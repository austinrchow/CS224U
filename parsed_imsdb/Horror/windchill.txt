Camera lingers on her in  , noticing details: hair worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively

-    -                      5 Our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely-empty parking lot
It's late afternoon, and already dark enough for the sodium vapor streetlights to have come on
few snowflakes swirl in their sickbed glow
We follow her to
beat-to-shit 1988  idling in the middle of the lot
An unbroken dusting of snow indicates it's been the only vehicle here for some time

He's skinny, dressed in thrift-shop clothes, has the complexion of someone who doesn't get out in the sun much
His car is filled with all of his earthly possessions: books, 's in plastic milk crates, dirty laundry, etc
She knocks on the driver's side window, startling him awake
He stirs, blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot
Do you think you could have parked any further from the entrance
The sight of her quickly snaps him awake
He scrambles out
(still a little groggy) There were still cars when  got here
thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the snow
What time is it
Quarter past three

Shit
Sorry
You should've just left without me
That's what  would've done
Hurry up and pop the trunk so  can stow my shit
He does
She walks back to the trunk, which is stuffed to capacity with more of his things: , a bag of , etc
(cont'd) (calling to him) Jesus, 'm just going home for Christmas
What are you doing
Pulling up stakes and movin' your Oakie family to Californey
She starts rearranging the trunk, making room for her bag
'm kinda getting kicked out of my apartment
didn't have time to find someplace new before exams
She takes out some of his things
Puts them on the ground
(cont'd) Here, let me help you with that- Why don't you just get the engine started and put the heat on
can handle this
He watches her rearrange his things, a little flummoxed
(cont'd) (smiling) Well
What are you waiting for thought you wanted to stay ahead of the snow
He hurries back to the driver's seat
Starts the engine
She hurriedly crams everything back in and slams the trunk
Then runs around to the passenger side and pulls on the door handle

It keeps getting stuck, leaving a half-inch gap
She shoots him a look: "What the hell
" That's as far as it goes
Sorry
She rolls her eyes, never once interrupting her phone conversation
He puts the car in gear and they set out on their six hour roadtrip

The road is wet, though the snow hasn't yet started to stick
(laughs; on her cell) What, are you kidding
'm bored to tears
No, we're still on the highway
how should  know, all highways look exactly alike
She looks up, catches him shooting irritated looks her way

You going to be on that thing the whole- He doesn't finish the thought, just chokes back whatever he was about to say
Focuses on the highway ahead

better call you back
(pause) Who do you think
Ride Board Guy
Okay, `bye
She hangs up, aims the camera phone lens his way, and snaps another digital picture of him
She puts the cellphone away, looks up to see him glaring at her
(cont'd) What
(blurting) This isn't cool
If  have to drive, you have to talk to me
What, 'm the in-flight entertainment
That's how this ride-sharing thing works
Division of labor
We split everything fifty-fifty
Get it
've got news for you,  don't get much more entertaining than when 'm on the phone
He darkens, mutters under his breath: (sarcastic) This is turning out great
What's that mean
Forget it
They ride in silence for a moment
She tries to strike up a conversation, by way of extending an olive branch

Yeah
Where'd you go to school
(falters for a second) Um
Saint Vitus Academy
St
Vitus
You're making that up
You're acquainted with every school in the area
Pretty much, yeah
Including all the Catholic ones
Because that's where  went
Saint Vitus Academy for Catholic Boys
Okay, fine
They drive for a few moments in silence
We had a class together, you know
Huh
Intro to Modern Philosophy
He looks at her expectantly, as if she should remember him
What
There were about a million people in that class
It was like Woodstock
Did you ever see so many Eastern religion types

She hoots with laughter
But he's not kidding
He seems surprised by her response
(cont'd) You aren't majoring in philosophy
No
Why
don't know
just assumed
Why would you assume anything about me
We just met
(a little defensive) don't know
guess you just
look like a philosophy major
Try engineering
She enjoys the pained look of surprise on his face, lets him twist for a second before explaining: (cont'd) only took Philosophy because need a humanities credit

What'd you put for the extra credit question on the final

He looks out at the road, reciting Nietzsche from memory: (cont'd) The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over and over, and you with it, a grain of dust
She looks at him as if he's nuts

He stares grimly at the road ahead, biting back a comment
(cont'd) High school and philosophy
Pretty much covers everything, don't you think
Guess that concludes the entertainment portion of today's flight
She turns on the radio, finds a station with Christmas music

Widen
She's turned the front seat into a nail salon
Cotton balls, emery boards, bottles of clear and colored varnish are strewn everywhere
She picks a bottle, opens it, begins painting her nails

gotta pee
Okay, 'll keep my eyes peeled
She looks up from her feet, giving him a funny look
(cont'd) What
(resumes painting) That phrase
`Keeping your eyes peeled
' It's kind of creepy, if you think about it
Huh
Actually, yeah, it is sorta
His eyes linger on her freshly painted toes on the dashboard
She catches him staring
He blushes, embarrassed
Says: (cont'd) Speaking of peeling eyeballs
Did you know that's how they do that corrective eye surgery
They use a laser
Well, yeah, they do
But there's definitely peeling involved too saw it on Discovery Health
If more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife
Laser
Right, laser
'm having corrective eye surgery over the break

It's okay
'm not really worried
Why
'm not worried
You're getting it done
Because  hate wearing glasses

How do you know
don't wear them outside my dorm
He gets a cornered look
You sure
You never
to class or anything
Because  could swear - Never
Huh
Weird
wonder why  thought- He breaks off, saved by the sight of a gas station up ahead
(cont'd) Hey, look
Here's your gas station

Notices her still seated in the car
He knocks on her window
She opens the door
thought you had to pee
didn't expect us to find a bathroom so soon
My nails aren't dry
Oh
He looks over the roof of the car, sizing up the distance across the slushy parking lot
(cont'd) Well if you want,  can carry you
That's okay, they'll be dry in just a second
Come on, 'm good at this
You are not carrying me inside
He opens her door, pulls her legs around, and crouches down between them
Hold on
What are you doing
Wait - () - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                   15
15    :                                                    15 Suddenly he's rising and she throws her arms instinctively around his neck
Unsettling as the deeply-weird moment is, she decides it's best to just humor him
But first - (cont'd) need my purse
He crouches a little so she can reach to retrieve it

-   -                                  16 The door  as he enters, carrying her
His face is red from effort, hers from embarrassment
Thanks
Sure
He just stands there
She taps him on the shoulder
You can let me down now
Okay
He crouches so she can slide off
She gives him a look, slips on the pair of flip-flops she's brought with her, then heads off in search of the ladies bathroom
Meanwhile, our guy saunters up toward the front of the convenience store
He nods to the twitchy , 20s, engrossed in a tattoo fetish magazine behind the counter

-   -  -                  17 The toilet is gross, tiled a queasy green, graffiti-covered
Our girl finishes peeing, gets up from the toilet, uses her foot to flush and her elbow to turn on the faucet
She washes her hands, holding them under the automatic dryer
Broken
She wipes her hands dry on her jeans
Is about to exit when she catches sight of her reflection in the dirty mirror

Slips them on
Checks herself out in the mirror
Cool
Sexy
With her glasses on she notices something scratched into the dirty mirror
Where we see: "

" She frowns, slips her glasses back in their case and moves to exit
But when she grips the doorknob she finds it
She frowns
Rattles the doorknob a few times
look of panic crosses her face, and she starts rattling the doorknob harder
Did someone lock her in
Suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand
She pounds on the door with the heel of her palm, shouts: , '
Nothing
She turns, scanning the filthy bathroom, notices something
: above the sink, near the ceiling
She puts a foot up into the sink, testing it to see if it can take her weight
Then climbs up and straightens on wobbly legs, until her face is near the filthy dust-clogged vent
(cont'd) (calling into vent) Her voice  weirdly
When the echoes die down she hears something from the vent that makes her scowl:
As if our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense
Pissed off now, she climbs back down, and attacks the broken doorknob with renewed urgency

-   -   -          18 As she exits she sees the  and our guy talking quietly, as if they know one another
She hesitates for a second, spying on them around a display of chips
Suspicious
: She strides up as the guy pays for the gas and a couple bottles of water
Didn't you hear me banging in there
(startled; puzzled smile) When
You think it's funny
Me locked in
Locked in where
You're telling me you didn't just hear me banging on the door
don't know what you're- (cuts him off) Forget it
Let's just get on the road
He gathers up the bottled water, heads toward the door
The clerk calls to him: Remember, highway's your best bet- (dismissive) Don't worry about it man,  got it all covered
She frowns, following him to the exit

(quickly) No, 've made this drive a million times
He holds the door for her, then follows her outside
19
-   -                          19 As they exit and start toward the car she offers him a twenty
He looks at the money, as if he's never seen
currency before
What's that for
My half of the gas
Keep it
What do you mean
Isn't that how ride-sharing works
-- We split everything fifty-fifty
don't take money from friends
Since when are they friends
They separate, walking around to their respective sides of the car

: nondescript exit comes up fast for a side road
Which wouldn't be cause for alarm or even interest except- He suddenly turns the wheel sharply, taking the exit
22
-                                      22 The car veers off the interstate onto a much smaller two-lane road marked with a simple sign, paint-on-wood, faded to illegibility: Scenic Route 606
The tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow
Attached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more modern vintage reading: Rough Road

-                                      23 She falls against him, bracing herself against the dash

This is not going to happen
He looks a little pissed she's questioning his judgment
Will you chill
It's a shortcut
We'll be back on the highway before you know it
Hard to argue with a shortcut
Nonetheless, she glances back with a look of trepidation at the highway receding into the distance

As it leaves  camera  to the dead grass on the roadside where it finds a sad little  half-buried in the snow: two homemade crosses, candle stumps, a rotting stuffed bear, deflated Mylar balloons

He scans the radio dial for something other than static

No, my grandparents are Dutch, so was raised on salted licorice and Sinterklaas

Snow boils in its headlights

The girl has been thrown under the dash
It's hard to tell in this light whether she's still breathing
Finally she stirs, disoriented
She climbs back into her seat, piecing together where she is
It takes her a beat to remember him
She looks over slowly
He's not moving, though thanks to his seatbelt he's still upright behind the wheel
His head rests limply against the driver's window, which now looks out on nothing but snowbank
link of blood trickles down the glass
Dead
She's not taking any chances
Without a sound she slips into her shoes, coat
Gropes for her cellphone among the detritus at her feet
Suddenly he stirs, groaning
She freezes
The seconds ticking by on the
When he doesn't wake, she resumes fumbling for her cell
Finds it
Then eases open the creaky passenger door
And launches herself into the frigid night

(cont'd) What happened to the, uh, the guy
Who
Asshole who ran us off the road
She's completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until now
She turns to look, puzzled
There's no sign of the other vehicle anywhere
They're alone
don't know
guess maybe he decided just to hit and run
So where are his tire tracks
She looks, sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow
In case you haven't noticed, it's coming down pretty hard
(points) Yeah, but you can still see our tracks
The mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated his post-accident fog, bringing him back into sharper focus
She watches as he walks out in front of the Olds' headlights to the middle of the road, where the other vehicles track's should be
(cont'd) What the hell
He walks back to the Olds and opens the passenger door (the only access into or out of the stranded car, thanks to the snowbank)
He begins searching the glove compartment for a flashlight

She looks back down the long dark road
Looks back at him bent over rummaging in the Oldsmobile
Too risky
Curiosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the middle of the road to have a look for herself
No tracks
Just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints
(to herself) This doesn't make any sense
At that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight
He spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings
The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it
precipice
He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs
(calling) She jumps at the sound of his voice, her nerves frazzled
(cont'd) (calling) His voice is swallowed by the dark
After the echoes subside the only sound in the hush is the  of falling snow and a weird otherworldly
He snaps off his flashlight, thrusts it into his coat pocket

They trudge back to the car, boots crunching in the snow
(cont'd) You steer, 'll push
He holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in, scooting over into the driver's seat
He leaves the door open so they can communicate
He walks back to the rear of the stranded Oldsmobile
He's pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow nearby catches his eye
He takes out the flashlight, shines it at the roadside
Little wooden crosses
Just two this time
Another sad shrine, to a different set of anonymous victims of Route 606
Their proximity to the stranded Olds obviously unsettles him

He bends with a little wince and braces his shoulder against the rear bumper

The tail lights come on as she turns the ignition
He hears her crank the starter motor
Cranking

She slips the Oldsmobile in gear, and he starts pushing

Suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side
He drops out of view, disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust

Knocks on the window

When there's no response from her he puts his lips to the half-inch gap at the top of the stuck window

What the hell is wrong with you
What did  do

You drove us here, that's what you did

You're not driving me home because one, you don't live near my home and two, this piece of shit isn't driving anywhere

Why did you get off the highway
told you, this is a shortcut
Anyway, you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway

She looks at him standing there, hugging himself against the sub-zero cold, his teeth chattering
He doesn't look like an ax-murderer
She doesn't know what to do
There's a long beat
Finally, he throws up his hands in disgust, decides to go to Plan

He goes crazy on the stranded Olds: punching the roof, jerking the door handle, kicking the door, screaming at her the whole time
She cowers inside, scared to death
Finally he gives up, and with a final  to the roof, exits
He turns and heads back down the road
We watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically away, his boots crunch-crunch-crunching in the snow
He stops
Leans his weight against a tree
Looks back at the car

She gasps, ducking out of sight below the car's dashboard
She doesn't move, listening, her eyes bright with fear

Fuel tank must've been ruptured in the accident
Can you fix it
Not unless you have a welding rig in all that shit of yours

We're out of gas

As long as we use it sparingly, it should last the night

Ah, Jesus

Gotta pee

There must be a house or something

She trudges on ahead, her footsteps growing , finally fading entirely

No sign of our girl
Hello
Hello
He arrives at the top of the hill
Silhouetted against the night sky
Treeless
His flashlight finds the few vertical objects still standing
Windowless and long-abandoned, its ceiling and walls caved in around a large stone chimney
He crunches inside and examines the black maw of the large stone fireplace, now stuffed with trash and dead leaves

Gingerly slips his arm inside the firebox
Retrieves a bunch of
He stuffs them inside the front of his jacket
Continues rummaging around in the firebox
As he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side
He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides
He turns in a slow circle
His flashlight sweeps over the interior of the abandoned ruins, the beam picking out what look like branches - frozen into claws, reaching from
It's lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe: teeth clenched in a terrible rictus, icicles dripping from nose, clawlike fingers, eyes
He's so startled he nearly drops the flashlight
The wayward light finding    in a nearby bed mere feet away: another rictus grimace, clawlike fingers seeming to reach for him
And then another
And another
All
Frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from Pompeii

Our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the bed's occupant: frozen sitting upright in an old wooden wheelchair
Eye to eye with him
He reels in horror, trips,    as he goes sprawling
Then recovers, snatching the flashlight up again and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies - And sees :   No beds

This time he's close enough for her to make out some of the words he's muttering: please, officer, please don't
Wait
Determined not to let him vanish again, she takes off in pursuit, coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles down the middle of the road
don't put me in the river
Suddenly she glances down, sees why he's shuffling so oddly
His ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with , as are his wrists

Who did this to you
please, officer, just take the booze and let me go

The instant her hand nears him the wind
She experiences a sudden powerful , almost as if she's grabbed a live wire

Frostbite
The jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze, and for the first time he becomes aware of her
He raises his frightened eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face
scream builds in her throat at sight of him

sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth moves, as if he's trying to speak

Skittering along the undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the next
Even appearing -- fleetingly, impossibly -- in the snow on the blocked driver's side window
All the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers sweeping back and forth, etc

Dead silence for a beat
Then an odd   underfoot, something crawling along the undercarriage of the car
Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe

One's chest is concave, stove-in by the impact with the steering wheel
The other's teeth are visible where his cheek has been torn away
She reels away in horror, forced to take the long way back to the Oldsmobile
She runs the last few yards to the car where we can hear the eerie sound of  emanating from the radio as she hurls herself - 83

Safe
She sits there, out of breath
She glances over quickly at our guy, gravely pale, slumped unconscious behind the steering wheel
She chafes her hands to get the circulation going again
She turns down the volume on the radio
(chattering teeth) -  did it - got through - but don't know how much she understood - the operator  mean - He doesn't respond
(cont'd) - Just have to hope - maybe - they can trace the line - When this too gets no response from him she looks over, frowning
She scoots a little closer across the front seat toward him
Which is when   - standing outside the car, slack-expressioned and staring
He stands there a beat, then drifts off into the night

She reaches to jostle him awake
One touch confirms her worst fears
She reaches up to switch on the  , to get a better look at him
(cont'd) Oh god
Her reaction is so sudden and violent and overwhelming it seems for a moment she's going to be sick
She covers her mouth, muffling a cry of raw-throated terror
Then shakes him again, harder this time, desperate to wake him
(cont'd) No
Please
Don't leave me alone
Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria
She shakes him harder
His inert body spills to one side, slumping against her
Her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate: revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her
She scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance as she can between herself and the corpse

We see them a split- second before she does
He's coming
When she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction, and for an instant it almost seems as if they don't register
Then her eyes widen in terror, she lets out a small whimper, and leaps into action
She scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the Oldsmobile - Only to find when she tugs on the handle that it's
She yanks on it harder, getting frantic now, as - The  get brighter, bearing down, close enough now that we can hear the  of the oncoming engine
