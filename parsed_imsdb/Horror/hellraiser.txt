86            115 Flood Street, London
SW3 01-352-4195 1 In darkness, a blood-curdling cacophony:  the squeal of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented souls
Above this din one particular victim yells for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage
By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by the surrounding tumult, until without warning his voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time reduced to naked scream
And with the sound, an image
house:   55,  , an old, three storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining its overgrown garden
Its curtains are drawn, there is newspaper over its top window
The titles begin to run, as we approach the house down the driveway
We move inside, to the hallway
The cries are louder now
Room by room, we explore the empty house, while the titles continue to run
It has been left empty for many years, though much of its furniture remains, covered in dust-sheets
On the mantelpiece of one room, a plaster saint
In the kitchen, evidence of life here
Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a glass
We move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the lower landing
The din is furious now
On the floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn; an open suitcase; more liquor
We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper landing, the door of which is ajar
The light within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into the passageway
As we reach the door, the screams from within halt abruptly
We can hear a bell now, which has been pealing steadily throughout this opening sequence
As we move through the door, the titles end
2 The bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently, disorienting us
There are chains - dozens of them - disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all are swinging back and forth
Some end in hooks, with pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated, others simply drip blood
The bell tolls on
On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle box
Later, we'll learn its name and function
It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a way to raise Hell
For now, it remains an enigma
hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles, reaches down and picks the box up
In close up we see just what an elaborate construction it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers
It is open at present, its polished innards exposed
Out of it, a banal melody, played on a hidden mechanism
The hands, which belong to one of the demons - a  - move over the box
(unseen) It's over
Delicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box, sliding the well-oiled parts back into place, the tune simplifying with each manoeuvre
The room is getting darker
The chains are disappearing into the gloom
We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning from the light and fading into the darkness
We catch sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest of moments
Then they're gone
The box is almost returned to its unopened condition
The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box, and the bell
It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place
The light stops swinging
The panel clicks
The tune stops
At last, a long shot of the room
At the far end the window is covered with yellowed newspapers
There is dust settling through the air
Otherwise it is empty
The bell fades
It's as if nothing ever happened here
Except
Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp of a thing barely alive
3 The wind is blaring as we watch the door of Number 55
From the doorstep, voices
One is that of , the other his wife
Clearly is attempting to get inside
We hear the sound of keys tried in the lock
It's one of these
We're going to freeze to death
0
0
The sound of another key tried in the lock
Maybe somebody changed the lock
(slightly irritated) Like who
Just a thought - Ah
The key is turned
Success
The door swings open
Voila
We see the pair on the doorstep
is an American in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost his edge in recent years
He looks harassed; he smirks too much
little, but significant, corner of him is utterly defeated
, his wife, is English: and looks perhaps ten years his junior
She is beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried unhappiness
Life has disappointed her too, of late: and  has been a major part of their disappointment
Well
This is it
They step over the threshold
4 The door of the Torture Room creaks, as the wind blows it opens an inch
From downstairs, we hear 's voice
It smells damp
It's just been empty a while
5 slams the front door
6 The Torture Room door creaks closed again
(from below) Besides, it's an old house
7 He stands in the hallway, not certain which way to go from here
How long since you were here
The best part of ten years
picks up some mail - circulars mostly - from behind the door, then leads  through from the hallway to explore the ground floor
wanted to sell it off at one point, after the old Lady died, but  couldn't get Frank to agree
He opens one of the doors, and looks inside
(with pleasure) Christ
It's not been touched
He continues along the passageway
He opens another door, and steps into a large room
He opens one of the curtains
Light pours in, dust-laden shafts falling on the sheeted furniture
Look at this
lingers in the doorway
Why didn't he want to sell it
(dismissively) don't know
Probably wanted a hideaway
He pulls a sheet off a chair
Look at this stuff
The chair is ugly; old fashioned
is unimpressed
Not exactly modern
(shrugs) We'll sell it
Sell everything
thought half of it was your brother's
He won't complain
He can pay off some of his creditors
is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the moment
He leaves the room, moving past to explore further
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it
She'll love it
You mean we're moving in
pauses
Looks at her
You don't like it
shrugs
It's better than Brooklyn
She turns back down the hallway
He watches her, then follows
You're still blaming me
No
'm not
You wanted to come back to London
We came back
We are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens of times, which immediately annoys them both
All right
So what's the argument
(cold) No argument
Oh Christ
Julia
wanders back to the bottom of the stairs
Then starts to climb
(exasperated, to himself) Shit
8 climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed feeling
She's sick of ; his enthusiasm depresses her, his compromises anger her
What's between them is stale, like this house
9 The door opens a fraction
10 has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence, now rotted and fungal
It smells, to judge the expression on his face
It also puzzles him
Then, from above: Larry
He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs
Larry
hear you
He starts up the stairs
11 reaches the top of the stairs
Where are you
(out of sight) In here
follows 's voice to the end of the corridor
is standing in a doorway
Beyond, the 'bedroom' we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then
Squatters
steps past her, and throws back the blankets
Wood-lice scurry away
He goes to the suitcase, and starts looking through it
Besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries
Amongst the stuff, some photographs
peers at them
One pictures a good-looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked Chinese girl
Frank
At the door, we see  almost flinch at the name
He's here
He's been here
There's stuff in the kitchen
He must have made a hasty exit
The 'phone rings downstairs
jumps
That'll be Kirsty
stands up and leaves the room, moving past in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the bed  has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings
As we hear  clatter downstairs it seems 's face is close to tears
12 The 'phone continues to ring
steps through and picks up the receiver
Hello
There's no answer
Hello
13
' '' goes to the open suitcase, and looks at the photographs
14 (on'phone) Is there anybody there
He puts down the 'phone
He goes back out into the hall
15
' '' Nervous that  will return and see what she's doing,  is going through the photographs
(from below) There's nobody there - The sound of his foot on the stairs
Hurriedly, she selects a photograph of Frank without the girl, and pockets it
16 is climbing the stairs
'm surprised it's even connected
The 'phone rings again
Shit
17
' Mission accomplished,  leaves the bedroom, taking one last glance at the sweat-stained sheet and the indented pillar where Frank lay
lone wood-louse crawls over the sheet, navigating the folds
She closes the door on the sight
Downstairs, the 'phone stops ringing
18 has picked up the 'phone
Who's there
(barely audible) Daddy
19
' , the daughter of Larry's first marriage, and his only child, on the 'phone
She is barely twenty, beautiful in an unpretensious way: a dream of a girl- next-door
We can't see much of the room she's in at the moment, the shot is too tight
(
0
) Kirsty
got through
(
) Where are you
found a room
20 (on 'phone) What did you say
21
' said:  found a room
We begin to draw back from  now, as she continues to speak to her father
She's sitting on a battered chair by the door
The room she's in is cramped and dirty
From outside, the sound of trains going by
(
0
) thought you were going to stay with us for awhile
(pained) No Dad
(
0
) You'd like the house
' like my room
(
0
) Do you want me to come over
(hastily) No, no
Not just yet
It needs
er
some work
That it does
The place, now we've got a good view of it, is a total dump
(
0
) Well  want you to see the house
'm not going to change my mind, Dad
As she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture, tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts collaged onto it, down
She succeeds
Beneath there's a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there to conceal
Plaster falls from it
(mouths the word) Great
(
0
) Well come over, will you
See the place
Maybe tomorrow
got to go look for a job
(
0
) Honey
Well you take care
love you
love you too
She puts the receiver down
As she does so the small table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses
She covers her face with her hand
22 is three steps from the bottom of the stairs
Well
(resigned) Why not
(smiles; he's pleased) We'll move in Sunday
23 church bell rings
Off-screen, we hear voices: two men are attempting to move a bed into the house with  masterminding the manoeuvres
We their efforts, but we don't yet see them
Our interest is in , who is unpacking a tea-chest in a room which is still full of draped furniture
1ST  (
) We're not going to get it in
2ND  (
) Tip it
Tip it
(
) Wait
Wait
Watch the fucking paint work
1ST  (
) Look, do you want the bed in or not
(0
) Just take it slowly
1ST  (
) Oh, sod you
2ND  (
) Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says
(
) It'll go in
1ST Famous last fucking words
's face through this has been almost devoid of expression
She's holding so many feelings inside; deep inside
Now she moves from one box to another, and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric-a-brac
She picks it up and goes through into the hallway
The bell continues to ring
24 The three sweating men have the bed wedged in the door
(not seeing Julia) Alright, let's give it another try
2ND (sees Julia) Do you really need this bed, lady
turns
Sees
How are you doing through there
It looks like a bomb's dropped
2ND Got any beer
There's some in the 'fridge
Nobody moves to get it
Certainly  has no intention of being waitress
She goes to the bottom of the stairs
'll get it
disappears through into the kitchen starts up the stairs, watched appreciatively by the two men in the doorway
One leans over and whispers to the other, who laughs
glances back at them
The whisperer licks his lips; the meaning of the gesture perfectly apparent
heads upstairs
25
55 arrives at the head of the drive
The two men are drinking beers
The bed has not been moved
She wanders down the drive towards the house
26 2ND (seeing Kirsty) It's my lucky day
Hi
2ND Want to buy a bed
Not much
She moves past them, attempting to insinuate herself between the bed and the door-jamb
They watch, enjoying her efforts
27 Dad
emerges from one of the rooms, looking harassed
His face lightens as he sees his daughter
Honey
They hug each other
Big house
You like
Me like
Another hug
'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved
Is Julia here
Upstairs
(his voice lowers) Treat her gently, huh
She hates moving
(dryly) Suprise
(a gently chiding voice) Kirsty
'll be nice
You get on with the muscle work
'll make myself some coffee
Kitchen's through on your left kisses , and goes through to the kitchen
turns back to the door
The men have been watching
clearly dislikes the scrutiny
1ST , out-stared by , looks away
The 2ND is unperturbed
2ND That your daughter
Uh-huh
2ND (grins oafishly) Got her mother's looks
Her mother's dead
2ND 's grin fades
2ND Oh
Julia's my second wife
2ND (weakly) Lucky man
Damn right
Now are we going to move the bed or not
28 The kitchen is chaotic
Cutlery, crockery, utensils, pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every available surface
has found the kettle, but is having difficulty turning on the tap
She struggles with it
No joy
Just a rattling sound in the pipes as the system lurches into action
29 The pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster
The moves along the corridor, hugging the wall
At the end of the corridor stands , in a patch of sunlight
She has the photograph of in her hands
She looks intently at it
- of the photograph
Then 's voice
Can  come in
looks up from the photograph
30
' front door opens
On the step of another house stands , with two suitcases
It's raining outside;
The rain has plastered his hair to his scalp, which only emphasizes his raw good looks
He's unshaven; his eyes are dark, and intense
Again, the line she remembers: Can  come in
The splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of water, as we the present day
31 The tap has come on suddenly, spraying  with water
She jumps back, soaked
Shit
Shit
She reaches to turn the pressure down
32 The men are struggling with the bed again
(calls through) Are you
(from kitchen) Sure
33 Again,  returns her gaze to the photograph
34
' The same scene:   in the doorstep
Now we the person who opened the door
It's ; a younger , her hair arranged differently, her clothes brighter
It is two weeks before her marriage to She looks at the man on the doorstep without a trace of recognition on her face
You're Julia, right
That's right
Who are you
(a dazzling smile) 'm brother Frank
(smiles) Oh
came for the wedding
He looks at her, eyes glittering
His hold on her is almost mesmeric
There is going to  a wedding
Oh
Oh yes
Well can  come in or not
'm sorry
Of course
You're very welcome
He steps inside
Now he is close to her, rain running down his face
We can hear his breath; sense the almost intimidating intimacy of his presence
That's nice to know
(pause) Have you got a towel
35 stares down at the photograph
Off scrren, 's voice: (
) Have you got a towel
looks up
At the top of the stairs, soaked from the tap
looks up, and hurriedly pockets the photograph
Kirsty
Hi
got soaked
There's a towel in the bath- room
Which is where
Just to your left
ducks into the bathroom
We It's clear the memory of her first meeting with  has affected her deeply
The tears that threatened earlier are close
36 has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself
Did Dad tell you  got a room, by the way
Waterloo
Centre of the known universe
Silence from outside
Julia
(she puts her head out of the bathroom) 37 has gone
38 The door of the Torture Room is pushed open steps inside
39 hears the creak of footsteps on the boards above
's behaviour puzzles her, but she's not about to waste time thinking too hard about it
She starts downstairs again
40 We have an odd, hovering point of view of , as she steps inside the room
Something about the atmosphere distresses her
There is a scratching sound
She looks down wood-louse, recalling Frank's foresaken bed, crawls along the edge of the skirting board
She crosses to the window, and tears away a little spy-hole in the aged newspaper
From downstairs, the voices of the bed-movers
1ST Have you got it
2ND 've got it
told you - Wait
Wait
The light through the window falls on her eye
The screen becomes a white-out, from which emerges: 41
' bedroom, with afternoon sunlight pouring between the slats of bamboo blinds
Outside we can hear children playing summer games
Inside, a fly buzzes
, the younger self, is holding her wedding dress in front of her, displaying it
Well
(0
) don't want to see the dress
But you said - don't want to see the dress
lets the dress drop a few inches in front of her
She stares at
You know what  want
Still she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall
She stares though, and there's an invitation in her eyes
want you
Now we He is not so beraggled as in the first scene, but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat to his face
Standing half in shadow he looks almost dangerous
Now  lets the dress drop, putting it on the bed behind her
That's better steps towards her
What about Larry - Forget him
takes hold of her
She doesn't resist him, though there is barely disguised fear on her face
He puts his hand inside her blouse
42 In extreme  ,  blinks into the light through the window, as 's voice from downstairs calls her from her reverie
Slowly, will you
Slowly
Again, a white-, from which emerges: 43
' The two are naked on the bed, both sweating now
Beneath them, the wedding dress, crushed under their weight
Their love-making is not straight-forward: there is an element of erotic perversity in the way licks at her face, almost like an animal, his hold on her too tight to be loving
The sequence escalates into a series of strange details from their locked bodies
Nails digging into palms; sweat rivulets running down their torsoes
And once in a while we see their faces
watching , mesmerized and amused by his intensity; almost pained by his desire to push the experience
Their passion is rendered stranger still by the way the light through the window falls on their bodies, making striped creatures of them
At last, as their urgency increases, we move up until we're looking directly down on the bed
From here it is 's face we can see, and the ecstasy of the moment has seized her
Her arms are flung up over her head; her eyes are closed as she murmurs: Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
The scene whites out
44 is still staring into the light
She sobs, very quietly
(a whisper) Oh Frank
45 Downstairs,  and the men have moved the bed across the hall to the bottom of the stairs
All three are weary now, and getting careless
As they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead for , whose hand is moving closer and closer to a nail proturbing from the woodwork of the bannister
(to Movers) Will you take the weight while take a step up
He backs towards the stairs - and the nail
Damn it, will you take the - The side of his hand is impaled bythe nail
He cries out
The weight of the bed, which he cannot relinquish, drives the nail deeper, and gouges a long cut from the ball of his thumb to his wrist
Blood pours out
Christ
1ST What's the problem
My fucking hand
He drops his edge of the bed, and disengages his hand from the nail upon which he's injured himself
He lifts his hand, from which blood is pouring
You fucking ass-holes
1ST Who are you calling a fucking ass-hole
It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem
isn't listening
He's looking at the wound in his hand
He hates the sight of his own blood
Any moment, he may faint
Oh Christ
But not in front of these bastards
He turns and starts up the stairs, groggier by the moment
oh
Christ
46 is standing in the middle of the room
single dart of light, through the hole she tore in the newspaper, strikes her face
Softly on the soundtrack, the scrabbling noise of the woodlice
47 The bed has been put down
1ST  and 2ND  are putting on their coats
comes through from the kitchen
What's happening
2ND We're leaving
Where's my father
1ST He's fucked off
2ND (mock chiding) Eh
1ST Sorry
He's gone upstairs
So we're fucking off too
2ND  takes a sheet of paper from his jacket
2ND Will you sign for the bed
Sure
48 , his hand running with blood, climbs the last flight of stairs
(weakly) Julia
49 hears him, and turns from her silent communing with the room
She crosses towards the door
Too late
It opens
steps inside, blood pouring from his right hand, which he attempts to staunch with his left hand
What have you done
cut myself
Blood has started to drip, unnoticed by either of them, onto the bare boards
Heavy splashes
looks sick; his face clammy with sweat
She stares at him without a trace of feeling for him on her face
Is it deep
don't know,  haven't looked
You know me and blood
You're  going to faint
(he leans againts the wall) Shit
Let me see
She goes to him
He looks away as she unglues one hand from the other, and looks at the wound
Blood comes faster, hitting the floor between them
It's probably going to need stitches
'm going to throw up
No, you're not
The blood keeps hitting the floor
Slap; slap; slap
We'll get you out into the fresh air
He is again clamping his hand over the wound, as helps him to the door
They leave the Torture Room
We hear their voices receding down the passageway, as we again assume that hovering view point
The floor, is heavily spattered with blood
Take it slowly
So damn stupid
You're done worse
'll be scarred for life
No you won't
50 is half way up the stairs, as  and head down
What happened
Just an accident
He's all right
Will you drive
He needs stitches
Sure
The keys are in the kitchen
heads back to the kitchen
helps towards the front door
The  swings away from them, upstairs, and begins to track
- : we continue to track, towards the Torture Room
Downstairs, the front door slams
- : From outside, the sound of a car door slamming
An engine starts
The car drives away
We move towards the blood on the floor
As we watch, it begins to disappear, as if being absorbed by the room
We pan up to the wall
The plaster is not quite smooth; indeed, it now begins to grow restless, and cracks
Something begins to move in the wall
51 An explosion of laughter
We the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there
This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen
We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles
Finally, we reach , who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats
She looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk
The room has been spruced up for the party
Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls
But this is essentially cosmetic
The place has not been refurnished or re- decorated
We move to the party guests
Two, we recognize: , and  - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident
The others are new faces
An American couple: and his wife , who are of an age with , and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of 's -  '
All are drunk
brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides
, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on
is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest
His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged
- always hated the sight of my own blood
go out like a light
Anybody else's
no problem
But mine
you know
goes straight to my head
Anyhow, this damn doctor's poking around and 'm saying: 'm going to pass out, and he's saying, no you're not, no you're not
Next thing  know - We , who watches her husband, unamused
-  wake up On the floor
Gales of laughter at this
And it was  who was looking sick
Probably thought you'd sue
should do it
Doctors - know
And he's saying: 'm sorry
'm sorry
' sorry
Right
(he has picked up the brandy bottle) Anyone for more
(protests) No
no
Come on, you're only young once - fills up her glass
(to Kirsty) What are you drinking, love
(giggles) 've forgotten
Steve
We're on the Cointreau
That's right
Cointreau
picks up the bottle
'll do it
He fills up 's glass
won't be able to stand
So lie down
She casts him a sly glance
He smiles
She smiles
now stands up
Would you excuse me
think 'm going to go to bed
Are you
nods
(looks at his watch) Christ
think it's time we were away - He stands
Bill
Absolutely not
Sit down
We've got celebrating to do
looks frosty, but  does not catch the look
does however
sits down
(to Julia) It was a wonderful meal
(gushing) Oh it was
It was wonderful
There's a chorus of approval
puts a smile on
'm glad you enjoyed it
See you again soon
You must come round
Yes
You must
We're so happy you're back
(at the door) That's nice
Well
goodnight
She exits, to a chorus of goodnights
in particular watches her as she makes her exit
's behaviour confounds her
Meanwhile, the conversation has returned to 's 'wound'
Does it still hurt
Only when  laugh
This wins another round of laughter
52 walks along the landing, while the laughter - muted by distance - wafts up from below
From the floor above, she hears something more
She stops, puzzled, then starts up the second flight of stairs towards the Torture Room
53 She approaches the Torture Room, and steps inside
54 The sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here; it's barely audible
But there is another sound, a shifting sound in the corner of the room
She reaches for the light switch, and turns it on
The bulb's been broken however
She stares around the room, trying to make sense of the shadows
Nervously, she approaches the wall, on which four streaks of light from the window fall
Now she looks towards the window and realizes that the newspaper has been torn, as if by four fingers
Her breath catches
Suddenly, she's afraid
She stands absolutely still, eyes wide in the gloom
Who's there
On the far side of the room, a movement in the shadows
almost retreats, but something keeps her staring into the murk, as  - the remnants of a human form made of twisted, blistered strands of flesh, raises its head
It's squatting against the wall, unable to lift itself into a standing position
Its eyes, however, have life in them: and hunger
This, though he's unrecognizable, is
(a pained whisper) Julia
Oh my God
Don't look at me
Who are you
said: don't look
She looks away
Help me
Tell me who you are
Frank
's face registers horror and disbelief
No
God no
Believe me
It's me
It's really me
What happened to you
His blood
on the floor
It brought me back
Back from where
Just help, will you
Please God, help me - From downstairs, dimly, laughter
55 has just told another story
General drunken laughter
stands up
You're not going
Just upstairs
She staggers a little bit
Need any help
house-trained
Further hysteria
(covered in embarrass- ment) No
meant
It's round on the left - know
She steps out into the hallway
56 She starts up the stairs
She smiles to herself, thinking of
57 , in the corner of the room, watches , who is still at the door
somebody
Ssh
The sound of  downstairs, closing the bathroom door
You can't let me stay like this
Please
You can't
What do you want me to do
The blood brought me this far
need more of the same
Or 'll slip back
's lace as she stares at  once more
She is appalled at the choice before her
(a plea) You have to heal me
58 smiles at herself in the bathroom mirror, turns off the tap, opens the door and steps out onto the landing
59 She takes a step along the landing, then realizes that there's somebody ahead of her, in the darkness
She stops
From the floor above, a soft sigh
Hello
moves out of shadow into a patch of patterned light splashing up the stair well
The effect recalls her memory of her lovemaking with
The light makes her look strange; ominous
Oh, it's you
doesn't smile Are you all right
Do we read murder in 's eyes
is uneasy
Suddenly, a voice from the floor below
Kirsty
is relieved at the interruption
(calls down) 'm here
thought we'd lost you
(calls down) 'm coming
(to Julia) Sleep well
is left on the landing, as  heads downstairs
60 The station is deserted, but for  and , who are sitting, waiting for the last train
You know  do know the way home
It's late
Not that late
Please
want to see you home
All right
(lightly) All right
(smiles) No
That's nice
If there's a train
What do we do if there isn't
We walk
61
, and  are walking
Why don't you stay at Larry's house
There's plenty of room
Yeah, there's room
And there's Julia
see
She's so damn
English
Meaning what
Oh,  don't know
Up-tight
Frigid
stops walking
beg your pardon
(lightly) There ya go
(imitates his tone) beg your pardon
We're not all frigid
has turned to look at him
Both of them are aware where the banter is leading; smiles play on their faces as they speak
Oh no
Oh no
It's not what  heard
(moves closer to her) Well you've just been talking to the wrong people
He kisses her, with considerable feeling
62 snores loudly
lies beside him, wide awake, staring at the ceiling
turns over, muttering to himself
63 The door opens
is standing there, in her night-gown
raises his wretched head
Well
stares at the thing moving in the shadow
Yes
64
55 The door opens
steps out of the house, and starts towards the street
As she does so, she glances round
65 We approach the window, knowing that  watches behind it
66
55 heads off down the street
67 The din of a lunchtime restaurant, with all the tables full, and everyone hungry
In the middle of the melee,  is valiantly trying to do six things at once
Somebody wants their order taken;  somebody else wants more lager;  somebody else is complaining
She's doing her best, but losing the battle
She serves a table with their food, and then starts back to pick up another order
As she does so she's harangued from every side
1ST Excuse me, Miss - 2ND 'd like some more lager
1ST Miss
In a moment
2ND Did you hear me
starts back to the counter
As she does so somebody else's voice cuts through the din
Hey, sex-bomb - She wheels round
You keep your - (sees Steve) Oh
(smiles) Hi
just called in
How about tonight
don't finish till twelve
'm a late riser
He grins
She grins
2ND What do you have to do to get some service around here
Catch you later
68 By contrast, a quiet bar
Discreet music;  a well-dressed clientele
Several couples occupy booths
Other solitary drinkers are at the bar
Amongst them:
Now we see her more closely, we realize she's gone to some considerable effort to make herself ravishing
There's nothing crude about the change;  it's a subtle transformation which shows off her considerable beauty
She drinks soda water
She has an admirer
Sitting alone at one of the tables is a middle-aged man by the name of , a nervous, slightly paunchy individual
She glances over at him
His eyes don't leave her for a moment
He's trying his best to get the courage to approach her
She looks away, and concentrates on her drink
Now she takes out a cigarette, fumbling for it
Her hands are trembling slightly
She lights the cigarette, draws on it, and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that she's not the equal of it
She stubs the cigarette out, puts cash on the bar for her drinks, and gets up to leave
Suddenly, 's at her side
Not much fun, is it
What
Drinking alone
Not much
wonder, maybe
He's so nervous he can barely speak
as we're both on our own
we could have one drink together
looks at him
He seems to almost be offering himself to her
There's a long pause, while she tries to make up her mind
Then: Why not
She smiles
The smile works wonders
's nerves diminish somewhat
's simply increase, now that she's committed herself
Again, she opens the pack of cigarettes, as  calls the  over
(to Julia) What are you drinking
Just soda
Plain soda
Please
try not to drink at lunch- time
Makes me sleepy in the afternoon
You like to keep a clear head, eh
(to Barman) One soda, one whisky
(to Julia) do it anyway
No will-power
Got a busy afternoon
(looking straight at him) That depends
Oh
He stares at her, not certain he interprets her correctly
She stares back
Then: the tiniest of smiles, which he - scarcely believing his luck - returns
69 The  moves across the room
We can hear 's ragged breathing, and as we move in we see, on the floor beside him, the box - the Lament Configuration - its sides gleaming
, still squatting on the floor, taps a tattoo on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers
Then, voices outside:   laughs
He raises his head
70 opens the front door
She is still very nervous, fumbling with the keys
stands a pace behind her
71 They step inside
closes the door You know it's not often
you know
There's a first time for every- thing
suppose that's right
You want something to drink
'm already way over my usual limit
You know, it's funny
feel like 've known you for years
He approaches her:  his gestures made slightly clumsy by the alcohol he's drunk
He kisses her
She presses him off her
Oh, come on
(he takes hold of her breast) It's what you brought me here for, isn't it
Yes
just think we'd be better off upstairs
Oh
Oh fine
72 's view, from the corner of the room
We hear the sound of  and 's approach up the stairs
This your place
Let's not talk about it
No personal details, right
Right
You know, you're incredible - opens the door
Come on in
Make yourself at home
She steps inside
does as he's instructed
He stares at the bare floor, as  closes the door behind him
There's no bed
That's right
Huh
prefer the floor
First time for everything, right
Right
moves towards him Why don't you take off your jacket
You're warm
Yeah, why don't
She slips the knot of his tie
We can hear her pulse on the soundtrack
She glances over 's shoulder
He follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the cheek
(takes over his undressing) Why don't you do the same
Maybe  will
, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying not to take his eyes off  for an instant
We watch from '
as he drops his underwear
He still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton
We move back into a tighter shot
(voice slightly slurred) You know, you're very beautiful
Am
You know you are
Loveliest woman  ever set eyes on
smiles
stops unbuttoning his shirt
Oh Christ
What's wrong
Too much drink
Better empty my bladder
She steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door
'll be a moment
As he moves to the door, she throws a piece of cloth off a hammer, which lies beside the wall
takes hold of the door handle
Turns it:  it's stuck
The door's stuck
Before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head
He doesn't fall, but the blow sends blood down the back of his shirt
To avoid the following blow he stumbles blindly towards the wall but 's not going to be stopped now
He holds the back of his head - dazed, apologetic, pitiful - while she moves towards him
Don't
please
'm sorry
She eclipses him
'm so sorry
She raises the hammer
don't understand
She strikes him
He slides down the wall, his jaw broken, blood pouring from his face
He twitches
Then the twitches stop
She drops the hammer, and stares down at the corpse
Enough
The room sighs
In the corner, 's shadowy form leans forward
Don't look at me
backs towards the door, as the broken, skeletal form crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance
73 steps out onto the landing and leans against the wall, waves of sheer relief breaking over her
In the room behind her, terrible sounds of feeding
74 steps into the bathroom, and looks at herself in the mirror
Blood is spattered on her face;  her hands are similarly stained
She is trembling from head to foot
Stripping off her blouse, and flinging it over the side of the bath, she douses her face, neck and breasts with cold water
Then she stares up at her face again, examining it
She can scarcely believe what she's done
75 She crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the Torture Room
76 She opens the door
As she does so  retreats into the shadows
We are granted a fleeting glimpse of him, his body fuller than before, but still horribly vulnerable
looks at 's corpse
trail of blood leads away from it into the darkness
The body itself is a grotesquely misshapen husk now, the muscle and fat withered, the eyes sunk into the skull, the lips drawn back to expose the gums
ghostly sight
Jesus Christ
looks across at , who is no longer sitting, but standing in the shadows
(his voice stronger) Do  disgust you
She doesn't reply
He stretches his arm into a passage of light
His flesh glistens and pulses
See
It's making me whole again
He turns his arm over for her appreciation
Every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones
And we both want that don't we
She nods
Good
Come here
She stares, unable to move
Come here, damn you
want to touch you
Still she doesn't move
(more softly) Come to Daddy
only want to touch
She takes a step towards his outstretched arm
His fingers touch her face
She steels herself against them
Now, he starts to trace the line of her jaw, stroking her
Now her lips, caressingly
Suddenly, a sound from downstairs
The front door is opened
(from below) Sweetheart
withdraws from his touch (from below) Where are you
77 Shot from the stairs of
He looks up the flight
He takes a step towards the stairs
78 takes a step backwards, her foot hitting 's corpse
79 is still at the bottom of the stairs
Are you there
For a moment it looks as though he's going to climb the stairs, then he thinks better of it, and goes through to the back of the house
80 has wrapped the corpse of  up in its clothes and is now lifting it
The body is lighter now, having been drained of nourishment
Its head lolls back and its dentures drop out, hitting the floor loudly
She freezes
No sound from below
She backs out of the room with her burden
's arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at them
Who's a pretty boy then
Soft laughter from the darkness
81 pushes the door of the Junk Room, which is on the upper landing, open
Inside, a chaos of tea-chests and bric-a-brac
She lays the body down
82 has come through to look for
He hears a noise above
He looks up
(quietly) Julia
He leaves the kitchen
83 Again,  Steps into the hallway, and gazes up the stairs
Are you there
He starts up
84 steps into the bathroom, and then locks the door behind her
ascends to the top of the stairs
Julia
(from bathroom) 'm here
(at the door) Sweetheart
've been calling you
He tries the door
It's locked
Are you all right
Just feeling a bit sick
Oh, babe
85 , still trembling, sits on the edge of the bath
'll be
Just leave me be a while
Can  get you anything
Maybe a brandy
Sure
'll be down in a minute She listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and stairs
Then she crosses to the mirror and tries to erase the signs of panic
She puts a comb through her hair, and adjusts her blouse
That done, she unbolts the door and steps out into the landing
She doesn't go down however, but ,  back to the Torture Room
86 She opens the door
(very softly) Frank
crunching sound in the shadows
's hand opens, dropping the pieces of 's dentures, which he has crushed, onto the floor, in a rain of plastic teeth
'm hurting Hurting
My nerves
are beginning to work again
Good
One more
Maybe two - 's face registers no horrer at this
- to heal me completely
Then we can be away from here, before they come looking
Who
The Cenobites
It's only a matter of time before they find 've slipped them
have to get away from here
From downstairs,
Julia
Are you all right
crosses to the door and calls down
Just a moment
Put on some music will you babe
She returns to her conversation with
Poor Larry
Obedient as ever
Keep your voice down
She crosses to close the door
When she turns round, he's in front of her, silhouetted against the window, his half-formed face terrifying in the gloom
Suddenly he reaches out and catches hold of her arm
She gasps in pain
Ssh
Don't want babe to hear
You're hurting
You won't cheat me will you
You'll stay with me
Help me
Then we can be together, the way we were before
We belong to each other now, for better or worse
He lets go of her
like love
Only real
She goes to the door, and leaves him, locking it behind her
We move close to 's face
He licks his skinned lips with a bloody tongue
Thunder rolls
87   ' The thunder carries over to a dream
We are in the Dining Room of Number 55, except that everything is once more shrounded in sheets
We  to , moving through the room, her face pale, her hair glued to her forehead with sweat
Somewhere, a bell is ringing
Flies buzz
On the dinner table, a form is covered in a sheet
It's clear that the shape is human
She reaches the table, and looks at the body
Suddenly, blood begins to seep through the shroud, beginning at the head - eyes and mouth - then spreading across the body
There are sobs beneath the shroud
She reaches for it, to snatch it off the body
The blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet
She pulls
We glimpse only a moment of what'd beneath: a naked body, scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot
She screams
Her scream becomes louder, as we 88
' sits bolt upright in bed, while  yells
The sheet is snatched off him
He looks across the room to see  at the end of the bed, with the sheet in her hand
What are you doing
's eyes are still closed
Kirsty
Her eyes open
She looks down at the sheet she's snatched from the bed, and drops it in horror
Christ
What was that about
, weak with fear, just shakes her head
89
,  55 phone is ringing
crosses the hallway, bleary-eyed, and disappears from sight
The phone is picked up
' Hello
90 lies in bed, the pillow empty beside her
She's wide awake, staring at the ceiling
Downstairs, the murmur of 's voice
91 stands in the corner of the room, breathing softly in the shadows
92 is on the phone
'm
, honey
It's all right
93
' is on the phone
sits up in bed, having reclaimed the sheet
just wanted to be sure you were
94 Never better
You sleep well
(on phone) Yeah
love you, honey
(on phone) love you too
puts down the phone
95 returns to the bedroom
(
) Who was it
Kirsty
He goes into the bedroom
We  up the second flight of stairs
is sitting at the top, in the shadows
(soft as a breath) Kirsty
96 The front door is closed by
man stands in the hallway:  another
He is as nervous as You're sure we're not going to be interrupted - Quite sure
Only  like to be careful
97 shock  to the naked , thrown back against the wall from 's hammer blow
Before he can even slide down the wall,  is upon him
We don't linger, but  away to: 98 As  closes the door, her face devoid of emotion, we see the 's body on the floor, with 's hands oh its head, draining out its energies
99 sits, sipping a drink, her face still unreadable
100 is standing in the shadows
The 's body is in the middle of the room
enters
Well
Better
Much better
'd like some clothes
And maybe a cigarette
Then you tell me
you explain what happened to you
Of course
101 We pan across the walls as  speaks
(
) wanted access to experiences
pleasures
that only they could offer
(
) The Cenobites
That's what they call themselves
They're not human
Maybe they were once, but they're not now
They rearrange their own flesh for pleasure
We've moved across to  now
He is dressed, in loose fitting jacket and trousers, through which his blood is seeping
He smokes, taking great pleasure in the experience
And the box
picks up the box
Vague, tantalizing forms move over the surface, like ghosts
It cost me a fortune
All had
It's a puzzle you see
You solve it, and the Cenobites come through
Where from
God knows
Sometimes  think they're just behind the walls
He turns the box over
The lacquer catches the light
So they cheated you In the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving
It's difficult to be sure what the forms signify
Is this torture, or some elaborate pleasure
Oh no
They kept to their bargain
They gave me experiences 'd never forget
The images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and they are
Flesh torn open; blood running across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines
But their pleasure was my pain
His voice has begun to tremble
The images in the box are more horrific by the moment
And flowing between them, highly distorted, the 's faces, and that of , screaming and screaming
Terrible pain
Appalling
He can't speak for a moment
After a pause, he goes on, his voice heavy
My body was forfeit
But my spirit
they left that here
In the boards
In the walls
Watching the world, but never able to touch it
And the blood let you out
There are ways to resurrection
Blood's one of them
won't let them take me back, Julia
looks at the horrors in the box, and understands his desire
want to be whole, and then get out - He lifts the box up
won't let them take me
You won't have to
We'll be gone
Somewhere they'll never find us
There's a rumble of thunder
Not in the whole wide world
102 More thunder, and the sound of heavy rain against the windows
The television is on
and  are sitting on the couch
is watching a boxing match
He has consumed several beers:  the cans are beside his feet; and there's another in his hand
reads a magazine, glancing up at the screen to see the match getting more heated
Blood is starting to flow
Is this upsetting you
've seen worse
looks at her
Are you all right
Fine
Only 'll turn it off - There's a sudden raising of shouts from the screen, as one of the boxers hits the canvas turns his attention back to the match
And he's down
He's down
The thunder rolls on
103 The lightning finds its way through the holes in the newspaper
is watching through the window, his face occasionally washed with light
His hand, on the window frame, taps out the same tattoo he's tapped out before
He turns away from the window, and his foot catches the box
It rolls across the floor
104 The boxing match is heating up again
- and now he's in trouble, he's really in trouble - What was that
looks up from her magazine
Thunder
The violence on the screen is horrific, as swollen faces burst beneath punches
No
Something else
stands up
Maybe  left a window open - She gets up and crosses to the door
- 'll go see
No
'll do it
He opens the door, and steps out into the hallway
105 In such tight close up we can't sec that  has in fact left the Torture Room, we see his features register that somebody is coming
106 is climbing the stairs
follows
It was nothing
has reached the top of the stairs
He looks up the next flight
Larry
What's wrong with you
She's desperate to stop him climbing to the Torture Room
just hate the thunder
He crosses to her
'm here
He puts his arms around her
She responds
You're shaking
He hugs her tight, kissing her lightly
The thunder shakes the house
There's nothing to be afraid of
He kisses her neck, his hands restless on her
'll just go check upstairs
He kisses her again
She, in order to distract him, kisses him back
Her passion is artificial, but he doesn't register that
Oh baby
Don't go upstairs
Come with me then
He starts up the stairs
Please
107 He reaches the top of the stairs
First he throws open the Junk Room
Lightning flashes on boxes inside
Then he moves towards the Torture Room
The thunder rolls more loudly
She follows him along the landing, desperate to stop him
Too late
He throws open the door
Don't
Lightning floods the room
It's empty
She stands beside him at the door
We must have rats
She looks back down the stairs
Where's  gone
turns to her, holding her again, on the threshold of the Torture Room
See
Quite safe
He kisses her, much harder this time; a sexual kiss
Let's go  down
'll make it better
He kisses her again
108 shadow moves across the screen as the door opens, and  puts on the light
He has hold of 's hand
He leads her inside
She sits on the bed, illuminated by the light from the landing, and the occasional flicker from the window
kneels between her legs, and kisses her breasts, his eyes closed
glances into the shadows of the room
She senses 's presence
oh babe
He starts to unbutton her dress
She's distracted by her suspicions; he has his hands against her almost before she realizes what's happening
We have her
as she looks around the room
The dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the window
Does something move in the shadows
flash of lightning
No
There's nothing
gets onto the bed and draws her against him, kissing her
This is not the intense, slightly dangerous love-making she experienced with , but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange
is so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he doesn't register the fact that 's attention is elsewhere
Now we have a
from the far side of the room, of the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder and 's murmured words of seduction, which we can barely make out
love you, honey
let me
oh God
love you
Neither of them have undressed fully; there's just a tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace of eroticism from the scene
of 's head, laid on the pillow, shows just how uninvolved she is - while  works, eyes closed
looks down the length of her husband's body
The door of the wardrobe swings open is watching
She registers horror
is oblivious to all of this, of course
We have a   of  watching the love-making
Now he steps out of the wardrobe
makes a moan of horror, which  takes as enthusiasm
Oh baby
love you
From '
, we see the form of  shamble towards the lovers
From '
we see the lovers on the bed, 's back vunerable
seems to realize what he intends
no
barely hears her
is at the very end of the bed now, and becomes highly agitated
No
No, you mustn't
No
stops his love-making
(looks at her) Huh
Please
What's wrong with you
(almost sobbing) Please
can't bear it
is angered and utterly perplexed at this
He disengages his arms from around her
'
, as  retreats
rolls off
The wardrobe door closes
Click
don't understand you
One moment you're all over me, the next it's:  Don't touch me
He sits on the edge of the bed
just don't understand
He gets up and leaves the bedroom
remains where she is
We have a shot of the bed, and her upon it, from 's end of the room
She stares at the wardrobe
Through the crack of the open door, stares back
flicker of lightning illuminates his face; his skeletal grin
Softly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof, we hear laughter
109 and  are sitting eating a meal together, in an intimate restaurant
has little appetite, to judge by his plate
He looks as if he hasn't slept for several nights
, by contrast, is sparkling maybe we should never have come back
Maybe you should give it some time
guess
(skirting her real feelings) She's not like Mom
She's
don't know
moody
thought that was what you liked about her
You don't like her at all do you
The straight-forward question silences  for a moment
She wants to be delicate with her father's feelings, but honest at the same time
don't know her
She's so
sealed up
's face is full of the desire for reassurance
tries to offer it
If  love her she must be worth loving
Just give me some time
nods, a weak smile on his face She doesn't even want to leave the house
Really
It's like she's waiting for something
What
don't know
don't know
It's beyond me
silence
(hesitant) Would you
maybe call round sometime
Try to make friends
Sure
Maybe all she needs is some company
110 is standing at the top of the stairs, dressed in his stained suit
is a few steps down, staring up at him
You can't love him
don't
So where's the harm
said no
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking
nods
Tomorrow
She looks at him
111
- wind blows, carrying autumn leaves before it
And on the wind, the distant pealing of bells
112
55 is at the door, turning the key in the lock
Beside her, a third sacrificial lamb, balding and excitable
His name is
opens the door
113 At the corner of the street now:
She watches, puzzled
114
55 long shot of the house, from '
The man on the step seems to having second thoughts
speaks with him
We can hear none of this exchange, but  manages to coax him inside
She closes the door behind them
115 stands, bewildered by what she's seen
116 From the top of the stairs we watch  lead upstairs
get lonely sometimes
Everybody does
117 starts towards the house
118 In the corner of the room  stands, tapping out the rhythm with his fingers
It's 'Colonel Bogey', and now he hums it too
Outside the door, a footfall
Come in
The humming stops
opens the door
119 starts down the path
120 is looking at
What is this
game
moves in the corner
catches the motion from the corner of his eye
He turns
What
steps from the shadows
Jesus Christ
hits him with the hammer
121 hears  scream
She freezes
Then steps back from the doorstep and looks up at the house
122 In the Room, pandemonium
, blood pouring down his face, flails out at
The hammer flies from her hand
He lunges for the door, but she manages to kick it closed
Christ help me
123 makes her way around the back of the house
124 has taken hold of , and is using her as a shield against , whos is bearing down upon him
For the first time we see 's true colours where 's concerned - (to Frank) Don't
Casually,  throws  aside
She falls, sobbing
descends on
No
125 ' scream covers the sound of  forcing the back door open
She steps inside
126 has  face to the wall
is sobbing now
The room is covered in blood
(to Julia) Get out of here
She picks herself up
(to Julia) Please
don't let him kill me
please
leaves, closing the door
seizes hold of 's neck, his fingers entering the flesh either side of his neck vertebrae
screams
127
/ / moves through the house, and starts to climb the stairs
128 Half way up the stairs, the scream stops
She climbs the rest of the way surrounded by a graveyard hush
129 soundless, slowed shot, as , his face wasted by 's feeding, breaks from 's hold and lunges for the door
130 starts up the second flight of stairs
131 The same slowed, soundless horror, as  reaches the door
is a pace behind him
132 reaches the top as - 133 The door from inside the room
pulls it open - 134 In real time, and accompanied by the most horrific shriek,  flings himself from the Torture Room
The flesh is hanging off his face; his eyes bulge in terror
Seeing  he starts towards her
Behind him, , his body glistening
He catches hold of by the neck
'  shrieks stop
The eyes glaze over
The body judders as death claims it
Then drops the corpse, and looks up at
Oh my God
She starts to back away down the stairs
(shouts) Julia
Kirsty
He takes a step towards her
Keep your fucking distance
Julia
Where's Julia
Christ, what have you done with her
She's still backing away
He's still advancing
Kirsty
It's Frank
It's Uncle Frank
No
You remember
No
Come to Daddy
Her puzzlement, however, has slowed her retreat, and now  reaches for her
At the last moment she backs away again, but he's after her in a beat, and seizes hold of her
No
Get the fuck off me
He drags her back up the stairs
135 He pushes her ahead of him, into the Torture Room
He closes the door
You've grown
You're beautiful
She has retreated as far from him as she can get
He advances on her
Don't touch me
Or so help me - What
What will you do
What can you do
(pause) There's nothing to be frightened of
has closed in on her by now
He Lakes hold of her face
bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you
Beautiful
This isn't happening
used to tell myself that
Used to try and pretend  was dreaming all the pain
But why kid yourself
Some things have to be endured
Take it from me
And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter
As he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his abdomen, and
There's a flow of fluids
's head is thrown back, and he screams
She slips from beneath his grasp
But he's after her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse
It tears
His fingers rake her bare skin
She stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is slick with ' blood
Her hand slides over it
She falls, heavily
Roaring,  comes in pursuit of her
On the floor in front of :  the box
It's a poor weapon, but it's all she's got
As he comes after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box
He howls
She races for the door
But he's after her
He strikes her
She's thrown against the wall
He's  now
Strikes her again
She cannot survive much more
She raises the box to retaliate
sees what she's holding
His  attack stops
Give that to me
She dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool
(breathless) No
One last time
Give me the box
You want it
The monster's eyes glitter
Fucking have it
She throws the box
It sails past  and smashes through the window
He goes to the window
She takes her chance
She's out of the door in a moment
136 propels herself out of the Room, and down the stairs, while  vents his anger above her
137 She flings open the front door, and pitches herself - bleeding and bruised - into the daylight beyond
138
55 As she stumbles away down the path, she sees the box at her feet, in a litter of broken glass
She picks it up, and continues to run
139 series of shots from '
, as she staggers along the street
The sound-track whines; the image threatens to be eclipsed by darkness
People stare at her as she runs
child points
Finally, the  slows
She stands still
voice, off camera: (
) Are you all right
The  swings giddily around in the direction of the speaker
comes into view
Do you need any help
As she speaks, the picture fades to white
140  '   ( ) The whiteness continues to fill the screen
Distant, incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood in the inner ear
Then darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as sexual or horrific imagery
With the darkness, soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet in her first dream, fragments of 's previous dialogue
Come to Daddy
This isn't happening
Some things have to be endured
The darkness is filling the screen take it from me
Now, total darkness
Come to Daddy
And suddenly, she wakes
141 is lying in a bed in a private room is at her bedside, monitoring her condition
You're awake
She goes to the door
'll get the doctor
She exits
tries to sit up
Her head hurts, badly
As she achieves a sitting position, the door opens
The returns, with a
(approaching the bed) So
you're back with us
think so
How are you feeling
Tender
You took quite a beating
Do you remember what happened
She looks at him, uncertain of where to start
want to speak to my father
(nods) Of course
We'll bring you a telephone
The  exits
The  brings the box from his pocket
Maybe this'll jog your memory
He lays it on the bed
She stares at it, her expression betraying nothing
had the Devil's own job getting it out of your hand
Does it ring any bells
She shakes her head
Do you want it left
Why not
He offers her a reassuring smile
Chin up
There's no serious damage
And you're safe here
Um
He leaves the room
picks up the box, tentatively
She turns it over in her hand, examining it
142 is standing in the shadows
He is wearing a fresh shirt
He smirks
watches him
Downstairs, the telephone rings
is very nervous now; desperate even
She'll tell them everything
don't think so
She'll want Larry first
That's probably her now
Or the police
Maybe
Don't you care
There's very little  can do about it
Maybe we should just leave - Like this
Look at me Well we can't just stay here - need a skin
Then we leave - 143 is sitting up in bed
On the bedside table, a telephone
She is now thoroughly engrossed in the problems of the box
Her fingers speed over the surfaces, looking for some way in, testing its strength
Suddenly, a click
Her face lights up with pleasure, as she slides a part of the box open, revealing new intricacies
And to accompany the revelation, a tinkling tune
She smiles
It's a musical box
The light beside the bed flickers, but she doesn't notice
The door opens
It's the
Comfortable
(smiles) Sure
Any luck with your father
(shakes her head) He's probably got a meeting
called a friend of mine
He's coming; is that
Of course
The  exits
As she does go the light flickers again
The box clicks
new facet is revealed
smiles
144
55 The front door closes
(inside) Julia
145 stands in the hall
comes down the stairs
She looks pale; even ill
What's wrong
don't know where to begin
What are you talking about
It's better you see for your- self - She turns and starts up the stairs
He follows
146 has opened more of the box
The tune is more complex now
Somewhere a bell has started to ring
Now, she works the final mechanism of the box
The bedside light flickers and goes out
The bell rings
Light pours out of the box
She drops it, shocked
The bedside light comes on again
She looks up
In the wall opposite the end of her bed, a very narrow doorway has simply opened in the wall
Leaving the box on the bed, she gets up and goes to the gap
As she approaches she hears the distant, rhythmical sob of a baby
She stands at the doorway
147 We look back at her, a diminutive figure framed against a shot of light, from way, way down the corridor
148 The sobbing goes on
stares down the corridor - which is lit brightly in some places, and is absolutely dark in others - not certain of whether to venture down it or not
She glances towards the door of her room, from the other side of which comes the reassuring sound of the hospital going about its business
What's to fear
149 She steps into the corridor
The walls rise into darkness on either side of her, their surfaces like the interior of a pyramid, pitted with age, and rotting away
She starts towards the sobbing child, bare feet on the impacted earth of the passageway
The sobbing gets louder as she advances, her form disappearing entirely as she passes through the intermittent darkness
Once, she glances back towards the Hospital Room, to reassure herself that it's still there
It is, though it's no more than a sliver of light at the far end of the passageway
She advances a few more paces
The atmosphere is growing denser; smoke thickens the air
Then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor
The sound of the sobbing child ceases
She stops walking
Ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we see a creature -   - hanging in the space between the walls
It is in silhouette against the light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles no earthly animal
Its vast black limbs hold it suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone
Its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down from beneath its vast head
Its tail is curled over its back
's expression registers this horror moves into the light
Its irises narrow to slits
From the tail a vast sting, oozing pus - like venom, glides into view
And then - - it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by bracing its legs against the walls
Its breath is a growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when all sound from it ceases, only to erupt  again as it finds the light
turns, and starts to run
It comes after her at speed
Darkness, light, darkness, light; roars and silence - Its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam
runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the safety of the Hospital Room
But it's very close on her heels, lingering - As she comes within a few yards of the Room it closes on her
150 She flings herself through the door with  's breath on her back, and turns - The doorway has gone
The wall is sealed
She approaches the wall
scratches on the other side
Then, she realises that the bell is still ringing
And there's a foul smell in the air
She looks around
She's not alone
Standing across the room from her, lit by a strange phosphorescence that has no visible source, are four extraordinary figures
They are
Each of them is horribly mutilated by systems of hooks and pins
The garments they wear are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh, laced through skin in places, hooked into bone
The leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head at inch intervals
At his side, a woman whose neck is pinned open like a vivisection specimen
Accompanying them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping rectangle - the exposed teeth sharpened to points, and a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark glasses
When the lead  speaks, we recognise the voice as that of the creature from the beginning of the film
stares in amazement
Where the hell did you come from
The  gestures
The box is lying on the bed
The box
you opened it
We came
It's just a puzzle box
It's a means to summon us - it's called the Lament Con- figuration
Who are you
Cenobites
Explorers in the further regions of experience
Demons to some
Angels to others
Well,  didn't mean to open that thing
You can go back wherever you came from
We can't
Not alone
At this, the creature with the wired open jaw chatters like a mad monkey
This isn't for real
You solved the box
We came
Now you must come with us
Taste our pleasures
The chattering  steps towards her
Don't touch me
The door opens
It's
's face floods with relief
does not register the ' presence however
Steve
Thank God you came
What happened to you
He steps between the
These
they want to take me - What things
(to Kirsty) He doesn't see us, or hear us
We belong to you, Kirsty
And you to us
No
What's wrong
Don't let them take me, Steve - won't let anybody take you
He starts to walk towards her, but the creature in the dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts the hook to 's neck
's hand moves to the place; he makes a small sound of pain
The takes off its glasses, to see its trick better
The eyes beneath are sewn shut
It pulls a little more on the hook
winces
If he takes another step, we open his throat
(to Steve) Please go, Steve
What
Just go
'll be
'm going to go see Dad
He'll look after me - (protesting) What did  say
Will you , damn you
Mystified,  retreats a step
'll come back later, huh
Sure
Why not
Still puzzled,  crosses to the door
'Bye
'Bye
Good
It's time we were away
(almost crying) Let me alone, will you
No tears please
It's a waste of good suffering
The chatterer comes for her
As it does so desperation brings a plan to 's head
Wait
He stops
No time for argument
You did this before, right
Many times
To a man called Frank Cotton
Oh yes
But he escaped you
Nobody escapes us
did
've seen him
He's alive
Is that so
And what are you proposing
'll take you to him
Then you take him instead of me
Back wherever you come from
The  stares at her unblinking
Perhaps
But if you cheat us
The sound of  , scratching on the other side of the wall
The plaster cracks, violently
We'll tear your soul apart
We cut back to the cracking plaster, which cracks further
We hear 's voice, and pan back into the room
The door opens
and the  have gone
is there, with the
She was trembling all over
'd better go look for her
The  heads for the door
Maybe she's gone back to her - He looks round
The  has gone
- father
His eyes have alighted on the box, which is lying on the bed
He picks it up
151
55 Lights burn in the house, upstairs and down
152 sits in front of the dressing table mirror
She has a glass of whisky in front of her
She sips from it, studying her face in the mirror
We've seen her in many moods through the story:  now we see a mingling of fear and exhilaration on her face
She gets up
Laid out on the bed is,of all things, her wedding gown
153
' drives towards Lodovico Street, scanning the streets for sign of
154 As his car drives past,  turns a corner
He does not see her
hurries along the street
The wind is chilly
Sometimes she hears a bell in it
155 drives up to the house
The lights are still burning
He gets out of the car, and hurries down the path
156 He knocks on the door
There's no reply
157 Two shadowy, naked figures stand face to face in the bedroom
We can see no detail of their features
We move down their bodies
They are standing in a shining pool of blood
158 starts round the back of the house
159 The male of the couple pads towards  the bedroom door, leaving a trail of blood behind him
We can still see very little of the man
160 turns the corner of the street, and starts down it
The wind is strong now
It is full of sibilant whispers, hurrying her along
161 dresses
162 reaches the doorstep
As she does so the whispers die away completely
She beats on the door
No reply
She beats again, more urgently
Please
Dad
It's me
It's Kirsty
163 steps onto the landing
We can hear  shouting on the step
Damn her
We hear a voice, off-screen
Is it  or
Impossible to be sure
Answer it
164 still beats on the door
Please, answer me
Please - The door is suddenly opened
is standing there
Kirsty
It's very late
Where's Daddy
What's the problem
(stepping inside) have to see my father
Of course
There's no need to shout
165 We pan across the table
At the end of the table sits The light is behind him
His features are shadowy
But we can see that he is badly bruised
We hear the womens' voices, off-screen
You look terrible
Have you had an accident
was here this afternoon
This afternoon
saw everything
'm sorry,  don't follow
What was there to see
doesn't answer, but walks through into the Dining Room
sees  at the table
Oh God
Thank God
(she starts to sob) thought something might have
She glances round at , who has also entered
(to Larry) have to talk to you
Of course
leans forward, and into the pool of light over the table
He looks much the worse for wear
His flesh is raw and bruised
There is blood at his neck and hairline
It's all right, sweetheart
Julia's told me everything; and it's all right
No
You don't understand
Your brother - Frank - he's here in the house
And he's - Whatever Frank did was his error
And it's finished with now
Finished
(smiles) He's gone
Gone
Dead
He was insane, baby:  a mad dog
put him out of his misery - stares at , while in her head she hears the 's voice
we'll tear your soul apart
'll go to the police, when 'm feeling stronger
Try and find some way to make them understand, though God knows  don't really understand myself
Did he hurt you
is dumb with horror at her situation
(leans back) Poor Frank
He's better off dead
don't believe it
'm afraid it's true
(tears in her eyes) want to see
No you don't
Yes
(to Julia) Show her
turns away from
leads her out into the Hallway
, still sitting at the table
His fingers drum a familiar tattoo
Beneath his breath, he hums 'Colonel Bogey'
166 pushes open the door of the Torture Room
It creaks wide
Lying on the floor inthe middle of the room is a skinned corpse, in a tangle of torn clothing
It steams
There is blood everywhere
That too, steams
is revolted
She steps away from the door, back down the landing
The bell has begun to ring again, distantly, and there is the sound of wings in the air - thousands of birds - beating on the other side of the wall
starts down the stairs again
Where are you going
doesn't reply
She merely hurries away
(calling after her) You leave this to us, you hear me
We'll deal with the police - 167 descends the stairs
has stepped out of the Dining Room and is moving to intercept her as she makes her way to the front door
The sound of wings, and bells - and a terrible slow thunder which underpins it all - mounts in volume
snatches at her arm
Where are you going
have to get out
She shrugs off his arm
The thunder is increasing
Stay with me - is on the stairs, watching this exchange
- it's all right
Really it is
He touches her face, fondly
can't stay
She goes to the door
Come to Daddy
She hesitates at the door, and turns
168
('
) The thunder fills 's head, as she stares at , who has opened his arms to her
Come to Daddy
Her gaze moves up to , who is on the stairs
No, damn you - 169 (mouths) Oh my God
Everything is slowing down
The bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack
smiles, as  moves towards him
Tears have begun to fill her eyes
She searches for him
His smile decays as he realizes her objective
Her nails rake his cheek
The flesh puckers, and tears along the brow
Blood flows
The mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little, and 's twisted features come into view
Frank
screams, as  lunges for her
The lights in the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out
avoids 's blow, but in doing so allows him to get between her and the front door
She's trapped
His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the lining
Suddenly,  is behind her, gripping hold of her hair
advances on , but in the last moment before the fatal stab  twists, avoiding the blow shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as it's buried to the hilt in her side
slips from between them
collapses into 's arms
He holds her up
makes a dive for the front door, but  lets slip and intercepts
falls back against the wall, dying
retreats to the bottom of the stairs
follows
You're not leaving now - As he follows,  reaches out and takes hold of his sleeve
flees the only route she can, upstairs
The house is creaking in every board and rafter now
turns on , trapping her against the wall
, Help me, Frank
For God's sake
He puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards her
At the last moment she seems to understand that he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little life she has left
No, Frank - From the stairs  glimpses him battering upon her
Then she looks away, and runs up the stairs
When we look back  is withering in 's arms
170 The landing is smoky
The lights have taken on a yellowish tinge
The air is full of moans
is desperate for a hiding place
She tries one of the doors, but it's locked
She opens another, and the din of birds' wings gets louder
171 shot, lunging towards  in the doorway
She slams the door in the face of whatever's coming for her
172 hears the door slam
He drops  to the ground
She's dead, her flesh rotting on her face
starts to climb the stairs, his eyes burning with hunger
173 is cornered
From below, 's voice
Where are you, beautiful
starts up the second flight of stairs, as 's shadow is thrown up on the wall below
174 is faced with a choice
The Torture Room door is open, but the skinned body is in there, so instead she heads for the Junk Room, and opens the door
175 Moonlight falls through the window, illuminating a chaos of furniture and boxes
She crosses to the window, and tries to get it open
It won't budge
(somewhere below) Where are you, honey
She looks around for a lever to open the window with - 176 reaches the landing and opens the bedroom door, calling for her
Then he starts up the last flight of stairs
Come to Daddy
177 lifts a cloth off one of the boxes
Staring up from the box is the corpse of , his eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek
She reels back from the box, terrified, backing into the shadows
An arm reaches for her, taking hold of her and dragging her back into darkness as the door opens
stands on the theshold
His breath is thick
He shambles forward, but he doesn't see her
We  back to the shadows
's eyes are wild with terror
Back to the door, which clicks closed
breaks cover, and so does her saviour
It's He is sweating with terror
(a whisper) What are you doing here
Got in downstairs
Looking for you
What's going on
She shakes her head
brings the box from his jacket
You forgot something - She doesn't see what he's produced
She's already moving to the door
She listens
178 The landing is empty
The door of the Junk Room opens
steps out
The house is strangely still
The lights swing a little; but otherwise
nothing
She advances along the passageway
follows
They reach the top of the stairs in safety
(signalled more than spoken) 'll go first - As he speaks,  steps out of the Torture Room, knife in hand
Roaring, he comes at them both
flings herself out of the path of the knife
swipes at , who falls backwards down the stairs
He cries out, head hitting the stairs as he descends
The box falls from his unconscious hand
turns on , who avoids one slice of the knife, and another, but is driven back into the Torture Room
179 He's after her in a flash
She falls beside her father's body, her eyes meeting its skinned face
God - Don't cry for him
He's dead
He always was
has been pushed to the limits of her endurance
She can be terrorized and pursued no longer
Death looks an easy option by comparison with more of 's horrors
Go on
Kill me
don't care
Poor baby
You bastard Hush now
It's all right
Frank's here
Frank
That's right
Are you losing your mind, baby
This is Frank you're talking to
As he speaks the bell begins tolling again
looks puzzled
What's going on
Light begins to pour through the walls of the room
No
He starts towards the door
But he's too late
The are standing in his way
He backs off from them
Frank - (to Cenobite) What took you so long
We had to hear it from his own lips - turns on
You set me up
You bitch
You set me up
The pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate, and the  move through it towards
(to Kirsty) This isn't for your eyes
crosses towards the door
As she reaches for the handle she hears  roar behind her
She turns
He breaks between the , knife in hand, but as he comes within striking distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead
They have their hooks in him, we see
In his arms and legs;  in his back and sides;  in his scalp and neck and temples
Hooks attached to countless chains, which arrest his progress
They plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her
But at a gesture from the leader of the , the chains are hauled in
He flings back his head, yelling
The knife drops from his hand
(to Kirsty) Out
She turns back to the door and opens it
is hauled back towards the centre of the room
Bitch
The house is growling  from basement to eaves now, as steps onto the landing
180 Behind her,  howls
She looks back
They have him  ,    his body spread-eagled; hooks in a hundred places, pulling at his flesh
He fights like a wild animal, snarling and cursing
They pull the chains tighter
181 close up of 's face
He suddenly stops fighting
He raises his head, his eyes staring up at  from beneath a bleeding, sweating brow
He flicks his tongue over his bloodied lips
Then - - he comes apart
182 The door slams as 's body is torn apart in a welter of blood and flesh fragments
Something heavy thuds against the door
turns and starts down the stairs
183 As she reaches the place where  is half-sitting, half- lying, the house starts to growl as though its foundations are about to give way
's nose is bleeding, and his face is bruised, but he's conscious
We have to get out of here
They'll kill us for the fun of it
staggers to his feet
picks up the box, which is on the lower landing
As she picks it up, the   steps from the shadows
Don't leave us yet - starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands
We've got such sights to show you - manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back into place
don't
Her voice becomes a howl, and she's sucked away into darkness
(behind Kirsty) Jesus Christ
They start down to the half-landing
There stands the in the dark-glasses, carrying the hooked rod he threatened  with in the hospital
Again, manipulates the box
Again, the  howls and is claimed by the darkness
184 They hurry down to the hallway, half expecting another creature to step into their path
Dust is falling from the ceiling, and there are cracks opening up  in the walls
Any moment, surely, the whole place will be destroyed
's body has gone from the hallway;  a trail of blood leads into the dining room
As  and  stumble across the hallway, they hear 's voice, off-screen, an eerie, ghostly voice
Kirsty
hesitates, and looks towards the door of the dining room
There stands the bride, her white dress soaked in blood, her veil covering her face
Julia
takes a step towards her, but as she does so the veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering is beneath
slams the box closed
The  howls, and disappears
heads for the door
Turns the handle
As he does so,  realizes there's one piece of the box unfinished
Don't
Too late
He turns the handle
The door is flung open, and  , clinging to the sides of the door, swings down into the hallway
is flung backwards against
The box falls from 's hand
The beast moves to bite at , who scrambles out of the way, leaving in the front line
The box lies between  and  , which now uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her, its legs still bracing it in the door
She snatches for the box
, its mouth oozing fluids, almost catches her arm
Again, she tries
This time one of its arms seizes hold of  and drags her towards its jaws
Behind ,  snatches up a piece of plaster and flings it in  's face
It momentarily relaxes its grip on , who slides her hand from its hold and claims the box
She now has slime on her fingers
The box defies her manipulations
Come on
Come on
crawls towards them
Up above, the din of the roof collapsing
Timbers and dust hurtle down the stairs
Shit
Shit
Shit
is almost upon her
It rears up, its saliva dropping on her
And then, miraculously, the last piece of the box slots into place
The same vortex that seized the other  seizes Howling its complaint, it is drawn out into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears
Its voice grows thin, and fades
Finally, silence
The house is still
gets to her feet
does the same
Together, they move to the door, and out onto the step
185 The door slams behind them, of its own accord
turns the sealed box over in her hand
There is a slit in it which has not quite closed
Light suddenly pours from it, up into 's face
Her features are momentarily distorted, as if sucked towards the box
From within:  shrieks, bells, music
Between the screams, 's voice
Come to Daddy
She slams the panel shut
The distortions cease
So does the din
(quietly) Not tonight
smile crosses her face, and she leaves the doorstep, making her way towards the street
gazes at her, then follows
Their figures are erased by the darkness
Somewhere, a bell rings as
