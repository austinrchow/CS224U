She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with concentration
This is  , mid-20's, trim, very pretty
She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy windbreaker, khaki pants
Her thick hair is piled under a navy baseball cap
revolver, clutched in her right hand, hovers by her ear
She raises a speedloader, in her left hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads
guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its knob
Suddenly, wish a sharp
, the knob explodes, and the door bursts open
- as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke
She shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at the ready in both hands
: - '  -  - as she first sees, sitting on the edge of a bed - a
Black, late 20's, gagged, hands behind her back
Then,
she sees a startled , white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a rifle in his hands
He is turning towards her
Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts
Freeze
'  - all natural  suspended - as the Suspect faces her with a strange, pleading expression
The rifle is rising in his hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not pointing
Then another puzzling detail registers
' are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use it even if he tried
Suddenly we hear a metallic , which registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and - "" pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in , raising it in her untied hands
She fires repeatedly, flames leaping from the muzzle; the  is an echoing roar in these close quarters, but - Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is already firing back herself, two quick , which send - "" pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still in a haze of gunsmoke
Clarice rushes to her, clamping one knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case of movement
for a few beats
then we hear the shrill blast of a  from somewhere, off screen, as normal and  are restored
(
) Okay, people, good exercise
Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun
The lights brighten
we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the "hotel room" and its "corridor" built as a training set walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch
Mid-40's, ex- Marine
His -shirt's lettering says "Firearms Instructor / Academy
" Starling's reaction time was excellent
Let's break
Critique in five
class of about forty young  trainees, of both sexes, begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting
Clarice nods amiably to the "Suspect", then gives her "Hostage" a hand up
It's  , her roommate
Her broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both remove ear plugs
Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of southern accent
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me
(indicating her gun) Never cock
Just squeeze
(grins) love it when you talk dirty
As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's little smile of pride
He frowns good-naturedly
What're you laughin' at, Junior - Man
She got off four rounds to your two
He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her palm
(continuing) One hundred reps, each hand, every day
Now tidy up, the Section Chief wants to see you
He nods a direction, then moves off
Clarice, with her smile finally fading, looks out into the auditorium
sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her
He is 53, strongly built
He rises impassively, exits through the back door
He carries a think manila envelope under one arm
Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof vest, follows her worried gaze
What'd  do
Stay cool
Just remember to call him "God
" : , ,  - Crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, as Clarice joins him
He looks tired, haunted
Between master and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality
Starling, Clarice
, good morning
Good morning, Mr
Crawford
Your instructors tell me you're doing well
Top quarter of the class
hope so
They haven't posted anything
job's come up and  thought about you
Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand
Walk me to my car, Starling
They begin to cross the academy grounds
group of trainees jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p
e
coach
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile
Could be a big help in unsolved cases
Most of them have been happy to talk to us
They have a compulsion to boast, these people
Do you spook easily, Starling
Not yet
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate
want you to go after him again today, in the asylum
Who's the subject
The psychiatrist - Dr
Hannibal Lecter
Clarice stops walking, goes very still
beat
The cannibal
Crawford doesn't respond, except to study her face
Yes, well
Okay, right
'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me
You're qualified and available
And frankly,  can't spare a real agent right now
He walks on again, at a faster clip
She hurried to keep up
don't expect him to talk to you, but  have to be able to say we tried
Lecter was a brilliant psychiatrist, and he knows all the dodges
(hands her the manila envelope) Dossier on him, copy of our questionnaire, special  for you
If he won't talk, then  want straight reporting
How's he look, how's his cell look, what's he writing
The Director himself will see your report, over your own signature - if  decide it's good enough
want that by 0800 Wednesday, and keep this to yourself
They're reached his car
His driver stamps on a cigarette, climbs in behind the wheel
, his assistant, says something into a walkie-talkie, then opens the back door
But Crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder
His intensity is scary
Now
want your full attention, Starling
Are you listening to me
Yes sir
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter
Dr
Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him
Do not deviate from them, for any reason
You tell him nothing personal, Starling
Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head
Just do your job, but never forget what he is
(a bit unnerved) And what is that, sir
(
) Oh, he's a monster
pure psychopath
: '  - - an  card held in a male hand
Clarice's photo, official-looking graphics
It calls her a "Federal Investigator
" (
) It's so rare to capture one alive
From a research point of view, Dr
Lecter is our most prized asset
looks up from her card
smarmy little peacock, behind a vast desk; he's conceived an instant, hopeless letch for Clarice
He smiles, stroking her card with his beloved gold pen
You know, we get a lot of detectives here, but  must say,  can't ever remember one so attractive
- now wearing a more feminine skirt suit
Hair neatly coiled, elegant shoulder bag, briefcase
He has rudely left her standing
Will you be in Baltimore overnight
Because this can be quite a fun town, if you have the right guide
Clarice tries, unsuccessfully, to hide her distaste for him
'm sure it's a great town, Dr
Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon
(pause, sourly) see
(beat) Let's make this quick, then
'm busy
: -   - Clarice flinches as a heavy steel gate  shut behind her, the bolt shooting home
Chilton walks ahead of her
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits
We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests
And my, does he hate us
Thinks 'm his nemesis
Crawford's very clever, isn't he
Using you
How do you mean, Dr
Chilton
pretty young woman, to turn him on
don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years
And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak
graduated magna from , Doctor
It's not a charm school
Good
Then you should be able to remember the rules
: -   - darker, even grimmer area
Heavy grids over the lights
Distant  and faint, hoarse
They walk briskly
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars
You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils
No staples or paperclips in his paper
Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions
Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you
Do you understand me
understand
'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary
His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an
When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her
He hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo
Looking at it, she is stopped in her tracks
This pleases Chilton
The doctors managed to re-set her jaw, more or less, and save one of her eyes
His pulse never got over eighty-five, even when he ate her tongue
(pauses, he smiles) keep him in here
He turns, pushes a button
steel door  slowly open, and  - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an anteroom
On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, tranquilizer guns
(quickly blocking him) Dr
Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe 'll have more luck by myself
What do you think
(annoyed) You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time
But then  would've missed the pleasure of your company
She holds out the photo
beat
He grabs it, jaw twitching
When she's finished, bring her out
He turns on his heel, goes
Barney smiles reassuringly
Hi, 'm Barney
He told you, don't get near the bars
(shaking his hand) Clarice Starling
Yes, he did
Okay
Past the others, it's the last cell
Stay to the middle
put out a chair for you
Sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor
'm watching
You'll do fine
Clarice nods gratefully
She looks down the long corridor, takes a deep breath, walks into it
He watches her go
: '  - - with Clarice, as her footsteps
High to her right, surveillance cameras
On her left, cells
Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred
Shadowy occupants pacing,
Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses
c-can sssmell your cunt
Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on
' is coming slowly
Behind its barred front wall is a second barrier of stout nylon net
Sparse, bolted- down furniture, many softcover books and papers
On the walls, extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon
Clarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears her throat
Dr
Lecter
My name is Clarice Starling
May  talk with you
Dr
Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, reading an Italian Vogue
He turns, considers her
face so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth
He rises smoothly, crossing to stand before her; the gracious host
His voice is cultured, soft
Good morning
as Clarice comes a measured distance closer
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling
want to ask for your help with a questionnaire
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico
You're one of Jack Crawford's,  expect
am, yes
May  see your credentials
Clarice is surprised, but fishes her  card from her bag, holds it up for his inspection
He smiles, soothingly
Closer, please
Clo-ser
She complies each time, trying to hide her fear
Dr
Lecter's nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air
Then he smiles, glancing at her card
(continuing) That expires in one week
You're not real , are you
'm - still in training at the Academy
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau
Can you decide for yourself whether or not 'm qualified
Mmmmm
That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling
Sit
Please
She sits in the folding metal desk-chair
He waits politely till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily
Now then
What did Miggs say to you
(she is puzzled) "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell
He hissed at you
What did he say
He said - " can smell your cunt
" see
myself cannot
You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear 'Air du Temps, but not today
You brought your best bag, though, didn't you
(beat) Yes
It's much better than your shoes
Maybe they'll catch up
have no doubt of it
(shifting uncomfortably) Did you do those drawings, Doctor
Yes
That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere
Do you know Florence
All that detail, just from memory
Memory, Officer Starling, is what have instead of view
pause, then Clarice takes the questionnaire from her case
Dr
Lecter, if you'd please consider - No, no, no
You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire
It won't do
It's stupid and boring
'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor
Either you will or you won't
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill
Such a naughty boy
Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him
No,  came because we need - How many women has he used, our Bill
Five
so far
All flayed
Partially, yes
But Doctor, that's an active case, 'm not involved
If - Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill
Tell me
The newspapers won't say
'll tell you if you'll look at this form
(he considers, then nods) It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide
They said
this one likes to skin his humps
Witless and misleading
Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling
Thrill me with your wisdom
It excites him
Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies
didn't
No
You ate yours
tense beat, then a smile from him, at this small boldness
Send that through
She rolls him the questionnaire, in his sliding food tray
He rises, glances at it, turning a page or two disdainfully
Oh, Officer Starling
do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool
No
only hoped that your knowledge - Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic that makes her start
His voice remains a pleasant purr
You're sooo ambitious, aren't you
You know what you look like to me, with your good bag and your cheap shoes
You look like a rube
well- scrubbed, hustling rube with a little, taste
Good nutrition has given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you Officer Starling
That accent you're trying so desperately to shed - pure West Virginia
What was your father, dear
Was he a coal miner
Did he stink of the lamp
And oh, how quickly the boys found you
All those tedious, sticky fumblings, in the back seats of cars, while you could only dream of getting out
Getting anywhere - yes
Getting all the way - to the His every word has struck her like a tiny, precise dart
But she squares her jaw and won't give ground
You see a lot, Dr
Lecter
But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself
How about it
Look at yourself and write down the truth
(she slams the tray back at him) Or maybe you're afraid to
You're a tough one, aren't you
Reasonably so
Yes
And you'd hate to think you were common
My, wouldn't that sting
Well you're far from common, Officer Starling
All you have is the fear of it
(beat) Now please excuse me
Good day
And the questionnaire
census taker once tried to test me
ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti
Fly back to school, little Starling
He steps backwards, then returns to his cot, becoming as still and remote as a statue
Frustrated, Clarice hesitates, then finally shoulders her bag and goes, leaving the questionnaire in his tray
But after just a few steps, as she passes - ' She sees that creature at his bars again, hissing at her
b-bit my wrist so  c-can diiiieeee
-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds
The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and - is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with pale droplets of semen
She gives a little cry, touching her fingers to the wetness
Stunned, near tears, she forces herself to straighten up and walk on, fumbling for a tissue
From behind her, Dr
Lecter calls out, very agitated
(
) Officer Starling
Officer Starling
Clarice slows, stops
She shudders, but makes the very difficult choice to turn, walk back, stand again in front of - Who's shivering with rage
For an instant his face opens, and we catch a glimpse into hell itself
Then he's composed again
would not have had that happen to you
Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me
Then please - do this test for me
No
But  will make you happy
'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling
What's that, Dr
Lecter
Advancement, of course
(beat) Go to Split City
See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine
----
Now go
Go
(a smile) don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you
: -   - The grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as Clarice rushes out the front doors
She is badly shaken, almost stumbling, as she rubs at her face
She looks around for, and finally, with some relief, spots - an old Pinto, parked nearby
This image begins to
her face, fighting tears, as the  begins to her, almost dizzily
She is seeing, in her mind's eye - a screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year old girl - the young Clarice - rushing outside, down the front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to - -  ' a car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road
, Clarice's father, is just climbing out
He's tall, handsome, and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit
He grins, seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as
rushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning her around, the   with them, and capturing both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to - alone in the parking lot, sagging against her car
Her face is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking
- a steady, rapid series of , as we : - Clarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling headset, is squeezing off  after  at The silhouette of a man, approaching along a track
Her shots, tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest
The target stops, quite close to her, still swaying
Clarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader
Then she puts a final, emphatic shot right through  ' : - a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr
Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New Horrors in Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980
Clarice is punching keys on the terminal
Other trainees study at nearby tables
She pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by, carrying an armful of books
Phone call, Clarice
It's God
Thanks, Ardelia
as Clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows Ardelia past high metal bookstacks
You missed Fourth Amendment law
Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff
Where were you all afternoon
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face
Ardelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs
Damn
Wish  had time for a social life
Clarice grins, as Ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting on the check-out desk, then moves on
Clarice picks it up
(on phone) Mr
Crawford
: '  -  - Crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- lined study of his suburban home
He turns the pages of Clarice's memo as they talk
His tone is sharp
've read your interim memo on Lecter
You sure you've left nothing out
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim
Every word, Starling
Every gesture
(a bit heatedly) Right down to the kleenex  used
(he is silent) Sir, why
Is something wrong
He mentioned a name, at the very end
"Mofet
" Any followup on her
spent all evening on the mainframe
Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture
No record of anyone named Mofet
But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce
tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages
(glancing at her notes) It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice
She pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her cleverness
Well
Why aren't you there right now
Sir, that's a field job
It's outside the scope of my assignment
And 've got a test tomorrow on - Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling
What were they
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday
But sir - Then do that, Starling
Do just exactly that
Sir, what is it
There's something you're not telling me
(beat) Miggs has been murdered
(startled, upset) Murdered
How
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying
They found him at bed check
He'd swallowed his own tongue
Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you
told the little prick your conduct was flawless
(beat) Starling
'm here, sir,  just -  don't know how to feel about it
You don't have to feel any way about it
Lecter did it to amuse himself
Why not, what can they do
Take away his books for awhile, and no jello
(a bit softer) know it got ugly today
But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can
On your own time, outside of class
Now carry on
as we hear the loud  of Crawford hanging up
She stares at her receiver, stung by his abruptness
Well God damn it
You old creep
Creepo son of a bitch
Let Miggs squirt you and see how you like it
She slams her receiver into its cradle
as he flips aside her memo, then rises, wearily
He leaves his study, flicking off the lamp, and pads away in his slippers
: '  - private nurse, in white, stands marking a clipboard chart, as Crawford enters his tidy bedroom
'll take over, Patricia
You get some rest
The nurse nods, hands him the chart, and goes
He glances at it, then sets it aside
He crosses to - who lies in an elevated hospital bed
Nearby are an oxygen tank and mask, floral arrangements
Her breathing is shallow, very labored
Crawford looks down at his comatose wife for a long moment, tenderly brushes a strand of her hair back into place, then bends over to kiss her forehead
- and
: "  -" -  () An orange neon sign, streaked with rain, identifies out location
It looms over a hurricane fence, topped with barbed wire
Inside, row on row of garage-sized, cinderblock sheds
(
) Unit 31 was leased for ten years
Pre-paid in full
The contract is in the name of "Miss Hester Mofet
" : 31 - Clarice, kneeling before a closed, roll-up metal door, takes a  photo of its sealed padlock
, a fat, 60ish Chinaman, holds an umbrella over them both
He looks unhappy
So no one's been in here since - 1980
She opens the padlock, using a fat ring of tagged keys, then sets aside both keys and lock
Not to my knowledge
Privacy is a great concern to my customers
But, if you say this is an  matter
won't disturb anything, Mr
Yow, promise
Be gone before you know it
Slinging her camera over a shoulder, she tugs at the handle, but the door won't budge
Another tug, harder - no good
Mr
Yow stoops to help, puffing hard, but it's firmly stuck
He sighs
We could return tomorrow, with my son
Or perhaps some workmen
Clarice crosses to her Pinto, which faces the shed, reaches in to turn on her headlights
Mr
Yow blinks in the sudden brightness
Then she opens her truck, rummaging inside, and returns with a bumper jack, a flashlight, and a rubber floor mat
Would you hold these, please
She gives him her flashlight and camera, drops the mat on the ground, then sets the bumper jack in place, under the center of the door
She pumps on the jack handle as the door slowly up, but it won't go higher than about 18 inches, despite all her exertions
She spreads out the rubber mat on the cement, takes the flashlight from Mr
Yow, then lies on the mat
: -  ( ) Clarice, backlit, peers under the door
She reaches in, makes a sweep with her flashlight
We catch shadowy outlines - boxes, then the flattened tires of a car
of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small Mr
Yow's chubby face appears down beside Clarice's
It smells like mice
think hear them, too - don't you
Clarice turns onto her back, starts squirming under the door
You're going in there
: 31 - Clarice pulls her head back out again, reaching to take her camera from him
She hands him a card, trying to appear nonchalant
Mr
Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha
- or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number
It's our Baltimore field office
They know you're here with me
Do you understand
Might  suggest tucking your pants into your socks
To prevent mouse intrusion
(beat) Good idea
: -  ( ) Clarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening
As she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal edge of the door
She curses softly, shining her flashlight on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood
(
) Okay, Miss Starling
Okay, Mr
Yow
She shines her light around
In its narrow beam, we see - '  - , spiderwebs, everywhere
high stacks of cardboard boxes
a few dusty pieces of furniture
the big car, oddly long and tall, covered with a tarp
Suddenly there's a scurrying of loud
Clarice turns, scared, her beam capturing
an old upright piano
(
) You're playing a piano, Miss Starling
That wasn't me
(
) Oh
Clarice crawls a bit further
There's hardly room to stand, but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away cobwebs, next to the car
Holding her light under one arm, she takes several  photos of the shed's interior, ending with the car
Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof
The resulting clouds of dust make her cough
is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard
It's very dusty, despite the tarp
Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, but there's a narrow gap in them
More mousy
peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight
- as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat
as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines
a crumpled lap rug, on the floor
and then a pair of women's shiny, high-heeled pumps
Above these, the hem of a fancy satin evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs
Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself
Mr
Yow
Oh Mr
Yow
It looks like somebody is sitting in this car
(
) Oh my
Oh my
Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling
Not yet
- just wait for me
(under the breath) Maybe in about two seconds
She leans down with her camera, takes a  through the gap, then tries the door handle
Locked
So is the front door
She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac
She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends the tip into a hook
as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the inside door latch, pulling up
satisfying
Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her flashlight
- revealing more of the evening gown
a pair of hands, in white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag
thick strands of costume pearls over the breasts
and finally the white neck stub of a female mannequin
No face or head
sighs with relief
She takes a couple more , then very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by the corners, and setting it atop the car
Then she eases herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs loudly
slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh
Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard
She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic elbow
She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening bag's drawstring
stares back at her, as the beaded material slides away
Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart- pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more closely
The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory specimen jar
It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, into a woman's face
Over the years the makeup has smeared badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white
staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself quickly regaining control
She murmurs to herself
Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore
: '  -   -  () loud clap of , as a flash of  illuminates the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum
on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard admits her
: '    -  ( ) On a noiseless  screen, an evangelist rants, waving his arms
Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes
(
) It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor
Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on the corridor floor to one side of this , which has been stationed so that Dr
Lecter cannot avoid seeing it
Hester Mofet
"The rest of me
" Miss The-Rest-of-Me
Meaning, you rented that place
he's lost in shadows; we can't see him
He doesn't respond
Clarice and the darkened call - as she tries again
You put those - things in there
Paid for it in advance, ten years ago
Why, Dr
Lecter
The food carrier suddenly  out of the cell, making her jump up
In its tray is a clean, folded white towel
She hesitates, then crosses, takes this
Thank you
She sits again, rubbing her wet hair
When he finally speaks, he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering  light
Your bleeding has stopped
How did - (she stops herself) It's nothing
scratch
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill
(surprised, a beat) Why
Do you know something about him
might if  saw the case file
You could get that for me
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet
" You wanted me to find him
Or do  have to wait for the lab
(sighs) His real name is Benjamin Raspail former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic
didn't kill him, merely tucked him away
Very much as found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments
You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true
If you didn't kill him, then who did
Who can say
Best thing for him, really
His therapy was going nowhere
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find
And have them clomping about in my life
Oh dear, no
At that time still had certain private amusements of my own
(beat) How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice
May  call you Clarice
Scared, at first
Then - exhilarated
Ahhh
Why
Because you weren't wasting my time
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage
Memories, tableaux
scenes from your early life
don't know
Next time 'll have to check
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he
Apparently he likes you
And you like him, too
never thought about it
Your first lie to me, Clarice
How sad
Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually
True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes
scenarios, exchanges
Fucking you
That doesn't interest me, Doctor
And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask
Not anymore
(beat) Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice
Crawford dangles you before me
Then  give you a bit of help
Do you think it's because  like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste
don't know
Is it
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of
negotiation
There's something Crawford can give me, and  want to trade for it even wrote to him, offering my help
But he hates me, so he won't deal directly
Dr
Lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell
As his lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare
Gone are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat
She stands, too, startled
They face each other
Punishment, you see
For Miggs
Just like that gospel program
When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up
Chilton does enjoy his petty torments
Who killed Raspail, Doctor
You know, don't you
've been in this room for eight years, Clarice
know they will never, ever let me out while 'm alive
What  want is a view
want a window where  can see a tree, or even water
want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and want a view
'll give good value for it
Crawford could do that for me, but he won't
You persuade him
(almost a whisper) Who killed your patient
Oh, a very naughty boy
Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet
Buffalo Bill
(incredulous) Bill killed him, all those years ago
That's impossible
But Dr
Lecter only smiles, enigmatically
Who is he stalking right now, Clarice
wonder, don't you
How many more young women will have to die, before you trade with me
As Clarice stares at him, unsure how to respond - : '  - ,  - takes a long toke from a bong pipe
She is 21, a tall, big-boned, rather fleshy girl with long brown fair
Her head is on the lap of her boyfriend, ; they're sprawled on a couch in the den of her well-furnished apartment
The  in on, with low
This stuff's givin' me the munchies
Where's that bag of popcorn
Shit
Left the groceries in the car
He starts to rise, but she pushes him back
' okay, 'll go
She rises, goes out the front door
: -    - Catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting her car's back door
She sees, a short distance away - standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck
His right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck
Parked nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer
thin, breast- high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools
Catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man
Help you with that
Would you
Thanks
His voice is odd, strained, very soft
fog lamp, set on end on the ground, distorts his features from below
We can't get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above average height; he's in his mid 30's
She sets down the bag, then together they easily lift the chair into the truck
(
) Let's slide it up, you mind
: - He climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, and grabs the chair
She hesitates again, but climbs in after him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats
Are you about a size 14
(surprised) What
Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of her head with his cast
She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding off the armchair to lie on her stomach
He pulls off his cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut
He bends over her face with the lamp
We hear her shallow
Good
He peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size tag
Good
He carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves
There's no bra strap
He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily
Gooood
: - -  - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse is tossed out beside it
of the truck's motor starting
The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, partly squashing it
Then is drives away, taillights shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag
: -  - a large video screen, where a  image gradually sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric
(
) Electron microscopy reveals fiber "signatures" that are nearly as distinct as fingerprints
Clarice sits at a long table, with other trainees
Ardelia is beside her
Other tables and students in the background
Each trainee has his own microscope
Clarice is tired, but straightens, hearing - (
) Both of these blouses were worn by victims of Buffalo Bill
They were found in two different states, and four months apart
He always slits them up the back, like a funeral suit
successively   of the cut fabric edges, until we are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs
The cuts match
(
) The bunching you see - this compression - is characteristic of scissor cuts, rather than a single blade
And, as you see - Bill always uses the same pair
as John Brigham, the gunnery instructor, sticks his head in
Clarice Starling
Are you in here
: -   - Clarice and Brigham walk briskly down the hall, passing other trainees
He carries a small canvas bag
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight
You're goin' with Crawford
Where
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body
It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation
Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater
Think you can handle it
(thinking quickly) 'll need the big fingerprint kit
and the one-to-one Polaroid, the - 5, with film packs and batteries
: '   -  () Brigham steers as they pass hangars, parked planes, an airstrip
Clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend bag
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he
Impatient
Sometimes
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill
His wife, Bella, is real sick
Comatose
'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never
Clarice absorbs this in silence as they stop near an ancient, rather dilapidated Beechcraft
Its door is open, the twin props and beacons already turning
Brigham turns to her, holding out his small canvas bag
You're goin' in the field, so you gotta have full kit
Take this - it's my own
Clarice opens the bag, stares at the big blue gun nestled in its shoulder holster
She looks up at him, touched
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse
Dry fire it whenever you get the chance
And do your exercises
will
promise
Listen,  hope you never need a thing 've taught you
But you've got something
Jack sees it,  do too
If you ever need to, you can shoot
She nods, climbs out
Then she looks back in at him
They're both moved by this rite of passage, but a little embarrassed
Bless you, Starling
: -  () '  - Out the plane's window, at the landscape far below
Wisps of cloud, a quilt of farms
Clarice turns from the window, looks at a think folder in her lap
The cover reads "Case File: /
" Clarice is moody, distracted
She hesitates, then opens the file, begins to scan
- Police forms, some handwritten
Typed lab reports; we catch words, phrases: "Autopsy Protocols", "Histamine Analysis"
Grainy enlargements of bullet slugs, showing matched grooves
And then a stack of victim photos
The first one, taken from a good distance away, shows a nude female body, face down on a pebbly riverbank, surrounded by bits of litter
Clarice hesitates again, then flips this photo to look at the next
It makes her flinch, just slightly
Quickly she turns through several more photographs, trying hard to concentrate
(
) He keeps them alive for three days
shows Crawford standing over her, swaying with the plane's motion
Behind him, the open cockpit door, the pilot's back
Crawford sits, removing sunglasses
He rubs his eyes
Why, we don't yet know
There's no evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death
All the mutilation you see there is post-mortem
(a beat; he glances at her) 'm hot, are you hot
Bobby, it's too damned hot back here
The pilot adjusts a valve
Crawford turns to her again
So
Three days
Then he shoots them, skins them - usually just the torsos - and dumps them
Each body in a different river, in a different state, downstream from an interstate highway
The water leaves us no fingerprints, fibers,  fluids - no trace evidence at all
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one
-  ' shows a pretty, plump-cheeked brunette, in her high school graduation cap and gown
She smiles at us with touching optimism
(
) big girl, like all the rest
Went about 160
Her corpse was the only one he took the trouble to weight down, so actually, she was the third girl found
After her, he got lazy
as Clarice stares at the girl's face, moved
Crawford pulls a map from the file, spreads it out
It shows the central and eastern
, with widely-spaced, hand-drawn markings
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted
Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri
Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors
This new one, today
washed up here
(he marks with a Flair pen) Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below
79
Real boonies
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found
(he shakes his head) What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites
Do they converge at all
Good idea, but he thought of it, too
We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign
You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out
No, this one is different
This one has seen us coming
: -  () Crawford steers, following a highway patrol car along a winding mountain road
Clarice has the file open on her lap
He glances at her, inscrutable behind his sunglasses
Talk about him, Starling
Tell me what you see
(choosing her words carefully) He's a white male
Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group
And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere
Not an apartment
Why
What he does with them - takes privacy
Time, tools
He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control
He's cautious, precise, never impulsive
This won't end in suicide, like they often do
Why not
He's got a real taste for it now
And he's getting better at his work
(a beat; impressed) Maybe you've got a knack for this
guess we're about to find out
(quietly, evenly) Like  have a "knack" for Dr
Lecter
He studies her a few moments, measuring her anger
Okay, Starling
Let's have it
You haven't said a word today about that garage
Or what  found there
What should  say
You did fine work
We'll wait on the lab
You knew
You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this
But you weren't up front with me
You sent me in to him naked
(beat) Are you finished
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head
He makes me feel violated
You used me, Mr
Crawford
shadow of regret passes over his face, but he answers sternly
Number One
Maybe there's a connection, maybe not
Lying and breathing are the same thing to Lecter
Number Two
If 'd sent you in there with something to hide from him, he'd have known it, instantly
He'd never have trusted you
She starts to answer, then is silent
He is right
By now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree- lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in the background
They slow, turn
Number Three,  didn't bring you along today just because you can do first-rate forensics
If Lecter is becoming part of this case, you've got the most current read on him
And Number Four - you don't have to like me, or the way  do things
But you do have to keep a cool head
Especially now
Because from here on out, you'll know everything  do
Are we straight on that
Clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's likely to get
She stares out the windshield
the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other police cars, facing a big white frame house
Its sign reads "Potter Funeral Home
" Two troopers climb from the car
Crawford parks too, then kills the engine
He turns to her, removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file
(softly) You think about him long enough, you get a feel for him
Then, if you're lucky, out of all the stuff you know, one little part of it tugs at you, tries to get your attention
You let me know when that happens, Starling
Live right behind your eyes, today
Don't try to impose any patterns on this guy
Just stay open and let him show you
One of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, peers in through Crawford's window
Crawford nods to him, then turns back to Clarice
School's out, Starling
: - ,
- of organ music, as Clarice, carrying her fingerprint kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk
She stops, seeing - in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service
The music - "Shall We Gather At The River
" - is issuing from the open double doors
Several of the mourners glance over at her curiously
staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense memory is triggered in her
-  , as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open wooden coffin
Sad country faces turn, looking at us from the flanking pews
The b
g
organ hymn is "Shall We Gather
" , 10 - in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket
Her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons
' on the looming coffin
closer and closer
until finally she can see, lying inside it
her dead father, arms folded, his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel
(
) Starling
( ) as the grownup Clarice turns towards the impatient Crawford
Like her, he carries a large case
We're around back
: -   - young deputy, several state troopers, and a  are all waiting, as Crawford and Clarice enter
The dim, cluttered corridor doubles as storage space - there's a treadle sewing machine, a soft-drink machine, a tricycle
The  is closer
Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff
Sheriff Perkins
Jack Crawford,
This is Officer Starling
We appreciate your phoning us
(grim, unsociable) didn't call you
That was somebody from the state attorney's office
'For you do a thing else, 'm gon' find out if this girl's local
It could just be somethin' that outside elements has dumped on us
He casts a sidelong, unhappy glance at Clarice
Well sir, that's where we can help
If - don't even know you, Mister
Now we'll extend you ever courtesy, just soon as we can, but for right now - Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex crime has some aspects 'd rather discuss just between the two of us
Know what  mean
He indicates Clarice with his eyes
The sheriff hesitates, nods, then lets Crawford guide him into a small office, closing the door behind them
Muffled  from there
burning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who peek at her with shy curiosity
She pulls her blazer a bit tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster
as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge
The sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy
Oscar, run fetch Dr
Akin from the chapel
And tell Lamar to come on when he's done playin' that music
: - Crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a Litton Policefax fingerprint transmitter
of many men's low voices, in background
He is on the phone, and has to speak loudly
need a six-way linkup
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St
Louis, Atlanta, and Dallas
What
Can you hear me
He looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere
is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves
She raises her voice, turning up her natural accent by several notches
Gentlemen
You officers and gentlemen
Listen here a minute, please
There's things  need to do for her
as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies and troopers
They gradually fall silent, looking at her
(
) 'all brought her this far, and know her folks would thank you if they could
Now please - go on out and let me take care of her
Go on, now
The men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin to to file out, whispering among themselves
As they go, a bright green body bag is , tightly zipped, lying on a porcelain embalming table
It is almost the only modern object in this Victorian room, with its glass-paned cabinets and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses
as he looks at Clarice with a new degree of respect
Men brush by him, till finally only two are left:
, a family g
p
, and , a lean, whiskey-reddened mortician
of the door closing
Lamar dabs around his nostrils with Vicks VapoRub
(on phone) We're starting
Tell everybody to stand by for fingerprint transmission
at a side counter, has turned back to her open fingerprint kit
She is lifting out a camera when she hears the of the body bag being slowly opened, behind her
One gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts, involuntarily, to the sudden smell
She blinks at her reflection in the cabinet glass, then steels herself to turn, look at the corpse
(pause; softly) Bill
She steadies herself by raising her camera, takes a photo
-  , as Dr
Akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girl's arms
piece of fishing line, with multiple hooks, is still snagged around it, dangling
Crawford leans in for a closer look
Wrongful death
She'll have to go to the state pathologist at Claxton when you're done
(Crawford nods) better - get on back for the rest of that service
Lamar'll help you
(shaken) Lord almighty
He leaves, and Clarice leans  , taking another photo
What do you see, Starling
Well, she's not local
Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish
Looks like town to me
on the calf of one of the girl's legs, as Clarice trails the inside of her bare wrist along the skin
(
) She waxed her legs,  think
big girl, just like the others - but she was careful about her appearance
as Lamar joins them for a closer look
Two of the fingernails are broken off, and there's - dirt or grit under the others
She tried to claw her way through something
'll scrape out samples after 've printed her
She takes another , then quickly reloads film
Them fishhooks are set too close together
No wonder the Franklin boys was scared to say they found her
Think they were runnin' a trotline
Crawford and Lamar both look at her curiously
(to Crawford) It's a Fish and Game violation
Like poaching
There's a big fine
Right
Are you from around here
They do it lots of places
Get photos of her teeth
Then we'll fax her fingerprints to Washington, try to trace her through Missing Persons
-     ' staring blue eyes, short reddish hair
Clarice sets the Polaroid, with its special attachments, against the face, while Lamar gently retracts the lips
Each time the camera , there's a bright glow inside the cheeks
- as Clarice examines a developing print
She's got something in her throat
She hands the print to Crawford; he and Lamar look at it, as she searches in her kit
When a body comes out of the water, alots of times there's like, leaves and things in the mouth
Clarice holds up a pair of forceps
She glances at Crawford, who nods
She bends over, partially   , and after a few moments reappears, holding up a small, brown cylindrical object
She turns this in the air, as they all stare
What is it - some kind of seed pod
Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon
But how come that to get way down in there
'Less somebody shoved it in
Clarice and Crawford exchange a glance
She'll be easier to print if we turn her over
Lamar, will you give me a hand
Yessir,  will
Clarice takes a jar from her kit, carefully drops the cocoon inside
of the men's heavy efforts as they turn over the body, off screen
She seals the jar, staring into it at the cocoon
(
) Starling - what do you make of these
She turns to look
low on the corpse's back, over the shoulders, two neat, triangular patches of skin are missing
- as Clarice looks at Crawford
don't know
didn't see those on any of the other girls
They weren't there
Get close-ups
Clarice raises her camera, leans in for another
: - Clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained
She looks up wanly as Lamar appears, offers her a can of Coke
Thanks, 'm not thirsty
No, hold it under your chin, there, and on your temples
Cold'll make you feel better
It does me
She smiles, touched, and takes the can
When Lamar sees Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs
Crawford sits beside her; there's a brief silence
She soothes herself with the can
When  told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it
(she is silent) That was just smoke, Starling,  had to get rid of him
You did well in there
It matters, Mr
Crawford
Other cops know who you are
They look at you to see how to act
It matters
(beat) Point taken
She looks at him a moment, then offers the can
He opens it
When we get back,  want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it
Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year
You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit
'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect
It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater
Can we check back on that
(shakes his head) The other girls are in the ground
Exhumations are upsetting for the families
'll do it if  have to, but - Then have the lab check Raspail's head
(he looks at her) Dr
Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues
They'll find another cocoon
You seem pretty sure of that
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls
And Lecter knows him
Maybe even treated him
You think so, too, don't you
Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum
He looks at her for a moment, then sips again
Before we caught him, Lecter had a big psychiatric practice in Baltimore
But he traveled all over the country - teaching, consulting
Christ, even testifying in murder trials
Who knows how many potential psychos he turned loose, just for the fun of it
: '  -  ( ) shadowy male figure looks down at us, leaning over the edge of a deep hole
He holds a little white poodle in his arms, stroking it
This is
, aka "Buffalo Bill
" (softly) Rub the cream on your skin
Rub it in gooood
looks up at him
She is standing on the cement bottom of the pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level
The pit is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, from which a thin string rises up to the basement
She's soaking wet, in an orange jumpsuit, and holds a squeeze bottle of skin lotion
She struggles to sound calm
Mister
my family will pay cash
Whatever ransom you're askin' for, they - - Rub it in
Or you'll get the hose again
The little dog squirms in his arms,  excitedly
Yes, it will, Precious, won't it
It will get the hose
- as Catherine kneels, turning slightly away from him
(under her breath) Oh God
oh God
She unzips her jumpsuit, part-way, then squeezes some of the lotion onto a palm
She reaches inside her suit, rubs it on
Mister, if you let me go,  won't press charges,  promise
You've only had me here a couple days, and - (
) No
Just one day
Is that all
See - see, my mom is a real important woman
Well, guess you already know that
She'll pay you, no questions asked
Whatever cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - she'll see that - sudden blinding glare of light silences her
She looks up, shielding her eyes
a floodlamp is descending, attached to a small basket
Put the bottle in the basket
No funny business, or you'll be sorry
- as the basket stops, and she steadies it
But as she slips the bottle in, she sees something,
, just at the fringe of the light
She hesitates, looks closer
then begins to scream, hysterically, again and again
Her outflung hand hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see - high on the concrete walls, all around her - dried now, brownish - left by many pairs of frenzied hands
: '   -   - Clarice is at her desk, exercising her right hand with the grip flexer, while simultaneously studying a thick law book
Ardelia sticks her head in the door, excited
You better come see this
: -   - a  screen, filled with a photo of Catherine Martin
(
) was listed at first simply as a missing person, but is now believed to have been kidnapped by the serial killer known only as "Buffalo Bill
" The photo disappears, replaced by the   himself
Memphis Police sources indicate that the missing girl's blouse has been identified, sliced up the back, in what has become a kind of grim calling card
Young Catherine Martin, as we've said, is the only daughter of Senator Ruth Martin - looks at Ardelia, surprised
Other trainees are drifting into the rec room, some whispering among themselves
Clarice stares back at the  intently
(
) the Republican junior senator from Tennessee
And while her kidnapping is not at this point considered to be politically motivated, nevertheless it has stirred the government - to its highest levels, the president himself being said to be, and  quote, "intensely concerned
" Just moments ago, Senator Martin made this dramatic personal plea
( ) fills the screen, in a halo of lens flare, as she speaks to a jostling crowd of reporters on the front steps of her Georgetown home
tall woman, late 40's, with a strong, taut face
'm speaking now to the person who is holding my daughter
Her name is Catherine
You have the power to let Catherine go, unharmed
She's very gentle and kind - talk to her and you'll see
Her name is Catherine
Clarice is moved by what she sees
Other trainees are all around her
(whispers) Boy, is that smart
Why does she keep repeating the name
Somebody's coaching her
They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object
You have a chance to show the whole world that you can be merciful, as well as strong
Please -  beg you - release my Catherine
as we see (, ) - a taped-off section of Catherine's parking lot
Technicians, with instruments, are kneeling by the crushed grocery bag
2ND   (
) Meanwhile
in Memphis, the investigation continued throughout the night, as state and local authorities were joined at the kidnap scene by agents of the
(  ) as Jack Crawford is seen striding towards the front door of Catherine's apartment, followed by Burroughs and other agents
One of them moves quickly towards the , waving it back
- as the other trainees send up a brief, ironic cheer
But Ardelia turns sympathetically towards the troubled Clarice
don't know whether to say "'m sorry," or "Congratulations
" But girl
- you just went prime time
: -     - The massive Victorian building looms over Constitution Avenue
Clarice quickly mounts the steps, carrying a small plastic box
don't think he knew that she's a Senator's child
She's a big girl, Starling, like all the rest
We're going on the theory she was randomly targeted by size
: - Clarice, now accompanied by a museum guard, walks through an eerie landscape of dinosaur bones - crouching skeletons with blank eye sockets, gaping fangs
(
) By now, Bill's had her for 36 hours
That leaves us just 36 more, before he kills her
But maybe, just maybe, Starling, we caught a real break this time - thanks to you
(beat) We found another bug, in Raspail's head
: - an live, enormous, rhinoceros beetle, as it weaves its clumsy way among the men on a chessboard, before finally stepping off the edge, onto a lettuce leaf
(
) Time, Pilch
My move
(
) No fair
You lured him with produce
shows two entomologists, both 30ish, hunched over the board
is a pudgy redhead;  is lean, quite handsome
Tough noogies
It's still my turn
(
) If the beetle moves one of your men, does that count
They look up, delighted to see Clarice in the doorway
Both men are hopelessly smitten by her
Of course it counts
How do you play
(grins) Officer Starling
Welcome back
: - as Clarice and the two men go briskly down a hall lined with mounted insects, in all shapes and sizes
Roden peers at Clarice's new cocoon, in its box
Where the hell did this one come from
It's practically mush
You really don't want to know
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but  finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin
'm the one who found his perforating proboscis
Are you wearing a gun, right now
(Clarice nods) Ooh, cool
Can  see it
Can
Just ignore him
He's not a Ph

) The whole trick is to remove the chrysalis without destroying it
The wings are just like wet tissue paper
are hunched over a formica table, peering through square magnifiers into stainless trays
Clarice watches curiously
Of their two specimens, Pilcher's moth is in much better condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on towel paper
(without looking up) What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling
try to be a student, Dr
Pilcher
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer
The amusing house wine
(smiles) Not lately
But maybe someday
He looks up at her, shyly
little moment passes between them, before Roden straightens, exultant
Positive match
You're sure
(points with his dental probe) West Virginia
Baltimore
Officer Starling, meet Mister Acherontia Styx
He moves aside for Clarice to get a closer look at Pilcher's specimen
She leans forward, intently
() the wide, furry, brown back of the moth
And there, right between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull
(
) Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth
(
) The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell
Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time
Didn't read that
as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies
(shakes his head) They live in Malaysia
In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs
(pause, then softly) Dr
Lecter
As the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a   - the wail of police  - and
: 95 -  ( ) An awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an intersection, while normal traffic is held back by highway patrol cruisers
The lead cars turn off, hit the entrance ramp to the freeway - going, tires , red flashers
on a speeding surveillance van, with long antennas and a small satellite dish, near the head of the motorcade
(
) Maybe we can trace how he buys the bugs, starting with
Customs
: -  () The van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech equipment, all  and
Burroughs is talking quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a computer
(
) Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's old lovers
Maybe, someday
sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window
Clarice can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter
You're the one he talks to
He's already offered to help
What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch
That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off
Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun
Never forget fun
But if he knew we have so little time - If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait
He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up
That'd be the most fun of all
think he means it, this time think he'll deal
What would it take
Transfer to a new prison
With a view of trees, he said, or even water
Can we swing that
(shakes his head) State to federal jurisdiction
We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time
Can you convince him a deal's already in place
You'll back me up with some paperwork
(he nods) Then 'll try
But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself
(hesitates) She doesn't know what we're up to
And we can't afford to let her find out
Clarice looks at him, surprised
She's the mother, Starling
She can't possibly comprehend what Lecter is
She'd make the mistake of pleading with him
Begging him
He'd feast on her pain till the last second of that girl's life
: - Chilton approaches, walking briskly down a corridor in the administration wing
He looks quite agitated
(
) We can't trust Frederick Chilton, either
He's greedy and ambitious
If he knew about Lecter's link to Bill, he's go straight to the newspapers
Chilton falls into step beside Clarice, who has her briefcase
He points his gold pen at her accusingly
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me
For the third time
Dr
Chilton,  told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case
He's my patient
have rights
(grabs her arm, stopping her) 'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling
shouldn't even be here this afternoon
had a ticket to Holiday on Ice
She stares at him, with pity and distaste, till he lets go
'm acting on instruction, Dr
Chilton
(handing him a card) This is the
Attorney's number
Now please - either discuss this with him, or let me do my job
She walks away, leaving him speechless with frustration and hostility
He clicks his pen, watching her go
: '    - Dr
Lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with charcoal on butcher paper
He uses his own hand and forearm as a model
His other drawings, books, and bedding have been restored
Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for a United States Senator, you're an odd choice of messenger
Clarice, sitting again at the desk-chair, is taking papers from her briefcase
was your choice, Dr
Lecter
You chose to speak to me
Would you prefer someone else now
Or perhaps you don't think you can help us
That is both impudent and untrue
Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort
(beat; he smiles) Or should  say, his "next-to-latest"
By the book, he's a sadist
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice
Typhoid and swans came from the same God
(beat) Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl
Yes
Big through the hips
Roomy
They all were
Mmm
And what else
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat
That hasn't been made public yet
We don't know what is means
Was it a butterfly
(pause; staring at him) moth
How did you predict that
'm waiting for your offer, Clarice
Enchant me
Clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect her thoughts
She looks up at him again, evenly
If you help us find Buffalo Bill in time to save Catherine Martin, the Senator promises you a transfer to the
hospital at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby
Maximum security still applies, but you'd have reasonable access to books
He is silent
She rises, moves closer, carrying papers
Best of all, though - one week a year you'd get to leave the hospital and go here
(points to a map) Plum Island
Every afternoon of that week you can walk on the beach or swim in the ocean for up to one hour
Under  team surveillance, of course
His face remains neutral
She puts the papers in his food tray
Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, copy of Senator Martin's terms
Her offer is final and non-negotiable
If Catherine dies - (she slides his tray through) You get nothing
measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks down at the papers, without touching them
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center
" Sounds charming
That's just part of the island
It has a very nice beach
Terns nest there
Terns
If  help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too
Quid pro quo
tell you things, you tell me things
Not about this case, though - about yourself
Yes or no
(she is silent) Yes or no, Clarice
Catherine is waiting
Tick-tock, tick-tock
She looks at him
beat
They are standing uncomfortably close
Go, Doctor
What's your worst memory of childhood
(she hesitates) Quicker than that
'm not interested in your worst invention
The death of my father
Tell me
Don't lie, or 'll know
Clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes
She looks past him, hesitating again
He was a town marshal
one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore
They shot him
Killed outright
No
He was strong, he lasted almost a month
My mother - died when  was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me
After he left me,  had nobody
was ten years old
You're very frank, Clarice
think - it would be quite something to know you in private life
Quid pro quo, Doctor
The significance of the moth is change
Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty
Billy wants to change, too, Clarice
But there's the problem of his size, you see
Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one
(puzzled) Dr
Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence
Transsexuals are very passive
Clever girl
You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that
No
Tell me why
After your father's death, you were orphaned
What happened next
(Clarice drops her gaze) don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice
went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana
They had a ranch
cattle ranch
Horses - and sheep
How long did you live there
Two months
Why so briefly
- ran away
Why, Clarice
Did the rancher fuck you
(angrily) No
Did he try to
No
Quid pro quo, Doctor
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is
He tries to be
He's tried to be a lot of things, expect
You said -  was very close to the way we'd catch him
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center
wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected
On what basis would they reject him
The personality inventories would trip him up
Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person
He wouldn't test like a real transsexual
How would he test
Suddenly Dr
Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching
Clarice take a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement into an elaborate yawn
He gathers the papers from his tray
That's enough,  think
Happy hunting
Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away
Shall summarize
(shaken) Yes, Doctor
Please
: '  - a cocoon, split along its back, as a living Death's-head Moth wriggles torturously free
Trembling and damp, the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade
(
) You should try to obtain a list of males rejected from all three gender reassignment centers
we see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths
They crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings pumping lazily
In the distant background, the incongruous of show music
(
) Check first the ones rejected for lying about criminal records
at about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar
As we go - occasionally  corners, or skirting the dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom briefly  , overhead - a stainless-steel work table
a big sink
jars of chemicals
neat racks of gleaming knives
(
) Among those who tried to conceal their past, look for severe childhood disturbances, associated with violence
Possibly you'll find a childhood incarceration
Then go to their personality tests
We pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various stages of completion
then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar
The jaunty background
is growing even louder: Fats Waller singing "Bye Bye Baby
" And now we hear something else, too - the rapid of a sewing machine
(
) Study their drawings, especially
Billy's house drawings will show no happy future
No baby carriage, out in the yard
No pets, no toys, no flowers, no sun
We  another corner, and there is Mr
Gumb himself
As we , his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old- fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a piece of material that we mercifully cannot see
female wig rests near him on a head form
He wears a hairnet and a beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet
(
) His females will be more crudely sketched than him males - but he'll compensate by adding exaggerated adornments
jewelry, big breasts
And his tree drawings - oh, his trees will be frightful
Next to Mr
Gumb is an antique phonograph - source of the His little dog, Precious, perches by his plump ankles
As we  Mr
Gumb, Precious scurries away from him, panting happily, and we  the little dog down another corridor, the music starting to fade behind us
(
) Billy hates his own identity, he always has - and he thinks that makes him a transsexual
But his pathology is a thousand times more savage
He wants to be reborn, Clarice
He will be reborn
At the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette
Precious sniffs her way over to the edge - excited, tail wagging - than  happily as we hear a hoarse, ghostly moan from below
(
) Pleeeeeeeease
: '  - -   Dr
Lecter's slippered feet, which rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck
along his tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel restraints
his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are bound by heavy canvas webbing
beneath the webbing is a strait-jacket
and over his face is a hockey mask
(
) Bad news, Hannibal
shows that Dr
Lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed down his corridor by Barney, and back into his open cell
(
) Gourmet magazine has rejected your recipe for braised kidneys
: '  - Chilton lounges on Dr
Lecter's cot, casually reading his large stack of private correspondence, and making notations with his gold pen on a little pad
Another orderly mops the floor
Perhaps you should have been less specific about what kind
(to Barney) Stand him by the toilet
Then leave us
Barney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies go
Chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily
Such a lot of correspondence
can hardly wait to analyze it in more detail
But first things first
Tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from underneath Clarice's desk
He waggles it triumphantly at Dr
Lecter
thought she might be looking for a civil rights violation in Migg's death, so  bugged you
Not a word to me in all these years, Hannibal
Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff over here, and you just turn to jelly
It's too pathetic
- as Chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the front of Dr
Lecter's mask
You still think you're going to walk on some beach, and see the birdies
don't think so, Hannibal
called Senator Ruth Martin, and she never heard of any deal with you
She never heard of Clarice Starling, either
They scammed you, Hannibal
Dr
Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits
When Crawford gets through milking you, he's giving you to Baltimore Homicide for the Raspail murder
And they're preparing some special surprises for you right now, in my electroshock room
'  (  -) first looking at Chilton's moving lips
then  to his soft, white, inviting throat
The Starling bitch wants you to rot here, in this little box, till your teeth fall out and you're soiling diapers
You've seen the old ones, Hannibal
They weep when their stewed peaches get cold
That'll be you, too
Unless - you trade with me
as he sits chummily on the table
There never was a deal with Senator Martin - but there is now
've been on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on your behalf
Here's what you get: if you identify Buffalo Bill, and the girl is found in time, Senator Martin will have you transferred to Brushy Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee
' as they shift restlessly, away from Chilton - then suddenly lock onto something
They widen with interest
(
) The Governor has already agreed
You get books, a view of the woods, and plenty of exercise time
'  - On the cot, carelessly left there, lying half-hidden under the letters and the rumpled sheet
is Chilton's gold pen
(
) And best of all, you'd be out of Jack Crawford's reach, forever
The Senator will verify these terms on the phone, and guarantee them in writing
as he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his eyes towards Chilton
We can almost hear his brain clicking
(
) In exchange,  get your full cooperation in publishing a professional account of this - my successful interviews with you
You publish nothing
And  get exclusive access to any material from Catherine Martin
So
Do you accept my demands
(pause) Answer me, Hannibal
beat
Dr
Lecter is silent
Chilton sticks his face , almost intimately close to the mask
He is agitated
You'll answer me now, or by God, you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide
Who is Buffalo Bill
(pause; then softly) 'll tell the Senator herself
But only in Tennessee
: -    - - as the very impatient Crawford, clutching a folder, strides down a hall beside
- early 50's, severe, in a lab coat
Nurses, doctors, glance as they pass
'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr
Crawford
Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem
Dr
Danielson, the man we want was never your patient
It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence
Please, Doctor - time is eating us up
Just show me the ones you've turned away
Danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, with Crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee
(adamantly) Examination and interview materials are confidential
We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will
You want to see a violation
This is a violation
He takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it down in front of Danielson
From our angle, we can't see it clearly
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just 'd
met her on a slab in West Virginia
And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr
Crawford
was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture
Burroughs sticks his head in, looking for Crawford
Phone, Jack
Director Burke
(snaps) In a minute
Burroughs hurriedly retreats
Crawford strains for patience
Look
search your own records, if you prefer
You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway
If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, 'll suppress it
Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated
doubt very much that the  or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr
Crawford
Truth will out
And then what
Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity
Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose
Oh, that's clever, Dr
Danielson
Very humorous
You like the truth
Try this
(right in his face, enraged) He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off
We don't want him to do that anymore
If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news
And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr
Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation
And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr
Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks
(pause; stiffly) It may be that -  could confer with my colleagues on this
And get back to you
Would you, Doctor
That would be so kind
: - Crawford is on the scrambler phone
Burroughs watches silently
(on phone; stunned) Transferred
: -     - , the  Director, swivels in his big chair
Lean, late 40's, very distinguished
His desk is flanked by flags
(on phone) Already airborne for Memphis
Senator Martin's meeting him at the airport
(uneasily) Jack - did you make some sort of promise to Lecter, in the Senator's name
Listening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his desk at  , the Deputy Attorney General - 40, very tanned, modish haircut
Krendler is irritable, impatient
(on phone) We're going to have to talk about this, Jack
The Senator's mad as hell
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice, she's asking him to take charge in Memphis
know that
But you're still in command of the task force, and Lecter's plane can still be ordered back
It's your call, Jack - but  want it now
: - Burroughs starts to make an objection, but Crawford stills him with a hand motion
He is taut, frustrated
Long pause
(into phone) Let him land
: '   -  - Clarice opens her door, stares out at Crawford
She's just slipping on her blazer, over her shoulder holster
She's furious
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he
That slimy little bastard
We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone
Let's get some coffee and talk
: -  - on Clarice and Crawford, as they walk along a sidewalk, sipping from paper cups
The surveillance van trails them slowly, radios
Are you in trouble over this, Mr
Crawford
Can Senator Martin do something to you
'm 53, Starling
If  found Jimmy Hoffa on national , 'd still have to retire in two years
It's not a consideration
But you are
(beat) You've done enough
If  keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled
Cost you six months, at least
can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it
(he stops, looks at her) Now's your chance, Starling
Go back to class
Leave Bill to me
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home
He looks at her steadily, then nods
They walk on
Lecter is still the key,  know he is
Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before
Or just as worthless
But  want you in Memphis, close to him
Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again
There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip
She smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's quit
lied to Lecter
'll need some kind of peace offering
Can  get the drawings from his cell
Good idea
Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin
Her apartment, her friends
how he might've stalked her
'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio
(he crumples his cup, tosses it) Now's the hardest part, Starling
Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking
Just keep your eyes on Catherine
We've got less than 30 hours
(hesitates) Mr
Crawford
can those cops down there handle Dr
Lecter
(grimly) They'll use their best men
But they better be paying attention
: - ,  - Dr
Lecter
Behind his mask, the alert, searching eyes
(
) He will
two sturdy, well-armed, veteran prison guards - are checking Dr
Lecter's restraints with clever, careful fingers
Welcome to Memphis, Dr
Lecter
'm Officer Boyle, this is Officer Pembry
We aim to treat you just as nice as you treat us
Act like a gentlemen, you'll get three hots and a cot
But we ain't pussy-footin' with you, buddy ruff
You get cute, try to bite somebody
- we'll tie your asshole in a knot
You savvy
Oh yes, Officer Pembry
certainly do
The officers turn away, Boyle signing a clipboarded form
(under his breath) Shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick
Won't be no trouble as all if he don't flip out
Dr
Chilton
- as we see that we're in a vast, dusty hangar
Parked to one side: an  ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers; a dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there
Prentiss is pacing impatiently, casting anxious glances towards the open hanger doorway
If you'll please sign right here, sir, we'll have us a legal transfer
Chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold pen; it's gone
He searches other pockets, with growing unhappiness
Use mine
Here they come
glide smoothly into the hangar, stop
Secret Service agents pour out of the lead car, form a cordon
driver opens the rear door of the second car, and Krendler steps out, followed by the Senator's assistant, with a briefcase, followed, as last, by the Senator herself
Barely glancing around, she strides towards Lecter
- as she stops, struck by the bizarre spectacle of his restraints
The others instinctively keep a distance, but Chilton, with theatrical relish, unstraps and removes Dr
Lecter's mask
Senator Martin, meet Dr
Hannibal Lecter
They stare at one another for a long moment: the Senator tense, almost haggard, the madman with his unearthly poise
Dr
Lecter, 've brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights
You'll want to read it before  sign
He assistant unsnaps his briefcase, reaches for the form
won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already
only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl
Let me help you now, and 'll trust you when it's all over
You have my word
Paul
Krendler raises a pad, poised to take notes
Buffalo Bill's real name is William Rubin
met him just once
He was referred to me in April or May, 1980, by my patient Benjamin Raspail
They were lovers, but Raspail had become very frightened
Apparently Rubin had murdered a transient, and - done things with the skin
He thought if could cure Billy, then Billy'd be safe from the police, and he's be safe from Billy
Obviously, he was wrong
We need his address, a physical descr- Did you nurse Catherine
(pause; startled) What
Did you breast-feed her
He flicks his tongue obscenely
You son-of-a - The Senator stills him with a hand
She is trembling
Yes
did
Toughened your nipples, didn't it
(a beat; then rapidly, bored) Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds
Hair brown, eyes pale blue
He'd be about 35 now
He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied
That's really all  can remember, Senator - but if  think of any more, 'll let you know
(to the others) Let's go with it
They start towards the car, but he calls out, stopping her
Senator Martin
You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling
It's such a game with these people
They're determined to get the arrest for themselves
The "collar,"  think they say
Thank you, Doctor
'll keep it in mind
Oh, and Senator
Love you suit
: '  -  ( ) scraps of food - peas, chicken bones - lying on the cement floor of the pit, near the foil tray of a  dinner
(
) (muttering, feisty) Close enough to fuck is close enough to fight
is hunched over in concentration
The plastic toilet bucket is on her lap, and she has yanked down its cotton string
Get my legs round your neck, you goddamn creep, 'll send you home to Jesus
are tying a chicken bone to the bucket's handle, where it meets the string
The other end of the string is tied to her wrist
gathers the coiled string in one hand, and swings the bucket by its handle, calculating this distance up to the basement floor
Okay, Precious
Time for a treat
She hurls the bucket upwards
the bucket sails out, bounces , then falls back inside
, who is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy
She cocks an ear, making a low , then sets off to investigate
Catherine swings the bucket again, trying another cast
two feet beyond the pit's edge, rolls a bit, stops
then pauses, staring curiously towards
(' ) the enticing chicken bone, six feet away
It twitches as Catherine tugs on the string, edging the bucket back towards the pit
Precious with her tail wagging,  - greedy but suspicious
staring upwards, pulls again, even so gently, at the string
(softly) Preeeeecious
'mon, boy, nice yummy bone
c'mon, you little shit
edges reluctantly closer
then suddenly rushes in, seizing the bone in her teeth
She tries to run away with it, but Catherine is pulling her towards the hole, working her like a hooked fish
Her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop
stares desperately, unable to see how she's doing
Hang on, boy
hang on
still fights for the bone, , as the bucket rocks precariously on the edge of the pit
long, seesaw battle
until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily into the hole, she panics and lets go
The bucket flops over the edge
crouches, covering her head as the bucket bounces off her
Nooooo
furious,  down at her, then trots away in disgust
as she sinks to the cold cement
She slaps aside the foil tray, the scraps of food, sobbing in utter despair
: '  -   - a framed photo of Sen
Martin and Catherine, held in Clarice's cotton-gloved hands
Powdered fingerprints on the glass
Clarice glances up from the photo, smiles disarmingly at - young   sitting in Catherine's easy chair
He smiles back at her, then relaxes, returns to his newspaper
He also wears gloves
: Clarice closes the refrigerator door, glances around
big --   has been set up on the breakfast counter, attached to Catherine's phone
Two new red phones are hooked up as well
: Clarice slides open the medicine cabinet's mirror, looks inside
She reaches in, pokes carefully amongst the lotions
: - ceiling hatch bangs open, sending up dust clouds
Clarice, lit from underneath, pokes her head through, looking around
: Flat on her back, Clarice wriggles out from under Catherine's bed
She sits up, brushing dust from her face and hair
: an open, multi-tiered jewelry box, resting atop a bureau, as Clarice's fingers pick through costume jewelry
Clarice closes the box, and is just turning away when a figure suddenly looms  , giving her a bad start; she cries out softly
Senator Martin is revealed, staring at her suspiciously
Who are you, please
thought the police were through in here
'm Clarice Starling, Senator
(softly, very angry) Clarice Starling
(calls out) Paul
Would you come in here, please
Krendler enters from the hallway, looks at Clarice
Miss Starling, you may know the Deputy Attorney General, Mr
Krendler
Paul, this is the trainee that Jack Crawford sent to Lecter
She lied to him, pretending to have my authority, and thus jeopardized this entire investigation
Now she has the further gall to invade my daughter's privacy, again without permission
If her little games have killed my baby
Overcome, she hurries from the room
Krendler shuts the door behind her, points sternly at Clarice
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case
Back to Quantico
Sir, Mr
Crawford instructed me - Your instructions are what 'm giving you now
Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me
My God, Crawford's losing it
He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is
How the hell did you get in here, anyway
He gave you - what
Some kind of special
Let's have it

The gun belongs in Quantico

Jesus
Turn in the  as soon as you get back
The gun, too
Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes
Clarice, burning, starts for the door, then turns back
Mr
Krendler
Dr
Lecter trusts me
Or at least, he used to
If could just - Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill
Clarice reacts, surprised
Krendler takes a folded computer sheet from his pocket, shoves it at her
She takes it, reads
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either
He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer
The next plane, Officer
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as -  don't know - kind of vague
Krendler moves in very close to her, pale with anger
Do you need a police escort, Starling
Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself
Yes sir
can find it by myself
: - The old courthouse is a massive Gothic stronghold, with an armada of police cruisers parked at the curb
Clarice climbs from her rented car,  the door angrily
Holding a rolled-up pile of papers - Dr
Lecter's drawings - she starts determinedly up the steps
nearby commotion makes her pause
Dr
Frederick Chilton in a sea of interviewers and mini-cams, is preening grandly
Clarice carefully avoiding his gaze, slips up the steps and inside
: -   - , a Memphis policeman, is studying Clarice's
He looks up at her from his command desk, a bit doubtfully
Are you with Mr
Krendler's people
just left him
Access to Lecter is strictly limited
We've been getting death threats
(hesitates again) Log in, and check your weapon
He picks up a phone, murmurs into it
As he does so, Clarice glances around this main ground floor lobby
The building looks like an armed fort
Cops with shotguns guard the front door, both ends of the hall, the foot of the stairs, the single elevator
More of them are coming and going
(
) Shoot, we haven't had this kinda security since the President came through town
: - Clarice and  , a young patrolman, ride up in an old-fashioned, , metal-cage elevator
He is excited
Every cop in Tennessee wants a look at this guy
'Sit true what they're sayin' - he's some kinda vampire
(beat) don't have a name for what he is
: - 5TH Pembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining the unrolled pile of Dr
Lecter's drawings
You know the rules, ma'am
Yes, Officer Pembry
've questioned him before
He waves her on her way, but retains the drawings for now
- as she crosses the big, spare, white octagonal room massive, temporary iron cage has been installed; Officer Boyle sits facing its barred door
He rises, nods, moving away to allow her privacy
a cot and a small table, each bolted to the floor, and a flimsy paper screen, hiding a toilet
Dr
Lecter sits at the table, his back to her, studying the Buffalo Bill case file
He now wears a green prison jumpsuit
small cassette player is chained to the steel table
(without turning) Good afternoon, Clarice
She stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars
thought you might want your drawings back
Just until you get your view
How very thoughtful
Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case
Nobody sent me
came on my own
He spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly
coy smile
People will say we're in love
(beat) Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it
Pity for poor Catherine
Tick-tock
He spins again in his chair, playfully
- as she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight
Dr
Lecter, you find out everything
You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him
You made him up, didn't you
Clarice
you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying
think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to
Tell me the rest now
've studied the case file, have you
Everything you need to find him is right in these pages
Whatever his name is
Then tell me how
First principles, Clarice
Simplicity
Read Marcus Aurelius
Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature
What does he do, this man you seek
He kills w- (sharply, as he stops) No
That's incidental
-   as he rises, pained by her ignorance, and crosses to the bars
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus- No, he covets
That's his nature
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice
Do we seek out things to covet
Make an effort to answer
No
We just - No
Precisely
We begin by coveting what we see every day
Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice
hardly see how you couldn't
And don't your eyes move over the things you want
All right, then tell me how - No
It's your turn to tell me, Clarice
You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island
Why did you run away from that ranch
Dr
Lecter, when there's time 'll - We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice
This is all the time you'll ever have
Later, listen, 'll - 'll listen now
After your father's murder, you were orphaned
You were ten years old
You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana
And -
And - one morning  just - ran away
She turns from him
He presses closer, gripping the bars
Not "just," Clarice
What set you off
You started what time
Early
Still dark
Then something woke you
What
Did you dream
What was it
The 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, frightened
She is in a Montana ranch house; it almost dawn
Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls
a window, partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside
(
) heard a strange sound
(
) What was it
crosses to the window in her nightgown, rubs the glass
(
) didn't know
went to look
(2ND ) -  ' Shadowy men, ranch hands, are moving in and out of a nearby barn, carrying mysterious bundles
The mens' breath is steaming
refrigerated truck idles nearby, its engine adding more steam
strange, almost surrealistic scene
(
) Screaming
Some kind of - screaming
Like a child's voice
is terrified; she covers her ears
(
) What did you do
(
) Got dressed without turning on the light
went downstairs
outside
in her winter coat, slips noiselessly towards the open barn door
She ducks into the shadows to avoid a ranch hand, who passes her with a squirming bundle of some kind
He goes into the barn, and she edges after him reluctantly
(
) crept up to the barn
was so scared to look inside - but  had to
' as the open doorway
Bright lights inside, straw bales, the edges of stalls, then moving figures
(
) And what did you see, Clarice
is held down on a table by two ranch hands
(
) Lambs
The lambs were screaming
third cowboy stretches out the lamb's neck, raises a bloody knife
Just as he's about to slice its throat - staring into the distance, shaken, still trembling from the child's shock
We see Dr
Lecter, over her shoulder, studying her intently
They were slaughtering the spring lambs
Yes
They were screaming
So you ran away
No
First  tried to free them opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run
They just stood there, confused
They wouldn't run
But you could
You did
took one lamb
And  ran away, as fast as  could
a vast Montana plain, and crossing this, a tiny figure - the little Clarice, holding a lamb in her arms
(
) Where were you going
(
) don't know
had no food or water
It was very cold
thought - if can even save just one
but he got so heavy
So heavy
The tiny figure stops, and after a few moments sinks to the ground, hunched over in dispair
(
) didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me
The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman
never saw the ranch again
(
) But what became of your lamb
(no response) Clarice
as the adult Clarice turns, staring into his feverish eyes
She shakes her head, unwilling - or unable - to say more
You still wake up sometimes, don't you
Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming
Yes
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop
Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs
Do you
Yes
don't know
don't know
(a pause; then, oddly at peace) Thank you, Clarice
(a whisper) Tell me his name, Dr
Lecter
Dr
Chilton
believe you know each other
as Clarice turns, startled, and the fuming Chilton seizes her elbow
Pembry and Boyle are beside him, looking grim
Out
Let's go
Sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to have you put on a place
Clarice struggles, pulling free of them for a moment
Brave Clarice
Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming
(moving closer to the bars) Yes
'll tell you
Promise
(she nods
He smiles) Then why not take your case file won't be needing it anymore
He holds out the file, arm extended between the bars
She hesitates, then reaches to take it
- as the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, and lingers there, just for a moment
' widen, crackling at this touch, like sparks in a cave
Good-bye, Clarice
hugging the case file to her chest, stares back at him as the men crowd in on her, pushing her away
- as Dr
Lecter, head cocked in a smile, slowly recedes
: - -
'  as he pushes a rolling rack of completed leather garments, each wrapped in plastic, down as aisle
of many sewing machines, all clattering at once, as he passes row on row of work tables
The seamstresses, mostly black or Hispanic, glance up as he passes, then quickly avert their eyes, his presence disturbing them in some nameless way
thin  in a flowery shirt, sees him approaching
He rises from his desk and comes over cheerfully, as the rack rolls to a stop
Hello, dear
Punctual as always
And what have you brought us today
He seizes one of the dangling jackets, pulling up the plastic wrapper
He examines it, stroking the sleeve
Oh, marvelous
You know,  always say you're the Leonardo of leather
(
) (a harsh whisper) Oil
Pardon
(
) You're leaving oil on the skin
The foreman quickly releases the jacket
Of course
You'll be wanting your - Mr
Gumb's hand reaches  , snatching an envelope from him
The foreman is watching him walk away, as a seamstress comes over to take the rack of garments
The foreman is vaguely troubled, but shakes it off
He strokes the jacket again, admiringly
(to seamstress) wish we had a dozen like him
- Glenn Gould playing Bach's Goldberg Variations
: -   - Clarice, in a line of other passengers, is moving slowly towards a departure ramp
Through a huge plate glass window, we can see her plane
She glances back over her shoulder at pair of   brawny and impassive, their arms folded, waiting to make sure she board the flight
Clarice sighs, turning wearily back towards the jetway
The , as we
: -    - a steaming, rather elegant dinner tray, being carried by Pembry, as he approaches Dr
Lecter's cell
(shouts) Ready when you are, Doc
the  is issuing from the cassette player
Beside it, on the table, the pile of Dr
Lecter's drawings
The top one is an accurate, sensitive portrait, from memory, of Clarice
Beyond the table, we see Lecter's shadowy form, seated behind the paper screen
He calls out from there
(
) Just another minute, please
Pembry grunts, sets the tray down
Boyle joins him, handing him a riot baton and a Mace cannister, which Pembry fastens to belt clips
Boyle is similarly armed, and carries a ring of keys
Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for dinner, extra rare
(laughs) What you reckon he'll want for breakfast - some fuckin' thing from the zoo
Dr
Lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet - swaying slightly, eyes closed, lost in the music, tongue working in his cheek
Suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of metal protrudes from his lips
He plucks it out, opens his eyes
he is holding the pocket clip from Prentice's disassembled pen - a straight, thin strip of metal, with a circular collar at one end, a square edge at the other
lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge, then braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim
He pushes down, hard, using both hands for leverage
After a moment he smiles, holding up the result, and twirling it before his eyes
the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle, and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers
Pembry and Boyle turn as the toilet , and Dr
Lecter reappears, looking jaunty
Okay, Doc, grab some floor
Same drill as lunchtime
Dr
Lecter sits on the floor, legs straight, then wriggles backwards
He stretches his arms behind him, hands and wrists through the bars, with two bars between them, and clasps his hands
'm ready when you are, Officer Pembry
Pembry comes around the cell to squat behind Dr
Lecter
He tugs his hands farther out, rather roughly, handcuffs his wrists
He shakes the cuffs, making sure of them, then nods to Boyle
- as Boyle picks up the dinner tray, and Pembry crosses around
Pembry takes the keys from Boyle, unlocks the cell door, and pushes it inward
Boyle goes inside with the tray
watches as Boyle approaches the table, above five feet from him
Boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear off some of the mess of drawings
The  plays on
Dr
Lecter's hands, outside the bars, as the makeshift key, held between the tips of his right index and middle fingers, searches for the keyhole of the cuffs
And finds it
- as he finishes clearing the drawings, then turns back towards Dr
Lecter, stooping to pick up the tray
' is just inches from the tray when Dr
Lecter's hand darts , snapping a handcuff onto his wrist
looks up, astonished, to find himself right in the grinning face of Dr
Lecter - who just as quickly rolls sideways, and snaps - around the bolted leg of the table
And suddenly all natural and  are suspended, as the  soars much louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and we see
-    - Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton
Dr
Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door frame
Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his pants pocket for his handcuff key
Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist
Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at
Dr
Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him
Dr
Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it like a dog shakes a rat
Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it
Dr
Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing him to his knees
Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, seeing
Dr
Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and again
Then normal  and  are restored as we go to - the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now flecked with blood
In addition to the Bach, we now hear soft , close by, and whimpering  in the background
eyes closed, lost in a favorite passage of the music
His bloody fingers drift airily with the notes, as his breathing slows to normal
He opens his eyes, sighs contentedly, looks down
By the sprawled legs of Boyle lie various objects that spilled from his pants pocket - coins, a comb, a big pocketknife
picks up the pocketknife, examines it happily
About a four- inch blade
He becomes aware of the , off screen, turns
as he crawls, with torturous slowness, towards the command desk, and the phone
He is crying, but frantically determined
'  -  , Above the desk, hanging from pegs, are his and Boyle's holstered revolvers
: -    - The bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards "5," then indicates a stop there, at the top floor
at his command desk, as he stares at the indicator
Another cop, , sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in the lobby
What is this shit
Did somebody go up to five
(Jacobs shakes his head) Call Pembry, ask him what - , and then, moments later,   quick ones, echo down the nearby stairwell
Sgt
Tate jumps to his feet, grabs a radio mike, as the other cops stir, confused and noisy
(into mike) , shots fired on five
Repeat, shots fires on five
Outside posts look sharp, we've got a
Ho-ly shit
has begun to descend
Down to 4, then past 4
as he reacts
The other cops, behind him, are now in a full uproar, shouting, pulling out guns
(to the others) Guard mount, double up on your outside posts
Bobby, get the vests
Rainey, Howard, cover that fucking elevator if it comes all the way to - (
) It stopped
has, indeed, frozen at 3
Sgt
Tate lifts the microphone again
(into mike) Seal off a ten-block radius
Get me the  team and an ambulance, double quick
We're going up
: -  ( ) on Sgt
Tate as he leads a five-man squad, all in bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs
They move fast but carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with drawn revolvers, shotguns
The distant Back  makes a ghostly echo in here
: -  ( ) thin rectangle of light on the floor from the open elevator door
We can't see inside
The  sounds closer
approaches very cautiously, gun aimed
The other cops, behind him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the various office doors - all locked - as they creep up
-  ' as he reaches the side of the elevator, hesitates, then spins to point his gun inside
It's empty
He backs away
(shouts at ceiling) Pembry
Boyle
: -  ( ) on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on the frosted glass
The Bach is
After a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for the glass to shatter, Tate following his gun inside, moving low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe
They all freeze, staring in utter horror
Oh no
no
is a brief snapshot from hell
The two uniformed bodies, one sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the cell, have been savaged by a knife
Blood and gore everywhere
The faces are unrecognizable
struggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around him, into the room
He pulls his walkie-talkie from his belt
(into mike) Command post
Two offi- (a beat; clears his throat) Two officers down
Prisoner is missing
Repeat, Lecter is missing
He's stripped the bed, might be making a rope, check all windows
Where the fuck is my ambulance
a cop angrily punches  the music
Jacobs kneels with his fingers on Boyle's neck
Boyle is dead, Sarge
His gun's gone
a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist
Murray, the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the gory face
bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage , very softly
This one's alive
Tate crosses, kneels to see for himself
Murray looks green
Take ahold of him where he can feel your hands, son
Talk to him
What's his name, Sarge
It's Pembry, now talk to him, God dammit
(into radio, looking around) Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad
Lecter is missing and armed - he took Boyle's gun
The other cop, checking the cylinder of Pembry's gun, holds up one finger to Tate
(into radio) Pembry got off one round - there's a chance Lecter was hit
We heard a total of three shots fired, so he's got four left
He's got a knife, too
: - on a floodlit scene of barely controlled pandemonium
Flashing red lights, men shouting commands, in the distance
members, in full gear, leap from a black van
fan out
swarm up the steps orderlies unload a gurney from an ambulance
Cops kneel for cover behind cars, aiming guns and rifles up at the windows
: - trio of  orderlies work fast over the body, already strapped on its gurney
They bandage a big plastic airway into place, over the butchered face, checking for a pulse at the neck
Young Murray crouches, sickened, gripping a bloody fist
You're just fine, Pembry, lookin' good, buddy, you're gonna make it
One orderly massages the heart
Another is popping a plasma bag, ready to insert the needle, when the body starts convulsing
Downstairs - let's go
Quickly the gurney is elevated, wheeled out of the room, with cops rushing forward to open the doors, help push, men are running by in the hall, automatic rifles at the ready
: -  - Sgt
Tate, riding down with Jacobs, has his radio out
(into mike) Ten-four, Lieutenant
'm on the elevator, bringing it down
Pembry and Boyle are both cleared, top three floors secured, main stairwell secured
He's somewhere on - spot of blood falls on his cheek
He and Jacobs stare at each other
Another spot hits his shoulder
They look up
Blood is dripping slowly from the corner of the service hatch
Sgt
Tate motions for silence, as both men draw their guns
(into mike) Uh, we're pretty sure he's somewhere on two, sir
That's all for now, over
: - The elevator doors open, and Tate and Jacobs hurry out, stepping quickly to the side
Tate reaches back in and - Locks the elevator into position, with its doors open
are rushing up to them, curious, as Tate frantically pushes them aside, gesturing for silence
(whispers) He's on the roof of the elevator
: - Two  officers,  and , turn a key, unlocking and opening this floor's elevator doorway
The shaft is dark
Lying prone, they inch up to the edge, Peterson extends a mirror, on a long pole, out into the shaft
(   ) Is a distant figure, in a green prison jumpsuit, lying on his stomach, atop the elevator
shiny revolver is near one hand
whispers into a radio, as Kubell carefully tips an assault rifle, with a flashlight taped to its barrel, over the edge
see him
There's a weapon by his hand
He's not moving
Can you get the drop
We got the drop
One warning
Then take him out
Peterson nods to Kubell, who switches  the flashlight, as Peterson shouts down the shaft
Quinn
put your hands on your head
the green figure shows no movement
as Peterson mutters to Kubell
Put one in his leg
The figure below, as Kubell's gunshot , echoing hugely in the shaft, and a slug rips through the jumpsuited leg
The figure doesn't stir
staring down the shaft, raises his mike again
No movement
Okay, Johnny, hold your fire
: - small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway, from both sides
Tate crouches next to the
(into radio mike) We're coming into the car, we're opening the hatch
Watch his hands
Any fire will come from us
Affirm
' Got it
The  commander hands his radio to another cop, then looks at Tate
long, tense moment
Then he waves a signal
as we follow a picked team of four  cops, in full body armor, rushing into the elevator car
Two men move to the corners, aim assault rifles at the ceiling
third man sets a stepladder in place, and the fourth man, armed with a big Colt, hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch
the service hatch, as the hinged cover drops open, and a body tumbles through, dangling head first, until it's caught at the waist
We see the back of the head
shoulders through the  cops for a closer look
He turns towards the  commander, astonished
That's Pembry
: - In the rear chamber, a young   is braced against the vehicle's sway
Behind him, the stretchered form of his patient, and, through a curtained opening, the driver of the siren
(into radio mike) He's comatose, but his vital signs are good
Pressure's 130 over 90
Yeah, 90
Pulse 85
Behind him, in slightly  , the bloody figure sits slowly upright
His convulsions have stopped, but he's got so much loose skin on his face, it's hard to tell if - Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange
He turns, puzzled
in Lecter's fist, flashes high in the air
: -  -  ( ) on the  ambulance, as it races along normally, its  blazing, the heavy flow of traffic parting to make way for it
Then suddenly it begins to weave erratically, changing lanes, before drifting dangerously to a full stop, almost side-ways
Cars swerve to avoid hitting it,  angrily
on the stopped ambulance
After a long, still moment, the wind-shield wipes come on, incongruously, then stop
Then the  is shut , and the flashers
The ambulance starts rolling again - at first jerkingly, then with increasing speed
We follow it for several more moments, until is passes - and we  on
that reads "Memphis International Airport / 2 miles
" - Dr
Lecter's face is slowly , as he wipes across it with a fistful of gauze, tossing it aside
: -  - ( ) , rushing with dizzy swiftness over the prairie, over waving grasses
a long passage
before we come at last to the girl Clarice, sitting with her lamb, hunched in despair
She rises, her face tear-stained, and turns from us
Holding the lamb, she starts back the way she came
: -  - , very rapid, down this road
coming at last to a stopped highway patrol car
Clarice, with her lamb, is standing in the car's headlights
She starts wearily towards the sheriff
: - - sweeping rapidly  into the barnyard towards the arriving highway patrol car, as it stops
to the little girl as she steps from the car, holding the lamb
The dark figure of the rancher
As he roughly takes the lamb from her, we  on a  of her face - stunned, blank
She
: - - '  as she walks towards the open barn doorway
It looms
The rancher is revealed, a shadowy figure, pinning the lamb on the killing table
His knife hand sweeps up high, then holds
He turns  , his face breaking into the light - and it is the face of Dr
Lecter
He smiles his terrible smile at the young Clarice
: -     - - coming in very  on the adult Clarice's face - shocked, devastated - as she stands alone by the dangling receiver
: -   - a shower head, as water suddenly blasts out
Clarice moves  , as she scrubs her face and hair compulsively, almost desperately, unable to get clean
(
) They found the ambulance
: '   - Clarice is hunched on her cot, in a bathrobe, her hair wet
The Buffalo Bill case file, a thick bundle, rests by her feet
Ardelia hovers anxiously nearby
In the parking garage at Memphis airport
The crew was dead
He killed a tourist, too
Got his clothes, cash
By now he could be anywhere
Clarice looks up
Her eyes are red-rimmed with exhaustion, and something close to despair
She reads Ardelia's thought
No
He won't come after me
Why not
(bitterly) It would be rude
And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions
Ardelia sits beside her, touches her arm
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin
You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried
It's not your fault it ended this way
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me
Only  can't see him
(touching the case file) Lecter said, everything  need to catch him is right here, in these pages
Lecter said a lot of things
(shakes her head) He's here, Ardelia
Ardelia stares back at her
- the low throb of a washing machine
: -   -  ( ) Clarice has spread out the case file across two washing machines
Ardelia, cross-legged on a dryer, studies another pile of forms
Nearby is their laundry basket, detergent box
(surprised) Hey, is this Lecter's handwriting
She holds up the map, with its location markings for the kidnapping and body dump sites
Clarice takes it, looks
- with newly inked words in Dr
Lecter's precise, elegant hand
(
) Clarice, doesn't this random scattering of sites seem overdone to you
Doesn't it seem desperately random - like the elaborations of a bad liar
Ta
Hannibal Lecter
- as Clarice looks up at Ardelia, puzzled but excited
"Desperately random
" What does he mean
Not random at all, maybe
Like there's some pattern here
But there is no pattern
There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it
They're even found in random order
Well, except for the one girl
(beat) What girl
The one that was weighted down
Where is she
Fred something
They search among the inserts
Clarice finds the graduation photo
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio
The first girl taken, but the third body found
Why
'Cause she didn't drift
He weighted her down
But why
He didn't weight the others
Clarice moves, on fire, unable to keep still
The first, what the hell did Lecter say about
"First principles," he said
Simplicity
What does this guy do, he "covets
" How do we first start to covet
"We covet what we see -" She stops, turns
She grabs the photo of Fredrica from Ardelia, stares at it
She looks up, trembling
"- every day
" (softly) Hot damn, Clarice
(
) He knew her
: -     - Clarice and Crawford are seated in front of Director Burke, who's at his desk
Another chair is empty, because Krendler is pacing
All four are nearing their boiling points
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too
Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously
Maybe he just meant to
give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir
But then - Starling - But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them
That's what Lecter was hinting
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay
've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians
've got - Who the hell's fault is - - a
Senator who's half out of her head because her daughter's going to be murdered today
And all because of your mind games with fucking Lecter
If you hadn't interfered, he'd still be in custody in Baltimore
Jack - You sent in a green recruit, with a phony goddamn offer - You're just trying to cover your ass for letting him escape
'
All of you
long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure
Crawford, who was at the point of striking Krendler, finally retakes his seat
Burke looks sadly at Crawford and Clarice
(very reluctantly) Starling, 'm afraid  have no choice
You're suspended from the Academy
(Crawford starts to interrupt) Not another word
(to Clarice) This is pending a reevaluation of your fitness for the service promise you'll get a fair hearing
(pause) Jack
you're ordered to take compassionate leave
You'll spend the rest of the day briefing the 's office, then transfer command of the task force, effective by 1800 hours
(beat) 'm sorry, Jack
Go home
Take care of Bella
Clarice and Crawford stare back at him, drained
long and very painful silence
Not even Krendler looks happy
: - Clarice and Crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other
All his victims are women
His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women
But not one women is hunting him - except me
can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would
(beat) have to go to Belvedere
You heard them
don't have that authority anymore
You do until six p
m
He stares at her sadly
He looks, for the first time, defeated, old beyond his years
Ohio is cold ground
Picked over, ten months ago
Our people worked it, so did the locals
But not from this angle
Not thinking he knew her
You've got to send me
'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling won't disobey orders, not even now
But  just became a private citizen
can go anywhere  want to
With  and a gun
Impersonating a federal agent is a felony
He's going to kill her, Mr
Crawford
This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance
'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me
You want my
Here - take it
He stares at her, a long moment
Catherine's life
Clarice's passion, and future
His loyalty to the Bureau
Call it
(pulls out his wallet) There's about $300 here
And a hotline code number
They'll patch you through to me, wherever  am
She raises her hand to him
She wants to touch him face, or his neck, but can't
Finally she takes his money and card
Thank you
He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van

: '  -  ( ) the needle of the Victrola, on the spinning record, as Mr
Gumb's fingers lift away
continues in background
(
) (calling out) Preeeeecious
the moth cage, as Mr
Gumb's fingers search through the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out
The door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult moths flutter out
(
) Precious, come on Precious
Busy busy day today
a clean towel, beside the sink
The cocoon is gently placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives
(
) Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful
a stainless steel Colt Python, with a six-inch barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a practice cock
The metallic  is deep and loud
note of alarm has entered Mr
Gumb's voice
(
) You come here this minute, you little scamp
on Mr
Gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through his sewing workroom
His back is to us; he is looking anxiously under the furniture
He stops, straightens
Genuinely scared
Precious
- Towards Mr
Gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the oubliette chamber
He stares inside; his face in shadows
Sweetheart
From the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice
(
) She'd down here you sack of shit
Mr
Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the doorframe
little groan escaped him; the dog answers with a series of
, as Mr
Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge
Precious, are you all right
crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest
Seeing Mr
Gumb, the dog squirms frantically,
Get me a telephone
Lower it down to me
Do it now, mister
don't want to have to hurt this little dog
on Mr
Gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the Colt from inside his kimono
The muzzle gleams as he takes aim
Catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming at him
You shoot motherfucker you better kill me quick or 'll break her fucking neck,  swear to God
(
) (wails) Nooooooo
Tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting the head
The dog  piteously
Back off, you son of a bitch
Back off
as Mr
Gumb cries out again - a terrible, inarticulate scream of rage and anguish
But then he slowly lowers his gun
On Catherine, as she maintains her grip
That's better
Now get me a live telephone
Get a long extension and lower is down here
And you better do it fast, too, 'cause  think her leg's broken
She's in pain, mister, she needs a vet
stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily
You think she's in pain
You don't know what pain is
But you're going to find out
And abruptly he vanishes
of his footsteps, rushing off
begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably
She hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in its fur, sobbing
: - ,  - as a rented sedan pulls up to the curb, stops
After a moment Clarice climbs out, a bit stiffly
Double- checking this address, she glances up from a folded street map to - , - in a row of similarly shabby homes, all backing onto a narrow river
path of boards, laid over mud, leads back along this house towards the brown water
of hammering from there
: -   - An awesome huddle of pigeon coops sprawls by the brackish water
The birds'  mixes with the
tall, gaunt man in a knit cap is obsessively pounding nails into a new coop

He has red- rimmed eyes of watery blue
His face is deeply seamed
Mr
Bimmel
He stares back at her, warily
: -  - -   as Mr
Bimmel leads Clarice up a steep flight of steps
The bannister is worn, sags a bit
don't know nothin' new to tell ya
The police been back here so many times already
Fredrica went into Columbus on the bus to see about a job
She left the interview
She never come home
Clarice pauses, at the landing, to look at a framed photo: the familiar graduation portrait
Others pictures show Fredrica as a young girl, toddler, infant - plump and hopeful at each age
Her room's how she left it
Just shut the door when you're done
: '  - '  -   as she takes in flowery chintz curtains
posters of Madonna and Blondie
a twin bed, with worn, stuffed animals on the pillow
a big sewing machine in the corner
turns, absorbing nuances
There is loneliness here, an echo of desperation under this steeply pitches ceiling
shrill , and she looks down
is rubbing against her ankles
picks up the cat, scratches behind his ears
She glances up
- she and the cat stares back at their own reflection
: sitting at the desk, turns the pages of a high school yearbook
The cat is curled on her lap
: kneeling by the old Decca record player, flips through LPs and singles
The cat has wandered off
: pulling a string to light up the closet
She is surprised and intrigued to see an extensive wardrobe, groaning from the rod
shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing supplies, in clear plexiboxes
She flips through the hanging clothes, pulls out one dress, on its hanger, for a closer look
is very big, to fit Fredrica, but beautifully cut
Some of the seams still look unfinished
She turns it around, sees a blue tissue dressmaker's pattern still pinned to the back
as Clarice turns, looks towards it
She hangs the dress on the closet door knob, crosses to sit at the machine
She takes off its dust cover
She runs one hand over the cool metal, as a taunting memory forms in her mind
(
) Billy wants to change, too, Clarice
But there's the problem of his size, you see
She turns, looks again at the unfinished dress
Suddenly she straightens, her attention riveted by something
' On the printed pattern, down at the lower back of the outlined dress, are two bold black triangles
We   to there shapes, before jumping back to - who stares at them, starting to tremble
(
) Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one
those missing triangles of skin on the dead girl's back, in the funeral home in West Virginia
as she jumps to her feet, with a fierce joy
Sewing darts
You bastard
: -  - Clarice paces, in an exuberant rush, amidst the worn furniture
(into phone) He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr
Crawford - out of real women
And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled
dressmaker, or a tailor - (
) Starling - That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin
He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that - (
) Starling, we know who he is
And where he is
We're on our way now
(pause; surprised) Where
: -  - Crawford sits at a communications console, with Burroughs, in headphones, by his side
This forward section of the cabin is crammed with hi-tech equipment, all lit up and
Through a window we see clouds, part of the jet's wing
(into speaker phone) Calumet City, edge of Chicago
'll be on the ground in 45 minutes with the Hostage Rescue Team
'm back in charge, Starling
He's mine
as Clarice reacts; her happiness for Crawford is tinged with disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt
(on phone) Sir, that's great news
But how - Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us
We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries
(takes a paper from Burroughs) Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," "John Grant
" Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name
- from the rear of the cabin forward, as we slowly  the twelve-man
They're seated in full gear, hardshell armor, quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons - silencer automatics, shotguns, stun grenades
(
) This Gumb's a real beauty
Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric
Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade
Sewing
Take a bow
Customs had some paper on his alias
They stopped a carton two years ago at  - live caterpillars from Surinam
The addressee was "John Grant
" Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias
We're hitting one, Chicago 's taking the other
(eagerly) Chicago's only about 400 miles from here
could be there in - No, Starling, there isn't time
And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio
We want him for murder, not kidnapping
'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted
Clarice tries hard to swallow her disappointment
Yes sir
'll do my best
(pause; gently) Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy
We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that
Least of all me
Yes sir
Thank you, sir
switches off, feeling bad for her
On the console near him, the fax machine starts to
He turns, looks
(
) Here he comes, Jack
an emerging sheet, as Gumb's face is printed out
We see just his hair, then the top of his forehead, before we
: - Clarice walks slowly across the yard, absorbing all this news, before suddenly leaping into the air and pumping her fist in triumph, with a happy yelp
Then she sees - staring at her in surprise
He sits by his coops, smoking
somewhat embarrassed, crosses over to him
Mr
Bimmel
did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb, from Calumet City
Or John Grant
(he shakes his head) Did she know any men that sew
She sewed for everybody
Stores, ladies, whatever
don't know about men
Who was her best friend, Mr
Bimmel
Who'd she hang out with
: - '  - The  turbojet is parked, its gangway down
Crawford, Burroughs, and the  squad, carrying their bags of weapons, rapidly down the metal steps
(
) Freaked me out
Get your skin peeled off, is that a bummer
: &  -  - - short, perky, early 20's - sits nervously at her desk, talking to Clarice, who jots in her notebook
In the background
beyond them, bank tellers, lines of waiting customers,
They said she was just rags, like somebody - Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb
Or John Grant
(Stacy shakes her head) Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about
No way
She had a guy, 'da known, believe me
Sewing was her life, she was really great at it
Poor Freddie
Did you ever work with her
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs
Lippman
Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores
But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle
Where does Mrs
Lippman live
'd like to talk to her
She died
She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago
She dies own there
Clarice reacts, disappointed at the ending of this trail
(beat; shyly) Is that a pretty good job,  agent
think so
You get to travel around and stuff
mean, better places then this
Sometimes you do
Freddie was so happy for me when got this job
This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit
What did she know, big dummy
Suddenly she's fighting tears
Clarice reaches to hug her
: -  ,  - on what appears to be, at first, a calm, ordinary neighborhood of working class two- and three-story houses
But the street is strangely quiet, deserted
After a few moments, we become aware of movement - armed, dark-clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs to garage corners, from parked cars to porches, appearing and then disappearing
: '  -  ( ) Mr
Gumb, as he settles a big pair of infra-red night-vision goggles over his eyes
Moths flutter past his face
His mouth is set in a grim line
: -   - An  cop, prone beneath a hedge, is joined by a 2nd Cop, who throws himself to the grass beside him
They both take aim with their scoped rifles at - (  ) The front door of a big, nearby, split-level house
: '  -  ( ) a fuse box, as Mr
Gumb reaches in, flips a switch
The lights go out
of a second switch, and the cellar is bathed in a green glow
: - '  - little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly startled to find himself staring into the grim face of - crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth
As the little boy starts to cry, the cop pulls him into the shadows, covering his mouth
: '  -  ( ) Mr
Gumb, in his kimono and goggles, creeps silently through his workrooms - knees bent, painted toes places ever so delicately, the Colt held aloft - as more moths flutter past him in the eerie light
: - florist's van turns the corner, comes slowly down the street and stops at the curb in front of the split-level
The driver, in a gray deliveryman's uniform and cap, climbs out of the cab, walks briskly to the panel door, on the street side of the van, and slides it open
He leans in, comes out with a long, thin red-ribboned floral box, starts calmly towards the house
: '  -  ( ) '  -   on the top of the oubliette, a glowing green circle in the dark, as it draws closer and closer
and then Catherine comes  , at the bottom of the pit
She is crouched, exhausted, staring straight up at him - but she can't see him in this infra-red darkness
Precious is curled into her stomach, asleep
The futon is up to Catherine's waist, but there's a clear shot at her head and neck
Looking down at her, smiles
: - '  - on the "deliveryman," seen from behind, as he mounts three steps to the split-level's front porch
Tucked into the small of his back if a 9 mm
automatic
have slipped out of the van, and are crouched behind it now, with drawn guns, watching tensely as - "" settles the floral box in the crook of his left arm, reaches out with his right hand towards the buzzer
: '  -  ( ) Slowly, savoring the moment, Mr
Gumb aims the big Colt, which is already cocked, using both hands
He is just about to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his  , surprisingly loud and close by
He turns, startled, and sees - the extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is making the hideous, grating
It finally stops, but not before waking Precious, who starts frantically , off screen, as - raises his gun again, spinning back towards - - where Catherine, hearing but still not seeing him, quickly yanks the futon over both herself and the dog
Instantly the two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass
bites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to safely place his shot
The maddening  sounds again, even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and fury
But as the  continues, he reluctantly uncocks his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door
: '   - The door opens, on a chain, and Clarice peers in, smiling
Good afternoon
wonder if you could help me
'm looking for Mrs
Lippman's family
Mr
Gumb frowns out at Clarice
For the first time ever, we get a well-lit view of his bland, pale-eyed moon of a face
They don't live here anymore
: '  - The "deliveryman" yanks a 12 lb
sledgehammer from the floral box, swings it with all his might against the door knob, blowing it through as - Crawford and Burroughs race towards the door, guns up
: '   - Mr
Gumb starts to close the door, only to have Clarice push back against it, politely but firmly
She holds up her
Excuse me, but  really do need to talk to you
This was Mrs
Lippman's house
Did you know her
(beat) Just briefly
What's the problem, Officer
: '  -   - bedroom window disintegrates as a flash grenade is shot through it,  on the floor
An instant later, a black- clad  cop dives through the shattered glass, rolls across the floor, comes up on one knee swiveling his sawed-off shotgun
: '   - Clarice and Mr
Gumb, still eyeing each other through the door crack
'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel
Who are you, please
Jack Gordon
Mr
Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs
Lippman
No
Wait
Was she a great, fat person
may have seen her, 'm not sure
: '  -   - as Burroughs moves quickly down a hallway and enters the living room, where Crawford is standing, with his gun held down by his side, surrounded by several other cops
Burroughs shakes his head: Nothing here
: '   - Mr
Gumb glances briefly over his shoulder, towards his kitchen, then turns back to Clarice with a smile
Mrs
Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you
have his card somewhere
Do you mind stepping inside, while  looks for it
Thanks
which rests on a counter, just inside the open kitchen doorway
this doorway, we watch as Mr
Gumb, at the end of his front hall, slips the chain
Clarice enters, closing the door behind her
: '  -   - - towards the front door, as frustrated cops file out of the empty house, rifles slung across their shoulders
walking across the grass towards the van, when all at once he stops in his tracks, shaken by a sudden flash of intuition
on his stricken face
Clarice
: '  - Clarice, pulling her notebook from her shoulder bag, glances around the musty-looking room
(
) That horrible business,  shiver every time  think about it
Overstuffed furniture, porcelain figurines
One archway onto the front hall, another onto a dining alcove, and through there, the kitchen
Mr
Gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, raising the top
He bends over, begins poking through cubby holes
His tone is casual, neutral
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think
think we may be, yes
Mr
Gumb stiffens, almost imperceptibly
His back is to her, as he continues opening drawers, rustling papers
Mr
Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs
Lippman died
Yes
bought the house from her, two years ago
Did she leave any records here
Tax or business records
Maybe a list of employees
' as he continues his rummaging
No, nothing at all
Has the learned something
Because the police here don't seem to have the first clue
Out of the folds of his kimono crawls a Death's-head Moth
It creeps slowly to the center of his back, raising its wings
Do you have his description yet, or some fingerprints
unaware, is still glancing around the room
For several agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze
beat of pure fear
tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm
No
no, we don't
Very carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, lowers the bag to the floor
With her fingertips she brushes back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape
turns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business card
Ahhh
Here's that number
keeps her distance
They are about ten feet apart
Good, thank you
Mr
Gordon, do you have a phone  can use
is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind him, flutters past his face
He turns, looking at it
He looks back at Clarice, his mouth still open
are unmoving, locked on his
stare back at her, widen
And they know each other
(softly) In the kitchen
'll show you
whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands
Freeze
slowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her
tries to force more authority into her voice
Okay
Okay, Mr
Gumb, you're under arrest
Down on the floor, hands and legs spread, move it
turns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen
hesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back - and then it's too late
Shit
: '  - Clarice hurries inside, moving low, swivelling her gun
- The kitchen is empty
To one side, a door still shuddering on its hinges
rushes to this - pauses - then elbows the door aside, aiming her gun down - brightly lit, leading to the cellar
Two doors facing the bottom, both open
No sign of Mr
Gumb
hates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: she is very scared, but suddenly hears - The distant  of Catherine Martin, somewhere down there in that killing maze
rushes through the doorway, and down the stairs
,     there's an empty space; the Colt Python is gone
: '  - -   - hurrying down the steps
More ; they seem to be coming from the left door
Clarice goes that way, entering a brick-walled passage - pipes over- head, naked bulbs
The lighting, though dim, is incandescent; Mr
Gumb has switched off his infra-red system
Clarice comes to a -shaped intersection, stops
Another , again to her left, and the  of a dog
follows her gun around the corner, looking right
but doors opening off it - he could be lurking behind any of them
She looks left
sees an opening onto some kind of chamber
The noises are , coming from there
moves cautiously towards this chamber
: -  ( ) Clarice moves in, hugging the wall, gun swivelling
- the open top of the pit
beyond it, the other two doorways, opening onto this room - Jesus, he could come through either one of them, or come up behind her
She moves to the pit, looks down, very briefly, sees Catherine , hysterical, and a little white dog
kneels, staring up from one door to another, she can't cover them all, she's totally exposed - and what's a dog doing there
, Catherine, you're safe
Safe, , he's got a gun
Getmeout
You're all right
Where is he
Get me out
'll get you out
Just be quiet so can hear
Shut that dog up
(still swivelling) Is there a ladder
Is there a rope
don't know
Get me out
Catherine
Listen to me
have to find a rope
have to leave this room, just for a minute, but - You fucking bitch don't you down here, '  - Shut
(then, louder) The other officers will be here any minute
you're perfectly safe now
Ignoring Catherine, whose shouts turn to sobs, she backs away, turns, picks one of the other doorways, moves into it quickly
: -  ( ) '  -  down this passageway, towards a new room
pausing at the doorway, straining to hear
no sound except Catherine's , not in the background, and Clarice's own
Then she crouches - - bursts forward, through the doorframe, sidestepping
: -  ( ) Clarice weaves back and forth, half-crouched, gun out, back to the wall
Her face glistens with sweat, as she takes in
- Mr
Gumb's sewing machine
his swivel chair
the old Victrola
Big moths are crashing into the light bulbs, overhead; they're everywhere
Suddenly, from just behind her, a  and a , and - spins, almost shoots, before seeing - with its thermostat just switching
gasps for breath, fighting for calm
She turns again, slashing her free hand at the moths, moving quickly on
: -  ( ) Clarice moves past the mannequins, all of them naked now
then quickly past the huge Chinese armoire, ready to shoot into it
Its doors yawn open; it is empty except for several padded hangers
She moves on, past the big sink, with its faucet
the counter, with its gleaming knives
the rows of chemical jars
At the end of this room is Clarice starts to open it, then hesitates
Looking around, she seizes a wooden chair, wedges it under the door know, sealing off this section of the cellar
With her back thus defended, she turns, softly retracing her steps
: -  ( ) Passing again through the workroom, Clarice pauses, seeing a half-curtained door, to one side, that she had previously skirted
She crosses to the door, listens and hears no sound inside, takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob
She twists it, and, as it turns, shoves hard and follows her gun inside, all in one quick move
: -  ( ) An old-fashioned bathroom: tiled floor, sink, toilet - and a big, free-standing tub
An opaque shower curtain, suspended from an oval ring, hides whatever might be inside
centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks it aside with her left hand
No one standing there
Something lower down catches her eye
She leans in, stares more closely, not understanding, at first, that she's seeing - sticking up from the tub, which is filled with hard red-purple plaster
The hand is dark and shriveled, with pink nail polish and a dainty wristwatch
As - is reacting with horror to this sight, the lights go out, to be replaced, a split-second later, by the eerie green glow of Mr
Gumb's infra-red system
Clarice cries out, turns blindly, reaching for the door, can't find it, free hand clawing desperately into what is, for her, utter darkness
of Catherine  again, in the far distance
Clarice stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches the door frame
: '  -  ( ) Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of her unseeing eyes
She stops, listens
In her raw-nerved darkness, every  is unnaturally magnified - the  of the refrigerator
the  of water
her own terrified , and Catherine's faraway, echoing
Moths smack against her face and arms
She eases forward, then stops again, listens
She eases forward again, following her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past - who has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a high priest, Colt in one hand
He wears his goggles and kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed suit of human skins
This is an exquisite moment for him - a ritual of supreme exaltation
He smiles at Clarice as, completely unaware, she moves beyond him, exposing her back
Very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her, taking his gun in both hands, aiming
the Colt Python as - in   - his thumbs cock the hammer, the  registering as a   , and - spins, still in  , flame already leaping from her gun muzzle, as we see - almost at point-black range, guns  hugely, one from Mr
Gumb, and one two three four  from Clarice, overlapping his, and then, as the  crash deafeningly - -   - with   , as the side of her face hits the floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness
Where is he, where
Then, as the  finally fade, she hears something else - a tortured, sucking,  from perhaps eight feet away
- as she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, until it bumps against Mr
Gumb's shoulder
He is lying on his back, chest a bloody mess
She slides her muzzle against his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't needed
He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips working
He tries to speak, but cannot
One hand reaches slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize something, overhead
Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand drops, he is dead
Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, making sure
Then, and only then, does she permit herself to roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him
down at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers on their pillow
Then, as we   , we see that her staring eyes, and his dead gaze, are both locked onto - '-  - perched on an infra-red bulb, overhead, its wings pumping slowly
- wailing , many excited , as we
: '  - The front porch of the tall Victorian house is bathed in a glare of  lights, police and ambulance flashers
Cars and vans and even a firetruck choke the street; cops, reporters, workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective barricades
The  of their voices goes even higher as dazed, her face bandaged - comes out of the house, walking protectively beside Catherine, who is wheeled on a gurney
They are followed out by uniformed cops, then two firemen with an extension ladder
Catherine, blinking in confusion, is still clutching the little dog, and refuses to give her up even as she's trundled into an ambulance
Clarice sways with exhaustion; everyone seems to be shouting at her at once, pulling her sleeve
She tries to fight free of them, desperate for a familiar face
pulls up, stops, and Crawford climbs out of the back seat
He makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies, stopping when he sees Clarice
for a long moment, Crawford choked with pride for her, with sorrow for her ordeal, with love, but unable to find any words
And then he does
Starling
your father sees you
And then all at once she is sobbing, her knees giving way, but he is there to catch her, he is hugging her fiercely
them for a long beat
(
) (over loudspeaker) Congratulations
You are now officers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
: -   - The forty members of Clarice's class, resplendent in their best dark suits and dresses, rise, cheering themselves, then turn happily to wave to their audience, as  mounts
Beyond them, on a gaily tented platform, the Director stands behind his podium
look at one another solemnly
Ardelia holds up both fists, in a power shake, and Clarice taps them with her own
She is radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin scar on her cheek almost healed
Ardelia turns, waving towards the crowd, the Clarice's thoughts are elsewhere
She turns, searching among the dignitaries on the platform, till she locates who smiles back at her with quiet pride, and offers a little salute
grins - more happy than we've ever seen her - then turns to wave towards the crowd with the others
over the admiring sea of spectators, several hundred of them, still rising from their folding chairs,  in celebration of these special young people, this perfect, sunlit day
- rock music, laughter - as we
: -   - party is underway - food, beer, dancing - as the new grads celebrate ferociously
Ardelia weaves her way through the crowded room, reaches Clarice, who is flanked by her special guests - Pilcher and Roden, the two ardent scientists
Ardelia has to shout at Clarice over the din
Agent Starling
Telephone
(surprised) Agent Mapp
Thank you
She nods to Pilcher, leaves them
Roden, who is quite happily drunk, grabs the startled Ardelia around the waist
Hel-lo, gorgeous
Let's get down
Ardelia looks at Pilcher, confused
Just ignore him
He's not a Ph
: - Clarice picks up the dangling pay phone, speaks happily
Starling
(
) Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming
She freezes, stunned by the familiar voice
Then she turns, waving frantically towards who is just inside the rec room door, at the end of the hall, lost in conversation with Pilcher and Roden
Ardelia glances at her briefly but misunderstands, waves cheerfully back
(
) Don't bother with a trace,  won't be on long enough
turns back, gripping the phone more tightly
Where are you, Dr
Lecter
: Very beautiful, glittering with countless stars
(
) Where  have a view, Clarice
we see a rolling lawn, a curving bay
Boats ride at anchor, lights shimmering
(
) Orion is looking splendid tonight, and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his flock
smiles into his mobile phone
He is stretched out on a lounger, on a tiled patio, languidly paring an orange with a penknife
His appearance is quite altered - a beard, glasses, lighter hair
He's has some cosmetic surgery, as well
(into phone) Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever
You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence
Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end
Dr
Lecter - have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it
Be sure you extend me the same courtesy
(
) You know  can't make that promise
Goodbye, Clarice
(and then, softly) You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit
: - As Clarice reacts, the fill weight of his words sinking in
Dr
Lecter
Dr
Lecter
But only a   comes from the phone
She is still staring at her receiver, in shock, as we - : Dr
Lecter sighs, sets his phone down, then rises
Popping an orange section into his mouth, he turns towards the brightly lit house
Stepping delicately over the sprawled body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open french doors
: In a swivel chair, amidst the wreckage of his papers and books, is the writhing figure of Dr
Frederick Chilton
The extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls Dr
Lecter's own former restraints
His screams are muffled by the tape over his mouth; he stares at Dr
Lecter like a rabbit trapped in headlights
Considers him for a genial moment, then raises the little pen-knife
His eyes are twinkling
Well, Dr
Chilton
Shall we begin
