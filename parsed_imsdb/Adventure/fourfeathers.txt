Mason /  barracks/  - Day
Through a veil of dust we see two lines of uniformed cavalry, stretched out across the parade ground
There's a tense silence except for the occasional flourish of hooves
horseman steps out of each line
and   face each other across the wide expanse
Already we feel the keen sense of competition between them
raises his sabre first
His horse sets off at a slow trot
His troops follow in perfect time
waits a moment, then raises his own sword
sea of sabres rises up in response
The two lines approach each other at a steady canter
smile of anticipation lights up 's face
He's a born soldier, enjoying himself
looks more nervous
He's not as easy as Durrance in the saddle
It's a skill he's acquired over the years rather than been born to
seems to sense Harry's doubt
With a loud whoop he kicks his horse into a gallop and points his sabre forwards
His troops echo his war cry and descend on the opposing line at speed
checks his troops and responds
The two lines bear down on each other, hooves thundering, sabres pointed
charges recklessly
His eyes are fixed on Harry all the time
holds his gaze, but doesn't look as sure of himself
He's thinking too much, trying too hard
His horse senses it and slows a fraction
The troops behind him lose their cohesion as they draw level
sees the momentary lapse and waves his men on at full tilt
They pass through 's troops in a perfect line, panicking their mounts, cheering triumphantly
's formation loses its shape
There's no doubt who's won the drill
wheels his horse around and grins at  through the clouds of dust
Changing room/   - day
Moving through clouds of steam we see the   washing themselves in wooden bathtubs
There's a din of voices, soldiers re-living the day's drill, those on Durrance's side still crowing over their victory
walks with his arm around
With them is another friend,  , a squat bull of a man
How many does that make it Harry
harry It's not something  count
How many Trench
harry Trench can't count
grabs  in a neck hold
He lets go as he spots another friend of theirs,  , sitting in a bathtub, staring out
sneaks up on , and ducks his head under the water
comes up, spluttering
He reaches for a bar of soap and hurls it after
Idiot
's rooms/ barracks - day
fifth friend,  , stares at himself in the mirror
His hair like his uniform is perfect
There's a loud knocking on his door
trench o/s Miss Willoughby, Miss Willoughby we're waiting
finally stops preening himself as he hears his friends picking the lock
He gets up reluctantly, taking one last look at his reflection in the mirror
/   -
The  pour out of the barrack gates in full regimental unifom, a sea of gleaming red
We pick out , , , , and , laughing amongst themselves, taking turns to tease each other, inseperable
carriage/ HAnsom cab/ london streets - day
The friends share a flask of whisky as they sit in the back of the carriage
passes it on without taking a sip
harry Who are you planning to impress tonight
trench (Grinning) Anna What's-her-name
Anna What's-her-name's father more like
Don't think we're going to take you any more seriously when you're promoted
wILLOUGHBY (Quietly confident) We'll see about that
chorus of mocking 'ooohs' from the others
notices  staring out of the window
trench What's so interesting about a London street
(Reflecting) Ask me that when we're in Bombay
rolls his eyes and turns to
treNCH Is Ethne going to be there
We catch a hint of shyness in  at the mention of Ethne's name
think so
watches , a little uncomfortably, as if he's holding something back
/ india office building/ london - night
line the entrance to the India Office
in turbans and robes escort the  to the entrance, holding umbrellas over them
The five friends crowd under a single umbrella
makes sure he's in the middle, he doesn't want to get his uniform wet
nudges him into the rain
The Durbar court/ party/  office - night
Palm trees and fountains dominate the room
The ladies are dressed in ballgowns, the Officers in regimental colours
The full pomp and ceremony of Empire is on display
, , ,  and  have  gathered by the bar, a little overawed by the occasion
trench (Admiring the passing women) 'm going to ask someone to dance
willoughby (Admiring the passing Generals) You said that ten minutes ago
trench 'm waiting for Castelton
stares at the  , paralysed with shyness
trench (Pouring him another drink) Just look dreamy
'll do the talking
smiles as he listens to them
He turns to
Can you see Ethne
harry Not yet
seems uneasy again
We sense there's something on his mind, something he wants to tell Durrance
doesn't pick up on it
He finishes his whisky and looks back into the throng
Harry, your father
looks away from
He sees his father,  , shaking hands with some  across the room
seating area/ durbar court/ india office - night
is deep in conversation with his friend,  , a fellow veteran of the Crimean war
moves discreetly into their field of vision
(His face lighting up) Harry
Immediately we feel the bond between father and son
harry (Greeting Colonel Sutch) How are you Colonel
Fine Harry
Relieved to see a few familiar faces
When are you boys shipping out
harry Next month
Your father and  served in Bombay
There are worse places they could have sent you
harry Yes Sir
smiles politely
is sensitive enough to see that his mind is on other things
He lets father and son talk
Is Ethne here
Not yet
They both smile, as if they share a secret
reaches out and straightens his son's collar, trying to make him look as presentable as possible
dance area/ the durbar court/ india office - night
and  are dancing with two :  waltzing boisterously,  taking it all very seriously
another area/ durbar court/ india office - night
has found a place amongst a group of
He stands next to  , the Commander of their regiment
If  had a choice we'd be on our way to the Sudan
Deal with this Dervish uprising once and for all
2nd colonel You prefer a tour in the Sudan to India Willoughby
wILLOUGHBY don't know about that Sir, but  agree with Colonel Hamilton, we're going to have to fight the Mahdi sooner or later
trails off, leaving   to continue
bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night
downs another whisky
He looks less sure of himself in this social whirl than he did in the barracks
few  cast admiring glances in his direction but he doesn't notice them
His eyes keep searching the crowd for Ethne

's eyes search the crowd as soon as she walks through
She stops as she sees  at the bar
Her eyes stay on him a moment, but it's only to see if Harry's nearby
When she realises he isn't she looks away
Finally she sees him, standing with   and
She takes her father 's hand, and leads him in their direction

Your sole purpose in life is to annoy me
trench She couldn't see me
could see you
can see you everywhere  look
Pulling those stupid faces at me
willoughby Now Ladies
joins in the laughter but he seems distracted
He takes another gulp of whisky and looks around the crowd
His eyes stop as he sees
smile lights up his face, but it's short lived
Across the courtyard  appears, greeting
Their hands touch briefly
The noise fades in 's head
He stares in silence
shakes 's hand warmly
slaps him on the back, as if he's congratulating him
's eyes take in the smallest details now
Even though he can't hear a word, the scene before him reveals itself more and more clearly
raises his glass
, , and   respond
and  move closer, a little coyly, as if the toast is for them
looks pale
We feel the disappointment in his eyes as he realises what's happened
's arm moves around Ethne's waist, a libery that can only mean they're engaged
fountain area/ durbar court/ india office - night
and  glance at each other tenderly
Did you tell them
harry was waiting for you
Not even Jack
harry Not even Jack
The two of them look towards  for the first time
bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night
looks up as  and  make their way through the crowd
He gathers himself, and walks towards them, concealing his feelings: Congratulations
harry How did you know
Nothing escapes me Harry
(Kissing  on both cheeks) 'm delighted for you both
Harry wanted to tell you before anyone else
It's my fault
asked him to wait
'll still blame him
hARRY (Relieved that his friend's taking it so well) You were the one who introduced us
Did
'll be more careful next time
takes  in his arms, slapping him on the back
, , and  appear behind them, realising something's up
turns to them, beaming: Three guesses for Trench, one for everyone else
The friends let out a cheer as they realise what's happened
They crowd  and , congratulating them

sweeps  and  towards the dancefloor
trench (As if they have to dance in public as a punishment) Over there
Where we can see you
And remember you're not married yet
takes  in his arms
harry (Smiling ironically) Alone at last
claps loudly as they dance
looks embarrassed by his friend
Behind them  congratulates  and
bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night
watches the celebrations from the bar
He's smiling to himself, but it's the glazed smile of someone who's forcing himself to be happy
quiet voice interrupts him: o/s Wonderful news isn't it
turns around to see , Ethne's friend, gazing at him
(Smiling automatically) Yes it is
Had Harry told you
knew it was just a matter of time
(Changing the conversation) What can  get you to drink
Nothing thank you
(Nervous under her gaze) 'd ask you to dance, only 'm not sure how steady  am on my feet
(With the quiet confidence of an older woman) 'd love to dance
grins sheepishly, at a loss, as he is with most women

The waltz is in full swing
All the friends are out on the dance floor
spins his  around energetically, exchanging glances with other women as they pass
stares into his partner's eyes, already in love
dances with an elderly , probably some General's wife
waltzes with , avoiding her meaningful glances, looking over her shoulder for Harry and Ethne
/ india office building/ london - night
The rain pours in torrents
and  stand in the shadows of the building
Harry tries to kiss her and hold an umbrella over her at the same time
What if  hold the umbrella
harry 'd have to kneel
Nothing wrong with that
hands her the umbrella, bending under it
(With irony as he kisses her more and more passionately) You're very distant tonight
harrY 'm locked in a barracks room all day
What are you going to do in India
harrY Take you with me
Hindu wedding
harry Why not
Not on your life
She walks away with the umbrella, leaving him exposed in the rain
want the full works
The Church near my home
long speech from you
An entire regiment crossing swords
harry (Drenched) Done
don't believe you
makes a rush and grabs her, eneveloping her in his arms
You're soaking wet
Whose fault is that
squirms but loses herself in his embrace
As they start to kiss they're suddenly interrupted by 's braying voice in the distance
trench o/s ( regimental song) Goodnight, Ladies
goodnight, Ladies
goodnight, Ladies, we hate to see you go
shakes his head in despair
, castelton, willoughby and durrance together o/s Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along
Merrily we roll along, until the morning comes
smiles
Duty calls
feels the quiet regret in her voice
harry We've two days leave before we sail
Once  tell them we're engaged 'm sure they'll give me more
As long as you promise to make me miserable
Argue with me all the time so  don't miss you a bit
Her lightness is forced
harrY You'll be fine
You don't have to reassure me
'm a soldier's daughter
Everything under control
harry 've never kissed a stiff upper lip before
's  bellows out again as they kiss: trench o/s Goodnight, Ethne's
goodnight, Harry's
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
and  ignore him, the rain falling all around them
/   - night
The regimental song turns into a deafening roar
All around the mess hall,  are laughing and banging on tables
and  stand on wobbly stools, downing pints of beer
As soon as their glasses are empty they set off down the hall at a sprint
It's an obstacle course
The two friends duck under two long tables, and crawl on their bellies, towards two more glasses
and  are busy laying bets on who'll win
and  step over a bridge of chairs
They have to find a pint of beer hidden under one of them
finds his first
looks at  smugly, convinced he's going to win
and  step-walk over two long benches
falls off
overtakes him
He throws his head back and finishes off another pint
stands up, cheering
and  are level as they reach the last glass
As they start to drink  stops, spluttering
harry This isn't beer, it's whisky
trench Down in one
drinks again, but he's fallen behind
The pint of whisky disappears down 's throat
Grinning, he makes his way towards the finish line
pours the whisky over his head, conceding defeat
/  barracks/  - Day
An obstacle course of a different kind
The  are training, galloping at full tilt,  and  bringing up the front
At the sound of a bugle, they dismount their horses, and sprint towards a row of bayonets
They snatch up the weapons and charge a row of dummies
In
Out
On guard
The blades tear into the dummies, exposing soft leaves and hard wood
Hold the line
and charge
The  charge towards a second set of targets
Teeth bared, they drive their bayonets into the stuffed dummies
's blade sticks in a chunk of wood
In and out, Castelton, in and out
pulls in frustation
He can't get the bayonet loose
They're coming at you boy
Rip it out or they'll stick you first
puts his foot on the dummy's head and tries to wrench the blade free
Even though it's only a training exercise, his panic is real
slows down as he watches his friend struggling in vain
Move on Trench
Castelton's dead
Enemy spear through his throat
The  continue, bayonets thrust forward, leaving the struggling  behind
/ training ground/ westminster barracks - day
The men are washing up after exercises, dousing themselves with cold water
Everyone's teasing , except for
For once he keeps quiet, knowing how hard his friend's taking it
- enters and salutes
- Gentlemen
fifteen minutes, in the briefing room
As he leaves, the  look at each other curiously
/ westminster barracks - day
The Officers are assembled
, , , , and , take their places on the wooden benches
As he sits  notices a map of Africa behind Colonel Hamilton
Gentlemen
(when the room settles down) The 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards have been ordered to forego their posting to India
(Off murmurs of surprise) We ship out in three days, to establish a forward garrison in the Sudan
There's a buzz of excitement
can hardly contain his smile
He turns to  : General Holmby, Sir
, a severe looking military man, stands and faces the
Their eyes are lit-up with anticipation, all except Harry, who stares ahead, slowly turning inward
'd like to apologise for not giving you men more notice
know many of you will find it hard to see your families now
Unfortunately we had no alternative
He turns to the map and points out the Sudanese desert
gENERAL Three days ago, an army of Egyptian reserves led by General Hicks, was ambushed at Tashgil by the Mahdi's forces
Upoun attack the Egyptians fled, leaving General Hicks and the British Officers with him, to fight a heroic, but in the end hopeless rearguard action
All of them died, sword in hand
stares out silently, his whole world turned upside down
geNERAL hesitate to call this a mission of vengeance, but the honour of our country is at stake
This Government has finally seen fit to send its own troops to war
There's loud cheering from the men now, regimental pride and bravado covering any trace of nerves
/ westinster barracks - sunset
The  pour out into the courtyard, still exhilirated by the thought of seeing war
We hear 's voice rising above the others
trench wish  had more than one life to give for my country
Two would make me feel a lot safer
laughs with the others, hiding his mounting anxiety
and 's /  -
Laughter filters into Harry and Durrance's room
The two of them lie in their beds, watching the embers die out in the fireplace
(Gazing up at the ceiling where the noise is coming from) listen to them laugh, and  can't help wondering which ones won't be coming back
The worse part is  think  even know who they are
haRRY Am  one
Of course not Harry
You're one of the lucky ones
Always have been
picks up the reference to Ethne but doesn't say anything
More laughter filters through
stares out in the darkness, tormented
What are you thinking
harry (Hesitating) 'm wondering what a Godforesaken desert in the middle of nowhere has to do with her Majesty the Queen
Ask Willoughby
He's on the Colonel's staff
harry know what he'll say: 'It's not for us to question
' ( beat) Do you ever ask yourself why you're going
Not for the Queen
hardly know her
(He smiles softly) Nor for the regiment
There isn't much of a military tradition in my family
( beat) suppose 'm going because you're going
You, and Trench, and Castelton, and Willoughby
( big grin) Not much of a reason  know, but it reassures me
smiles, but Durrance's words only make him feel more ashamed of the fear he feels inside
harry Is there anything that frightens you, Jack
'm frightened of not coming back in one piece
Much more than dying
wouldn't know what to do with myself in a wheel chair
And  couldn't stand to be pitied
He puts the thought out of his head and grins
There's a Church near our house
Next to the pub
Every night at ten the drunks spill out, shouting at the top of their voices
That's where  want to be buried
Where  can hear them
harry Nothing's going to happen to you
It's out of our hands anyway
Might as well sleep easy
rolls on his side
looks back at the fireplace, as the last embers fade
- dawn
cold blue light hangs over the barracks
The courtyard is empty, except for a few sentries on duty
Wagons pull in, loaded with supplies
and 's /  - dawn
buttons his uniform
He looks as if he hasn't slept
He turns to
His friend is still asleep
hesitates
He wants to wake him up, and talk, but in the end he turns away, and leaves the room

Harry walks slowly toward the Regimental Office
He glances up at the Regimental flag, flying beside the Union Jack
ADCs' /    - dawn
looks up from his desk as  walks in
willoughby (Grinning) Harry
You're up early
smiles awkwardly but doesn't say anything
senses something's wrong
willoughby (Concerned) What's the matter
looks at him for a moment, but then turns to Colonel Hamilton's other --
'd like to see the Colonel please
stares in confusion
The -- disappears into the next door office
still can't bring himself to look at his friend
willoughby Harry, what's wrong
He's interrupted as the -- walks back in
-- The Colonel will see you, sir
harry Thank you
walks into Hamilton's office
stares after him, bewildered
's office - day
glances at the letter  has just given him
He stops reading after only a few words
What the hell is this
My papers, sir
wish to resign my commission
doesn't appear to understand
He looks back at the piece of paper, as if he's misread something
If it's leave you want, there's a different procedure
Normally  wouldn't consider it in the circumstances, but given you've got engaged
(Interrupting politely) don't want any leave Sir
wish to resign my commission
long silence
calmly puts the letter aside, and returns to his work, ignoring
harry Sir
It's nerves
We all have them
Sir, 've made up my mind
And 'm asking you to reconsider
have considered, sir
And 've decided to leave the service
Come back to me when you've discussed it with your father
It's not his decision, sir
explodes, all his repressed fury pouring out
do not accept these "papers," Lieutenant -- and do not accept that one of my men -- the son of a man with whom  was honored to serve -- would walk out on his Regiment -- Sir -- -- on the very eve we're shipping off to war
(holding out the papers) Take these back
will not, sir
Dead silence
harry wish to resign my commission
stares at  for what seems an eternity
He's struggling to make sense of something beyond his comprehension
Slowly he gathers himself and lowers his eyes, looking down at Harry's papers: Very well
Then as the coward and disgrace you are, you may take yourself out of my office
(Signing Harry's papers) Please leave the barracks at once
You're belongings will be sent on
Face drained of color, Harry turns and leaves
ADCs' /    - dawn
As the door opens,  stares at , speechless
lowers his eyes and walks on

walks down the stairway, gripping the bannisters
Two  salute him on their way up, but he doesn't respond

The supply wagons are being unloaded in the courtyard
walks between more , his eyes fixed on the barrack gates
The only sound he hears in his head is the gentle flapping of a flag
and 's /  - day
is packing his trunk, neat and fastidious, taking his time over every item
waits for him impatiently
trench Why can't you do this after breakfast
We're not leaving till tonight
ignores him, folding his shirts
turns to , exasperated
trench He packs three bibles
Can you believe it
Three bibles
grins
He glances up as  enters
Field Marshall Willoughby
doesn't smile
He looks ashen faced
What's the matter
and  look up
willoughby It's Harry
(He still can't believe it) He's resigned
trench Resigned what
willoughby (Snapping at Trench) His bloody commission
What do you think
There's a long silence
No-one knows quite what to say
finally speaks
What did Hamilton do
Refuse him leave
willoughby Hamilton didn't do anything
Harry went to see him of his own accord
Right after they changed our deployment
looks at , as the insinuation sinks in
trENCH It's just a coincidence
He's having second thoughts about leaving Ethne
willoughby He was happy to leave her behind when we were going to India
No doubts then
(Jumping to Harry's defence) What's that supposed to mean
willoughby You tell me
He resigns his commission the very day we're sent to war
Harry's the best soldier in this regiment
wILLOUGHBY Obviously not when it counts
Why don't you say that to his face
(Intervening) We don't know the circumstances yet
(Reasoning with Willoughby) think we should give Harry a chance to explain
willoughby (Bitterly) Harry's gone
He left this morning
Whilst you were all asleep
turns away in frustration
He's as upset as the others, but he shows it in anger
and  look stunned
stares ahead in silence
trench Did he say anything to you, Jack
(Quietly) No
Nothing
remembers his conversation with Harry the previous night
An action like this dishonors the entire Regiment
(Suddenly venting his anger on Willoughby) Will you forget about your bloody Regiment for once
Alright then, it dishonours us
He stares at  with conviction
willoughby He was my friend too, Jack
( beat) but a man who isn't prepared to give his life for his friends, isn't a man at all
From the look on their faces, it's clear  and  are beginning to agree with him
wILLOUGHBY This has to be answered
shakes his head, refusing to turn on Harry
He storms out of the room
to  - night
The whistle of a train
sits in a crowded carriage, looking stiff in his civilian clothes
He glances out of the window, but sees only his own reflection in the glass
ethne's carriage/  - day
drives the carriage through the country lanes, overjoyed to see
How many days leave have they given you
harry How many days would you like
They shouldn't have let you out of their sight
'm going to kidnap you
harry thought as much
This doesn't look like the way to your house
laughs happily
can't quite bring himself to tell her yet
village church near ethne's home - day
Dappled light shines in the small stone Church
takes  under the arm, and walks him up the aisle
harry Isn't this supposed to be bad luck
Seeing me in the wedding dress is bad luck
This is practice
looks towards the church benches, as if she's greeting the guests
harrY So 'm playing your father
You have to be a little less steady on your feet
He's had a few to drink
harry (Taking slow deliberate steps) How is he
Fine
He'll be thrilled to see you
lets go of his hand as they reach the altar
She walks around him, and takes his other hand, as if he's the groom now
"Do you Harry Feversham -- harrY (Skipping the rest) -- You may kiss the bride
" He tries to kiss her
(Laughing) You can't jump ahead like that
You have to let me enjoy my wedding
It's your fault the real one isn't for another year
hesitates, finally seeing his opportunity
harry There's nothing to stop us getting married whenever we like, Ethne
've handed in my papers
long silence
stares at him, not sure she's understood
When
harry Yesterday
'd been thinking about it for a while
Why didn't you tell me
Was it because of me
Because of you
Because of me
couldn't see the point of continuing
The moment  fell in love with you my career in the army was over
would have supported your career
My mother did the same for my father
It's what's always been expected of me
harry didn't think it was what you wanted
still looks conflicted
It is my fault Harry
gave you the wrong impression
'm really much more stoical than that
It wouldn't have been easy, but 'd have coped
love you far too much to let a year make a difference
hARRY It wasn't what  wanted for us
( hint of guilt as he hides the whole truth from her) love this place
love you in this place
We'll help your father with the farm
We'll get it going again
We'll begin our lives together
is silent, moved by his words
harrY All  want is for you to be happy
(The smile slowly returns to her face) am happy Harry
She rests her head in his arms again
As long as you're sure
hARRY Of course 'm sure
He holds her close, kissing her hair, hiding his eyes from her

Whoa
You ought to train these beasts Dermod

Trained them to scare away prospective son in laws
and  hug each other, already like father and son
/ '   - hands  some letters and a parcel as she enters the house
follows her up the stairs
Which room do you want
harry The one with the connecting doors
You must have imagined that one
the guest room/ ethne's house
day
Sunlight fills the room as  throws open the blinds
He takes a long look at the fields outside
(Glancing through her letters) see you've moved in already
harry Why
This one's addressed to you
She holds out the small parcel
walks over curiously
(Teasing him) secret admirer
harry (Teasing her back) wonder which one it is
'll open it, thank you
She undoes the wrapping
There's a small white box underneath
She opens the lid
There's nothing inside, except three white feathers, pinned to three visiting cards
's about to make a joke when she suddenly sees how pale  looks
What is it
(Looking at the feathers again) What does this mean
(Slowly) That there are some things that can't be hidden
(Beginning to look worried) don't understand
harry These are feathers of cowardice
laughs, nervously
What a horrible joke
harry It isn't a joke Ethne
They were sent in earnest
By whom
Who sent them
(Her anger rising) How dare they
harry (Reading the cards) Willoughby, Trench, and Castelton
You see it is a joke
They're your friends
She looks to  for confirmation
(All he can say) You're the most important thing to me
(Panicked by his tone) Why are you saying that to me now
What is it Harry
harry We were told on Tuesday night that the regiment would be shipping out to the Sudan instead of India
That we'd be seeing war within a week
handed in my resignation the following morning
There's a long silence as  takes it in
Like Durrance she won't accept it
don't believe that's why you resigned
You wouldn't have come to me like this
You wouldn't have been able to look me in the eye
stares at her guiltily, tormented
(The tears shining in her eyes) don't believe you
Three white feathers and our world is at an end
It can't be that simple
And still he doesn't answer
Please Harry
You have to answer these charges
harry (Finally) can't
All my life 've been following a path that's filled me with dread
kept going because of the people behind me, and the people beside me, but all  wanted to do was turn and run
didn't even have the courage to do that until  met you
Don't use me as an excuse
harry Ethne -- (Pulling away from him) -- This afternoon you told me you left the army because of me
Or at least you made me believe it
Tell me the truth
Would you have resigned if we weren't engaged
There's a long silence
These are the hardest words Harry's ever had to speak
harry Yes
would have resigned
wouldn't have gone to war for anything
stares at him a moment, then removes her engagement ring from her finger, and holds it out to him
've no right to call you a coward, but you are a liar
Please take this back
takes the ring without protest
turns and walks away
As she leaves she sets the feathers on the table, and closes the door behind her
listens to her footsteps fade
He walks towards the table
As he looks down he sees four feathers
Ethne has snapped the fourth from her fan
Very carefully, as if they were the most precious objects in the world,  gathers them, his eyes shining with tears

Congratulations, it seems you had another successful day

'm giving you three weeks leave
looks surprised

You certainly deserve it, every report  receive singles you out for praise
With your permission, 'd like to stay here with the rest of the regiment
Permission refused
is too disciplined a soldier to protest
Anyway the rest of the regiment is stuck here in Suakin until the Government agrees to send us to Khartoum
(Containing his frustration) You and several other Officers will be going to London, to convince parliament, and more importantly public opinion, that it is necessary to pursue this campaign with the utmost vigour
Do you have any questions
Yes Sir, why me
pauses
Then almost mischievously: Because you're a hero
With all due respect Sir,  don't think we've been fighting long enough to have any heroes in this campaign
That's my point
It's all about perception

He salutes and turns to leave

The Dervishes' eyes seem to follow  wherever he goes, staring out at him through their slit Djellabas

He wheels around to see a huge   towering over him

He's been picked out as a pale looking Arab, one that might pass as a British officer from a distance
As he looks around he sees other  , grinning at him, wearing their own blood stained British uniforms
kneels beside the slaughtered British soldiers
One of them still has his pipe stuffed between his teeth

The   screams, but all that comes out is a terrible hissing sound
clamps his hand over the 's mouth and bends his head backwards
As they tumble to the ground,  twists the knife in deeper
The Dervish bites down in agony, drawing a stream of blood from Harry's knuckles
rams his fist deeper into the man's throat, choking him slowly
Meanwhile his knife hand tears its way out of the Dervish's gut, and plunges back into his thigh
The 's eyes water in pain and fear
stares at him, crushing his spirit with his own unflinching gaze
As he feels the man's grip weaken, he pulls away sharply, and swings the knife down with all his force
The blade sticks in the  's chest, sending his eyes spinning out of focus, forcing a rush of blood out of his mouth
watches in horror, as the man's eyes roll around, desperately trying to find their focus, then stop still
He feels his enemy's dying breath on his face, and hears a horrible sucking sound, as he withdraws the knife
's arm is elbow deep in gore
He turns away and tries to retch, but nothing comes out
He stays like that for a moment, bent over the bloody sand, contemplating what he's just done
Finally he gathers himself, grabs the dead man by the ankles, and drags him further into the stable

He starts crawling away on his hand and knees
He crawls right into a mud bath of Dervish dead

The screams of the wounded   echo all around the hospital ship

You ought to see a specialist once we're back
Is it part of your treatment to offer false hope
Only for some
(reaching in his pocket) This came for you
He hands over a letter
sticks it in his top pocket
'll read it later

He hands the letter back to  to read for him
(Glancing over it) "Dear James,  hold in my heart all you have written me"

Don't
There's something strident in Durrance's voice, a brittleness that hides the insecurity inside
continues: "Knowing you as  do, and convinced as  am of your affections,  wish to go back on my previous fears
'm writing now, to let you know how grateful  am to have you in my life -- and to say, with all my heart, how much  wish to be in yours
With all my love, Ethne
" , lowers the letter, quietly moved
Congratulations
stares out quietly
knew a man once who went blind, a good man too, before
year after you wouldn't have recognised him
He was the most selfish, exacting, egotistical human being you could ever meet
wouldn't wish him on anyone
He smiles ironically, hiding the heartbreak inside
The one thing  want most in this life, finally comes to me when  can no longer accept it

stares out of the drawing room window, waiting
Her friend  sits at a table, pretending to be absorbed in her book, listening just as intently
There's the jingle of a carriage outside
That's him

turns away from the window
Maybe you should have gone to the station to meet him
He might have thought  was going because  imagined he was helpless
don't want him to feel like that
There's a quiet resolve in Ethne's voice, as if she's been mulling over her future life with Durrance
The doorbell rings
That must be him
gets up to answer the door
walks to the window
Her movements are nervous, her eyes tense
The door finally opens
walks in, alone
As soon as  leaves the window he turns around and looks straight at her
(Startled) It isn't true then, you can see
(Gently) It's perfectly true
can't see a thing
stops, feeling guilty
You moved from the window, that's how  knew
hardly made a noise
No, but the window was open
The noise outside grew louder
She tries to answer his smile
Let me get you some tea, and then we can talk
(Sensing her tension) Yes, we have a lot to talk about
's hand trembles as she pours the tea
interprets every sound
She picks up the cup and walks over with a smile, holding it out for him
hate to sound humble, but  don't trust myself with a cup of tea yet
feels stupid again
She sets the cup down on a table
(Gently) You're not bound, you know
There's a pause
knows exactly what he means
Bound by what
wouldn't dream of holding you to your letter
Or a committment you made to a different man
stares at him in surprise, and then in quiet admiration
You're not a different man
don't say it begrudgingly
'm not being particularly noble or heroic either
It's something 've thought about long and hard -- Jack -- -- Please hear me out
(With difficulty) 'm thinking of myself as much as you
have to learn to accept what's happened
have to learn to respect the person 've become
The only way to do that is to start again
Why does it have to be without me
Her words make him hesitate
Because if  was with you, 'd spend every moment wondering how you really felt about me
If you don't know how  feel about you, then that's a good reason to call off our wedding
Your blindness isn't
She stares at him, determined
looks touched by her devotion, but still doesn't feel worthy of her love
It has to be more than mere obligation Ethne, or even friendship
It has to be more than that
suddenly reaches out and touches his face
stops as he feels her fingers
He's lost for a moment, unsure of himself
leans forward and kisses him, tenderly at first, but then more and more passionately, proving herself to him, proving herself to herself
kisses her back, close to tears

sharp clatter of hooves
rides his horse with the help of a , his face fixed in concentration
and  watch him from the patio
(Gazing at him proudly) He seems to need his eyes less and less each day
It's incredible
Nothing escapes him
Sometimes  think he reads me like a book
You no longer have your face to screen your thoughts
doesn't notice the edge in her voice
She's lost in her own thoughts
climbs off his horse and strides towards them, looking pleased with himself
(Wrapping Ethne in his arms) You smell wonderful
And you smell like a horse
Go wash
keeps smiling, even after  has gone
watches her friend quietly, fighting the jealousy she feels within

Your father told me you were here
'm sorry  came unannounced,  needed to talk to you alone
doesn't reply or return his smile
seems to read her thoughts
wILLOUGHBY understand how you feel, Ethne
All  can say is that we never set out to hurt you
What happened was between us and Harry, not the two of you
(Coldly) What do you want, Tom
hesitates, bracing himself
wILLOUGHBY 've seen Harry
In Suakin
He asked me to give you these
He holds out
stares at them, unable to speak, her whole world turned upside down
wILLOUGHBY He risked his life to save our regiment
He fought as if he'd been born to it
've come to tell you 've withdrawn my accusation of cowardice against him, along with Castelton's
(All she cares about) Is Harry dead
wILLOUGHBY He was fine when  saw him
He'd changed a great deal but he was in good health
Changed how
wILLOUGHBY didn't spend much time with him
don't know what else to tell you Ethne
Tell me everything Tom
Please

and  sit on a bench in the garden maze

We were two miles short of Abou Klea when we were ambushed
We managed to hold off the enemy, but at a terrible cost

The     in Arab robes hovers over him
Get lost

wILLOUGHBY (Looking up furiously) Didn't you bloody hear me
Get lost
suddenly stops
He stares at the Arab as if in a dream
wILLOUGHBY Harry
stares back at him through his black desert robes
sent a man to you with a warning from Abou Klea
You wouldn't listen to him
You had him tortured instead
The confusion and shock bring pent-up tears to 's eyes
He told you a British Officer had sent him
Even if you didn't believe him, what would it have cost to take precautions
What more did  have to do
wILLOUGHBY (As the horror sinks in) didn't know Harry
didn't know it was you
(He still can't believe his eyes) What are you doing here in God's name
What are you doing
opens his hand to reveal a soiled white feather
stares at it, in bewilderment at first,then slowly beginning to understand
wILLOUGHBY (He gazes at the feather as if it's the symbol of his own disgrace now) Give me the others
Give them to me
harry They're not yours to take back
looks up at him through his tears
There's no condemnation in Harry's eyes, but no sympathy either
His experiences have changed him, turned him into a harder man
maze/ caroline's house - day
gazes silently at the feathers in her hand
wILLOUGHBY He'd followed us all the way from Alexandria, looking for an opportunity to redeem himself
It was only after he left that  found out an Arab matching his description had also saved Jack Durrance's life
looks up in surprise

That was the way Harry wanted it

thinks she's staring at the medals on his chest
wILLOUGHBY (Embarrassed) tried to turn them down
told the committee 'd done nothing to deserve them
They didn't care
think they pick their heroes' names out of a hat
(Trying to ease her pain) You asked me how he'd changed
All  can say is that you would have been proud of him
should have been proud of him before
Or at least  should have tried to understand
willoughby You can't blame yourself
Why not, if you can
(She won't forgive herself) We all misjudged him, but  had the least excuse
He was the man  was supposed to love
Suddenly a voice calls out: /s Ethne
They turn around, startled
stands at the entrance to the maze
gets up nervously
(Whispering urgently) Please,  don't want him to know you're here
stops
looks in their direction
wILLOUGHBY (In disbelief) He can see us
He can't see a thing
reaches out and feels the hedge, finding his bearings, taking slow steps into the maze: Ethne
keeps quiet
Ethne
She watches , wracked with guilt
wILLOUGHBY (Beginning to panic) 've got to say something
Be quiet

Durrance's voice fades in the distance
(Struggling with her emotions) didn't want him to find out what you just told me
wILLOUGHBY Harry was his best friend -- -- 'm engaged to Jack
'm going to marry him
stares in surprise
wILLOUGHBY knew he'd proposed,  had no idea you'd accepted
(Considering the implications) 'd never have told you if  knew
'm sure Harry wouldn't have wanted me to
'm glad you did
needed to know
(Looking at him) Do you know where Harry is now
hesitates
wILLOUGHBY He didn't tell me anything;  didn't feel  had a right to ask -- -- Please, tell me the truth
There's no anger in her voice, only concern
looks torn
wILLOUGHBY Some of our men were taken prisoner
The Dervishes took them South, in case we tried a rescue
Trench was among the missing
smiles sadly, as if she has her answer
wILLOUGHBY (Trying to give her hope) Harry may be determined but he isn't mad
He'll look for Trench and then he'll come back
He'll do whatever he has to do
There are still two feathers left

From her window,  sees  and , saying goodbye, walking off in different directions
As  approaches the house,  sees her gazing at something in her hand

walks down the stairs

(Forcing a smile) He was a friend of father's
He apologised for not introducing himself
He was in a hurry

She notices the two white feathers in Ethne's hand
/ 's house - night
sits at the piano stool, still gazing at the feathers in her hand
She hears voices in the corridor
It's Durrance, asking Caroline where she is
hears his footsteps approaching
She lifts up the piano lid and starts to play
The living room door opens
ignores the quiet footsteps behind her
She feels  listening to every note
His hands cover her eyes gently
(Trying to smile) Who could that be
She removes his hands from her eyes, and kisses them
sits down beside her on the piano stool
What were you playing
The Melusine overture
Cheerful stuff
He grins and starts to play the tune, perfectly
looks on in admiration, trying to hide her feelings
Join me
'd rather listen
Please
Reluctantly  starts to accompany him
They say you can tell a woman's heart by the way she plays
What if she can't play at all
It isn't how well you play, it's how passionately you stroke the keys
presses the keys harder, pretending it's a joke, worried that he might see through her
'd say you're in love
Even though it's said in jest, his words stick like a knife
The notes torture her
She suddenly gets up and walk away from the piano
(Following her footsteps) Where are you going
want to hear you play on your own
moment's silence
Then  turns back to the piano and starts to play -- quietly, tenderly
The haunting music breaks Ethne's heart
Almost involuntarily she starts to walk away from him, towards the open patio doors
(With a sudden flourish of the keys) There you go, 'm in love too
He swivels around and beams at her joyfully
stares back at him, unable to speak
(Gazing at her adoringly) These past few days have been the best days of my life, blind or otherwise
His eyes shine in the candlelight, full of new-found hope
Before  came here 'd given up
put on all kinds of fronts and defences, but deep down  was petrified
had no idea what was going on around me, what people were thinking behind my back
imagined the worst, so that nothing would surprise me, no-one would catch me out
He walks closer
You've made me realise  can't live like that
Whether one can see or not, there's no way of knowing how people really feel about you, all you can do is put yourself in their hands, and trust them unconditionally
can't speak
know how much you loved Harry
( beat) for the first time 'm not afraid to admit it, 'm not not afraid to bring it up between us
( beat) 'm not afraid, because of you Ethne, because of the way you've made me feel
He waits for an answer but all that greets him is silence
As he steps closer he suddenly loses her presence
touch of panic enters his voice: Ethne
The only sound he hears is the wind on the curtains
We see for the first time that Ethne's left, through the open patio doors
Ethne
He turns around sharply as he hears a noise
stands in the doorway
walks towards her
(Touching her arm) thought you'd disappeared
It's Caroline
Ethne's gone
pulls back, embarrassed
'm sorry
She must be in the garden
(Trying to sound lighthearted) She was here a minute ago
It must have been something  said
(Every word is calculated) don't think it was anything you said
She's been upset all afternoon
Ever since she spoke to Lieutenant Willoughby
Willoughby
He looks perplexed
Willoughby was here
Why didn't he come and see me
thought he did
saw you walking into the maze to join them
She feels the impact on him -- the fact that he called out and no-one answered
(Trying to justify it to himself) He must have had his reasons
He brought her two white feathers
That's all  know
looks up, startled
Harry
watches his unseeing eyes trying to make sense of what's happened
She feels a touch of remorse as she sees him struggling with his emotions
Finally he looks up: Ethne obviously didn't want me to know
(Curiously) Why did you tell me
hesitates
thought you should know
You're her friend
Yours too  hope
stares at her in silence, her intentions slowly becoming clear to him
You're not fair to Ethne
Are you
Her meaning is clear
Her words sting him deeply
How much of our conversation did you overhear
Enough
Then you should know  meant every word
(more with pity than anger) love and trust Ethne unconditionally
Whatever doubts she's feeling,  know she'll resolve them
(With quiet dignity) 've put myself in her hands
long silence
doesn't need to see  to know she's in tears
The only reason  told you, was because you mean the world to me

declines
You're surprised by the women
doesn't need to answer, his face says it all
They're always the most cruel
Amongst the Southern Tribes it's the custom for them to go into battle first, calling the men cowards until they're ready to fight

looks up to find   grinning at him
The woman you spoke of
Go back to her
Tell her you're ready

There are very few of them left

This time  takes the bowl and swallows the rancid meat as if it's nothing

Your Army abandoned them
The shame is no longer yours

(Coldly) Twelve British soldiers were taken by boat from here to Omdurman last month
haRRY Shoukhran
You're a foolish man
Even for a British Officer
hARRY (Smiling) 'God protects the fool'

All  want is to be imprisoned there

You will die before your time

Why should you give your life for his
harry Because he'd do the same for me
No matter what had passed between us
(Looking at the Nubian) hope 'd do the same for you too
have no need of such friends
The Nubian returns to his food, betraying no sentiment
reaches into his pocket and holds out five shilling coins
(Disdainfully) You owe me two shillings a day
This is too much

Their leader, a sickly looking , smokes a hashish pipe as he listens to his men recounting their feats of war

The crowd clears a space for the two lunatics to dance

He echoes her movements, staring into her deadened eyes
The  pushes them closer together
feels an overwhelming sense of pity and dread
The dreamlike intensity is getting to him
The tragic creature, shimmying before his eyes, is like a grotesque reminder of the woman he loved and lost
The  starts murmuring to herself
As he listens,  realises she's singing -- a tuneless lament, remembered from long ago, sung without any understanding now
The emotion wells up in 's eyes, even as he laughs at her
It's as if he's gazing into a crazy, distorted mirror

Hundreds of shapes move forward in the darkness
At first they look like a herd of animals, but slowly we recognise the grunts and cries as human
Faces come at us out of the dark, screaming and cursing, shoving each other violently, raising their faces to the ceiling, gasping for air
As our eyes adjust to the light, the vision of hell intensifies
The  are manacled and herded into a space no more than thirty feet wide
They circle the room in a clockwise direction, pushed on by each other in perpetual motion, afraid that if they stop they'll be sucked under the maelstrom and trampled underfoot
The most fortunate are those who've found a resting space in the corners of the room
They cling to the walls, fighting off anyone who tries to share their sanctuary
From somewhere amongst them we hear a familiar voice: trench Get away
This is Ibrahim's space
protects his corner, lashing out at anyone who tries to breach the space
He bellows at the top of his voice: trENCH Ibrahim, where are you
voice answers from the heaving mass
holds out his hand and drags his friend, , out of the scrum

You musn't fall
As if to prove his point, a fight breaks out at the far side of the room
stands on tiptoes, as eager as everyone else to see the outcome
try to strangle each other with their chains, fighting for an inch of space
It's hard to make out anything in the dark, but the savagery of the fight is reflected in the speed of flailing fists and feet
One of the  finally loses his footing
In an instant he's sucked under
The victor laughs maniacally
The loser's cries continue for a moment and then stop suddenly as the trampling feet break his neck
turns to Ibrahim, with the knowing look of an expert

Get back
The  closest to the door push away
The head guard, the towering --, tosses in a blazing torch to clear some space
is flung inside and the door slammed shut behind him
The other  surge back, trying to reclaim their space
There are cries of pain as some of them tread on the blazing torch
The sheer weight of men quickly puts it out

From his corner  looks on grimly

As he approaches 's corner he tries to claw his way to safety
beats him back with a flurry of blows
The prisoner disappears under the heaving bodies, but then he pops up again, gasping for breath
He fights with all his might, swinging his fists, clutching at anyone in his way
looks impressed, but he knows it won't be long

Youssef will get him
As the   swings towards them again, the prisoner behind him, , slams his chains down on his head
The new arrival goes down hard
As he disappears, he screams out the name: "Trench
" stares in disbelief, frozen for a moment, then bellowing like a bull, he charges out of his corner and flails his way through the heaving mass, trying to retrieve the fallen prisoner
Help me Ibrahim
The tall Arab fights his way to Trench
Together they pull the   to his feet
They take him under each arm and fall in with the moving mass
treNCH We've lost our place
You mustn't fall
The man almost collapses, but  holds him up
He and Ibrahim keep walking the prisoner, trying to keep him conscious, knowing they have to fight till daybreak now

The sound of early morning prayers drifts into the House of Stone
Sunbeams pick out bloodmarks and broken nails where prisoners have tried to claw their way to safety
Half a dozen  lie crushed on the floor, those who didn't make it through the night

The man opens his lips to swallow it
treNCH Don't drink
It's dirty
Your body isn't strong enough
Beads of sweat shine on the bearded man's ravaged face
studies his features, wondering who he is
He digs out a copper coin from his shoe

sets off towards , who's busy beating the other  to their feet

How far away are they

Over a month ago

stares at it in bewilderment
Then suddenly he starts to laugh, full of anguish and joy, amazed by the madness of the world

As the feeding frenzy breaks out we hear Trench's voice: trENCH v/o Hassan's the only guard who's corruptible
For two hundred he'll get us on the graveyard detail

We see what he's talking about now
The dead bodies from the House of Stone are dumped in a row boat
The  order several  onto the boat with them
They're too afraid to handle the corpses themselves

Ripples appear as huge  move in to feed

The corpses float for a moment, then suddenly vanish in a froth of blood
treNCH (Smiling grimly) You didn't think of that when you came
haRRY didn't think of much when  came

trENCH All for a feather
hARRY (Lightly) More than one
looks down at the sand, reflecting: trENCH Give it to me Harry
haRRY Why
treNCH So  can show you it means nothing -- that if  throw it in the river it'll float away -- end up between some Croc's teeth
harry (Smiling softly) Not this feather
It's got the measure of me
It'll float back and find me
The water laps quietly in the silence
trENCH There were a dozen British Officers here last month
Every time one of them died, the last words on his lips were: "Don't worry about me lads
Our boys will come and get you
" They never did
Just you
'd say you've done enough

reaches down to give him a hand, when he suddenly sees how pale his friend is
He drops to his knees, feeling 's pulse
He's alive, but very weak

God didn't want you to leave
He has given you Umm Sabbah

This time  spins around and grabs the whip
He stares at  dangerously, the frustration and disappointment pushing him to the edge

sits across from   in the dimly lit room
There's bright sunshine outside but very little of it gets in
seems much older than the first time we saw him, his eyes are withdrawn, his movements restless
He rings the handbell irritably
Don't worry about the biscuits General
gENERAL wanted some myself
need something sweet in the afternoons, otherwise  fall asleep
(Catching himself) Not today of course
tries to answer his smile, but neither of them is particularly convincing
gENERAL 'm very touched you've come all this way to tell me your good news
Jack'll make you a wonderful husband
(Hiding all her doubts) He'll be pleased to hear that
gENERAL 'm very fond of the boy
smiles weakly, and looks away
Whatever they talk about seems to come back to Harry
finally broaches the subject: Have you heard any news from the Sudan
hesitates
gENERAL An old friend of mine came to visit me yesterday, Colonel Sutch
You probably remember him
nods, panicking inside, sensing the old man's grief
gENERAL He used to receive the occasional letter from Harry, letting him know that he was alright
(His voice falters) Harry made him promise not to tell me anything, unless the letters stopped
'm afraid they did
Over a month ago

She tries to hold back her tears for the General's sake
'm sure it doesn't mean anything
gENERAL asked some friends at the war office to make some enquiries
According to their spies, all the British prisoners are dead
can't speak
The old man fights his tears as well
gENERAL Would you like to see his letters
(Barely a whisper) 'm not sure  could cope right now
geNERAL No, of course not
'm sorry
looks up, remembering his grief is as great as hers
Have you looked at them
gENERAL Oh yes
They make wonderful reading
(His face lights up briefly) He travelled all the way from Alexandria to Suakin
Across three hundred miles of desert
From there he followed the camel corp disguised as a coolie
He fought with them at Abou Klea, excelled himself by all accounts, saved dozens of lives
If he was still a soldier they'd have probably given him the Victoria Cross
(Her eyes shining with tears) You must be very proud
The old man nods, suffering again
geNERAL There isn't a trace of fear in the writing
That's what  find so hard to understand
That someone could be so terrified of going to war; and yet when the time comes to face it for real, he embraces it, almost gratefully
(Sharing his guilt) We all misjudged him
gENERAL You only knew him a short time
had no excuse
Seeing him overcome by guilt and grief,  gets up and takes his hand
holds hers tightly
gENERAL My son loved Jack Durrance like a brother

He'd want you to live your lives

The  tear and claw at each other like wild animals, desperately trying reach a scrap of meat that's fallen to the floor
is in the thick of the fighting, elbowing and head-butting people out of his way
He's changed beyond recognition, and it isn't just physical
He fights with a primal savagery, oblivious to everything except the precious scrap of food
He finally gets hold of it, and swings his elbow round, breaking another 's nose

When it's soft between his teeth, he spits it out, and feeds  with his fingers
For all the primal horror, there's a touching human tenderness in the moment
Suddenly a pair of hands grab  by the hair, and drag him away from
It's
The giant prison guard tears the scrap of meat from 's hands and kicks him in the ribs for good measure
Spitting out blood,  crawls after him, no longer having to play the madman, he's halfway there
hARRY (In Arabic) Food master, food master please

He kisses the ground at Idris's feet, still begging for his scrap of food back

The other  scramble after him, desperate to receive their daily handout from their

He collapses in the sand, staring up at the sun
As he closes his eyes, he suddenly hears a whisper: o/s English
looks up to see a small  , approaching him
The  stops as he sees 's ravaged face, frightened by his mad, staring eyes
sees the piece of chicken in his hand, and waves him over
The   finally kneels down, and offers him the chicken bone
snatches it and gnaws on it like a hungry animal
It's only when he examines the meat, making sure there's enough left for Trench, that we realise how human he still is
He slips the half eaten chicken bone in his robes, and looks at the   gratefully
The   holds out some coins for him
From Abou Fatma
stares at the coins
It's all the money he's ever paid Abou Fatma
harrY Money's no good anymore
We can't bribe the guards
need him to buy food and medecine for my friend
He stops as he realises the   doesn't understand a word
He gives him back the coins: harrY (In Arabic) Tell Abou Fatma to buy us food
You bring me the food
He points to the other  as if to explain
The   nods that he understands
is about to ask him more when he suddenly spots  walking towards them menacingly
harrY Go
Thank Abou Fatma
Thank him for me

Will  look as bad as you
smiles through bleeding gums and swollen cheeks
The evening prayer starts up behind them
closes his eyes in despair
treNCH don't think of God anymore when  hear that sound
It used to give me hope
Now all  feel is dread
hARRY Don't talk like that
We're going to get you through this
treNCH don't want to get through this, Harry
What for
In the distance they hear  shouting at the prisoners, driving them back into the House of Stone
There's only one thing that frightens me now
The thought that the closer  come, the more desperately afraid and sure  am that all this will end right here
when  so wish  could die at home
(fighting tears) In my own country -- in my own village
to be buried beneath the trees  know -- in sight of the church and houses  know
beside the trout stream, where  fished when  was a boy
(Trying to smile) Are you laughing yet
No, 'm not laughing

Anything would be better than this
Are you sure
nods, his decision made
hARRY (Slipping him the vial) The poison will take a few hours to work
You won't feel any pain

looks at him sadly, then turns away, preparing for the inevitable charge from the other
trENCH One last thing, Harry

trENCH My feather

takes it
As they finally let go, we see the soiled white feather in 's palm
closes his fingers around it, gratefully
treNCH hope it gives me as much strength as it gave you
Their eyes stay on each other, full of friendship and respect
Then, steeling himself,  snaps the vial, and starts to drink

dips his feet under, nodding as they touch the riverbed

The poison paralyses the body
It's worn off
Gripping the root,  starts to walk against the current, the water flowing up to his neck
Slowly the river shallows
looks relieved as his friend finally tumbles onto the riverbank and collapses
He's about to follow him, when suddenly a pair of hands shoot out of the water, and grab him around the neck
It's
He's also managed to clamber his way to safety
With a howl of rage he pulls 's face under the water
kicks and flails
With one huge hand  keeps him under the surface, with the other he holds onto the giant tree root
tries to loosen his grip, but he isn't strong enough
He reaches down into the riverbed, and gropes around until he finds a rock
He grinds it into 's wrist like a pummel stone
whips his hand away in pain
is instantly sucked out of his grasp
The current smashes him headlong into another root, downriver
stares at his escaped prey in fury
His anger clouds his reason
He lets go of his own root and lets the current drag him to 's

drags himself towards the riverbank
He's only a few yards away when 's hands grab him again
turns around swinging and catches  on the jaw
Both of them tumble in the water
They wrestle beneath the surface, then shoot up again, tearing at each other like wild animals
grabs  by the hair, and slams his face down on his knee, smashing his nose
The searing pain staggers
He tries to crawl away, but  stamps on his back, flattening him
He drops to his knees, and grinds 's face into the riverbed
As he pulls him back up by the hair, we see 's mangled features -- a mask of blood, eyes staring out, jaws hanging open in defeat
For a moment time seems to slow, then suddenly, shaking his head free,  screams a savage, primal cry, and drives his elbow back into 's face, shattering bone and cartilege
falls back, stunned
has his chance to get away, but he's not interested now
He wades after , an expression of pure, uncontrollable rage in his eyes
As  tries to pick himself up,  slams both fists into his mouth, smashing his teeth down his throat
It's 's turn to look scared
He tries to crawl away, but the bloody faced demon is on him in seconds, ramming his head back under the water
manages to kick him away briefly, but it only enrages
He comes back at  with a large rock between his hands, cracking his face open
And still he isn't finished
Sitting astride the gurgling prison guard,  raises both arms as high as they'll go, and smashes the rock into 's face, again and again
The guard's blood splatters all over him, but  hardly seems to notice
He's gripped by a savage, primordial fury
Everything he's suffered has built up to this point
He's at his highest and lowest ebb
His hands whirr up and down, his eyes glow feverishly, his lips curl in a terrifying sneer
Strong arms grab him from behind, but  ignores them, hammering away
He's beyond hatred, beyond compassion, face to face with his deepest, darkest self
Again the arms try to pull him off, but  brushes them aside
The blood and tears stream down his cheeks
He howls like an animal
His hands finally slow as his arms reach exhaustion
This time   manages to pull him off
collapses in his arms and weeps like a baby, finally breaking out of the darkness, no longer sure who or what he is anymore
holds him tightly, hushing him, comforting him, understanding

In their place, there's an inner strength, and confidence
Everyone said how much you'd changed

When did you get back

She looks hurt that it's taken him so long to come and see her, but she knows she has no right to expect more
'm glad you did what you did, on your own, without anyone's help

hARRY did nothing on my own
You were with me the whole time
The tears begin to shine in her eyes
You've heard our news

hARRY didn't come here to change your mind

So that you wouldn't always be ashamed of the time we spent together

Her eyes drift to a crack of sunlight on the church wall, glinting through the stained glass windows
hARRY What are you thinking
You'd laugh if  told you
harrY That might not be a bad thing
was thinking 'd get up and leave when that patch of sunlight disappeared
So far it's been quite resilient
She smiles gently
For a moment they're the Harry and Ethne of old
passed by your appartment the other day
hARRY (Surprised) When
When you didn't come and see me
(She smiles sadly) was in London for the day
It took me hours to pluck up the courage
When  finally drove by, your lights were off
hARRY 've hardly been out since  got back
It was last Friday
Between five and six
hARRY (Pausing) 'd gone to see my father
(Smiling ironically) Someone must be watching over us
The sunlight lingers precariously on the wall
It will pass
You'll meet someone soon
Then you and her, and Jack and , will sit over tea and chatter politely, as if there was never anything between us
hARRY That won't happen
It has to happen
(The tears fill her eyes) Because  love you Harry
and  can't
can't
The sunlight on the wall finally fades
wipes her tears and gets up to leave
As she tries to walk past him,  takes her in his arms
She doesn't resist
If anything she's relieved
They stay like that for a moment, holding each other, unable to do anything else
We feel their desperate longing, but there's a self imposed wall that keeps them apart
pulls away gently
'll take you to the station
He nods
hARRY wanted to look in on Jack
'll leave him a note
(Considering) No, he'd love to see you
He's staying at the vicarage
It's on the way
They're polite around each other now, like strangers
slips past him with an awkward smile
waits before he follows her
They walk down the aisle, several feet apart
's room/ vicarage/ glenalla - day
sits at a table, knotting his tie
There's a determination in his eyes, as if the smallest activity has become a battle to be won
Suddenly he hears the noise of Ethne's carriage outside
His face lights up
He feels his way towards the window
The carriage door takes a long time to open
stares curiously
Finally he hears footsteps on the gravel
They're heavier than he expected
They stop a moment
knows whoever it is, is staring up at him in the window
He looks thoughtful now, as if he knows who it is
He turns away from the window and finds a chair
He sits, facing the door, checking to make sure the carafe of Scotch and the crystal glasses are within easy reach
The footsteps climb the stairs
There's a knock on the door
Come in
enters
He stops as he sees his friend
's face has softened from inactivity
His skin seems pale compared to Harry's coarse, sunburnt features
It's good to see you, Harry
hARRY (Quietly impressed) How did you know
calculated guess
(He grins) Scotch alright
hARRY Perfect
've got to cut down on the stuff
'm putting on weight
hARRY You look good
Not as good as you, 'm sure
watches his friend, taking the carafe, pouring two perfect glasses
Everything Durrance does, is designed to show him he's alright, that there's nothing to pity
(Handing him the drink) heard Ethne's carriage outside
hARRY She's giving me a ride to the station
Why didn't she come up
hARRY (He knows the question isn't as casual as it sounds) think she wanted to give us a few minutes alone
Do we need a few minutes alone
Even though he's smiling, the air is thick with tension
hARRY came to thank you, Jack
For what
hARRY For standing by me
If you're talking about the feathers,  wasn't there
hARRY Willoughby told me you were
He said you'd tried to talk them out of it
hesitates
You don't owe me anything Harry
The wedding isn't for another month
Ethne's free to make up her own mind
hARRY You don't owe me anything either, Jack
And she's made up her mind
You should trust her judgement
long silence
is too proud to respond
stares at his friend, regretting the wall between them
hARRY 'd better go
'll miss my train
'll come and see you soon
He finishes his drink and gets up
Have another one
hARRY can't Jack
Please
His voice is softer now, more conciliatory
The friendship was the best thing about that place
It's the one thing  haven't been able to hang onto
It's his way of asking Harry to stay
sits again
've become like one of those old soldiers we used to laugh at
Forcing my stories on everyone
Enough medals on my uniform to light up a Christmas tree
(Filling their glasses) Have they given you back your commission
hARRY They haven't acknowledged me in any way
suppose it wouldn't be the British Army if they admitted their mistakes
hARRY don't know if it was a mistake
was never a real soldier like you
real soldier doesn't come back in a hospital ship
(Raising his glass) To Castelton and all the others we left behind
watches his friend down his whisky, sensing the guilt and pain inside
hARRY (Reassuring him gently) You did everything you could
You saw it happen
hARRY From a distance
remember the entire British Square retreating in perfect order, and then these two lunatics, charging out to save their friend
(He smiles affectionately) remember thinking there wasn't a bullet in the world that could stop you that day
(Ironically) Except my own
hARRY You obviously weren't meant to die
You certainly tried your best
chuckles, close to tears, holding them back
It's hard to talk like this with anyone else
They all want to know how many people you've killed, but the moment you mention the friends you've lost, their eyes glaze over
hARRY They weren't there
No
( beat) Do you ever miss the desert Harry
hARRY 'm glad 'm home
It was the best time of my life
Whenever anyone had a problem they came to me
never felt so needed
__ (He smiles) Maybe we should change places
isn't sure what he means
tops up their glasses
You remember the first time we led a cavalry charge in public
hARRY You wiped the floor with me
Most of my horses ended up in the bandstand
Ethne was watching
hARRY (Hesitating) That's right
We'd met her the previous night, at the regimental ball
hARRY remember
You should
You were the only one she danced with
smiles but doesn't say anything
've never been so jealous
stayed up all night brooding
The next day  was determined to show you up -- prove to her  was the better soldier
hARRY (Affectionately) You were always the better soldier
And it still didn't make a difference
(He smiles wistfully) She was the first person  looked for in the crowd, and she was staring at you
Everyone else was applauding me, and she was staring at you
( beat) 'm not sure if anything's changed
can't speak
He knows what  is saying
(Raising his glass) To us Harry
He leans over, grinning, and touches Harry's glass
To you
churchyard/ glenalla - day
Church bells chime, drowned out by the excited
The Wedding party has gathered outside the chapel, waiting for the bride
There's a flurry of activity as Ethne's carriage finally draws up
and  run over to greet her
's  stays behind at the Church door, preparing him for her imminent arrival
and   make last minute adjustments to 's suit and tie
reminds  to make sure he's still got the ring
finally emerges from the carriage, looking radiant in a white dress
tries to catch a glimpse of her, but  covers his eyes, as if it's still bad luck to see his bride
laughs as she walks past them into the church, accompanied by her
waits until she's safely inside, before he removes his hands from Harry's eyes
looks around, hoping to see Durrance amongst the crowd
His friend is nowhere to be seen
smiles at the other , but he seems distracted, as if he knows in his heart Durrance won't show
Slowly the  outside thins until only , , and  remain
trENCH Ready
has one last look for Durrance, still hoping against hope, then he nods and follows his friends inside
The noise of the choir fades as the doors close behind them
For a moment we're left in the balmly stillness of the churchyard, and then, in it's place, we hear the unmistakeable whisper of the desert wind
: -    -  (  )    155 In full dress uniforms, Colonel Sutch and General Feversham work Harry over -- adjusting his collar: All set
looking good
(mock nautical) Aye, sir
That's enough out of you
As they shove him through the door -- turning back to Sutch: By the way,  must remember to thank you
(pause) For telling everyone  was dead
've never been so happy to be wrong in all my life
But  did what  thought was right
terrible habit
(beat) Raises all kinds of hell
As he heads out through the door, with the  : "
