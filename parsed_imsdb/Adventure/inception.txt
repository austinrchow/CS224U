Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass- An intestinal worm
Saito's fork pauses, mid-air
Cobb
third man is at the table-
He jumps in to save the pitch- What Mr
Cobb is trying to say- An idea
Saito looks at Cobb, curious

Resilient, highly contagious
Once an idea's taken hold in the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
person can cover it up, ignore it- but it stays there
But surely-to forget
Information, yes
But an idea
Fully formed, understood
That sticks
(taps forehead) In there, somewhere
For someone like you to steal
Yes
In the dream state, conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft
It's called extraction
But, Mr
Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor
How can you do that
Because  am the most skilled extractor
know how to search your mind and find your secrets know the tricks, and  can teach them to your subconscious so that even when you're asleep, your guard is never down
Cobb leans forwards
Holding Saito's gaze
But if 'm going to help you, you have to be completely open to me
'll need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, your analyst, anyone
(gestures around) If this is a dream and you've got a safe full of secrets,  need to know what's in that safe
For this to work, you have to let me in

Saito gives this a flicker of a smile
Rises opens double doors which give onto a
Gentlemen
Enjoy your evening as consider your proposal
They watch Saito leave
Arthur turns to Cobb, worried- He knows
Cobb motions silence

And we- : -  (   ) Cobb, , The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs level with the rim of the tub

This is distant  rumbles through the room
Nash moves to the window, parts the curtains
Outside: a  - - the street filled with - ,
Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds in place
Nash looks at Cobb's watch- Nash follows the tubes to a   at Arthur's feet:    in an armchair
Tubes connect the briefcase to Arthur's wrist
Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where they pass under the door to the bedroom
Through the crack of the door, Nash sees   on the bed, tubes running to his wrist

Saito knows
He's playing with us
can get it here
The information's in the safe- he looked right at it when  mentioned secrets
Arthur nods
Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder
What's she doing here, Cobb
Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed, staring out at the sea
This is
Cobb watches her
You just get to your room
'll take care of the rest
See that you do
We're here to work
Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head
She nears Cobb
Looks out at the

With a clean dive, perhaps

Amused

She smiles
He leans in, mesmerized

But  can't trust you anymore
She stares up at him, inviting
So what
,   - Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis Bacon
Looks like Arthur's taste
Cobb is looking down through the window at the patrolling the castle at ground level
Actually, Mr
Saito is partial to postwar British painters
He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves
Would you sit down
Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of   and kneels at Mal's feet
She looks down at him
Tell me
Cobb  the rope around the
Do the children miss me
Cobb pauses
He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's ankle
He looks up at her
7
You can't imagine
Mal looks away, uncomfortable
Cobb gets to his feet, letting out the rope as he moves back to the window
What're you doing
Cobb tosses the rope out- Getting some air
He tugs on the rope, testing
The weight of the chair, with Mal on it, holds
Stay seated
Please
And with that, he
Mal considers the open window

Cobb turns
At the far end of the room: Saito
Next to him is Mal, gun in hand
She smiles at Cobb
The gun, Dom
Cobb doesn't move
Mal motions outside- two  drag Arthur into the room
Mal puts the gun to his head
Please
Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then it along the polished ebony
It comes to rest down the length or the table
Now the envelope, Mr
Cobb
Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes  of the envelopes,  it along the table
Steps back, hands raised
Did she tell you, or have you known all along
That you're here to steal from me
(beat) Or that we're actually asleep
Arthur gives Cobb an -told-you-so look
want to know who your employer is
Mal  the gun at Arthur's temple

No point threatening him in a dream
That depends on what you're threatening
Killing him would just wake him up
but pain
Pain is in the mind
Mal  the gun and  Arthur in the leg- Arthur drops, - Mal looks at Cobb, cold
And, judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur
Cobb watches Arthur's
Mal aims at Arthur's other leg
Cobb  for the table,  along its polished surface- he  his gun-     - Arthur - the room starts to  in a - Cobb  for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at the ceiling, , and we- : - Arthur's   as he    - he  at the tubes at his wrist,  them free- What're you doing
It's too soon- spurts from the tubes as Arthur  with the on the bathroom floor
know
We have to reconnect the loop before they wake up
Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist- Saito  and we- : - Cobb  towards the stairs, as all around him the building  and - 10
,   - Saito and the Guards
Mal walks calmly through the destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito
He was close
Very close

He looks at Mal,
He turns to the Guards- Stop him
Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper:
Mal smiles, amused

Arthur's hands fly across the machine's controls as he glances at Saito's  face- 'm not going to make it
Wake Cobb
- Nash turns to Cobb
Raises his hand and  him across the face, and we- : ,   - Cobb is  sideways off his feet
11
,   - The   above Saito- he looks up as a  of floods down,   and we- : - Saito's eyes
- Nash  Cobb again- He won't wake
- Arthur crouched by Saito, connects the second tube
Dunk him
: Arthur looks up to find Saito with a gun to his head and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence
- Nash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and - as Cobb starts to   in the chair we are in  , and we- : ,   - Cobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the last sheet of paper
He stares at it - bullets hit around him as the Guards race up the stairs and we- : - Cobb in  , hits the - head  as he goes under- and we- : ,   - Cobb glances up from the paper as ,    - 12

Saito  into the room,  Nash down- Cobb himself out of the tub,  dripping wet across the room to  Saito against the door- the gun , Cobb's fist  with Saito's jaw and the struggle is over
- Cobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his hand
Nash holds Saito's arms behind him
Outside, the sounds of  grow louder
You came prepared
bring the gun because not even my head of security knows this apartment
How did you find it
Arthur, at the window, looks out at the
Hard for a man in your position to keep a love nest totally secret
particularly when there's a married woman involved
She would never
And yet, here we are
Saito is silent
With a dilemma
You got what you came for
Not quite
The key piece of information wasn't there, was it, Mr
Saito
13
Arthur looks over at Cobb, worried
They're getting closer, Cobb
: - Todashi slips a pair of  over Nash's ears, then pulls out an MP3 player and we- : - Saito's eyes are on the floor
You held something back because you knew what we were up to
Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin
So why let us in at all
Saito smiles, defiant
echo up the stairway
An audition
Audition for what
It doesn't matter
You failed
extracted all the information you had in there
But your deception was readily apparent
And we- : - Todashi opens the  , revealing the complex mechanism of syringes and controllers- 14
Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit "30," then on the MP3 player- He watches Nash's sleeping face as he the volume
Through Nash's headphones: the opening bars of Edith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien," and we- : - In the distant background, strange  low-end start, sounding like
So leave me and go
You know the corporation who hired us won't accept failure
We won't last two days
The , -  is becoming , as are the coming up the stairs
Arthur looks at his watch, its Come on, Cobb
So now  have to do this the old- fashioned way- Cobb         , gun pressed into his cheek
Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will pull the trigger
Saito , looks away in shame- When he
And starts
've always hated this carpet
Cobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways
Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss
But very definitely made of wool
Right now 'm lying on polyester
15
Cobb glares at Nash, and we- : - Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit - He looks up at Arthur, , and we- : - Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb
Which means 'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment
(smiles) You've lived up to your reputation, Mr
Cobb
'm still dreaming
Cobb looks over to Arthur, but   , and we- : - Arthur's eyes flicker open,
He  at his tubes
How'd it go
Not good
Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we- : - Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb
dream within a dream-'m impressed
Cobb lowers the gun
Defeated
Glances at his watch
The music , the     , and we- : 16
- Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the next countdown hit , and we- : - Another  on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches Cobb
Nash is behind Saito
But in my dream, we really ought to be playing by my rules
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr
Saito- Saito turns to Nash- We're not in your dream- Saito turns back to Cobb,    - We're in mine
Saito  back to Nash- the , The music
Saito and the rioters stand there in the , the light
and we- : - Nash' eyes open,
(
) Asshole
Nash
Arthur is in his face, furious
How could you get the carpet wrong
It wasn't my fault
You're the architect- 17
didn't know he was going to rub his damn cheek on it
Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash
Lets go
And you-what the hell was all that
had it under control
'd hate to see out of control- There's no time for this-'m getting off at Kyoto
Why
He's not gonna search every compartment
can't stand trains
Arthur moves to the briefcase
Turns a dial
can keep him under for one minute- Arthur hits a button-
Cobb  the tape off Saito's wrist,  up his tubes
Arthur  the silver case shut
Todashi pulls open the door- Every man for himself
Arthur and Nash , heading in different directions down the corridor
Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of , looks at Saito, who stirs
Cobb moves off
- The   speeds through the lush landscape
- Saito
Looks around the compartment, empty but for Todashi, reading a comic
Saito looks down at his wrist
Sees a small mark
Rubs it
18
- Moving over the vast city towards a high rise thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof
,  - Cobb sits, waiting
Checks his watch, restless
He pulls a Checks it is loaded
places it on the table in front of him
Pulls out a   ,  it on the table
He   the top's spin
As he stares, the sound of a   builds and builds- the top ,  onto its side- the sound of the train
the  - Cobb  it- '  (over phone) Hi, Daddy
Hi, Dad
Hey, guys
How are you
'  (over phone) Good
Okay,  guess
Cobb closes his eyes, trying to picture his children: : 's - a    (3), back towards us, crouches   , looks at something in the grass
Who's just okay
Was that James
(over phone) Yeah
When are you coming home
can't
Not for a while
:     (5), also  , joins ,
(over phone) Why
Well, James, like 've told you-'m away because 'm working
(over phone) Grandma says you're never coming back
Cobb pauses
Takes a breath
: James and Philippa, , lift their heads from the grass, responding to someone's call- they
19
Philippa, can you ask Grandma to pick up the phone- (over phone) She's shaking her head
Cobb , as if about to  the phone
Well, we'll just have to hope Grandma's wrong about that won't we
(over phone) Daddy
Yes
(over phone) Is Mommy with you
Cobb looks like he just got punched-  : ' - ,    ,
No
No, we talked about this, James
Mommy's gone
(over phone) Where
'  (over phone) Time to go, kids
Say bye-bye- 'll give some presents to Grandpa, okay
Just be good for- Cobb  at the dead phone
Then  his drink- at the door
Cobb  the top, the gun-  to the door- cracks it: Arthur
Our ride's on the roof
Cobb nods
Moves to pick up his bag
Arthur watches
Cobb
are you okay
Cobb looks up
20
Yeah, why
Down in the dream
Mal showing up like that
Yeah
'm sorry about your leg
It's getting worse, isn't it
One apology's all you're getting, Arthur
Now, where's Nash
Hasn't shown
Wanna wait
(shakes head) We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago
By now they know we failed
Time to disappear
- Cobb and Arthur head towards the elevator
Where will you go
Buenos Aires
can lie low there
Maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down
You
Stateside
(wistful) ) 'Course
Send my regards
Arthur looks at Cobb
Nods
Sympathetic
- The  sits,
As Cobb and Arthur reach the door, it
Cobb steps up into the leather-padded interior
He freezes
21
- Nash,  , sits on the far side, slumped against the wine
Beside him:
He nods politely at Cobb
He sold you out
Thought to come to me and bargain for his life
Saito's  offers Cobb a
So  offer you the satisfaction
That's not how  deal with things
Would you work with him again
Cobb shakes his head
Saito's   Nash from the chopper
Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit
The chopper Cobb watches Nash  across the pad
What will you do to him
Nothing
But  can't speak for your friends from Cobol Engineering
Saito looks out at the city slipping by
What do you want from us
Inception
Arthur raises his eyebrows
Cobb is poker-faced
Is it possible
Of course not
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind, why can't you plant one there instead
Okay, here's planting an idea: say to you, "Don't think about elephants
" () 22
(') (Saito nods) What are you thinking about
Elephants
Right
But it's not your idea because you know  gave it to you
You could plant it subconsciously- The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea
True inspiration is impossible to fake
No, it isn't
Can you do it
won't do it
In exchange, 'll give you the information you were paid to steal
Are you giving me a choice
Because can find my own way to square things with Cobol
Then you do have a choice
And  choose to leave
- The helicopter sets down next to a
- Saito indicates the plane
Tell the crew where you want to go, they'll file the plan en route
Cobb and Arthur look at each other
Then move for the door
23
Mr
Cobb
There is one other thing  could offer you
(Cobb stops) How would you like to go home
To America
To your children
Cobb turns back to Saito
You can't fix that
Nobody could
Just like inception
Cobb considers this
Arthur touches his arm
Cobb, come on- How complex is the idea
Simple enough
No idea's simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind
My main competitor is an old man in poor health
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation
need him to decide to break up his father's empire
Against his own self-interest
Cobb, we should walk away from this
If  were to do it
If  could do it
how do  know you can deliver
You don't
But  can
So do you want to take a leap of faith, or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone
Cobb looks at Saito
Barely nods
24
Assemble your team, Mr
Cobb
And choose your people more wisely
- Cobb reclines his seat
Arthur picks at a salad, angry
know how much you want to go home- (sharp) No, you don't
But this can't be done
It can
You just have to go deep enough
You don't know that
- 've done it before
Arthur is taken aback
Cobb turns to the window
Did it work
(quiet) Yes
Who did you do it to
Cobb looks at Arthur
Closed
Arthur shrugs
So why are we headed to Paris
We're going to need a new architect
,  ' - Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no students, just a   hunched over paperwork
25
- (
) You never did like your office
looks up, squinting
Recognizes Cobb
No space to think in that broom cupboard
Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows
Is it safe for you to be here
Extradition between France and the is a bureaucratic nightmare
think they'd find a way to make it work in your case
Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag
Can you take these back for the kids
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father
know
thought you could talk to Marie about bringing them on vacation
Somewhere  could meet- Why would she listen to me
You were married for twenty years
She blames me as much as you
Doesn't she understand that my kids need me
26
Yes, she does
We all do
Go back and face the music, Dom
Explain what Mal did
Be realistic, Stephen
They'd never understand- they'd lock me up and throwaway the key
Or worse
You think what you're doing now is helping your case
Lawyers don't pay for themselves
This is what  have
This is what you taught me
never taught you to be a thief
No, you taught me to navigate other people's minds
But after what happened with Mal there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill
Miles looks at Cobb
Why did you come here, Dom
Cobb shifts slightly
found a way home
job
For powerful people
If  pull it off, can get back to my family
But need help
Miles realizes something
My God
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best
If you have someone good enough, you have to let them decide for themselves
You know what 'm offering- Money
27
No, not just money: the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities- things that have never existed, things that couldn't exist in the real world
Everybody dreams, Cobb
Architects are supposed to make those dreams real
That's not what you used to say
You told me that in the real world 'd be building attic conversions and gas stations
You said that if mastered the dream-share 'd have a whole new way of creating and showing people my creations
You told me it would free me
Miles looks at Cobb, sad
And 'm sorry
was wrong
No, you weren't
Your vision was a vision of pure creativity
It's where we took it that was wrong
And now you want me to let someone else follow you into fantasy
They won't actually come on the job, they'll just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers
Design them yourself
Mal won't let me
Miles looks at Cobb
Appalled
Come back to reality, Dom
Please
You want to know what's real, Stephen
Your grandchildren waiting for their dad to come back
() 28
(') This job-this last job-is how  get there
Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers
wouldn't be standing here if there were any other way
can get home
But  need an architect who's as good as  was
Miles looks Cobb in the eye
Decides
've got someone better
- Miles and Cobb stand by as  file out of a lecture
Ariadne
young woman carrying books turns
This is
'd like you to meet Mr
Cobb
She sizes him up with quick eyes
Offers her hand
Pleased to meet you
If you have a few moments, Mr
Cobb has a job offer to discuss with you
work placement
(smiles Not exactly
,  ' - Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris
She unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of and a
He offers them
She bites her sandwich
test
29
(mouth full) Aren't you going to tell me anything
Before  describe the job,  have to know you could do it
Why
It's not, strictly speaking, legal
Ariadne raises her eyebrows
You have two minutes to draw a maze that takes me one minute to solve
Ariadne takes the pad and pen
Cobb looks at his watch
Go
She starts   on the grid, constructing a maze
Stop
Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb
He glances at the pad, then, looking her in the eye,  the solution
She is taken aback
Cobb  off the sheet, hands the pad back
Again
She traces straight lines,
Stop
She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased
Cobb solves the puzzle instantly, as before
Her smile falls
You'll have to- She  the pad, frustrated
but this time she  it over and starts drawing on the   of the back
Cobb watches, surprised
He smiles as he sees that she's drawing , creating a maze based on concentric rings
Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant
Cobb takes the pen, starts the maze
This time he gets stuck
Nods
30
(working the maze) More like it
,  - Arthur stops at a warehouse door
Consults a piece of paper
- large, dusty warehouse
The   cracks open
Arthur enters
Looks around, approvingly
- Arthur    into the middle of the room
He erects a table
Lays out several  , unpacking them, laying out lines of tubing,
- Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table
They say we only use a fraction of the true potential of our brains
but they're talking about when we're awake
While we dream, the mind performs wonders
Such as
How do you imagine a building
You consciously create each aspect, puzzling over it in stages
But sometimes, when your imagination flies- 'm discovering it
Exactly
Genuine inspiration
Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth
In a dream your mind continuously does that
Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows
31
It creates and perceives a world simultaneously
So well that you don't feel your brain doing the creating
That's why we can short- circuit the process
How
By taking over the creating part
Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows
This is where you come in
You build the world of the dream
We take the subject into that dream, and let him 111 it with his subconscious But are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life
(nods) While we're in there, We don't want him to realize he's dreaming
How could  ever get enough detail to Convince him that it's real
Our dreams reel real while we're in them
It's only when we wake up we realize things were strange, Ariadne gestures around them- But all the textures of real life- the stone, the fabric
cars
people
your mind can't create all this
It does
Every time you dream
Let me ask you a question: You never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you
You just turn up in the middle of what's going on
32
guess
So
how did we end up at this restaurant
We came here from
Ariadne trails off, confused
How did we get here
Where are we
Ariadne , unable to remember
begins
Oh my God
We're dreaming
Cobb nods
The  is
Stay calm
We're actually asleep in the workshop
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming, remember
Ariadne looks around, mind
Cobb - The restaurant  , , ,   - Ariadne at the   around them- Cobb  his head against the debris
She sees him- (shouting over noise) If it's just a dream, why are you covering your- Ariadne is         and we- : - Ariadne  awake
(
) Because it's never just a dream
Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice
They are both sitting in the lawn chairs
Arthur watches over them
33
And a face full of glass hurts like hell, doesn't it
While we're in it, it's real
That's why the military developed dream sharing-a training program where soldiers could strangle, stab and shoot each other, then wake up
How did architects get involved
Someone had to design the dreams
(to Arthur) Let's go another five minutes- We were only asleep for five minutes
We talked for an hour at least
When you dream, your mind functions more quickly, so time seems to pass more slowly
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream
Let's see how much trouble you can cause in five minutes
And we- : - Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb
Cobb looks around at the street, the cafe, approving
It's good
You've got the cafe, the layout
you forgot the book shop but pretty much everything else is here
Ariadne looks at the passers-by
Who are the people
34
They're projections of my subconscious
Yours
Sure-you are the dreamer,  am the subject
My subconscious populates your world
That's one way we get at a subject's thoughts-his mind creates the people, so we can literally talk to his subconscious
How else do you do it
Architecture
Build a bank vault or a jail, something secure, and the subject's mind will fill it with information he's trying to protect
Then you break in and steal it
Exactly
Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street
love the concrete sense of things- (stamps foot) Real weight, you know
thought a dream space would be all about the visual, but it's the feel of things
Question is, what happens as you start to mess with physics
She  on the street
The street starts to - the buildings on either side   until they form the      , Ariadne looks up (or down) at the people on the opposite city surface
Cobb watches her excitement
It's something, isn't it
(quiet) Yes
It is
35
As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the projections  at her
Why are they looking at me
Because you're changing things
My subconscious feels that someone else is creating the world
The more you change things, the quicker the projections converge on you
Converge
They feel the foreign nature of the dreamer, and attack-like white blood cells fighting an infection
They're going to attack us
Just you, actually
They walk along the street to where it joins the next gravitational plane
They step up onto the different plane and walk down the street towards a river
As Ariadne approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads Cobb up onto a small jetty
As she concentrates, pillars emerge and a  starts to telescope out from the jetty
They step onto it as it grows
Cobb is impressed
It's beautiful
but if you keep on changing things
People crossing the bridge  at Ariadne
Several of them her shoulder as they pass
Mind telling your subconscious to take it easy
That's why it's called subconscious
don't control it
The bridge now spans the Seine
Cobb marvels at it
Arched stone, iron pillars
it's
36
Cobb pauses, thinking
Remembering
: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling, laughing
He smiles back
They are on the same bridge
know this bridge
This place is real- (serious) You didn't imagine it, you remembered it
(nods) cross it every day on my way to the college
Never recreate places from your memory
Always imagine new places
You have to draw from what you know- (tense) Use pieces-a streetlamp, phonebooths, a type of brick-not whole areas
Several people around them  Cobb's attitude
Why not
Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream
Did that happen to you
Cobb says nothing
He stands there, starinq at Ariadne
around her stop and look at her, hostile
Look, this isn't about me- Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him- Is that why you need me to build your dreams
37
passerby  Ariadne's shoulder- Leave her alone- More of the crowd join in,  at Ariadne, holding her arms open- Cobb  people off- the crowd  him away- Cobb sees someone   through the crowd towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal
She approaches with even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy
Wake me up, Cobb
As Mal walks, she pulls out a  - Mal, no
Wake me up
Ariadne  as Mal  at her with the knife and we- : - Ariadne ,
Arthur moves to her- It's okay
Why couldn't  wake
The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die
Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite,  his tubes out
She'll need a totem
What
Some kind of personal icon
small object that you can always have with you, and that no one else knows, Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious
He heads to the bathroom
38
That's some subconscious you've got, Cobb
(calls after him) She's a real charmer
Sounds like you've met Mrs
Cobb
(surprised) She's his wife
Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes
So
totem
You need something small, potentially heavy
,  - Cobb takes out his   ,  it on the marble counter
- Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled
Like a coin
Too common
You need something that has a weight or movement that only you know
,  - Cobb  the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more and more
- What's yours
Arthur holds out a
loaded die
Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away- 39
can't let you handle it
That's the point
No one else can know the weight or balance of it
Why
So when you examine your totem
,  - Cobb's spinning top
(
) You know, beyond a doubt, that you're not in someone else's dream
Cobb  it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline
- Ariadne thinks this over
That's not an issue for me
Why not
Arthur, maybe you can't see what's going on, maybe you don't want to
But Cobb's got problems he's tried to bury down there
'm not going to open my mind to someone like that
Ariadne gets to her feet
Walks away
(
) She'll be back
Arthur turns
Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway
've never seen anyone pick it up so fast
And one reality won't be enough for her now
When she comes back, get her building mazes
Where will you be
40
've got to talk to Eames
Eames
But he's in Mombasa
Cobol's backyard
Necessary risk
There are plenty of other thieves
We don't just need a thief
We need a forger
,  - Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled
a westerner (40's), shabby suit, is squeezed in at a dice game
This is
He with his last two chips
(
) Rub them against each other all you like, they're not going to breed
Eames looks up to see Cobb
You never know
Eames tosses down his last chips
The dice are rolled
Drink
Eames loses
You're buying
Cobb follows Eames
Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of chips and puts them down in front of the cashier
Cobb pulls one off the top, squints at the embossed name
You're spelling hasn't improved
Eames  the chip
Hands it to the cashier
Piss off
How's your handwriting
41
Eames takes his money
Smiles at Cobb
Versatile
,  - Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street
Word is, you're not welcome in these parts
Yeah
There's a price on your head from Cobol Engineering
Pretty big one, actually
You wouldn't sell me out
Eames looks at Cobb, offended
`Course  would
(smiles) Not when you hear what 'm selling
- ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street
Eames pours
Inception
Eames's glass stops halfway to his mouth
Don't bother telling me it's impossible
It's perfectly possible
Just bloody difficult
That's what  keep saying to Arthur
42
Arthur
You're still working with that stick-in-the-mud
He's a good point man
The best
But he has no imagination
If you're going to perform inception, you need imagination
You've done it before
Yeas and no
We tried it
Got the idea in place, but it didn't take
You didn't plant it deep enough
It's not just about depth
You need the simplest version of the idea- the one that will grow naturally in the subject's mind
Subtle art
That's why 'm here
What's the idea you need to plant
We want the heir to a major corporation to break up his father's empire
See, right there you've got various political motivations, anti- monopolistic sentiment and so forth
But all that stuff's at the mercy of the subject's prejudice- you have to go to the basic
Which is
The relationship with the father
(downs drink) Do you have a chemist
43
Cobb shakes his head
There's a man here
Yusuf
He formulates his own versions of the compounds
Let's go see him
Once you've lost your tail
(Cobb reacts) Back by the bar, blue tie
Came in about two minutes after we did
Cobol Engineering
They pretty much own Mombasa
Cobb glances over the balcony
Run interference
We'll meet downstairs in half an hour
Back here
Last place they'd expect
Eames downs his drink
Rises
Walks over to the Businessman
Freddy
The Businessman looks up, awkward
Freddy Simmonds, it is you
Cobb nonchalantly  over the balcony   into the midst of the crowd on the street below
(looks harder) Oh
No, it isn't
,  - Cobb stands up,  into the crowd- faces  at him- he moves, trying to blend- - a    is there
44
(disarming smile) Yes
We need to- Cobb   the Second Businessman,  past him- The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake, after him- Cobb  headlong through tight passageways,  through or  into the locals
He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables
the First Businessman enters, spots him
An   gets in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers his options
the First Businessman   - Cobb bolts, steps up on a table and out an open window,  into the alley outside
Cobb  left, right
into a narrow, alley- the alley
Faces in the start to watch Cobb-  start to  him- Cobb looks back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, - Cobb sees a   between the buildings at the narrow end- he  himself into it- gets
The crowd bears down,  for him as Cobb struggles to through the gap
Cobb's moving  as his pursuers gain
the Crowd is upon him
he onto the next street,  out of sight
Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square move towards him
Cobb  but a   , - the door opens-
Care for a lift, Mr
Cobb
(jumping in) What brings you to Mombasa, Mr
Saito
have to protect my investment
- Eames stands on the pavement
The car pulls up
Cobb beckons from the rear window
Eames looks at Saito
Back to Cobb
This is your idea of losing a tail
45
(shrugs) Different tail
- Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism
small prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there
He said you'd be back
tried not to come
But there's nothing else quite like it
No paper, no pens
nothing between you and raw, direct creation
Arthur picks up his mechanism
Shall we take a look at paradoxical architecture
Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we- : - Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass and steel  in an office complex
You're going to have to master a few tricks if you're going to build three complete dream levels
some papers as they pass
What sort of tricks
They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight
In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes
() 46
(') That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps
The infinite staircase
Ariadne - , next to the Secretary gathering her papers
Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs
See
Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a to the next step
Arthur gestures at the drop
Paradox
closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream you've created
How big do the levels have to be
Anything from the floor of a building, to an entire city
But it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections
maze
And the better the maze- The longer we have before the projections catch us
Ariadne looks around
Sees people  at Arthur
My subconscious seems polite enough
You wait, they'll turn ugly
No one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind
Cobb can't build anymore, can he
47
don't know if he can't, but he won't
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts
Why
He won't tell me
think it's Mal
think she's getting stronger
His ex-wife
She's not his ex
They're still together
Arthur turns to Ariadne
Gentle
No
No, she's dead, Ariadne
What you see in there is just his projection of her
What was she like in real life
(quiet) She was lovely
: ,  ,  - Saito deposits a  in front of Cobb: ,
As Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames
Robert Fischer, 32
Heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate
He's spent his whole life being groomed as successor-breaking up his father's empire will take a radical shift in his thinking
What's your problem with Fischer
That's not your concern
48
This isn't the usual corporate espionage, Mr
Saito
This is inception
The seed of the idea we plant will grow in this man's mind
It'll change him
It might even come to define him
Saito looks at Cobb
My sources suggest you might not have always been so cautious
Then you need new sources, Mr
Saito
Saito considers Cobb
Shrugs
Fischer Morrow has the regulators in their pockets
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance and we can no longer compete
Soon they'll control the energy supply of half the world
They'll be able to blackmail governments, dictate policy
In effect, they become a new superpower
The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind
That's where we come in
How's Robert Fischer's relationship to his father
Rumor is the relationship is complicated
We'll need more than rumor, Mr
Saito
Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68)
Can you get me access to him
Browning
Fischer senior's right- hand man
Fischer junior's godfather
49
It should be possible
If you can get the right references
References are something of a specialty for me, Mr
Saito
,  - Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway
- Peeling paint, buzzing flies
They ascend to a dusty, wire-reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open- - Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty glass bottles of all shapes and colors
At the far end, a portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning
This is
Come, come
Eames shakes Yusuf's hand
Yusuf stops at Cobb
Ah, yes
Mr
Cobb
've heard so very much about you
(indicates chairs) please
Yusuf chases a  off Saito's chair
Bloody cats
Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass bottles
None of them has a label
You work using Somnacin,  think, Mr
Cobb
You're well informed, Mr
Yusuf
Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb
50
(dubious) Somnacin
(proudly) Yusuf's Somnacin
Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose
As good as the real thing
Yusuf  the bottle away from Cobb, offended
Better
Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling
Binds the dreamers tight
Let's them dream as one
Makes it real
Of course, if you'd prefer, you could use Somnacin brand
If you could explain to the international control council what you wanted it for
Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf
Sits
You are seeking a chemist
(Cobb nods) To formulate compounds for a job
And to come into the held with us
rarely go into the held, Mr
Cobb
We need you there to tailor compounds to our particular requirements
Which are
Great depth
dream within a dream
Two levels
51
Three
Not possible
That many dreams within dreams would be too unstable
've done it before
You just have to add a sedative
powerful sedative
How many team members
Five
Six
(to Cobb) The only way to know you've done the job is if  go in with you
There's no room for tourists on these jobs, Mr
Saito
This time, it would seem there is
Cobb looks at him, uneasy
Yusuf pulls out another bottle
Of course
use it every day
Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid inside
For what
Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a He - second thoughts
Perhaps
you will not want to see
Cobb motions to continue
Yusuf pulls out a large key
52
,  - dark room with  of low
Each with a sleeping occupant
Tubes connect their wrists
An watches over them
(counting) Eighteen, twenty-all connected, bloody hell
They come every day
To share the dream
Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest bed
Reaches out to the
Gives his face a
The sleeper does not even stir
See
Very stable
How long do they dream
Three, four hours
Every day
How long in dream time
With this compound
about forty hours
Each and every day
Saito surveys the room, appalled
Why do they do it
Tell him, Mr
Cobb
After a while
(looks at Saito) It becomes the only way you can dream
Do you still dream, Mr
Cobb
Cobb  at the sleepers
Uneasy
They come here every day to sleep
53
(
) No
Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his dreamers
They come to be woken up
the dream has become their reality
The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest
And who are you to say otherwise
Cobb  at the Elderly Bald Man
Cobb turns to Yusuf
him the bottle
Let's see what you can do
- Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep
Yusuf stands over him
As we move in on Cobb's   we hear the sound of a , , and we- : - Cobb's face as he lies,  , cheek pressed to a  -       - Cobb is , , , and we- : ,  - Cobb's eyes open
Yusuf is watching him
Sharp, no
Cobb nods
Gets to his feet, looking around- ,  - Cobb  water on his face, breathing hard-  : ,  ,
Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top
He tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is there
Cobb
He looks down at the spinning top
54
Everything alright, Mr
Cobb
Cobb dries his face with a paper towel
Picks up his top
Everything's fine
,  - Close on a small
Ariadne tips it over
Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base
Tests the   again
makes her look up
- Ariadne comes into the main space
Someone is there, unpacking one of the
Cobb
You're back
Cobb looks up with a start
Caught out
Are you going under on your own
just- need to test some things
didn't realize anyone was here
Just working on my totem
Ariadne holds up the chess piece
Cobb reaches for it
Let me see- Ariadne  it out of his reach
Smiles
Cobb nods
You're learning
It's an elegant solution to keeping track of reality
Your invention
No
Mal's
Cobb pulls out his spinning top
Looks at it
55
This one was hers
She'd spin it in a dream and it would never topple
Just spin and spin
Arthur told me she died
She did
How are the mazes coming
Ariadne indicates three large
Good
Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious we're trying to access
'm making the bottom level a hospital, so that Fischer will bring his father there- Don't tell me
Remember, you only want the dreamer to know the layout
Why's that so important
In case one of us brings in part of our subconscious
You wouldn't want any projections knowing the layout
In case you bring Mal in
Cobb says nothing
You won't build yourself because if you know the maze, then she knows it
And she'd sabotage the operation
You can't keep her out, can you
Cobb says nothing
Do the others know
No
56
You have to warn them if it's getting worse- (gentle) didn't say it's getting worse
Look, Ariadne,  need them for this job
need you for this job
Without your help, 'll never get back to my children
And that's all can care about right now
Why can't you go home, Cobb
Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say
They think  killed her
How did she die
Cobb thinks
: Mal, wind  her hair, smiles at Cobb
Now we see Cobb-   ,  , - Thank you
For what
Not asking whether  did
- Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room, looking at
Cobb presides
The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to the Australian energy conglomerate, Fischer Morrow
Cobb opens a large presentation pad
(reads aloud) "     ' " Cobb turns to the team
57
An idea Robert Fischer's conscious mind would never accept
We have to plant it deep in his subconscious
How deep
Three levels down
dream within a dream within a dream
Is that even possible
Yes
It is
Now, the subconscious motivates through emotion, not reason, so we have to translate the idea into an emotional concept
How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion
That's what we have to figure out
Robert and his father have a tense relationship
Worse, even, than the gossip columns have suggested
Do you play on that
Suggest breaking up his father's company as a 'screw you' to the old man
No
Positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time
We yearn for people to be reconciled, for catharsis
We need positive emotional logic
Eames thinks
Paces
Looking back at the board
Try this
" , " That might work
58
Might
We'll have to do better than that
Thanks for the contribution, Arthur
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames
Inception's not about specificity
When we get inside his head, we're going to have to work with what we find
Arthur shrugs, frustrated
And we- : - The team are in the middle of a  intersection
Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography
We could split the idea into emotional triggers, and use one on each level
How do you mean
On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father
Say: " '
" Next level down we've accessed his ambition and self-esteem
We feed him: " " Then, the bottom level, we bring out the emotional big guns
"  ' " That could do it
How do you produce these emotional triggers
59
forge each emotional concept in the style and manner of Peter Browning, a key figure in Fischer's emotional life
Two   wander into view
Are those yours
Eames shakes his head
Cobb turns to Yusuf
Yusuf
Yup
Sorry
Suppress them
We don't bring our own projections into the dream-we let Fischer's subconscious supply the people
Saito, when do  get to see Browning
You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday
We've arranged for you to spend several days
,  '  - Eames sits in the crowded room
Boxes and files are piled high
Browning stands by a pair of double doors
(
) as part of a consulting litigation team working for Browning
'm not smelling settlement here-we take them down
Mr
Browning, Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation- Browning turns to the lawyer
Calm, but
60
Shall we relay your concerns directly to Maurice
Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office
Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into- '   - The office is a   : a  where the desk should be
Browning addresses a figure at the window , 30', abstracted
How is he
Fischer turns to Browning
Motions silence, as he glances at his  in the bed
Wheezing gently
don't want to bother him unnecessarily but  know he- Robert
've told you to keep out the damn
- ,  things from his bedside table calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a holds a       (each of the points is numbered in pen), his  blows on it
Must be a cherished memory of his- put it by his bed
He hasn't even noticed
Robert, we have to talk about a power of attorney
know this is hard for you, but it's important that we start to think about the future- Not now, Uncle Peter
Browning looks at Fischer, considering
Biding his time
(
) The vultures are circling
The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the stronger Peter Browning becomes
61
Eames  Browning,  his every move
- Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands
(
) 've had time to learn Browning's physical presence and mannerisms
In the mirror:
- Now, in the dream,  can impersonate Browning and suggest the concepts to Fischer's conscious mind
(draws a diagram) Then we take Fischer down another level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him
(impressed) So he gives himself the idea
Precisely
That's the only way to make it stick
It has to seem self-generated
Eames, 'm impressed
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur
: - The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby, debating
Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby
He's not scheduled for surgery, no dental, nothing
thought he had some knee thing
Nothing they'd put him under for
Besides, we need a good ten hours
62
Sydney to Los Angeles
They turn to Saito
Twelve hours and forty-five minutes-one of the longest flights in the world
He makes it every two weeks
- Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the tarmac towards a   , accompanied by two aides
(
) Surely he flies private
(
) Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane
Fischer is met at the steps by a
- Cobb chews this over
Arthur comes over
It'd have to be a 747
Why
On a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin
We'd have to buyout the whole cabin, and the first class flight attendant- We bought the airline
Everyone turns to Saito
It seemed
neater
Neater, huh
(gets to his feet) Well, now we have ten uninterrupted hours
() 63
(') (to Ariadne) Nice lobby, by the way
And we- : - The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion
My question is how we go down three layers with enough stability
Three layers down a little turbulence is gonna translate into an earthquake
The dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance
Yusuf clears his throat
Sedation
For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming
- Yusuf depresses a plunger
Arthur is  in a chair
(
) We will have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative
Eames  Arthur,
Arthur does not stir
- Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek
The compound we'll be using to share the dream is an advanced Somnacin derivative
It creates a very clear connection between dreamers, whilst actually accelerating brain function
: Buying us more time in each level
Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal
() 64
(') And when you go into a dream within that dream the effect is compounded
How much time
Three dreams
that's ten hours, times twenty, times twenty, times twenty
Math was never my strong suit
It's basically a week one layer down, six months two layers down- And ten years in the third level
Who wants to spend ten years in a dream
Depends on the dream
It's not going to take us long to crack Fischer open once we get going
We'll be out in a couple days, max
How do we get out once we've made the plant
(to Cobb) hope you've got something a little more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head like last time
Arthur tilts back in his chair
Yusuf turns to Cobb
kick
What's a kick
Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg
it- Arthur's legs    for balance- That, Ariadne, would be a kick
65
That feeling of falling which snaps you awake
We use that to jolt ourselves awake once we're done
But how are we going to feel that through the sedation
That's the clever part
customize the sedative
- Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, , in a chair
(
) To leave inner ear function unimpaired
Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly  Arthur's chair backwards
as he falls, Arthur's body , just before he  the floor
- Arthur thinks, nodding slowly
That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper will still feel falling
- Yusuf gleefully  a   to one side
(
) Or tipping
Arthur goes down with a ,  - - Arthur thinks this through
Even that won't cut through three layers of deep sleep
The trick is to devise a kick for each level, then synchronize them to get a snap that penetrates all three layers
66
Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it
We can use the musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks
- Ariadne comes into the darkened main space
Cobb is lying on one of the chairs, asleep
Plugged into the mechanism
Ariadne stands over him
Watching
She opens the case,  one of the tubes, sits, checking the dials as she injects the needle cap into her arm, and we- : - Ariadne ascends
She looks at the buttons
Spots the "
" The elevator
She looks through the grill at- '  - Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room, considering the dusty furnishings
At the window is a doll's house, front slightly ajar
Ariadne opens it
Inside is a She tries it
her- she turns, looking through a doorway into another room
- Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking, arguing
private moment
Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying to convince him
We hear snatches of conversation- You remember when you asked me to marry you
Of course
You said you had a dream
That we'd grow old together
And we can
You know how to find me
you know what you have to do
Cobb is shaking his head, gently
Mal looks into Cobb's eyes- gentle, loving
Mal  Ariadne spying on them
67
, staring, hostile
Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves towards her, leaving Mal
You shouldn't be in here
Cobb guides her back into the elevator
wanted to know what "tests" you need to do on your own every night
- Cobb shuts the
Ariadne hits a button
The elevator Through the  Ariadne can see a  stretching off into the distance
The elevator stops
Mal sits on the sand
Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from us, building a
Why do you do this to yourself
This is the only way  can still dream
Is it so important to dream
Cobb stares at his family
In my dreams
we're still together
The kids,   , jump up and
- The elevator descends
But these aren't just dreams, are they
They're memories
You said never to use memories
And  shouldn't
You're keeping her alive
No
68
You can't let her go
No
These are moments  regret
Moments  turned into dreams so could change them
Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "
" What've you got buried down there that you regret
Cobb pushes her hand away
Hits the third floor button
There's only one thing  need you to understand about me
,   '  - Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen
is there, standing by the table
He holds a
This is your house
Mine and Mal's
Where is she
She'd already died
The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper
' - Cobb
Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden
small blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to look at something on the ground
It's James
My boy
He's found something
Maybe a worm
slightly older girl  into view
And there's Philippa
She crouches beside the boy

thought about calling out, so they'd turn and smile those incredible smiles
but 'm out of time- The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand
Right now
Or never, Cobb
Cobb nods, turns from the window- Then  panic that 'll always wish 'd seen them turn, that  can't waste this chance
Cobb   to call out- but the children
But the moment's passed
And whatever  do, the dream's always the same
When 'm about to call
they run
Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma,
If 'm going to see their faces again-'ve got to get back here in the real world
Behind him, Ariadne  the grill shut
Cobb
- Ariadne hits the  button
The elevator starts to ariadne , fascinated as glimpses of floors slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of freight train
The elevator
Through the grill Ariadne sees a
She pulls open the grill, steps cautiously out into- -  ( ) bedclothes,  room service table, across the floor
Ariadne steps forwards- - she looks down to see that she has kicked over a
Ariadne feels a draught
The (
) What are you doing here
Ariadne
Mal is there
70
My name is- know who you are
What are you doing here
don't know
Trying to understand
How could you understand
Do you know what it is to be a lover
To be half of a whole
No
Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne
'll tell you a riddle
You're waiting for a train
train that will take you far away
You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure
Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over
But
it doesn't matter
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you
(
) Because you'll be together
Cobb is standing in the elevator
Mal nods
Looks at him
How could you bring her here, Dom
What is this place
hotel
We spent our anniversaries in this suite
What happened here
Mal picks up the   of a champagne flute
71
- Cobb  Ariadne into the elevator- Mal  herself towards Ariadne- Cobb  the - Mal  against it and  like a  - Ariadne - you
' - We can
We will
But  need you to stay here for now- '
- Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise
'll come back
need you to stay here on your own for now
Just while  do this job
Then we can be together- '  -
- Mal  herself against the grill, and
we- : - Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping
His eyes gradually flicker open
He sees her watching him
You think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in
You think that's going to contain her
The   : Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney
When's the funeral
Thursday
In Los Angeles
72
Robert'll accompany the body Tuesday at the outside
We have to move
Cobb gets up
Ariadne comes over to him
(low) 'm coming with you
No
promised Miles
The team needs someone in there who understands what you're struggling with
If you don't want it to be me then you need to show Arthur what just saw
Cobb looks at Ariadne
Turns to Saito
We need one more seat on the plane
,  - Saito stands looking out the window at a 747
Cobb arrives beside him
They watch a  being loaded
If  get on this plane and you haven't taken care of things
when we land  go to jail for the rest of my life
Complete the job en route,  make one phone call from the plane
you will have no trouble clearing immigration
, 747 - The luxurious cabin has only ten seats
Cobb finds his- sees Ariadne in the seat behind his
They do not acknowledge each other
Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window
Eames enters,  his bag into the overhead bin,  the passenger behind:  , standing there, patient, bag in hand, wearing black
Oh, sorry
73
Eames  up against his seat to let Fischer
Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb
Eames Cobb a
Cobb flips it open: Fischer's
Pockets it
Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats
- The 747  down the runway
, 747 - Cobb looks down at his hand: a   taped to the center of his palm
He removes the cap
The seatbelt sign goes dark
Cobb unbuckles, stands
Excuse me
Fischer looks up
Yes
think this is yours
Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to Fischer
Fischer's hand goes to his pocket
Cobb hands Fischer the passport
Would you gentlemen care for a drink
Water
Same
Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile
Holds up his passport
Well, thank you
No problem
Look,  couldn't help noticing your name
You're not related to Maurice Fischer
Fischer takes a beat
But Cobb seems harmless
Actually, he was my father
74
'm very sorry for your loss
He was an inspiring figure
The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them
Thanks
As he turns to Fischer he  his right hand
a into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him
To Maurice Fischer
(they drink) 'll leave you in peace
Fischer grants him a smile
747 - The great plane  through a burning cloudscape
, 747 - Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch
Cobb the others
The First Flight Attendant unlocks a in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain
Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a
Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed them around the window side of each of the seats
Arthur rolls up Fischer's cuff-  the needle cap into Fischer's wrist
Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes behind the armrest of Fischer's seat
Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne
Cobb puts the case on Yusuf's lap
Yusuf checks the , tapping the syringes
The others recline their seats
Yusuf   - closes the case- places it at his feet
He settles back, and we- : - Cobb
Saito and Arthur are in the back
Rain down
Cobb pulls over- - Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar turned up against the rain
He reaches for the door
75
- Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face
(indicates rain) Couldn't you have peed before you went under
Sorry
The front door  and Eames climbs in, soaked
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff, Yusuf
Ha bloody ha
At least we know he'll be looking for a cab in this
/
- Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic
He weaves around several cars before lining up behind a
Brace yourselves
Cobb hits the gas-   the cab with a
The gets out, fuming
Heads to Cobb's window- Hey, asshole
Why don't you try driving without your thumb up- He sees the   Cobb is holding at his belly
Walk away
The Cabdriver backs off
Arthur climbs into the cab
Both cars pull away
/
- Arthur  in front of the  , peering at the pedes pedestrians
He  Fischer, lights the cab's sign
Fischer  him down
Fischer  into the back, brushing rain from his shoulders
76
Third and Market
Snappy
Eames  in from the other side
What're you doing
Sorry,  thought it was free
Maybe we could share
Maybe not
Saito gets into the front passenger seat
Pointing a gun
Great
Arthur pulls away
Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it at Eames
(contemptuous) There's 500 dollars in there
And the wallet's worth more than that
For that you ought to at least drop me at my stop
Eames smiles at this
'm afraid- the window by Eames's head- another by Saito- Get us out of here
Arthur hits the gas, but a
sideways in front,  the path- - Cobb is at a light
is getting in the front
Cobb has  the - Come on
- Cobb looks ahead to the , hits the gas- the sedan forwards
but - , ,       - 77
is behind the cab- advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab
Bullets  into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of Fischer,  a  over his head- Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing- This wasn't in the design- Cobb  ,  around, heading for the tail of the train- Security Man emerges from the front
carrying an - he steps towards the cab through the rain, raises his weapon and   ' - Cobb clears the end of the train, and  across the tracks- Arthur  down-  the accelerator with his - the wheel-
The cab  the Security Man,  into the front

Rain whips across Arthur's face as he - Everybody okay
Saito
Arthur looks at Saito
Saito's hand is at his belly
Covered in
- The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps out-  the shutter down behind them- - Yusuf and Eames  Fischer from the cab,  him through a doorway
Cobb  out of the sedan, furious
Arthur
Arthur what the- Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat
Oh, Christ
Is he dying
78
don't know
What happened back there
Where were you
We were blocked by a freight train
(to Ariadne) Why would you put a train crossing in a downtown intersection
didn't
(snaps) Why were we all ambushed, Arthur
Those weren't regular projections- they'd been trained
How could they be trained
Fischer's had an extractor teach his mind to defend itself
His subconscious is militarized
It should've shown on the research- So why the hell didn't it
Calm down
Don't tell me to calm down-you were meant to check Fischer's background thoroughly
You can't make this kind of mistake-we're not prepared for this kind of violence- Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security before
We just have to be more- This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur
(points at Saito) He's dying
So we put him out of his misery
79
Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over Saito
No
He's in agony
Let's wake him up- Cobb  Eames's arm
No
(they lock eyes) It won't wake him up
What do you mean, it won't wake him
When you die in a dream you wake up
Not from this
We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way
Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb
So what happens if one of us dies
That person doesn't wake up
Their mind drops into Limbo
Limbo
Unconstructed dream space
What's down there
Raw, infinite subconscious
Nothing there but what was left behind by anyone on the team who's been trapped there before
On this team
just Cobb
How long would we be stuck there
80
You couldn't even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases- How long
Decades-it could be infinite- don't know
Ask him-he's the one who's been there before
Eames moves to Cobb
Looks him in the eye
Great
So now we're stuck in Fischer's mind battling it out with his private army, and if we get hit we're stuck in Limbo 'til our brains dissolve into scrambled egg
Cobb says nothing
Saito groans more loudly
Let's just get him upstairs
,  - Saito is laid out on an old desk
Arthur examines him
He motions to Ariadne
Eames watches Cobb
Hold this
Firm pressure
Arthur turns to Cobb
You knew the risks and you didn't tell us
There wasn't meant to be any risk
We weren't supposed to be dealing with a load of gunnre
You had no right
It's the only way you can go three layers deep, Arthur
Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile
81
And you
You went along with this
trusted him
You trusted him
When
When he promised you half his share
(offended) No
His whole share
Plus, he told me he'd done it before
Arthur turns to Cobb
Oh, yeah
With Mal
That worked out great, didn't it, Cobb
Cobb grabs Arthur
You don't know anything about that
This was the only way to do this job, Arthur
did what  had to do to get back to my children
So you led us into a war zone with no way out
We have a way out
The kick
We just have to push on, do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick
Forget it
We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes
'm sitting it out on this level
You'll never make it, Eames
Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak
The ten hours of the flight is a week at this level-you'll never make it without getting killed
Downwards is the only way forwards
We have to carry on
Saito groans
Cobb looks at him- 82
And we have to do it fast
Eames and Arthur weigh this
Eames, go get ready
Arthur, let's get in there and soften him up
,  - Cobb and Arthur, wearing ,  the sack from Fischer's head
He is chained to the radiator
'm insured against kidnapping up to ten million-this'll be simple- No, it won't
Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved
In
your lather's office, below the bookshelves, is his personal safe
We need the combination
never noticed a safe- Doesn't mean you don't know the combination
Well,  don't
We have it on good authority that you do
Whose
,  - Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet
Eames is opening a , -
Five hundred dollars, this cost
What's inside
83
Cash, cards,
and this- Yusuf holds up a : the photo from Maurice Fischer's office-   holds his  , his blows on it
Eames takes it from Yusuf
it
Cobb enters
Eames hands him the snapshot
Useful
Cobb studies the snapshot
Eames examines himself in the hinged mirror from multiple angles:    the myriad Eames reflections
Cobb pockets the photo
You're on
You've got an hour
An hour
was supposed to have all night to crack him
And Saito was supposed to keep his guts on the inside
You've got an hour-get something we can use
Eames turns from the mirror
He glances at his watch, then , as if begging for mercy- ,  - Browning's  reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned- What's that
Good authority
Another cry rings out
Fischer recognizes the voice
Uncle Peter
Make them stop- The combination
don't know it
Why would Browning tell us you did
Let me talk to him-'ll find out
84
,  - Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the room and forces him down next to Fischer
Cobb handcuffs Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink
You've got an hour
Get talking
Cobb leaves
() They've had me for two days
They've got someone with access to your father's office and they're trying to open his safe-they thought 'd know the combination, but  don't- Neither do , Uncle Peter
(confused) Maurice told me that after he passed only you would be able to open it
He never gave me the combination
Browning thinks for a minute
Realizes something
He did, he just didn't tell you that it was a combination
What, then
Something only you would know
Some meaningful combination of numbers from your experiences with Maurice- We didn't have a lot of meaningful experiences together
Perhaps after your mother died
After my mother died,  went to him in my grief
() 85
(') You know what he told me
"There's really nothing to be said, Robert
" He always had a hard time with emotional- was eleven, Uncle Peter
Browning (Eames) takes this in
He loved you, Robert
In his way
"In his way
" At the end he called me to his deathbed
He could barely speak, but he took the trouble to say one last thing to me
He pulled me close
could make out only one word
"Disappointed
" Browning can say nothing
,  - Cobb pulls off his balaclava
Looks down at Saito, who is breathing fast, shallow
How's he doing
He's in a lot of pain
Cobb takes Saito's hand
Looks him in the eye
When we get you down to the next level, the pain will be less intense
Saito nods, breathing hard
(low) And if he dies
His conscious mind will drop out of the dream
He'll be trapped in Limbo for a lifetime
What will that do to him
86
Cobb looks at her
Grave
When he wakes
his mind could be completely gone
When
when we wake  will still honor our arrangement
Cobb looks down at Saito sadly
Saito-san, when you wake you might not even remember that we had an arrangement
You'll have forgotten this world
Limbo will be your reality
Lost there so long, you'll have become an old man
Filled with regret
Waiting to die alone
Yes
Then 'll take the chance and come back
And we'll be young men together again
Saito smiles weakly
Cobb nods at him, turns to Ariadne
When were you trapped in Limbo
Cobb says nothing
Ariadne pulls him away from Saito
Cobb, you might have convinced the rest of this team to carry on with the job
But they don't know the truth
What truth
The truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wall
The truth that Mal is bursting up through your subconscious
() 87
(') The truth that as we go deeper into Fischer, we're also going deeper into you-and 'm not sure we're going to like what we find there
Cobb stares back at Ariadne
Saying nothing
This is not just about Fischer, it's about you
Tell me what happened to you and Mal
Trapped in Limbo
Cobb looks at her
Thinking it through
We were on a job
Exploring dreams within dreams
But we didn't understand how your mind can turn hours into years
How you can get trapped
Trapped so deep that when you wash up on the shore of your subconscious
:     , ,
You can lose track of what's real
How long were you stuck
Cobb pauses before he answers
Looks at Ariadne
Fifty years
Ariadne stares at him, incredulous
How did you stand it
:
We built
We created a whole world for ourselves
:
It's not so bad at first, being gods
The problem is knowing that it's not real
It became impossible for me to live like that
88
But not for her
She accepted it
At some point
: '   - Mal opens a '
Inside is a
She opens it- it is empty
She pulls out her
(
) she'd decided to forget that our world wasn't real
Mal places the top inside the safe
,  - And when you finally woke up
To wake from that
From decades lived
To be old souls thrown back into youth
It was hard
At first Mal seemed okay
But  started to realize something was wrong
Finally she admitted it
This idea she was possessed by
This simple little idea that changed everything
What was it
That our world was not real
No matter what  did, no matter what said, she was convinced that we were still in a dream
That we needed to wake up again
'  -  () Cobb is trying to calm Mal, who is hysterical
(
) That to get home we'd have to kill ourselves
- Ariadne looks at Cobb, appalled
89
What about your children
Cobb has to look away
She
she believed they weren't real
That our real children were waiting
Somewhere above
'  -  () Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he  the children out of the room,  - Calm down, Mal- They're projections, Dom
Your dreams
'm their mother-don't you think  can tell the difference
Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter tears
If it's my dream then why can't control it
Why can't  stop this
(it's obvious) You don't know you're dreaming
You keep telling me  am- And you don't believe me
(
) She was certain
But she loved me too much to go without me
So she made a plan
-  () Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key
(
) For our anniversary
-  () Cobb enters the lavish suite
He notices the 90
He steps forwards- - he has tipped over a champagne glass with his foot
dinner for two is He looks at the , confused
next to the broken glass is a
He picks it up, studying it, thinking
He feels a draught, looks to the window
The -  () Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the opposite window
Feet dangling over the dizzyingly high atrium
She smiles
Join me
Mal, come back inside
No
'm going to jump
And you're coming with me
No, 'm not
This is real-if you jump, you're not going to wake up, you're going to die
Let's go back inside and talk about this, please
We've talked enough
She  off a shoe and watches it
Come out onto the ledge or 'll jump right now
She means it
Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge opposite is wife
He looks down at the drop
'm asking you to take a leap of faith
can't do that, Mal
can't leave our children
If  go without you, they'll take them away, anyway
What do you mean
91
filed a letter with our attorney
Explaining how 'm fearful for my safety, how you've threatened to kill me
Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite,
(') love you, Dom
've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them
We're going home to our real children
Out children are here, Mal
Mal
Cobb looks for some way to reach her
You're waiting for a train
, ,  '
train that will take you far away
'
You know where you hope this train will take you, you can't know for sure
'
But it doesn't matter
Because you'll be together
Mal
Cobb  after her
Then tries to bury his face in the wall
,  - Cobb stares as he remembers
92
He letter to the authorities refuted all the claims about her sanity that she knew 'd make
'  -  () Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper
(
) She'd had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists
Cobb hears a - turns to the garden
James , Philippa joins him, examining the ground,
(
) (') It was impossible for me to explain the nature of her madness
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand
Right now
Or never, Cobb
Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and Philippa
Cobb turns from the window
Looks at the paper in his hand
It is an
(
) So  ran
And 've been running ever since, trying to buy my way back to my family
,  - Cobb looks across at Ariadne
Psychiatrists judged her sane
She was sane
She was just lost in the labyrinth
Then why should you blame yourself
Because we were a family
And we had a life  would do anything to get back to now
But that reality wasn't enough for me then
93
It might have been your idea to push the limits, Cobb
But you're not responsible for the idea that destroyed her
The idea that her world wasn't real
that was her own idea from her own mind
Cobb says nothing
(') Your guilt defines her
Powers her
If we're going to succeed in this, you're going to have to forgive yourself, and you're going to have to confront her
But you don't have to do it alone
You don't have to do this for me- 'm doing it for the others
They don't know the risk they've taken coming in here with you
Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a  take up a position
Cobb shakes his head, frustrated
We can't stay here
Arthur
,  - Browning puts his hand on Fischer's shoulder
These people are going to kill us if we don't give them the combination
They won't, they'll try to ransom us- heard them-they're going to lock us in and run the can into the river
What is in the safe
94
Something for you
Maurice always said it was his most previous gift
a will
Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn
It's an alternate
It supersedes the other only if you want it to
What does it say
It splits all the component businesses of Fischer Morrow into individual companies, transferring ownership to the boards of those companies
Leaving me nothing
basic living
Nothing more
The entire empire would cease to exist
Destroy my own inheritance
Why would he suggest such a thing
don't know, Robert
Cobb  the door
Arthur is behind him
Come to your senses
Let us go
don't know the combination
Not consciously
Cobb considers this
Opens his phone
Pulls out his gun
Let's try instinctively
have someone standing in your father's office ready to tap in a combination
He holds the phone to Fischer's mouth
95
(') First six numbers that come into your head
Right now
have no idea- Cobb  the gun onto Browning- Five, two, eight
four, nine, one
Cobb lowers his weapon
Listens to the phone
Shakes his head
Shuts the phone
You'll have to do better
Bag `em
Arthur puts  over their heads
- Cobb and Arthur drag Fischer and Browning to the van- We're worth much more to you alive
Arthur places Fischer on the back seat- uses a  to drop  onto Fischer's mask- his head
"Browning" yanks the sack from his head- it is now
(excited) His relationship with his father's much worse that we thought
That helps us
Arthur pulls a   from a case by the van
The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis
Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs
But how do you reconcile them if they're that estranged
96
'm working on that
Arthur lines up a shot through the window- Well, work fast-Fischer's projections are closing in quick, we need to break out of here before we're totally boxed in
Arthur  two snipers
Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito into the van
He groans
Ariadne straps him in, checks his bandages
Arthur can't get the last sniper- he's too hidden behind a wall- Shouldn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, Arthur- Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher
Fires- the sniper  into the air- Arthur looks at Eames
(') Shall we
They climb into the van- /
- The van pulls out into the rain-drenched streets
Arthur opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes- Shifting Fischer's antipathy from his father onto Browning should work
We need the imagery, the words
So you destroy his one positive relationship
No
We repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfather's true nature
Hell, we should be charging Fischer as much as Saito
97
What about his security
It's going to get worse as we go deeper
We bring in Mr
Charles
No
Who's Mr
Charles
bad idea
Arthur, the second we approach Fischer in that hotel, they're gonna mow us down-we run with Mr
Charles like on the Stein job
So you've done it before
Sure
But it didn't work
The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces
Eames takes this in
You learned a lot, though
Right
(to Eames) 'll need a decoy
No problem
How about a pretty young lady 've used before
Fine- Cobb looks back: a second
pulls out, tailing them
(') (to Yusuf) know you've got to stay ahead of them, but drive with kid gloves, okay
The world down there is going to be very unstable- 98
And don't make the jump too soon- that kick is our only way back, we have to be ready to catch it- 'll use the music to let you know when it's coming, but the rest is up to you
Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat
(') Everyone ready
Nods all round
(') Sweet dreams- Yusuf hits a button and we- : - Fischer nurses a drink
Staring at the ice cracking
(
) Am  boring you
Fischer looks up
beautiful  is next to him
(') was telling you my story
guess it wasn't to your liking
have a lot on my mind
Fischer looks around the bar
There are several - paying him too much attention
- Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby
They spot Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer
And there goes Mr
Charles
Who or what, exactly, is Mr
Charles
99
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious
- Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer's Sub- security
Mr
Fishcer
Good to see you again
Rod Green, Marketing
(to Blonde) And you must be
Leaving
She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him
(') In case you get bored
Cobb watches her walk away
The Sub-security  her
think you just got blown off
unless her phone number really does have only six digits
Fischer glances at the napkin: "528-491
" - Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde
And why don't you approve
Because it involves telling the mark that he's dreaming
Which involves attracting a lot of attention to us
Didn't Cobb say never to do that
You must've noticed by now how much time Cobb spends doing things he says never to do
100
- Cobb turns to Fischer
Strange way to make friends
(off look) Lifting your wallet,  mean
Fischer pats his pocket
Empty
He looks to the lobby where he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde
Goddamn it
The wallet alone's worth- Five hundred bucks
know
Don't worry, my guys are on it
Who did you say you were
Fischer looks at him, curious
Cobb plows on, confident- said  was Rod Green from Marketing-but 'm not
My name is Mr
Charles
might seem familiar to you
'm in charge of your security here
- The Blonde hurries up to Saito, emerging from the elevator- Mr
Saito, can  have a minute
She pushes him back into the elevator, closing the door as the Sub-security approaches
- The Blonde fondles Saito's lapels, getting close
'm sorry, but
Saito glances over her shoulder to see, in the tunnel of infinite reflections created by the elevator's opposing mirrors, three reflections in,
He winks
(') (pushing him away) Very amusing, Mr
Eames
101
You look a bit perkier
ripples through the elevator
Turbulence on the plane
Feels closer
That's Yusuf's driving
And we- : /
- Yusuf  the wheel as the van    , and    aside-
s Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror, He checks his , then checks the back: the with the impact and we- : - As a  echoes through the bar Fischer looks at Cobb trying to place him
Security
You work for the hotel
No
My specialty is subconscious security
You're talking about dreams
You're talking about extraction
Exactly
My job is to protect you
Behind Fischer a  puts down a tray- tipping a champagne glass over- - Cobb
Pauses, looks across the bar- ,
Cobb looks around the bar, the patrons start to  at Cobb, suspicious- Cobb shifts back to Fischer- 102
(') My job is to protect you from any attempt to access your mind through your dreams
Cobb regains his patter- the patrons lose interest
- Eames pulls out Fischer's wallet, moves to hand it to Saito, then , opens it, leafs past the cast to find
The : young Robert holding his  , his father blowing on it
The elevator doors open and Eames steps off
Saito the wallet
Get off at a different floor and keep moving
Dump the wallet, then meet me in the lobby
The security will try to track it down
We need to buy Cobb a little more time
The doors close
Saito puts the wallet in his pocket
He - a deep, nasty cough
- Cobb looks over Fischer's shoulder to see a watching him
Another  is walking in from the lobby
You're not safe here
Cobb steps away from the bar
Fischer does not move
(') Trust me
They're coming for you
Fischer sizes him up,     , and we- : /
- out the rear and side windows of the van- a Security Man is leaning out of the lead
With a - - in the back, ' ,  - : - Fischer looks out the windows at sudden, - - 103
Strange weather, huh
runs through the bar- Cobb looks around- (') You feel that
- Ariadne and Arthur watch the     the windows
Arthur sees   staring out at the weather, Several of them
What's happening
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream
That's making his subconscious look for the dreamer
For me
And we- : /
- At the end of the alley-   Yusuf  the van into a - we move into and   we- : - The liquid in Fischer's drink - Fischer notices, confused
Very odd-the weather, the gravity
Fischer looks around the bar- it's as if 45- - glasses  off tables
(') But  can explain all this
You've actually been trained for this
(Fischer nods) Think of the strangeness of the weather, the shifts in gravity
None of this is real
() 104
(') (beat) We're in a dream
Fischer looks at the room around them
Back to Cobb
All through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb
(') The simplest test of what 'm saying is for you to try and remember anything about the way you arrived in this hotel
okay
Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this
All around them, people  at Cobb
Several get up as if to approach
(') Breathe
Remember the training
Accept the fact that we're in a dream
That's why 'm here protecting you
As Fischer considers this we- : /
- Yusuf   the van,  down the street, swerving through traffic and we- : - The building gradually    - So you
you're not real
The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again
No
'm a projection of your subconscious
was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream
believe that's what has happened
Fischer takes this in
Then looks at the Security Men approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb- 105
- Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby
As he does so, he walks past the two , backs to us- Cobb ignores them- The two Sub-security fall in behind
Cobb hurries Fischer up the stairs- then  him into- - Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry- Hey- Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man  in- Cobb him to the ground-  his gun as the comes through the door, moving towards Fischer- Cobb  the Second Man in the back-  and the First Man
(') Jesus Christ
What are you doing
Cobb turns to Fischer, calm
Convincing
Look at the gun in his hand
Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol
Cobb opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and sidearm
(') These men were sent to abduct you
Cobb pulls out the gun and  it to Fischer
(') If 'm going to help you,  need you to be calm
Fischer remembers something
If this is a dream,  have to kill myself and wake up- Fischer raises the gun towards his head- wouldn't do that-they've probably got you sedated
If you pull that trigger, you might not wake up, you might drop into a lower dream state
() 106
(') Mr
Fischer, you know all this, you just have to remember it
Fischer lowers his gun
- Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man
Saito  around the corner, moves to a   and Fischer's  into it
He  into the stairwell as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses
- Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491
491 - Arthur leads Ariadne in
He opens the closet, opens the room safe, pulls our
So, if everything's correct, this room should be directly below 528
- Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer
What do you remember from before this dream
(thinking) Rain
gunfire
Uncle Peter
(looks up) Christ-we've been kidnapped
Where were they holding you
They had us
in the back of a van
Your body's bouncing around in the back of a van right now-that explains the gravity shifts
It was
to do with a safe
Christ, why's it so hard to remember
107
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up
It takes years of practice to do it easily
So, you and Browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind
What
They wanted a combination to a safe
they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head
That's them extracting a locator
locator
number from your own subconscious
It can be used any number of ways
(thinking) This is a hotel
Room numbers
What was the number you gave them
5, 2
something
it was a long number
528
528, 4 something
(opens phone) Well, we know where to start
(into phone) Fifth floor
491 - Arthur hangs up the phone
He is standing on a chair, attaching the explosives to the ceiling
Do you use a timer
No,  have to judge it myself
Once you're all asleep up in room 528, wait `til Yusuf starts his kick
How will you know
108
His music warns me it's coming, then the van hitting the barrier of the bridge should be unmistakable- that's when  blow the floor out from underneath us and we get a nice synchronized kick
Too soon, and we won't get pulled out; too late and  won't be able to drop us
Why not
The van will be in free fall can't drop us with no gravity
Arthur finishes setting the charges
- Saito moves through the lobby
Browning is coming in the other direction
Saito assumes him to be Eames
see you've changed
'm sorry
Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito's eye
'm
mistook you for a friend
Good-looking fellow, 'm sure
Browning moves off
Saito approaches Eames
That's Fischer's projection of Browning
We'll keep an eye on how he behaves- Why
How he acts will tell us if Fischer's starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to
109
,   - Cobb leads Fischer around a corner
Arthur and Ariadne are waiting in the corridor
They work for me
Fischer starts looking at room numbers
Stops at 528
Cobb draws his gun, steps back from the door and  it open
528 - Cobb  into the room, gun up
The room is empty
Arthur and Ariadne search the room
Saito and Eames arrive
Eames shuts the door
Arthur  something- Mr
Charles
Arthur holds up a
Cobb shows it to Fischer
You know what this is
Fischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers
think so
But  don't understand
They were going to put you under
'm already under
Under again
dream within a dream
Shhhh
Arthur is at the door
Someone is there
key goes into the lock- the door starts to open- Arthur   and the person entering,     - puts his gun in their face
Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather
Uncle Peter
What's going on
Cobb pulls the key from Browning's hand:  528
110
You said you were kidnapped together
Not exactly, they already had him
They'd been torturing him
You saw them torture him
Fischer shakes his head
Looks at Browning
Thinking
The kidnappers are working for you
No, Robert- You're trying to get that safe open
To get the alternate will
Browning looks up at Fischer
Fischer Morrow's been my entire life
can't let you destroy it
'm not going to throw away my inheritance
Why would
couldn't take the chance of you rising to your father's final taunt
What taunt
That will
'm sorry, Robert, but it's his final insult
challenge to build something for yourself
He's telling you that you aren't worthy of his achievements
Fischer takes this in
Devastated
That he was "disappointed
" 111
'm so sorry
But he was wrong
You'll make his company even greater than he ever could
Your godfather's lying, Robert
Fischer turns to Cobb
How do you know
It's what  do
He's hiding something
Cobb looks at Browning
Let's find out what
Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism
Browning watches
Silent
Let's do to him what he was going to do to you
Cobb rolls up his sleeve
Nods at Fischer to do the same
We'll penetrate his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know
Fischer looks Cobb in the eye
Decides- rolls up his sleeve, offering his bare arm
The team run tubes to each other- Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps
He's out
Wait, Cobb-'m lost
Whose subconscious are we going into
Fischer's
told him it was Browning's so he'd come with us as part of our team
(impressed) He's going to help us break into his own subconscious
112
That's the idea
He'll think that his security is Browning's and fight them to learn the truth about his father
Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism
The team goes out one by one
Cobb is last
Fischer's subconscious is going to run you down hard
'll lead them on a merry chase
Be back in time for the kick
'm on it
Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains, like those in Mal's suite- a  of someone (Mal
) As the screen goes , and we are- -  - Cobb's face, staring
Fixed
(
) Cobb
Cobb
Ariadne is beside him
They stand on a cliff, dressed in white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like commandos
Cobb checks his  , examines their objective: a massive    a mile below
What's down there
Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn
meant what's down there for you
Cobb turns to her
Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, down from the hill above
Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's earshot
You're the dreamer
need you to draw the security away from the complex
113
Then who guides Fischer in
You
If  know the route
we could be compromised
Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy
Ariadne comes over
designed the place
No
You're with me
(
) could do it
They turn to Saito
Saito shrugs at Eames
Eames smiles
Eames, brief Saito on the route into the complex
What we're looking for is going to be in the most heavily fortified section
That north tower
Cobb moves to Fischer
Saito
Eames sees on the snow
Looks at Saito
Mr
Fischer, you're going in with Mr
Saito
You're not coming in
You have to do this on your own
You have to get in there, break into your godfather's mind and find out the truth about your father
Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike
Keep this live at all times
'll be listening in, covering you
(holds up the sniper rifle) The windows on the upper floors are big enough that  can cover you from that south tower
114
Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle
: 528 - Arthur checks the mechanism
He hears   like thunder
He checks his watch-
With a last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor
/
- slams into the van as Yusuf - he glances back to see a  pulling up behind him, the - the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's window as the passenger - Yusuf  the wheel  the bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can it, spin the wheel back-  the passenger from the back of the bike
Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused - - Arthur walks towards the elevator
It - a emerges, heading right for him
Arthur takes a , speeding up
The  are louder, and we- : /
- The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the driver pulls a handgun and starts
Up ahead, an sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van- the   driving the
guns it, as the bike creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf , forcing the bike out into the path of the

- The fight continues all over the spinning room- and we- : /
- around as the van , along the barrier- the van , and we- : - Arthur and the Security Man  to the floor, Arthur on top
Arthur gets up- heads to the stairwell
/
- The van  with a thump
Yusuf  hard
Then as he realizes he is in one piece
up ahead makes him look up to the bridge, where the barriers are starting to come down
Yusuf checks his watch- Bugger
Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge
An
lines up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the barrier onto the bridge- The van   - the
behind  its read axle off,  to a halt on the rising section
The Security Man inside starts  on the van
- Arthur  down the steps-  the door to the fourth floor- spots   outside room 491
Hey
They - he  back into the stairwell-  down the stairs- the Security Men follow- they start , and we- : -  - Eames  down within sight of the hospital complex
He reaches into his pack and lets off a
116
- Security Men on the ramparts spot the flare and send out on skis and  to investigate
-  - Eames watches them close in, then launches himself down the mountain,  across the icy slope, and we- : /
- Yusuf  , looking over his shoulder to line up a at the edge
He  as vicious  from the the vehicle
He looks at his watch
The Sod it
hope your ready
He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place on sleeping Arthur's head
As he does so, he notices Saito's bandage
Yusuf hits - Edith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien" starts up and we- : - Arthur , hearing something-  - - he looks up - No, Yusuf
Too soon
slam into the stairs around him and we- : -  - Cobb and Ariadne make their way down towards the complex
( ) Cobb
Are you hearing that
Cobb listens
The wind sounds unusually
, -  - Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a patrol passes beneath his position
117
noticed it twenty minutes ago-at first  thought it was just wind
-  - Cobb is listening intently
The "wind" changes pitch
No, it's music
Dammit
( ) What do we do
We move fast
Saito, did you copy
,       - Saito and Fischer  down a   above the complex- We're going as fast as we can
-  - Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned
How long do we have
Yusuf's about ten seconds from the jump, which gives Arthur about three minutes, which gives us about- Sixty minutes
The route you gave them, can they do it in under an hour
don't think so
They've still got to climb down to the middle terrace
They need a new route-a direct route
The building's designed as a labyrinth
118
There must be access routes that cut through the maze
(into radio) Eames
, -  - Eames cannot answer- he  through the forest, Sub- security in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks
-  - Cobb turns to Ariadne
Did Eames add any features
Yes
What did he add
Ariadne looks at Cobb
shouldn't tell you
If Mal- There's no time-what did he add
Utility closets, trap doors
What about service features
Did he add any large pipes or- Ducts
He added an air duct system- it doesn't follow the maze
They can use it to go straight from the outer walls to the upper tower
Explain it to them
(into radio) Saito
- Saito is using a hammer to tap in a belay
119
Go ahead
And we- : /
- Yusuf looks at the Security Man in the
, gives him the finger and hits the -   at the barrier
and we- : - Arthur   the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and- - arrives behind the Security Man, who looks at him, , then looks down to realize he is now at the edge of a dangerous drop- Arthur shrugs
Paradox
Arthur  him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up to the fourth floor- throws open the door- and we- : /
- In  - the van     - and we- : - Arthur is  down the corridor when a sends him  into the air- and we- : -  - prompts Cobb to look across the valley- , -  - Eames shoots out of the trees, then  to the snow as he sees a great  up ahead- the - 120
- Saito hears the  above them
He looks down, Fischer is below, near the bottom of the sheer face- Look out
Saito  the rope- they -  the icy face and down the slope, clearing the path of the avalanche- and we- : /
- In   , the van emerges from the concrete balustrade and starts - and we- : - Arthur is still  through the corridor,  - he scrambles for a handhold, a sconce- and we- : -  - Cobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex
What was that
The kick
( ) Cobb
Did we miss it
Yeah, we missed it
, -  - Eames is lying on the snow
What the hell do we do now
( ) Finish the job before the next kick
121
What next kick
-  - Cobb looks at Ariadne as he talks into the radio
When the van hits the water figure Arthur's got a couple minutes and we've got about twenty
Cobb and Ariadne  towards the base of the complex
- Saito and Fischer  around the base of the building
They find a large
Lay a charge on the
They blow the charge
Climb into the open vent
/
- In   , the van seems   - and we- : - In  , Arthur pulls himself to the door of 491, opens it
He looks at the charges planted on the ceiling
How the hell do  drop you
He  the charges from the ceiling
Hurrying
And we- : ,   - Saito and Fischer hurry through the duct system
Saito is falling behind, coughing up blood
,   - Cobb  a Security Guard from behind, strangling him unconscious
He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs towards him
They enter the base of the south tower
,  ,   - guard is manning the tower
Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb the guard and moves to the window
122
(she points) That's the antechamber outside the strongroom
Cobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber
What about the strongroom
Doesn't it have any windows
Wouldn't be very strong if it did
(off look) Look, if you wanted to design it yourself- It's fine
Better hope that we like what Fischer finds in there
Cobb sets up his sniper rifle
Through the scope he can see three guards on the balcony outside the chamber
Three more inside
Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle
Ariadne watches through binoculars, appalled
These projections, they're part of his subconscious
Yeah
Are you destroying those parts of his mind
No, of course not
They're just projections
( ) Cobb
Something's wrong
, -  - Eames is watching the patrols   towards the complex
They're heading your way
Like they know something
,  ,   - Cobb hears this
Concerned
123
Buy us some time
( ) On my way
, -  - Eames   towards the base of the complex
And we= : 528 - Arthur  into the room
The  are floating, loosely connected by their tubes
Arthur looks at them, He  Cobb towards Eames, and we- : ,   - Saito and Fischer approach the grate covering the exit to the anteroom
Saito  to the floor of the duct, pulls out his radio
Fischer looks at him- he is ,
Fischer takes the radio,  into it
(into radio) We're here
Are we clear to proceed
,  ,   - Cobb  the anteroom through the scope-it looks clear
You're clear, but hurry-there's an army headed your way
Ariadne watches the patrols approaching the complex
,   - The  from the radio is too loud- Fischer  it and turns the volume to zero as he starts to remove the grate
- Eames is setting  along the   of the structure
He moves carefully-there is a   below the wall
124
,  ,   - Cobb  something through his scope
Something above the main windows, glimpsed through the side of the skylight
Shit
There's someone else in there
Cobb prepares to fire
Ariadne  the radio- Fischer, stop
It's a trap
- ,   - Fischer does not see the flashing light on his radio as he carefully lifts the grate
He motions for Saito to stay
,  ,   - Cobb  to fire
Come on
a little lower
a little- -
Ariadne puts up her binoculars
Spots Mal
Fischer is climbing out of the vent
Cobb, that's not really her- Cobb turns to her- How can you know that
- Fischer moves into the antechamber, cautious- 'm in
Fischer turns up the volume- ( ) Fischer, look out
- Mal  gracefully to the floor behind him- Hello
125
,  ,   - Cobb looks at Ariadne- Cobb, she's just a projection
Fischer
he's real
Cobb thinks
Nods,  back to the scope- too late- - Cobb reflexively pulls the trigger- Mal - Cobb steps back from the scope,
Eames
Get to the anteroom now
They run for the door
,   - Saito  as he hears the shot
He starts edging forwards, clutching his belly
And we- : 528 - The sleepers are floating in a rough stack, top-and-tailed
Arthur pulls the bedding from the bed and uses the sheet to bind the sleepers together
And we- : /
- In   , the van  , still high above the river
and we- : - Arthur  the floating stack of sleepers to the elevator
He hits the button- the doors open- he pushes them in- the charges- climbs through the hatch in the ceiling and we- : ,   - Eames steps over Saito, who looks up at him with  eyes- ,   - Eames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing over the bodies of Fischer and Mal
126
What happened
Mal killed Fischer- wouldn't shoot her
Eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer's jacket open- It won't do any good- Eames  Fischer's chest
Even if you could revive his body, his mind's trapped down there
It's over
Eames listens for a pulse
Looks up at Cobb
So that it, then
We failed
'm sorry
It's you who doesn't get back to your family
Eames looks down at Fischer
Then over to the double doors
wanted to know what was going to happen in there
think we had this one
There's still a way: We follow Fischer down- They look at her
We're almost out of time- Down there they'll be enough time
We'll find him-soon as you hear Arthur's music start, you use the defibrillator to revive him-we give him his own early kick from below
() 127
(') Get him in there- (points to doors) Then, as the music ends you blow the hospital and we all ride the kick back up through the layers
Eames looks at her, then to Cobb
Okay, Saito can hold them off while plant the rest of the charges
Saito's not going to last, Eames
We have to try
Go for it, but 'm taking the kick whether you're back or not
Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack
Offers it to Ariadne
Cobb watches
Silent
Ariadne pulls out the tubes- Can  trust you to do what's needed
Mal's down there- And  can find her
She'll have Fischer
How do you know
She wants me to come after him
She wants me back down there with her
Cobb rolls up his sleeve
Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve
Eames
Cobb and Ariadne lie down
Eames hits the button- And we are- () - Ariadne lies in the ,  up at a tremendous  prompts her to look around her- right down to the water
The buildings are , falling into the ocean like a  calving
Cobb towards her through the shallow water
Ariadne looks up at the crumbling city around them
This is your world
128
It was
And this is where she'll be
And we- : - Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges on the   and
He sets them,  the other explosives, then  , shooting up the shaft
As he hits the ,  the braking and safety systems of the elevator, we move into  , the fireballs   in graceful licks and we- : - Eames  around, full speed- getting the defibrillator paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the duct- pulls Saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun
Come on, Saito
need you to cover Fischer while  plant the charges
Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun
Eames moves to the window- pulls his machine gun off- checks its load
Ready
He watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls
Eames lays down a  of covering fire- then heads outside- - Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- a window behind him and we move into  , the glass   and we- : ()- Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed
They move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings
The streets are eerily
As they move further in, the buildings become , different
Ariadne marvels at the extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural style imaginable in waves of
You built all this
We both did
129
It's incredible
We built for years
Then, when that got stale, we started in on the memories
child's  echoes through the deserted canyons, prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a crouched, his back to us
joins the boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off
Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar  lined with an eclectic mix of buildings, from   to
This is our neighborhood
(confused) From what city
No
Our neighborhood
(pointing) That was our first apartment
then we moved to that building
we got that small house when Mal became pregnant
You reconstructed them all from memory
We had time
Cobb pauses in front of a French country house
Staring
What's that
The house Mal grew up in
Will she be in there
No
Come on- Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper
130
() - Cobb leads Ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the elevators
We both wanted a house, but we both loved skyscrapers
In the real world we had to choose
Not here
() - Cobb pulls out his handgun, and a ziplock bag full of bullets
How do we send Fischer back
We need some kind of kick
What
'll improvise
Cobb  his weapon, and the
The doors open
Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her
There's something you have to understand about me
About inception
You see, an idea is like a virus
Cobb leads her out of the lift
() - Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous interior of a craftsman house
They cautiously move down the corridor towards the back of the house
Resilient
(turns to Ariadne) Highly contagious, and an idea can grow
The smallest seed of an idea can grow to define or destroy your world
Cobb is staring into the kitchen
Mal is sitting at the table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the  of Limbo stretching off behind it
131
The smallest idea, such as
"Your world is not real
" Cobb hands Ariadne his gun and moves towards Mal
simple little thought that changes everything
Ariadne watches as Cobb sits down beside Mal
And we- : - Arthur  back down the shaft to the top of the elevator, past the car to the bottom and starts to set the , and we- : () - Cobb touches Mal's arm- she , angry
It is only now that we see that she holds a
Mal looks at Ariadne
So certain of your world
Of what's real
Do you think he is- (points at Cobb) Or do you think he's as lost as was
know what's real
What are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream
Mutable laws of physics
Tell that to the quantum physicists
Reappearance of the dead
What about heaven and hell
Persecution of the dreamer, the creator, the messiah
They crucified Christ, didn't they
know what's real
No creeping doubts
Not feeling persecuted, Dom
Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces
The way the projections persecute the dreamer
132
Mal puts her hand on his face
Pitying
Admit it, Dom
You don't believe in one reality anymore
So choose
Choose your reality like  did
Choose to be here
Choose me
(rising anger) have chosen, Mal
Our children have to get back to them
Because you left them
You left us
You're wrong, Dom
You're confused
our children are here- child's  draws Cobb- James  on the porch, back to us
Philippa joins him, also turned away
Cobb watches, moved
Mal leans in close
(whispers) And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you, Dom
Our real children are waiting for me up above
And we- : - Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees  on it
He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his shirt
Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we- : - Eames throws a , blowing up the security forces trying to ascend the terraces
He  to the ground to avoid - starts unpacking the charges and setting them along the base of the terraces- 133
,   - Saito looks up as he hears a Security Guard climbing through the duct
he raises his gun,  with weakness
And we- : ,  () - Mal laughs at Cobb
(laughs) Up above
Listen to yourself
You judged me for believing the very same thing
Mal points at the children- These are our children
Watch
(turns to the kids) Hey, James
Philippa
The children    to us-
They're not real, Mal
Our real children are waiting for us- The children run off
Cobb opens his eyes
You keep telling yourself that but you don't believe it- know it- And what if you're wrong
What if 'm what's real
Cobb is silent
You keep telling yourself what you know
but what do you believe
What do you feel
Cobb looks at Mal
Struggling
Guilt
feel guilt
And however confused  might get
() 134
(') However lost  might seem
it's always there
Telling me something
Reminding me of the truth
What truth
That you were wrong to doubt our world
That the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie
How could you know it was a lie
Because it was my lie
(realizing) Because you planted the idea in my mind
Because  performed inception on my own wife, then reaped the bitter rewards
Why
We'd become lost in here
Living in a world of infinite possibilities
world where we were gods realized we needed to escape, but she'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world
: Mal opens the doll's house
Takes the spinning top, lies it down in the safe
couldn't make Mal understand that we needed to break free
To die
So started to search our world
Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne
: Cobb  the streets of Limbo
Searching for the right place in her mind
135
: Cobb stops outside the  , ' , looking up at it
He heads inside
And when  found that place, that secret place where she had shut away her knowledge years before, broke it open
: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom
Comes to the doll's house
broke into the deepest recess of her mind, to give her the simplest little idea
: Cobb throws open the safe doors
Sitting on the shelf of the safe is a spinning top
On its side
truth that she had once known, but had chosen to forget
: Cobb picks up the totem
He  it in the safe
Cobb    of the safe
That her world was not real
: (
) That death was a necessary escape
They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes
Mal is crying
Cobb takes her hand, reassuring
He starts to speak- You're waiting for a train
train that will take you far away
You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure
Yet it doesn't matter
Mal looks at him across the railroad tracks
Replies- Because you'll be together
The train comes,  the lovers
Back in the present- Cobb looks into Mal's eyes
She is crying
136
never thought that the idea 'd planted would grow in her mind like a cancer
That even after we woke
: Cobb looks around the  , confused
He moves to the
Mal is on the ledge opposite
You'd continue to believe that your world was not real
Crying, Mal nods- That death was the only escape
: Mal  to her death
You killed me
Cobb looks at Mal
Whispers- was trying to save you-'m sorry
Mal comes in close to Cobb
Looks him over
You infected my mind
You betrayed me
But you can make amends
You can still keep your promise
We can still be together
right here
In our world
The world we built together

Mesmerized
If  stay, can she take him back
Cobb, what are you saying
Fischer's on the porch
Cobb, you can't do this
Go check he's alive, Ariadne
Ariadne moves onto the porch, high above the metropolis, and we- : - Arthur nods his head in time with the music, counting down, holding the detonator
He starts bracing himself, and we- : 138

Fischer again, and we- : ,  () - Ariadne looks up as a      across the sky
she looks down to see Fischer,   , lying below the rail
He's here
And it's time
But you have to come with us
Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky- Cobb, 'm not going to let you lose yourself in here
You have to get back to your children
Send Fischer,  have to stay- You can't stay here to be with her- Cobb turns from Mal
Looks at Ariadne
'm not
Saito is dead by now
That means he's here

Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail
Cobb looks back at Mal

Mal looks at Cobb, furious
Not real

Here-doesn't this feel real, Dom
She  him in the chest- Cobb - , looking at Mal- 139
wish you were
But  couldn't make you real

perfection
As you really were
You're the best can do
And you're not real
Mal pulls the knife and moves to  again- No
rings out, Mal  her shoulder- Cobb turns to Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun
What're you doing
Improvising
She  Fischer off the roof-  again at Mal- Fischer  as the sky    - Fischer , then , no longer falling, and we are- - Eames pulls the defibrillator from Fischer's chest as he Get in there-quick
Fischer looks up at the double doors

At one end of the room is a bed

His
Breathing with tremendous difficulty
Dying
And we- : () - Ariadne takes aim at Mal- No

She lowers the gun
And we- : 140

You were disappointed that  couldn't be you
The dying man    with surprising energy
(whisper) was disappointed
that you tried
Fischer hears this
And we- : - The elevator car is  along its track by the explosion- - Arthur is  against the floor of the car next to the sleepers who  with the force of - and we- : - Eames  Fischer- 141
(to himself) ) Come on, come on
- The Father collapses back onto the pillow
Fischer starts to weep
His Father reaches out a trembling hand but when Fischer tries to hold , he  his son's hand away
He is reaching for the  next to his bed
His fingers fumble at the keypad, he can't open it
His son pushes 5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad
Opens it
Inside the safe is the And beside it is a  , clearly made by a child
By Fischer
He takes it out,  at it
He turns to his father, but his father is dead
Eames, watching from the door,   - - line of

Cobb shields Mal against the blast- looks up at Ariadne, who  the railing,  the wind- That's the kick-you have to go
You're coming
No, 'm not
'm staying here to find Saito
(turns to Mal) And to say goodbye
Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing
Don't lose yourself
Find Saito
And bring him back

Ariadne lets the wind pull her off the edge- - and we- - Ariadne  as the  - her eyes  - 142
() - Cobb holds Mal in his arms
The wind
We'd be together forever
You promised me

But we can't
And 'm sorry
You remember when you asked me to marry you
You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together
And we did
Mal looks at Cobb
thinking
Remembering
:    (  ) miss you more than  can bear
but we had our time together
And now  have to let go
She nods, weakly
Cobb holds Mal as her eyes close
and we- - Fischer and his Father's body  - - Ariadne  inside the  , and as it Ariadne  into- /
- ,      - Fischer's  , - he  , pushes out of the broken window- , goes back to Browning and  him out
143
- Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who  and He starts  for the near bank, struggling through the rain-impacted water- ,  - Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater
They are sharing   pulled from beneath the front seat
Arthur turns to Saito
There is blood in the water around Saito's belly- his eyes are - Arthur feels for a pulse
turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless
Ariadne Arthur's elbow, pulling him away
- Fischer turns Browning/Eames over
They lie there, exhausted
'm sorry, Robert
Fischer stares at the rain on the water
The will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man, not live for him
(turns to Browning) ) And 'm going to, Uncle Peter
Browning nods
Wipes the rain from his face
In the puddle beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames
- Arthur sits on the riverbank, breathing heavily
What happened
Cobb stayed
With Mal
No
To find Saito
Arthur looks out at the water below the bridge
He'll be lost
No
He'll be alright
144
And we- : The waves  a   onto wet sand
As the Japanese Security Guard turns him onto his back, we realize that this is Cobb-
,  - Cobb  his food
The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, 90 years old) watches him
So
have you come to kill me
Cobb does not look up
've been waiting for someone to come for me
Someone from your half-remembered dream
Saito peers at Cobb
Cobb
Not possible-he and  were young men together
And  am an old man
Filled with regret
Saito , nods
Waiting to die alone, yes
Cobb is  at something on the table
came back for you
came to remind you of what you once knew
Cobb gestures at the table
Saito follows his gaze down to the polished surface of the table
That this world is not real
145
The top    , Saito looks at the top
Then back to Cobb
You came to convince me to honor our arrangement
Yes
And to take a leap of faith
As Saito-san listens to Cobb, he looks at the  on the table between them
Come back and we'll be young men together again
The elderly Saito looks at Cobb
Nods
And we- : , 747 - Ariadne watches Cobb
His eyes are closed
(
) Hot towel, sir
His
He takes the towel with a nod
Ariadne smiles
Relieved
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about twenty minutes
Do you need immigration forms
Cobb nods
Takes a landing card
Looks around the cabin
Saito is  him
Serious
Haunted
Holding Cobb's gaze, Cobb nods thanks
,  - Cobb steps forwards to the
Hands him his passport
Nervous
The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb up and down, then
- the passport is stamped
As Cobb takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter
She nods at him
He nods back
Then moves off
As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle greetings with Eames and Yusuf
Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb
Cobb brushes past Fischer, who glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him, then moves on
146
As Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots Professor Miles, waving at him
,   '  - Cobb enters with Miles
Drops his bags
Moves to the table, looking out at the overgrown garden
He reaches into his pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the table and  - a '  makes him look up- Through the window, James and Philippa have run into view, playing,
Cobb  at the back of his children's heads
Miles moves to the window and on the glass- James and Philippa - see their Dad
He steps to the window, watching their    as they run towards him
Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is
