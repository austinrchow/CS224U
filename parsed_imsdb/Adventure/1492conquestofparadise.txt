He is seated in a splendid chair
Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate hands
His fore finger impatiently plays with a large topaz ring
Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing on marble floors
: Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion, dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard
This is door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer
We can now here a subdued conversation
stands up as: The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room
, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters moves towards him
He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large table
She is followed by a ,  , and three dignitaries of Church and State
All sit beside her
takes a document and starts to read aloud
On screen the words:   -  - 1500 Your Majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of Hispanola, our first settlement in the New World, and the activities there of your servant, Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, Governor of that Island
You will remember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us -- the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos, degradation and madness beyond imagining
punctuates each word carefully
From the beginning, Columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island
He appointed his brothers to important positions, at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him
He promised to build a city, the City of Isabel, named after Your Majesty
What he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts, and that in the wrong place, for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud
Is that not so, Brother Buyl
The  nods
Yes, Your Honor
He promised gold
Not finding the easy quantities he promised, Columbus commanded each Indian to pay an annual tribute
Most being unable to, they were barbarously punished, against the express wish of Your Christian Majesties
lowers her eyes
Since provocation and injustice never ceases, many of the Indians have fled to the forests, or have begun to slay the Christians
looks over at
Could it be so
Yes, Your Majesty
But there is worse
From the beginning, he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor, treating them equally with the Indians, all of them reduced to slavery
When the nobleman Adrian de Moxica protested against such treatment
(he pauses) he was executed
(pause) Is that not true also, Brother Buyl
Yes, Your Honor
It is all true
All of it
saw it with my own eyes
He has lost control
His great arrogance has led him into depravity
He encourages our soldiers to marry the native women
He promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors
Silence
Is that the man  knew, Treasurer Sanchez
Yes, Your Majesty
: -  - the :   is stretched on a bed, sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious
Insects crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away
There is a dripping sound of water
(
) Of all the words my Father wrote and there were many,  remember these the most
"Nothing that results from human progress is achieved with unanimous consent
" Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a table
stands up and moves to the table
Some of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames lizard scuttles into the shadows
(
) "And those who are enlightened before the others are condemned to purse that light in spite of others
" stares down at the documents, moving them away from the rain drips
He stares out by the window, and we see: devastated landscape
Flooded roads, half-destroyed huts, broken trees
dog picks its way through the mud
(
) There was a time when the New World didn't exist
: - vast stretch of ocean
It fills the screen
Unbroken, infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away, meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl and misty light
(
) The sun set in the west on an ocean where no man had dared to venture
And beyond that, infinity
Pulling back, we discover: --  and a strongly built man in his middle thirties, are riding a mule
The ' weather-beaten face frames unusually bright eyes
On the screen these words:  , 1491 are following a windthrashed path at the top of the hill
hums a song, and looks up at him in adoration
(
) Once  asked my Father where he wanted to go
And he replied:  " want to travel all over the seas want to get behind the weather
" laughs
He then starts to hum along with his : - rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone walls and thousands of sheep
, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him
High- spirited and wild,  laughs and tumbles over
rides his mule along the narrow track, watching his ' antics with amusement
In the distance, the solitary figure of
calls out to his son: Fernando
runs over
lifts him up onto the mule
As they move along the track we now see, perched on a distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La Rabida, their destination
-   - As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters, suddenly spots a familiar , standing under the  arches
Diego
He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his  -- an adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn, delicate face
' response is constrained
Diego
Aren't you going to kiss your brother
smiles a little, and kisses  -- who is immediately distracted by a procession of hooded , hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime
The  all turn to greet   , a white- haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer
' gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his arms to greet
He pats ' head and turns to
Diego, take Fernando to the dining hall
He must be hungry
Yes, Father
Both  leave under the arched roof
and begin to walk across the cloister
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious
Brothers should be raised together, Colon
Even brothers from different mothers
Father,  am doing what  think is the best for him
And he has the teacher  would have chosen for myself
laughs at the compliment
Just be careful you don't lose him
They have crossed the cloister
pushes open a door
-   - Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the miracle of printing, a recent German discovery
Several , perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily "" some of these massive volumes, delicately painting around the letters in bright colors and gold leaf
Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings, projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor
As and  move forward their conversation is punctuated by light and shadow
(fumbles in a pocket under his robe) have something for you
Almost casually, he hands  a letter
You will be heard at the University of Salamanca
stops dead in his tracks
Almost frantically he tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes
God
That's in a week
That's what it says
How did you manage it
(smiling) With some difficulty
had to promise them you were not a total fool
pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden panel
-   - is not a tidy man
Books are piled up on the floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps, instruments of astronomy
the visible evidence of an inquiring mind
With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a hundred times -- which indeed they have --  sits behind his desk, and  opposite him lights a candle and considers the mess
Then methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath
When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his expression
He turns over an hourglass
Why do you wish to sail west
To open a new route to Asia
At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it
He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the desk
By sea, sailing around the African Continent -- the journey takes a year
His finger traces the journey, from west to east
Or by land
We are  now on the map, as we watch his finger tracing a line between Europe and the Far East
(
) But the Turks have closed this route to all Christians
Trading with the Orient has become arduous, if not dangerous
(he pauses) There is a third way
We notice that the outline of the European continent is familiar
But we also notice that, in that great expanse of ocean, the whole American continent is missing
By sailing West across the Ocean Sea
' , touched by the mystery
How can you be so certain
The Ocean is said to be infinite
Ignorance
believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands
How can you be so certain
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras
(interrupting) Esdras is a Jew
So was Christ
throws his quill in the air in frustration
He glances at the hourglass: Two minutes
and already you're a dead man
Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon
(mockingly) 'll try to remember that, Marchena
Father Marchena
(ignoring this) Passion is something one cannot control
(heatedly) You get so carried away when you are being contradicted
've been contradicted all my life
Eternity
(amused) Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son
-   - and  wait in the courtyard appears and lifts  onto the mule
turns to go
Diego
walks over to him, squats down so their eyes meet
He looks at his  for a moment
Would you like to come and stay with us
Uncomfortable with the proposition,  cannot find an answer
'll do whatever makes you happy
am happy, Father
reaches out -- and touches his shoulder
He climbs up behind , who waves back to his as they ride off
-     - leads the mule, carrying the sleeping , through narrow streets
There's a clamorous noise in the air
Suddenly a large group of  , shouting with excitement, run up the street and brush past them
Then more people
sits up straight
The noise grows, rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence
Huge  have thronged the massive old square outside the cathedral
Holding the mule by its reins, tries to push his way through
Suddenly, as a gap opens in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the center of the square stand three pyres, already alit
are busy around the fires
Look, Father
Before  can stop him,  has slipped off the mule and into the crowd
Fernando
But the  has been swallowed into the mass of people
tries to follow him
Flames leap into the night sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with a lurid glow
Prayers are being chanted somewhere
has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd
brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a bound to a post
The heretic wears the "sambenito", a robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs, indicating that the man is Jewish
' eyes are mad with fear
But he refuses to kiss the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance
is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't realize what is happening
He is too close to the platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres
Fernando
He motions to his son, takes the ' hand, and drags him away from the scene
But  looks back
The distance now allows him to see inside the flames
-  --  ' face is distorted in a silent scream
The neck snaps like burning wood, and the head falls on one shoulder
Then the whole body collapses into the fire
'  -    - and  lead the mule into the white-washed, stone-floored hallway of the modest house
is mute, shocked by what he just witnessed
takes the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother, , appears from the kitchen to greet them
She is a beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic personality
tousles the ' hair glances at his  but looks subdued and doesn't say anything
'  -  - joins  in the kitchen, where a  is cooking
He explains Fernando's subdued manner
Executions
In the square
nods
He goes to the stone butt and pours water on his hands
They've agreed to see me in a week
puts the candle on the table
Her face lights up with a smile
He walks to her, and kisses her
could be gone for years
know
haven't given you much of a life
(amused) Well
that's true
have a child by a man who won't marry me
Who's always leaving
Are we going to argue
'd love to argue with you sometimes
But you're never here
They laugh and kiss
Perhaps  was never meant to live with a woman
(still kissing him) find that hard to believe
: '  -  - They are eating around the table, and  is unusually silent and thoughtful
pours a little wine into ' water, to distract him looks up at him, surprised
smiles, then looks over at
Fernando, don't you think we are lucky to live with such a beautiful woman
He winks at
smiles
'  -  - The room is dark
As  approached the bed with a candle, it illuminates the naked body of looks up at him intently
drop of wax falls on her skin
She flinches, murmurs
They make love
- medieval "campus"
Students-novices are playing "pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball
They run with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing white legs
Others are studying, reading, hurrying to their class
We find  watching the game from the steps above the court
Others are waiting with him
comes from a door, and looks around the group
(hesitant) Christopher Columbus
-    - An El Greco painting
tableau of twenty  sitting on dark, sculpted seats
Candles throw a gloomy light on their faces
Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in bourgeois outfits
Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish fashion -- he is , Treasurer of the House of Aragon
(Don ) holds a stick with an ivory claw at the top
Languidly, he scratches his back -- his off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his peers
You say Asia can be found by sailing west
Yes, your Eminence
The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ
(pause) Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle
Erathostene
Ptolemeus
am, Your Eminence Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately
(he leans forward) 22,000 leagues or more
Which makes the ocean
uncrossable
He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect
But you may have found new evidence proving that these men of knowledge are totally mistaken
ripple of mirthless laughter
Your Excellencies are aware of the statements of Marin de Tyr
We are
Then you are also aware that his theories contradict Ptolemeus
De Tyr believes the Ocean to be only 750 leagues
murmur of protest spreads among the members of the Commission
But Columbus is determined to press his theories
The Florentine Toscanelli and the French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both think that Marin de Tyr is accurate in his calculations
And therefore, that the ocean can be crossed
Indignant and amused murmurs
raises his voice to quiet the assembly
Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de Tyr is right
(the laughter subsides) Are we here to examine this proposal or not
Silence
(to Columbus) In your opinion, how long would the voyage be
Seven weeks
Six, during the summer months
The murmur increases
Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers
Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a year
of simple bearing, that  identifies as being a seaman, interrupts
How would the crew survive without being able to land for fresh water
Water is undrinkable after six weeks
You'd never be able to turn back
We wouldn't have to turn back
We would find land at this point
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew
am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment
Excellency, you are right
Instantly, the protests stop
am a seaman, not a scholar
But as a simple man craving for knowledge,  have read all the work of these renowned geographers and discovered that none of them could agree on the exact width of this ocean
He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as a lawyer before a grand jury
Therefore, as a modest man, wonder:  who is right
The experts listen
' , impressed by the boldness
Who is right
This question remains unanswered
He walks and stops before , and catches the look of , sitting just behind him
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter
And that is to make the journey
(to the assembly, with passion) am ready to risk my life to prove it possible
Your life, and that of others
If they agree to follow me, yes
(
) Suppose you cross this ocean
Suppose you reach Asia
What would Spain do there
Conscious of a friendlier voice,  sees the Treasurer , an imposing man in his fifties
Trade, Your Excellency
According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world
Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold
(interrupting) Is that all that interests you
Gold
No
The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people
, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God
smiles thinly
Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the Bearer of the Cross
(ironic) And Colon -- the one who populates
Another small rill of laughter
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world
hum of interest
-- watching intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips
So you consider yourself the chosen one
pause
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical
(calmly) Blind faith is what  consider heresy
The murmur turns to an audible gasp
gets to his feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a candle only inches from his face
There is absolute silence
meets the ' gaze unflinchingly
(quietly) Asia can be found to the west -- and will prove it
---
-  - The  is alone to deliberate
Food and wine has been laid out on tables
In the distance, students' cries carry over the conversation
approaches
The Treasurer of Spain honors us with his presence
bows slightly
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence
The Judgment is ours
Naturally
But  would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a
dispute over a point of geography
helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the other members of the committee, who pretend not to be listening
(interrupting) He is a mercenary
Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions
Indeed
The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them
(casually) My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain
understands the hint, and stops smiling
You would use your influence to assist this
intriguer
reaches for a decanter of sherry
You know, Your Eminence, the fascinating thing about power, is that what can be given so effortlessly
He offers the decanter to , who automatically lifts his glass
But instead,  pulls back the decanter, pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table, leaving  staring at his own empty glass
can so easily be taken away
And he drinks with a smile
- '  - reads aloud the Commission's letter
and therefore nothing could justify the participation of Your Highnesses in the venture that relies upon such feeble assumptions, and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical
if not impossible
He shakes his head, puts the letter down
looks appalled; devastated
They didn't listen
They didn't want to listen
He paces about the book-lined room
You mustn't give way to despair
You must wait
Wait
've waited seven years already
How much longer do you want me to wait
If God intends you to go, then you will go
(angrily) Damn God
is shocked
Colon
Damn all of you
You all set up theories based on what
You never leave the safety of your studies
Go out
Find out what the world is about and then tell me something can listen to
He seizes a beautiful book from ' desk
These don't mean anything
They're full of assumptions
Out of the heads of old men who've never been past the end of their gardens
He hurls the book across the room
is horrified
No
My books
seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping them to the floor
All of them
Just lies
Colon
Don't
tries to stop him
In his fury, accidentally knocks the poor old  to the ground
His cries bring three  rushing into the room
As  continues to rage and scatter books everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect
Finally, a short, muscular  delivers a quick punch that sends crashing to the floor
- lies face down on the stone floor
He is dressed in a homespun robe
His arms are stretched out in penance
and  look down at him
Father
Sssshhhh
One can't speak to a man doing penance
What can you do
Nothing
That's the point, Fernando
pause -- and then  lies face down on the floor beside his , and stretches out his arms in the same way
is left looking on, unable to bring himself to join them
-   - Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry in the light breeze
pins up a new addition
Another  works nearby, in silence
(
) Senor Colon
turns, to see a small, stocky  approaching:  a middle-class gentleman
He nods
Ah, thank God
've been looking all over Seville for you
Never expected to find a sailor in a monastery, eh
He laughs
smiles, but doesn't say anything
is clearly a little surprised
Name's Pinzon, by the way
Martin Alonzo Pinzon
'm a ship owner from Palos
glances around cautiously, and walks a little way down the cloister, away from the other , gesturing for to follow him
is yet more surprised by this strange behavior
(indicating the monk) Is he a spy
shakes his head
stares at him, perplexed
What is it
Are you a Trappist
shakes his head again
Vow of silence
Penance
nods vigorously
Jesus
Just my luck
He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk cloth
Listen
'll do the talking for both of us
You just nod
Agreed
Just as  do with the wife
nods
know that the Commission turned you down, right
What do you expect
You're a foreigner
But want to help you
gives him a glance like one throws a question in the air
You wonder why  believe in you
Hey,  am a seaman
And we don't like to be told where to go, and where not to go
looks at him, and bursts out laughing
The other looks round severely
ducks behind a map, following him
lowers his voice
don't look like it, but  have friends at the Court
The Treasurer of Aragon, for example
He finances me
His name's Santangel
Ever heard of him
shakes his head, but looks increasingly interested by what he's hearing
He can get you an audience with the Queen
You know why
She owes him money
That's how it is
You -- me -- the Queen -- the world and his mistress -- agreed
nods
So
What do you say
looks around, catches the disapproving face of the , crosses himself, then speaks: Where can  meet this man
(indicating with a nod) Immediately
turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties, examining the maps
- huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret of a mosque
are holding back a crowd at the foot of the tower
To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a Cross is hoisted up in its place
Astride horses, and the Treasurer  are watching the scene
They push through an extraordinary scene
The city of Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after several years of siege
All around them, are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated , bearing only a few possessions
Ragged, half-starved men, women and children
These people built Granada
Centuries ago
It is a great victory over the Moors, Don Colon -- and yet what a tragedy it is
The   pass a procession of grateful , who are crawling on their knees, chanting psalms and flagellating themselves
At the head of the procession,   carry a statue of the Virgin Mary swathed in silk and lace
The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight
Is this a good time to meet her
It couldn't be better
Victors can't say no
Bells are pealing triumphantly
The noise is tumultuous
They ride towards the magnificent palace
-  - Fabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp; exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees
The distant sounds of victory
and  walk through the gardens, escorted by
pass by, carrying coffers or piles of documents
As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are fewer people
They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where several  are waiting patiently for an audience
appears
They bow
approaches to murmur a compliment
Your Excellency
truly grateful
your help
as ever
protests softly, and looks over at , a half-smile forming on his lips
Then a  appears, and motions for  to follow
-   - An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the ' hand
We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades, mosaics
At the far end, windows open onto a view of Granada's rooftops
Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of The light in her blonde hair creates a halo around her head as she turns falls to his knees
Rise
Come forward
He approaches the window, stopping close to her scrutinizes him quickly
should not even be listening to you, since my council said no
But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity
And Sanchez, that you are not a fool
(bold) No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors
smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness
The ocean is uncrossable
What did they say about Granada before today
(a beat) That she was impregnable
smiles again
cannot ignore the verdict of my council
Surely you can do anything you want
direct challenge
She doesn't know what to make of this man
How little you know
This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment
Now we sense scrutinizing her
May  speak freely
(with a smile) You show no inclination to speak otherwise
know what  see
see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is
Who's not afraid
see a women who thinks
"What if
"
(amused at his familiarity) woman
slight pause
Forgive me
but you're the only Queen  know
She bursts out laughing
Then we are equal
since you are the only sailor  know
beat
How old are you, Senor Colon
Thirty seven, Your Majesty
And you
Once again taken off guard,  flushes, and turns away slightly to hide it
Thirty eight
pause
You will be informed of our decision
bows and goes to leave
As the  opens the door for him, he turns back
Actually,  thought you were younger than me
And he goes out, leaving her stunned
'  - -  - chalk white road, lined with trees
Two liveried are walking down the road, one carrying a large silver tray, the other a smaller tray
They are overtaken by an  who hurries along the road, with documents under his arm
'  -     - The  enters an imposing stable block
In the paddock,  is training a magnificent young horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will
The  watches him, unable to interrupt
Behind him the two  can be seen bringing in the silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of wine
They begin to lay them out on a table
'  -     - pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food, while the , clearly working himself up into a frenzy, reads from a document
and he demands
he  to be made a Knight, with the right to bear the Golden Spurs
He will receive the title of Don Cristobal Colon -- which will be extended to his descendants for ever more
The  looks up
He is reading the contract that  has proposed
, his mouth full, gestures for him to continue
Go on
He will be named Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea
Viceroy of the West Indies
Governor of all islands or lands discovered or as will be discovered with his help
The  looks up again
The highest titles of nobility, Your Excellency
To an immigrant sheltered by monks
gestures for the document
Wipes his mouth
Continues reading, calmly: Furthermore he will receive one eight of all wealth or monies, precious gems, pearls, metals, spices and other lucrative sources conquered within the boundaries of his admiralty
He smiles, hands the document back
It's very underdone
(exploding) Underdone
It's monstrous, Excellency
No, the pheasant
It's almost raw
And he carries on eating
You worry too much, Carvajal
The man will have to lower his demands
Believe me, he
-    - Close up on
'
'  quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy hole in the wall
Two beautiful eyes peer through a grille, into the next room
What they see: and  together
is visibly upset
(calmly) We have considered your -- demands very carefully, Senor Colon
Your expectations are
excessive, in every way
tightens his fists, tries to remain calm
If  am right, my requests are fair
holds up a document
We have prepared our own contract
He offers the document to , who takes it, scans it quickly, shakes his head
No
No
have waited too long, fought too hard
Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit
No
will not be your servant
The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little smile
remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me
'm not bargaining
(steely) Then you are too ambitious
leans over the table, faces him
And were you never ambitious, Excellency
Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us
(abrupt) If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will
smiles
If you can do that, Excellency -- 'll become a monk
He turns, strides towards the door
We hear a ' muffled laughter
As  goes out,  appears through a secret door
bows
goes over to the window and looks out
You were right, Don Sanchez
His demands could never be granted
Never, Your Majesty
Although
She turns, questioningly, towards him
Although one may always renegotiate a contract
Especially signed by Royal Hands
-  - joins  at the window
They see striding out and away
-    - (quietly) Into a monk
(with a smile) Yes
It would be a pity, wouldn't it
(turning to Sanchez) Call him back
- Teeming life
pushing his way through crowds
He is expressionless and distracted
He looks around him, stops walking
And then, unexpectedly, shouts
All heads turn as if he were totally insane
He walks on as if nothing happened
'  - is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with a glass of wine
There is a movement behind him is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt
turns and looks at her, almost sad
She said yes
(moved) Thank God
She smiles
But he seems to be unable to share her happiness
If  ever come back,  swear will
She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his mouth
(softly) 'm not asking you to swear to anything
don't want you to wait for me
(smiling) That's something you can't decide
kisses her
- '  - Strange, unearthly music
flickering light in a dark tunnel
, holding a candle in front of him, walks slowly down the dark corridor
Quietly opening a door, he walks into ' study
'  - :   huge illustrated map of western Europe and Asia
' candle moves slowly across the Atlantic Ocean, to the edge of the map
There, the illustrator's imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons; creatures half-human, half-animal
Sitting at his desk,  is looking at the map
(
) You can't go there
Turning,  finds his son beside him
Why not
points at the monsters
He pulls the boy to him
There aren't any monsters, Fernando
The only monsters are in here
(he taps his own forehead) Watch
He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible monsters, transforming it at once
laughs immediately
want to go with you
There'll be a time
You promise
(Columbus nods his head) Do you swear on St
Christopher
pulls the chain with the St
Christopher medal from under ' shirt
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven
(laughing) Yes
Yes,  do
On all of them
And he hugs his  tightly
- - luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate, down to the harbor
We see the faces of the  and their  -- ,    -- We sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure
The procession is lead by  and four young carrying the Madonna
All hold long, burning tapers, saying the rosary
pushes through the crowd, and kisses the Madonna's feet
- Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by the  and  of the
The   the  and the  nestle against the quayside
Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally witness this event
-  - sits on a barrel and crosses himself
Behind a curtain sits
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti
Forgive me, Father
For  have sinned
recognizes ' voice
am listening, my son
Father,  have betrayed my family
betrayed my men
And  betrayed you
What are you saying
lied
The journey will be longer than  said
How long
am not sure
It could be twice the distance
pause
May God forgive you
You must tell them
You must tell your men
If  tell them, they won't follow me
You know that  am right, Father
You trust me
My son, my son
(he shakes his head) Your certitudes are sometimes frightening
(pause) Christopher, you must speak to them
And if you don't  will
You are bound by an oath, Father
long silence
believed in you
Give me absolution
No response
Give me absolution, Father
Devastated,  reluctantly makes the sign of the cross
-  - walks over to where  and  are waiting
He kisses and hugs
(
) Ispo Te Absoluto
May God forgive you and have mercy on your soul, Christopher Columbus
Go in peace
: -  - The
stands in front of Be good to your mother, Fernando
Do you promise
nods, tears in his eyes
Then  embraces tightly
She whispers into his ear
Speak to Diego
But  and  are unable to find words, and instead they clumsily hug
Someone taps ' shoulder
He turns around to see
Wordlessly, they hug
: Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water
Now the  are slowly moving parallel to the quayside
The starts walking abreast to the holding up babies, blowing kisses, old  crying
,  ,   are among them
suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and throws it at
Diego
Here
catches it
Opening his hand he looks at the medallion
Then looks up at his , elated
is now two meters from the
is now opposite
(casually) Take care of my investment, wherever you're going
(ambiguous) have to tell you Santangel don't know where on earth  am going
They both laugh
, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand slide gently along the gigantic hull
He stares up at the leaning on the rail
Vaya con Dios
(Go with God
) They wave back
: walking towards the Moorish gate
He finally turns, sad and distraught
He sees: : -  - The sea resembling a  , holding its breath
living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable metamorphosis
Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety of the crew, the fear of the unknown
moving slowly alongside, surging majestically through the waves
Sinking back, disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music
- '  is throwing buckets of water on the deck
is busy clearing the ropes around the mast
is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of the evening meal
heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail, punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant
- The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an instrument
' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the prow
Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars
are watching with curiosity
One of them is , a rough, stocky Basque
Near , on a tressel, various books and charts
He makes an entry in the log
Then goes back to his quadrant
He senses  standing next to him
(softly) Due west, Captain Mendez
And may God be with us
God be with us admiral
doesn't move, continuing to observe
What is it Mendez
Speak
is hesitant
He nervously clears his throat
Well
It's the men, Sir
They wonder how you know our position
We've lost sight from land days ago
(still taking readings) And what do you think Mendez
Well,  surely know what a quadrant is
But 've never seen it used at night before
Come over here
hesitates, then motions to
The are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation
Now, find the North Star
Do you have it
: The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the north star
(
) Steady yourself
Keep the plumb line vertical
The picture steadies
: nods -- and loses equilibrium
The plumb line swings
Don't move
mistake of one degree and we'll be off 6,000 leagues
tries again
What do you read
Twenty eight
turns to
That's it
The twenty eighth parallel
And we'll follow it until we reach land
does not seem convinced
How do you know land is on the twenty eighth parallel
-  - blazing sun
The ship is like a furnace, its brass fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the air shimmer over the decks
Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the sagging prow sail
The '  throws an empty bucket attached to a rope over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with water
As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair lip
He drenches himself
From the shade, watches him
Chicken-ass face
The others laugh
The , ashamed, tries to ignore them
' hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he reacts like he was burnt
Shit
He sucks his blistered fingers
never seen heat like this
Not even in Las Minas
The water's going putrid in the barrels
You'll be drinking your own piss
For the glory of Spain
and Admiral Colon
Bastard
The '  glances round at them
What are you listening to, chicken ass
Ah, leave him alone
He's doing no harm
With a face like that
(to boy) don't want you looking at me
You hear
The  turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea
He's the devil's child
We'll all go crazy
The  throws more water over the deck
takes his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song
Culo de galina es el hijo del demonio
(Chicken ass mouth is the devil's child
Born from the loins of a stinky old goat etc
) They all laugh
The , hearing this, climbs to the crow's-nest like a monkey
-   '- - We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the main mast, high above the rolling deck
The  curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest, exhausted by the heat, and scared
His eyes are turning white
He begins to piss himself
: -  - Piss is dripping on the deck
do not seem to care
takes a chicken from a cage
He breaks its neck, and starts plucking it
The  continue their bitter conversation
We should have seen land
We left three weeks ago, Alonso
Can't be that near
Can't be that far,  say
Also, don't like the smell of the sea around here
Smells like a cunt
Bad sign
The  starts laughing
They turn to him
(shaking his head) Of course it smells like it
That's why sailors take to the sea
They all laugh
Alonso looks up at  standing on the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the land to appear
And why does this one take to the sea
Nobody knows
Never says a word
has sensed the danger of this lack of respect
He approaches them
To your post
At once
They split in silence
-  - The  is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- sleep on deck
The '  is singing to himself
Despite his hair lip he has a pure, melancholy voice
, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears it carry over the darkness
-  - -, nearly through its time
The '  throws an "ampoulette" over board
We follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full length of the hull
As it reaches the poop deck, another shouts ""
very primitive system of calculation for distance and speed
Sitting near the ' ,  is making entries in a log-book, watching the hourglass
' Mark
Twenty nine, Sir
- runs out
converts the mark into a daily average for distance and speed
Six hundred and twenty nine
'  cups his hands to his mouth to shout
: - , his  beside him, looks across at the ' Six hundred and twenty nine
turns to  to repeat the message
Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir
does not seem too pleased
heard
examines his own calculations
Captain,  don't understand
think  do
He goes back to his cabin
: -   - The three ships like dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed
The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats
, rowing, drenched with sweat
,  is staring at the horizon
pulling at his oars stares at ' distant figure with hate and resentment
suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat into disarray
Chaos
Total silence
and  stare at each other
Continue rowing
To where
defiantly stares at
He then starts to beat a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the others
In the two other boats, the  begin to follow suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls
looks up to , in panic
' , an  cups his hands to his mouth
Captain Pinzon requests permission to board
: - Granted
'  - enters
He looks furious
You lied
You cheated
We're way past 750 leagues
(calmly) Six days ago, yes
You must be mad
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon
You think  don't know that
We're lost
The land is there
know it
You don't know anything
Listen Colon, these are my ships, right
So 'm telling you we're turning back
And then what
Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid
You know that
(apoplectic) Jesus Maria
should have never listened to you
You never did
You did all the talking for both of us, remember
You bloody
Pinzon, Pinzon
All we can do now is go forward
Think about that
You tell that to them
You're right
Let the men decide
moves to the door
As an afterthought, he takes his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook
-  - Most of the men are now back on board
They go silent as  appears
He walks slowly over to them
All, including , are surly, threatening
Who gave you the order to come on board
He looks up and down the line, finishing on
They stare at one another
God doesn't want us to cross the ocean
This voyage is cursed
Some of the  murmur their agreement
Cursed
We set sail for greed
God has abandoned us
The voyage is cursed
There are signs
glances towards the ' , with his hair lip
The  lowers his eyes
moves towards him, pulls him forward, stands him in front of
This boy has the voice of an angel
What comes out of his mouth is blessed, Alonso
What comes out of your is evil
Some of the men laugh at this statement
is ill at ease
pauses, looks around at all the
Listen to me
Every man is afraid who does something for the first time
But those who overcome their fears, will find their rewards do not know if it is God's will that we cross this ocean -- but  am certain it is the devil who puts fears into our hearts
The  are listening
We sense a subtle change of mood
This jacket to the first man who sights land
want a man up that mast day and night
points at the '
You start first
The '  rushes up the mast
As he climbs, the mainsail starts to fill with wind
The deck begins to move under their feet
This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly erase the fears and the angers
Alonso
Jaime
Don't let this wind escape us
from the other ships, as the sails snap taut, filling with wind
rush to their posts stares at , shaking his head in disbelief
(murmuring) You lucky bastard
walks away to his cabin, then turning back to Pinzon, the more  sail, the luckier get
Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin
-  - is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his cape, struggling against the sleep
approaches him with a bowl of soup
Shall  take my turn
shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the bowl
: ' head nods lower and lower to his chest
He is asleep
We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound
It becomes louder as we move closer to ' face
mosquito lands on his temple
reflexively slaps it
He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot of blood, a crushed mosquito
He stares at it for a moment
Then slowly gets to his feet
-  - In the luminous moonlight,  is standing, staring up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast lantern
We hear the flutter of their wings and see the bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy
turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see the land that must be close
He kneels by , wrapped in a blanket
He touches his shoulder
(murmuring) Mendez
Mendez
grimaces, and opens one eye
Land
: - An opaque dawn
, riveted, staring forward as if to pierce the mist
The entire crew are clinging to the rail, and standing on the shrouds
Suddenly, the  ' voice cracking with emotion
' strains his eyes; he still can not see anything
The entire  stand and stare, silent, holding their breath
As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly, exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems almost as though they could touch it
Then a white slash of beach
Near , a  falls to his knees and burst into tears
Others laugh with joy
watches this vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were difficult for him to breathe
Tears come to his eyes
He closes them
Then opens them again
The land is there -- a green paradise
On screen the words:   12, 1942 - Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the beach
stands in the prow of the first boat
is in the second
the third
They stare entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue clarity of the water
As the first boat beaches,  leaps out and wades ashore
Behind him the rest of the landing party splash through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of Castille and Aragon
- They stand on the beach, almost in a dream
There is silence
The  , ludicrously overdressed, now wet through, stumbles over to  and holds out his contract and a pen
scrawls his name
The  stare at him, filled not only with new respect, but with something amounting to awe
turns to them, tries to speak
By the
by the Grace of
God
He swallows
Tears have sprung to his eyes
He is so moved he cannot continue
Coming to his rescue -- '  starts to roll the drum
He then stops
(pulling himself together) In the name of their Gracious Majesties of Castille and Aragon, and by all the powers vested in me, claim this island and name it San Salvador
The  cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand, flapping in the wind
starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence the rest follow
- Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of
The jungle is filled with
The impossibly-loud of  , the  of
The are overwhelmed
They move forward
Rays of sunlight pierce through the high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent cathedral
The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses
They are filled with wonder
Then  stops
He has seen something
Another stops, then a third, staring ahead of them
(whispering urgently) Arquebuses
Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders, pointing them into the jungle
From '  we slowly scan the face of the thick jungle ahead
For a moment we don't see anything -- and then, with a shock, we see the first
Naked, painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance
As if they had materialized from nowhere:  the rest of the , with their bows and spears
Silent
Watchful
They stare back at us
The  nervously finger their weapons
slowly lifts his hand into the air:  a clear signal not to fire
Then, removing his sword, he drops it on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze upon the first  he saw
(warningly) Colon
ignores him, even though some of the  have raised their weapons
He stops in the no-man's land between them
The  don't move -- but something excites them
The ' , wearing ' embroidered jacket and the drum, has followed  and now stands close to him
He is the cause of their interest
puts his arm around the , and this gesture of affection seems to put the  at their ease
They start talking and pointing
They come forward slowly, start to tentatively touch the ' jacket
Then, now laughing, they touch , pulling at his beard laughs too
Sensing their innocence, the rest of the  lower their weapons
Some of them laugh
An apparition:  a beautiful young  , totally naked, walks out of the jungle
She is pregnant and holds a child
We begin to hear Indian music, played on a flute
: - large post is lifted from the ground by two pulling on ropes
The post is fixed into position -- and then we see that it is a large wooden cross
The watch the ceremony with some interest and amusement
looks over at the men and gestures at the We have come here in peace, and we will behave with honor
They are not savages and neither will you be
Treat these people as you would your own wives and your own children
Neither are you free to take what you will; for a seashell you give a bandana
You will respect their beliefs
Pillage will be punished by the whip
Rape by the sword
- The smoke from fires
Laughter
Music playing
The have prepared food for the , who are drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world
sits with , , the  , Other  stand around, smiling, curious
The  talk among themselves
The  smoke primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to their guests
The  cough and choke at first
and laugh
In return, they offer the  wine
Dogs roam around the campfires
The  openly suckle their babies
The  are entranced
draws out attention, for the first time, to a small gold ornament on the nose of one of the
He points to it, indicates his interest in it
Gold
Gold
The  says the word in his own language, laughing
We see that some of the other  also have small gold ornaments
repeats the  word for gold
The removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to , who indicates that he wants to have it
The  nods -- but points to ' dagger, indicating that he wants it in return
shakes his head, stops the from taking it
(to Pinzon) Give it to him
looks at him, about to argue -- but insists
takes out the dagger and offers it to the (irritated) By God
That's the worst trade of my life
His friends laugh
Innocently, the  has taken it by the blade
He yelps, looks down at the blood welling up
moment of tension
Then  laughs at his clumsiness, and the  laugh too
and the laughs
Just outside this circle, we see the first  we saw, squatting on his haunches, watching
This is
- The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds of the jungle all around
writes in his journal
(
) October 21st, 1492
think we have returned to Eden
Surely this is how the world once was, before the beginning of time
believe no man will ever see this land again as we do, for the first time
He looks up
is squatting in the doorway of the hut
He's been there all night
takes more ink on his quill and begins to sketch ' face in the margin of his log-book
He draws well
He gets up and walks over to  and shows him the drawing
It's an electrifying moment
is shocked and amazed
At first he is rather frightened of his own image
Then he is happy, and laughs
and laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a gesture of friendship
gets up, and indicates that he too has something he wishes to offer
- expertly scampering through the jungle follows him
orders  to sit
obeys looks up at the tops of the trees
The sun is rising, and filters through the foliage
As if the time had come, stands up, and  does the same
gap in the dense vegetation
Something is glittering
Gold
mass of gold
As they approach, discovers -- large pool of fresh water
The morning sunlight has turned the water into liquid gold
The surface ripples with the breeze
smiles
It the stranger satisfied
Isn't this what he came for
plunges into the pool
As he emerges, he fills his palms with liquid gold
: - Wide shot --  flotilla of canoes are going upstream
are traveling together in the canoes
leads the expedition in ' craft
' cranium is shaved like ', and we notice that some other crew members are beardless, some even wearing tribal patterns
- confronting the ,  talks to an  , watched by ,  and
repeats several times the word for , showing some artifacts
The   shakes his head no, indicating another distant place
Cuba
Cuba
nods, points into the distance, chatters away to
Say not here
Cuba
What is it
tribe
An island
Island
Far
-  - Standing at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair floating in the wind,  rejoicing at the speed
-  - Led by , the  hack their way through thick jungle
It's hard work
The  sweat
This is inhospitable terrain
Even the noises of the jungle seem somehow more sinister
: -  is seated under a tree
He takes off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters on his toes
As he puts his foot back into the boot, he jumps screaming in pain
yelps, grasping his ankle
a snake sliding out of the empty boot
While his  rush to him, a  spots the snake, and decapitates it with his sword
glances at the dead snake
He then goes and kneels -- he sees the bite on ' ankle
Help him
is quiet and silent
His eyes are looking around at his companions
shakes his head
There is nothing he can do
is now leaning back, supported by one of his friends
He has grabbed the forearm of a
His look is already far away
His companion shouts at
Do something
Help him
He dead
starts convulsing
hold him, desperate in their helplessness
Others simply move away, horrified
One of them cries
- Standing in the stream up to his thighs,   (a gold expert) examines some stones
He then looks up at and  and just throws the stones back into the water without a word
The group of  are resting, exhausted by the humidity
Some are drinking from the river, others soak bandanas, and tie them around their necks
One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look discouraged, tired, and beaten
- and the  are trekking in the hills
Fully armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and the vicious insect bites
doggedly keeps up with , who tirelessly trots forward
Finally,  turns around and sees
nobody
He calls out to
Utapan
Wait
stops obediently, and rushes back to  with comical energy
On their way back, they find one  sitting, leaning against a tree
He has removed his helmet
His hair sticking to his forehead
As  and  walk back, they find another , then another, then the whole group gathered around Ashen, he burns with fever
He attempts a smile
Well
You'll have to continue without me
looks around him -- what he sees:  exhausted men and jungle, as far as one can see
No
It's enough
What would you say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon
grins
And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb
'd sell my soul for it
(to his officer) Help me up
've got to piss, gold
They all laugh as the  helps  to his feet
walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to urinate
It is red
Suddenly dizzy, he reels and collapses
- line of  and  threading their way down a mountainside
is being carried on a makeshift stretcher
His eyes are closed, his face thick with sweat
They enter a village, to the surprise of the
once again at the front as the ambassador
- is forcing a milky fluid into ' mouth
attempts a gesture to prevent him
But stops him
He cures
nods -- he obviously trusts
'  - In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- , and  watch the   putting a Spanish helmet on his head
The helmet is too big, almost covering his eyes
The  appraise the gift with solemn wonder
In return,  hands  a parcel made of leaves
unwraps them
Inside:  a  grimacing mask
The first real piece of gold
is unable to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of the metal
He waits for the  to speak, but the  only looks at him
On the ground, we see other presents offered by the  -- trinkets, and necklaces
(to Columbus) You come
You speak first
Tell the Chief we thank him
Chief knows
Tell him his country is very beautiful
Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort
translates
Tell him we will return very soon
Many of us
translates
The   asks a simple question
Chief says -- how many
Thousands
Why
doesn't seem to understand the question
For the first time he seems to be caught short
To bring the word of God
Chief says -- he has a God
(pursuing) and also to bring medicine
Chief says
(interrupting) He has medicine
(pause) Tell him we admire his people
translates
Chief says he knows you like his
(searches for the word) Women
And the  gets up, awards  with a smile, and walks out of the hut, the  following, leaving alone
(with a little smile) That's a beginning
- Watched from the shore by the  and by about forty of the , who are staying behind, the boats pull out towards the two remaining ships
is laid out in the bottom of the boat
, , and four other  are in the same boat
(
) March 1493
Thirty nine of my men volunteered to stay behind
God willing we will be back in less than a year
The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore growing smaller
: '  - :  a golden mask
the lamp in the cabin swings violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if the mask was alive
is writing with difficulty in his log-book
(
) Several men are ill
We did not find signs of civilization
No cities, no temples
Nothing that resembles Marco Polo's descriptions
My ships are not filled with the spices and the gold that Spain was hoping for
But this land intoxicates the senses like the strongest of perfumes
And all can think of, is to return to these untamed lands
Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over
Things fall from the table, smashing on the floor
nearly falls
- We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying proportions
The thunder is deafening
Light irradiates the darkness
We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the massive seas
- Five  are struggling to lash down the tiller
The deck jumps and rolls
It rises five meters into the air then falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack
Waves sweep over the decks
We hear desperate cries for mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard above the storm
and  are crawling towards the mast, along a lifeline
(screaming to the sailors) Get below
All of you
Go
The  start to scramble below decks
(to Mendez) Stay with me
The ship rolls again
and  crawl towards the mast
Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons of water falling like cement
They reach the mast
The wood groans
We may have to cut it
nods
grabs some rope
The ship rises into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing beneath them for a moment
(screaming out) 'll stay here -- to decide if we cut it
Help me
With ' help,  is tied to the mast:  one rope under his arms, the other around his waist hands him a horn
(screaming) Now go
seems to hesitate
screams at him again
said -- below deck, Mendez
crawls away
Another huge wave washes over
He emerges, almost suffocated
The storm rages, its eerie light making it seem at times like bright daylight
But as the lightning flashes,  begins to count: One
two
three
four
There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates how close they are to the eye of the storm
The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming never to rise
lifts his head to the heavens, screams out: Damn you
As if in answer, another flash of lightning that illuminates the sky and the sea
starts counting again
One
two
three
four
five
Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on
Then, in the strange light, something seems to move through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor
stares up at it
amazed
We start to hear the "Te Deum", majestic and heavenly
: -  - looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling, trailing a think vapor of incense
magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of ' achievements and return
The whole cathedral is packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous robes
,  and  are staring in fascination at ' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of this occasion
passes by, walking proudly down the long central alley, beside   and and other
He turns to his family, keeping his eyes on  until she is out of his vision
The procession is followed by , and other  in tribal regalia
As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon : -  (' ) - In a simple room, a  finishes giving the Last Rites and a sheet is pulled over the head of
His and  weep at the bedside
: - stool passes from hands to hands
It is placed at the Queen and King's side
sits on it -- a supreme privilege
To one side sit  and
leans over to whisper to him
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez
(whispering) On the contrary, Your Eminence
It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross
'    -   - :  the face of a young,  , Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his lips -- then pauses
We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit table
and
takes the cigar from
The rest watch him with rapt curiosity
inhales deeply then, to their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose
You must not inhale, but simply allow the palate to enjoy the flavor of the Tobacco
He hands the cigar back to
With a casual air, himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death
He gulps down a glass of wine
much to the amusement of the others
(deeply embarrassed) And you say this is an Indian vice
By God
don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica
Do they have such thoughts
They come and go as naked as the day God created them
blushes slightly
They don't see sin in their nakedness
They live according to nature, in a never ending summer
The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits
And
(interrupting) Forgive me, Don Colon
But what about gold
nods, turns and whispers something to a standing just behind his chair
The  goes to open the door -- and in comes , dressed as a tribesman, carrying a casket
The  around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight
puts the casket down in front of the , and steps back
These are gifts for Your Majesty
opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold inside
She takes out some of the little golden ornaments
a bracelet and then the mask
She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty
raises the mask to her face, looking across at The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the to silence
She speaks from behind the mask
We are more than gratified
The guests laugh obsequiously
bows a little -- looks up and meets the eyes of , who is staring at him, coldly
- advances towards us with determination, his sword flashing
He is fighting an adversary we do not see, and comments his movements
Si

Muy bien
Excellente
(Yes
Yes
Good
Excellent
) We discover the   is fencing with dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda, surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade
Out of breath,  stops the exercise, and removes his protective canvas padding
He bows at his teacher, who salutes him in return
walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages
, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass of wine
Upon seeing  approaching, he hands him a glass
You defend yourself admirably
for a commoner
laughs and raises his glass
To your second expedition
They drink

Don Colon -- Don Alonso de Bobadilla
man who knows our laws

Is it not so
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken
(disappointed) May  ask by whom
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon
looks at him in surprise
reddens
trust they are men of quality
glances at
But we do have a lack of notaries
You should contact my administration
(amused) Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal
Good
We are also in need of judges
Except there are no thieves
grin disfigures the face of
(to Sanchez) see  was mistaken
Don Colon has no need for my services
And he walks off
fills his mouth with a slice of ham
(amused) You seem to have a special talent for making friends
What
Do  have so many already
(seriously) To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation
(kindly) little hypocrisy goes a long way
-  - with two :  the oldest, around thirty, is a strong-looking man
The youngest, no more than twenty five, is thin and fit
There is obvious tension in the room
These are  and  , ' brothers
is angry, and  thoughtful
You might have given us a choice
Bartolome is stronger, more capable than  will ever be
need both of you
What are you afraid of
We are living what we always dreamt of
You know  never shared those dreams with you
Are you saying you refuse to help
looks at them with such pained surprise
(amused) You bastard
you always had your own way
Let me show you something
He opens the door to a terrace
: - The large gallery courtyard is crowded with  -- applicants for the voyage
As  appears, they all press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint
They crowd around  and his nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there
Of course
Of course
We'll see to it
Yes
Thank you
Soon
Soon
Fighting their way through, the  press their way, reaching the other side of the gallery
We get glimpses of the incredible activity down below
, ,  are busy around tressels covered with documents, plans, maps
preparing the second expedition
puts his arms around them
(indicating the applicants) Now -- you tell me
Who can trust
(almost amused) We're brothers
We must be a House
bloodline
In this country one can't exist alone
need you
Both of you
He walks then to the balustrade
The cries from the courtyard down below subside
some of the applicants begin to look up, aware of his presence
Where is the Admiral
Has anyone seen the Admiral
Everybody laughs
He is here
What is it
He leans over the balcony
In the middle of the overcrowded courtyard, the  who was shouting is brandishing a document
Admiral
The horses have arrived
know
saw them
Who did we hire today
raises his eyes
Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a hundred farmers, twenty miners
and Doctor Chanca, the royal surgeon
The royal surgeon
Then we can count on royal health
The whole courtyard bursts out laughing
- '  - is lying in his hammock
turns him over
falls to the ground
walks beside
(looking at his son) He's growing up
smiles, nods
They walk on
Beatrix,  want to ask you something
(with a smile) You don't usually ask
(after a pause) can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service
stops in her tracks, looks at him
It is a great honor
We could not hope for anything better
nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at For once  wish you weren't right
puts his arm around her waist, pulling her closer, they move away
- is now swinging expertly in the hammock is pushing him gently
He slowly straightens up to watch and  disappear, somehow sensing there is a dilemma
noticing ' reaction, turns to his parents
The arbor is empty
becomes pensive
We become aware of the rustling of the jungle
: - spread along the beach, looking towards the jungle
stands beside his , and , and
, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back and forth across the sand
All are waiting
signal cannon is fired from one of the ships
Birds scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence, complete and ominous
stares into the jungle
Nothing
No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from the  they left behind
glances at
looks at him, but can't answer
suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the trees
The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning out as they do so, weapons at the ready
-  - Ruins
The camp has been burned to ashes
strange sight:  arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the flight
In silence the  pick their way through the devastation
The ground is littered with coconuts
Kicking one over with his shoe, a  discovers that his coconut is actually a human skull
The gaping mouth has been filled to the brim with gold
But of the living, there is no sign
Is this your new world, Don Colon
looks around in dismay
, , takes out his sword
These animals should be shown what savagery can be
Other  join in, repeating this last word
Three heads for every life taken
No mercy before God
No mercy
Let's find them
No Guevara
There will be no revenge
Silence
Everyone looks at
We lost cousins, friends
We will wash this in blood
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as  say
They are all listening
Moxica,  lost friends too
Thirty nine brave men who trusted me
He walks among them
You want a war
Fine
We are a thousand
They outnumber us by ten
Who will you kill
Which tribe
We don't need to know
We came here to stay
To build
Not to start a crusade
In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days
So we will be brave and swallow our grief
And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for
- mounted on his magnificent   canters to the edge of the deserted village and enters the village
is terrorized by the absence of anything living
All we can hear is the breathing of the horse
The animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously
calls out in dialect
They here
Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other -- materializing from the jungle
Shy and scared
They stare at this "Centaur" (the  and the seem to be one -- a God)
To impress them even more,  makes the beast move sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing the air
retreat in terror, except for one, who stands his ground, brandishing his lance
encourages the   to approach the centaur
He places his hand onto the shoulder of the animal
The muscles shudder
jumps back comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe
Without warning,  climbs down from the saddle
More step back in fear and absolute astonishment
Now more have ventured from the jungle
The bravest of them approach , daring to touch him, and the horse, retreating then touching until they fill the compound
At this moment,  and his  appear all around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows
moment of tension
walks forward, towards the  () we meet before
Ask the Chief what happened to my men
The  answers
Another tribe made war on them
came by sea
took them away
God have mercy on their souls
The monkey is lying
pause
The  shifting, eager for blood
We should kill them, Don Colon
looks anxiously at
No
you'll do it my way
(to Utapan) Tell the Chief we will not harm his people, even though we have the power to do it
translates
The  listens in silence
We will work with his people
We want peace
Ask the Chief if he understands
He understands
Ask him if he will help
: - It is raining hard

They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a watermill
Despite ' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep
Close by, on horseback,  watches the scene
, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit and approaches him
Don Moxica -- we need your horse
looks down at the sodden, dirty figure
We can't raise the wheel without it
My horse doesn't work
beat
wipes some mud from his eyes
Don Moxica -- we all have to work
You did not hear me, Don Colon
Not my horse
He starts to turn away;  grabs hold of the reins
Forgive me, Don Moxica
But it was your horse  was talking about

stares down at an equally determined Then, in front of everyone,  has to dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it
Thank you, Don Moxica

The wheel is raised into position
: - Water thundering into the new canal
The huge wheel begins to turn
The  cheer and congratulate each other
looks at his mud-splattered and foaming horse, his eyes full of hatred
- wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles burning in the doorways
main square with the Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church
In the twilight,  and the other  returning, dirty and tired
'  - and  sit out on the "veranda", watching the return
raises his glass in an ironic salute
To the Governor of the Mosquitoes
They laugh
We see the smoke and flames from a fire
Four or five  are squatting on the earth nearby, cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language
calls out something in their language, and a naked comes out of the house, bringing more wine
stares at her lasciviously
, letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles at him
Do you want her
He turns the  round so that  can admire her properly
nods
lets the  go with a peremptory order, and she disappears back inside
suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically: To the new world, my friend
To the new world
- '  - In an already Spanish-colonel dining room,  is having dinner with his brothers,  and , served by an   --
eats with gusto
(as Nima pours the wine) Nima's a good cook
She's more than that
Seeing ' sudden blush and discomfort, as smiles at him, the other  laugh
To cover his embarrassment,  returns to the topic of the food
What is it
Eat
'll tell you later
As he sees  stifling a laugh,  pauses
'd like to know what 'm eating
eats a mouthful, glances at
Iguana
look of horror crosses ' face; he wretches slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine
The  laugh again
What wrong with it
The Indians eat it
'm not an Indian
He wishes he were back in the seminary
Priests always eat well
(tasting his wine, grimacing) And they have very good cellars
Nothing grows here
Everything rots in the ground
The wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them
We've got to learn to live like the Indians
(pause) Eat your Iguana
Reluctantly this time,  goes back to his dinner
- '  - They are drinking and smoking cigars
From the balcony they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away
is already dozing in his chair
sees it, and elbows
They both smile at their younger brother's exhaustion
Then  gets up and leans on the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle beyond
How much gold have we found
Not enough to justify a single shipment
Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere but in my imagination
Then let's hope not
(pause) What will happen if we can't find enough gold
They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy sound
looks out over the jungle, and kills a mosquito by slapping his arm
(jokingly) Then 'm Governor of the Mosquitoes
: -    - An  is playing the flute
In the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most primitive conditions,    lie sick
On a segregated part of the room are the , several coughing
They are attended by a doctor,  , , and other
attends to an , gently lifting his head, helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do
looks down at the body of a , covered in open sores
The  joins him
What kind of disease is this
don't know
It seems almost as if we have exchanged diseases with the Indians
They die of our most common cold, and we of their plague
God forgive us
: -  -  - covered with sores is screaming, thrashing in his agony
He is held down, his voice muffled
turns away, shocked
She is in a ward full of patients, attended by a , and other members of her court
The patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered with virulent sores
move between the beds
It seems to be caused by intimacy with the native women, Your Majesty
Will he survive
No, Your Majesty
They go mad -- then they die
There is nothing we can do
looks around at , appalled
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying
But with no gold
The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we
We must have faith
We must give time for time
bows in acknowledgement
But , despite her words, looks distressed
-   - Excavations carved into a hillside
It is a blisteringly hot day
At the foot of the hill, sits at a table beneath an awning, with  and several
standing in line at the table
In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold
The weighs it on a scale, and notes down each contribution
impatiently gestures the  to move faster with a thonged crop
An  approaches the table
He is nervous
He doesn't produce anything
The shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly
He says he has not found any
He's lying
Again the  pleads and gesticulates
hits him across the face with the thonged crop
The  tries to run away -- but is held by a
Bring him here
The frightened  is brought back to the table
One of the  slips away
Tell him to put his hands on the table
Like this

Don Giacomo, you'd better come at once

Tell them  want them to watch this
The terrified  speaks to the
Don't Moxica
You can't
: and the  running to the scene
: (to the clerk) can't
can't
With a single swift action,  draws his sword and cuts off the ' hands
The  flee, disappearing into the jungle
arrives at this moment
He stares at the dismembered hands in horror
'  - tribunal
Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and flanked by his council,  presides
stands before them
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos
Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us
All that because of your criminal savagery
(casually) Savagery is what monkeys understand
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions
Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged
Have you anything to say
(with exquisite insolence) You will regret this
He strolls to the  at the back of the room
- Everything is quiet on the mine site
On the terrace,   are drinking in turn, and cracking jokes
One of them leans against the wooden wall
He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him
: - is fucking an   against the wall
: - On the terrace, his two  laugh and encourage his efforts
whooshing sound
An arrow embeds itself in the chest of the  who was leaning against the wall
He is nailed to the wood behind him
stares at him, transfixed, until an arrow pierces his throat
He collapses, unable to cry out for help
- in full warrior outfit, their faces painted, burst into the room
Still busy with the , his eyes facing the wall, the  believes the intruders to be his friends
(without stopping) You animals
Can't you wait
Discovering the    staring at her, the   starts screaming and pushes back the He turns around, jumps off the , and starts to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his trousers
catch him, and force him to lay on the ground
struggles, his eyes rolling in terror
force his mouth open
kneels and starts stuffing it with gold dust
chokes and suffocates
still stands half naked against the wall, terrified
takes his knife from his leggings, slowly
She starts sobbing and imploring in her language
slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in the lower part of her belly

Pulling back, we discover: have been crucified on the scaffolding of the excavations
Some hands and noses have been removed

One of the   is gently laid on the ground
He is still alive -- not for long

(aggressively) Moxica is right
Our ways don't work

He looks up at  for help in confusion
You have to find them, Utapan
Look what they did
You did the same to your God
is caught short
We have to stop this war
nods
He walks and takes an arrow
He examines it
Do you know them
nods, uncomfortable
: - Around a campfire, two dozen  are squatting
They are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole from the mine
The  raise their heads
All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed at them
Two  try to run away
They are shot
This sound triggers the ' response
They start shooting at random

Stop
Stop this

On the table, the model of the future city
Watched by the other ,  sets fire to the parchment he has rolled up
He blows the flames from the torch onto the model
Fire races up and down the streets of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel

Behind him, his , his  and about thirty captured

They reach the river -- scan the far bank
Nothing
nods
His  start to enter the river, led by a Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above their heads
crossbow arrow pierces the
Without a cry he falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the current
Two more  are hit
One cries out, thrashes around in the water, an arrow protruding from his side
The river stained with blood
Still no sign of the enemy
'  nevertheless start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield
others continue to wade across the river

The first  come ashore
Musket fire
An exchange of arrows
is now wading across
The  next to him is killed, and carried away by the current
Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves
There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other weapons
kills one of ' men -- but his own are outnumbered and outmatched
Already, some are beginning to surrender
In the midst of the fighting, , sword drawn, pulls himself out of the river:    lunges at him
kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks forward into the jungle
He spots  at the foot of a cliff
- starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with following
The climb through the dense undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing in slow motion
- bursts out of the undergrowth
He is at the edge of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind
He turns frantically, to see  coming up behind him
Knowing he is lost,  regains his natural arrogance
He steps backwards towards the edge
You know what they will say in Spain about my death -- don't you
He takes another step backwards, as  moves towards him
You are nothing
You bastards will never inherit your titles
We are everything
We are immortal
He smiles, and steps back into space
- His body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into the water
- stares down as his body is swept away
: - ' expressionless face
: -- his face is white, he is crying and trembling
His arms are tied behind his back
He is held fast, a rope is put around his neck
, sitting not far away beside his , gives a signal
Drums begin to beat
looks on impassive
grimace suddenly transform   ' face
He is being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope
The ' feet dance frenziedly
We hear the choking
The drums cease
crosses himself and murmurs a prayer, deeply distraught
has covered his eyes
wider view shows the bodies of three other from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole, their heads straight, the rope still tight around their necks
Justice has been done
The members of the  rise in silence,  stands up
: -  - several large wooden cages
Inside we see the that  captured
They are packed together
They stare out with vacant eyes
guard them ship against the pier
at his side,  stares at the
wish to go back with them, Don Colon
have no desire to remain in this godless place
You may do as you please, Brother Buyl -- though your departure will not help me to make it more Godly
looks at him, almost with astonishment
You treat Christians equally with heathen savages
You execute members of the nobility
And what do you offer in return
(quietly) new world, Brother Buyl
Nobody wants one
Only you
And he walks away
- Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join the sky to the sea
gust of wind disturbs the roof of the jungle
'  - The wind grows stronger
Doors bang inside the building
a melancholy sound
sits on the balcony with his
They are silent
After a few moments,  begins to speak quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself
Perhaps hope only exists in the journey
When it begins, everything is still possible -- every expectation; every dream
The  do not answer
This is not how  imagined it to be
: -   - begins to shave his head
- '  - The sky is dark and threatening, the wind even stronger
We find  where we left him, but now alone
He has sat here all night
Shutters bang violently
He looks up -- and sees a few yards from him:  the naked , his face and body painted, staring at him
realizes who it is
Utapan
is still and silent
strange and mysterious figure now
Utapan, won't you speak to me
You used to know how to speak to me
(sadly, in his own language) You never learned how to speak my language
is gone
- The wind is whipping the trees now, stronger and stronger
Groups of  look up at the sky
Then, above the sound of the wind, they hear another noise
Like a collective murmur, almost in one voice, the repeat, over and over
Urracan
Urracan
Urracan
Urracan
(the wrath of God) With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks
In a few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the landscape is drenched in torrential rain
The wind doubles its strength
and all hell breaks loose
- The hurricane is full force
Trees are being ripped up by their roots
Rivers of mud are washed down from the hills, carrying everything away in their paths:  houses, carts, equipment, horses
-  - The mine workings flooded with mud
- ,  and  struggle through the teeth of the hurricane towards the dam
- Timbers creak and strain

Suddenly, frighteningly, the dam begins to crash

He subjects the natives to violence, provocation and injustice
He sent them to Spain against the express wishes of Your Majesty

In the vast, opulent, glittering room,  listens impassively to the voice of
Also present, other , representatives of the church and state
But there is worse
He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility
Is this true, Brother Buyl
Yes, Your Majesty
It is all true
saw it with my own eyes
pause
seems to struggle inwardly with her emotions
waits, expressionless, but on the point of victory
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez
He must be replaced
And who would you think of, for such a task
: -  - We see a buckled shoe -- as it rises, it slips into a stirrup
The horse is mounted
The shoe digs into its flank
The sound of hoofbeats

Then
How far from here

But  heard it is no more than a week at sea hope you are not too disappointed
How could  be
The mainland has been found
Exactly as  said it would
am afraid this is not the worst news
: -   - All is dark
We can just make out ' face as he lies on the hard bed
He is sweating heavily; his beard is filthy and matted, like his hair
He looks feverish
key turns in the lock
The  lets in two fashionably dressed

His eyes are reddened with infection at the corners
The   come forward into the light

Unable to believe it,  slowly sits up
Fernando
My God
He laughs, overcome with joy
Embraces

Diego, how did this happen
Santangel is going to see the Queen
We are going to get you out of here
Good
have to go back
and  look at one another, then back at , incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his eyes rimmed with dried mucus
Go back
There's a new excitement in ' voice
He walks over to the table
The candlelight illuminates maps, charts, drawings, figures

This time with me
laughs and  looks at them both in astonishment
In your present state it is madness, Father
glances at
Nobody is forcing you to come with us
is hurt
can't go anyway
pause
She's very beautiful
The Queen has very good taste
Diego is getting married
seems saddened by his brother's attitude
Once again  feels like the outsider
hugs him
am happy for you, Diego

Granted his faults
Yes, a hundred times
But the man is still remarkable
looks at him, then at , presses his point
All he asks is a chance to explore this
mainland
It does not belong to him
(quietly) In a way, it does, Don Sanchez
(to the Queen) beg Your Majesty to receive him
To hear him
He will make no more demands
He has changed
He is penitent
Penitent
He is suing us for breach of contract
Is he

Really
tries to stop himself laughing

is waiting for him
He drops to his knees before her
This time she walks towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other signs of physical deterioration
Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console him
Her hand is dying to comfort
But instead, she offers her hand for him to kiss
Rise
Please
gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes, as they meet hers, are as clear as before
smiles with relief to see it
He looks back at her
Now  do look older than you
She smiles -- then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps her dignity
We have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new world
starts to interrupt; she stops him with a gesture
But without your brothers
Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies
You may explore the continent
Thank you
There is one thing 'd like to understand
Why do you want to go back, after all this
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things
must see them with my own eyes
cannot be other than  am
She almost bursts out laughing -- only pauses, turns slightly, then goes out
-      - is standing alone in the next room; he has obviously been listening
He looks at her
know,  should not tolerate his impertinence
Then why
Because he is not afraid of me
-  - , in another direction, along a corridor, towards his office
As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a hand seizes him
All  have to do is call the guards
Call them
looks at him -- and doesn't call
lets go of him
am not afraid of you
You are nothing but a dreamer
Look out of that window
Surprised,  nevertheless turns, looks out
What do you see
Roofs
towers, palaces
spires
All of them created by people like me
turns round again to face him
No matter how long you live, Sanchez, there's something that will never change between us
did it
You didn't
turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the echoing corridor
'   - dismounts in the courtyard
Everything seems deserted
There's no one about, no sign of life
- walks slowly through the great rooms
There is nothing left:  no furniture, rugs, pictures
nothing
He turns, sees  standing in a doorway, looking back at him
They are both moved
God
you're so beautiful
can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me
They tried
but  didn't let them
She smiles
They don't dare to touch
looks round the empty room
They took everything
(looking at her) Not everything
Do you think care
'm a free man again
Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier
They laugh
There's a pause
God, how much 've missed you
And they throw themselves into each other's arms
: -   - All that has been left is a simple table and one chair
They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on the figs and hams and wine
and on their faces, as sits on his lap
(
) One chair
One table
What more can a man expect, when he tries to sue the Crown
They laugh
With only a little embarrassment, gets off ' knee
comes forward, and embraces him like an old friend
goes to the kitchen
owe you everything, Santangel
but as you see,  can't repay you
On the contrary
It is  who owe you everything
Through you,  have been an adventurer, an explorer
It's true  shall never see the new world
but it's here
(he points to his head) And here
(pointing to his heart) smiles
returns with a plate and glass for
What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a discoverer, a man of imagination
not a politician
You weren't meant to govern -- You cannot be all things to all men
He takes the wine  offers, and raises his glass
wish you could have compromised
It would have made your life easier
But as least we haven't been bored, have we
They all laugh, and drink
'  - '  - Night on the open sea -- the moon shines on the waves and we hear the creaking of ropes and timbers -- the loneliness and mystery of the night passage
' West
southwest, Captain Mendez
(
) Steady as she goes
walks over to , who is leaning against the rail
He is smoking a cigar
as the smoke blows over ' face,  wretches
It's clear he's feeling seasick, trying to control it
leans against the rail next to him, staring out at the darkness
Then looks at his  again won't give in to the sickness, but  knows he'd feel better if he did
How are you feeling, Fernando
(in a strangled voice) Not bad
nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke
winces, gags slightly
(almost casually) You know what  always used to do
shakes his head
Swallow a piece of pork fat on a string
It always worked
At the thought of the pork fat,  jerks his head over the side, and vomits copiously
smiles, pats him on the back
'  - As it plows through heavy seas
, a coat wrapped around him, is sitting on a chair topside, directing operations despite an obvious fever
Suddenly a cry from the mast head: (
) Tierra
Tierra
and  rush to the side of the ship, peering through the spray
wipes his eyes, and then he sees it:  there in the distance, a speck of land
and his  stand together, watching the low cloud formation sitting on the horizon
The mainland
looks excited
Discreetly,  watches his , enjoying his happiness
( ) - most wonderful and surreal image
heavy mist lies over the forest
We move above it slowly
emerges from the mist
At first only a silhouette -- then, slowly, a golden figure
an , covered in gold
gold artifacts, golden paste on his body
The   turns, and points, into an unknown distance
- From the  treehouse, , ,  and several  are gazing west over a necklace of magnificent lakes
The  point and talk gently
has never seen anything so fresh, so beautiful
- magnificent sunset
fire is burning, food cooking
looks over his maps, trying to figure out where they are
We see the outline of the continent of Asia
An   squats beside him, silent, also looking at the map
Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the map
Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus
and gather round
watches the   with initial puzzlement, then growing excitement
What's he doing
He's drawing an isthmus
He's saying we're on an isthmus
We can't be
is still confused
The   continues to sketch, talking quietly all the time
An listens
Tell me what he's saying
He says -- water on the other side
Ask him if he means a lake
big lake
The  asks
The   shakes his head, laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes, emphatically
No
Says those are lakes
Water on other side big -- as wide as here
Above and below, much land
(stunned) An ocean
He's says it's an ocean
don't understand
is too stunned for a moment to explain
The laugh
Then  takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on the map, for his son
Here is Europe
and over here, the continent of Asia
But there's something in between
Another continent
We've found
another continent
stares west, then back at his looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat
Father
There must be a passage to that other ocean
: - '  - , feverish, lies on the bunk
He shivers violently
anxiously watches over him, bathes his eyes
Suddenly   enters
help
little reluctantly,  lets him go to his
The  crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of leaves from a pouch
He chews the leaves himself for a moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens ' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging to chew with the motions of his hands
chews, quickly falling asleep
- We see things from ' hallucination
We are plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating, giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer and closer
wakes up with a jolt
Everything is silent
walks outside
- ' fever has subsided
He raises his head and stares at the mainland passing in the night
He smiles
: -    - The roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at anchor
: - Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the jungle
- Smoke rises lazily above the trees
: The boats reaching the bank
of a village
spread out into the empty village
,  and  preceded by enter one of the huts
The remains of a meal is still warm in bowls on the matted floor
famished  dips his hand in one of the bowls and devours its contents:  some kind of stew
Stepping back accidentally,  bumps into a large earthen jar behind him
It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains of meat marinating in liquid
There is something disturbing about the appearance of the content
Oh my God
The remains of human beings
(approaching) What is
He stares at the remains, stunned
stops chewing
He drops the half-empty bowl he was still holding
He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep in the back of his throat, and vomits
Oh Virgen Maria
Oh Madre de Dios
(Oh Virgin Mary
Oh Mother of God
) But as he vomits and cries, he notices: spread open, like a sheep carcass
Disturbed flies rise in clouds
Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos
(Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints
) : and the  meet in the center of the village
All have made the same horrific discovery
(urgently) Out
Get out
back out of the village, crossbows pointed at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle
They are running through the dense forest for the river bank
The  materialize among the trees, running alongside
Bounding, skipping, frightening , their brutal faces painted in black
They release arrows at the running
stops, kneels to the ground, fires his crossbow and kills one of the
but he is pierced by a spear
drag him and cut his throat to finish him
--   , and  moving in hand to hand combat
comes sprinting at , brandishing his lance
jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his abdomen
Blinded in sweat, he stabs the , who collapses
Frenzied,  stabs over and over again
He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood
Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at it
alights gently on his bloody fingers,  staring fascinated at its palpitating wings
, screaming at his , drags him to his feet
They run
: , , ,
all running hard to the boat
whistle around them as they leap into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them into the current
still follow them along the riverbank
But the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind
- Endless seascape, the caravel plowing
'  - is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a blanket
He seems in a state of shock:  he is pale and shaking
As  goes and sits near his son, he hands him a flask of alcohol
(kindly) Take it
Come on
Drink
As  insists, brandishing the flask, notices that his hands are shaking too
His ' forehead is dripping with sweat
drinks a gulp and grimaces
He drinks again and hands the flask back to his , who does the same
notices dried blood on his ' fingers
immediately hides his hand and stands
have to see Mendez
Then, with sudden anger
Your brother was right
should have never taken you with me
'll never forgive myself
Never
He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the rail
He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain, as if they were burning
scrambles to his feet and rushes to him
' eyes are already fixed somewhere -- fever is eating him up
Will you ever forgive me
turns around for help
Captain Mendez
'  - is lying on his couch
is bathing his eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in them
is drenched in sweat
: is writing under his ' dictation
came to Your Highness with honest purpose and sincere zeal
did not undertake these voyages for honor or wealth -- that is certain
After years of service to the Crown,  do not have a roof to put over my head
Your Majesty allowed me to explore the continent, believed to be Asia
now believe that it is an new Land, of unknown proportions and wealth
Life has more imagination than we carry in our dreams
: -  - The , sitting beside , quietly continues to read ' letter aloud
" should be judged as a Seaman who by Divine Will discovered a New World, and thereby placed it under the sovereignty of Your Majesties
humbly beseech Your Majesties that if it pleases God to remove me hence, you will help the name of Columbus to be remembered with honor
Weep for me, whoever has charity, truth and justice
" She stops reading
turns her face away
- An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher belonging to  -- indicates a line across a large globe:  the route between Europe and America
(
) The sunset route to the new continent is now well-established
We see a large amphitheater, filled with  attending a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography
stands in front of the assembly
Facing him, enthroned, is  , surrounded by , including
We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces
West by south west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo
From there, west north west, leaving San Juan to the north, reaching the island of Hispanola on the northern cape of San Raphael
Then onto the mainland, at the Cape called Gracias a Dios
We continue to rise up the tiers of seats
Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace -- has confirmed for all humanity the existence of an unknown continent
Tierra Incognita
On a highest tier, we stop on the face of , listening impassively
This continent was first discovered by a sailor commissioned by your Majesty
' eyes
His name
Amerigo Vespucci
On
- Around the , on horseback, surrounded by the , a  is kept back by
is mounting his horse
is waiting for him
stands among the students at the back of the : rides next to
suddenly spots in the crowd, as they move off
My God
thought he was dead
They pass close enough to touch
But he does not see them
You can see for yourself
What a tragedy
what a waste of a life
waste
Let me tell you something, Arojaz
If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his
looks at  in surprise -- then cranes his neck round, and looks back at  -- now a -   - , a very old man now, is taking a siesta next to his grapes
He is sitting in a simple armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers
The presence of someone wakes him
After a moment, he recognizes  and smiles
Both  are very moved
suppose we're both old men now
You'll always be older than me, Father
They laugh
sits down
Bees drone lazily in the sunlight
Have you ever forgiven me
nods his head
Yes
forgave you a long time ago
You see,  was proud of you
You were like a willful child
You wouldn't accept what others told you
You had to find things out for yourself, hurting yourself -- and others -- in the process
looks at his plants, sighs contentedly
Do you remember when you said that people talk about the world, but never leave their gardens
nods
More than ever  wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens
The world changes -- and yet it seems the same
We find new worlds, but fill them with the same people
He pauses, looks across at , smiles again gently
, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up towards the sun
have to disagree
knew you would
New worlds create new people
Oh
So you are a new man
don't know
have the impression that  didn't change that much
still can't accept the world as it is
starts laughing
God bless you, and those like you
They both laugh
'   - is sitting in front of his , examining documents and letters
has wrapped a shawl around his legs
He looks even older now, with his mass of pure white hair
comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a decanter of water
She places it on a small table near and touches his shoulder
As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her back
Can't you stay with us a little
am busy inside
He smiles
She looks at him smiling, intrigued
What is it, now
Tell me
can't keep my eyes off you would like to catch up with all the moments  didn't spend with you
looks up at them above his letters, amused and slightly embarrassed
looks at him with a fake air of reproach
What are you listening to
am not listening, Father
But can't help hearing
opens a letter and reads it quickly
It's Diego
He is at the Court, with Santangel
He says they hope to get your privileges restored
And maybe the house
smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very little importance to him now
But how is he
And Dona Maria
continues to read
Fine, it seems
Diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade, in Santo Domingo
He says he received many letters for you
Some of your men, mostly
He opens one of them, glances at it
This one is from Mendez
' eyes brighten with joy
What does he say
He asks when he can come to visit you
He left his address
(smiling) He never had one
except aboard my ships
laughs -- then, suddenly serious
want you to tell me everything you remember, Father
From the beginning
Everything
Really
(pause) God
wouldn't know where to start
and yet
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind
sighs, and leans back on his chair
His eyes are fixed somewhere, searching
Then, almost in a murmur
remember
We see the page
writes:
drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the words
is waiting
: ' eyes
: -   - , as seen from the rolling deck of a ship
We see: majestic forest, resting on a slash of white sand, and deep blue sea
: of an  emerges from the dense foliage
He runs down the beach towards the surf
He stops and seems to be staring at us
These words appear on the screen: 1571 , 1511 ,
