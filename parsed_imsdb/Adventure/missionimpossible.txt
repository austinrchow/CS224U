"Mission: Impossible", shooting draft, revised by Robert Towne 16TH  1995 : " " - We're in a large closet
, an athletic American in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a corner, staring at a television screen
The television shows a surveillance view of the living room that lies outside the confines of the closet
The  image is in black and white
shifts, trying like hell to get comfortable but he's been there a while bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel room
Directly under the blub a man,  , sits in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained - shirt
There are a couple of  and a stray  in the room behind him
legend: is sobbing
Uncontrollably
enters the room, , an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian godfather
The  and  are ushered out looks down at  pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him
does as he is bid, looking gratefully up at
They speak in Russian which is subtitled
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us
(sobbing) don't remember what happened
We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun
gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the room
lies half under the sheets
She's lying in an unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared with blood
She's dead
lifts her eyelid
don't even know how  got here
swear, Anatoly,  never touched her didn't lay a finger on her
moves away from the
Kasimov
Don't flounder
, impatient, checks his watch
Jesus, she's been under too long
Come on, come on
You're the only one who can help me
Desperately he tugs at ' jacket
But  hits his hand away and smacks him around the head
reacts
bends close to
'mon, c'mon, tell the truth
c'mon
They'll kill me
paces up the room, away from
You asked for my help
You asked for my help

You're right, of course
leans forward
The name pal

The contact in Minsk

Come on
Come on
His name is
Dimitri Miediev
Dimitri Miediev
Dimitri Miediev
Got him
Back on screen,  places a hand on ' shoulder as if he had just anointed him
In the closet,  types the name into a computer and cross checks -- "" comes up, then "posting/American consulate/Kiev
" turns and nods to a   in costume in the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic and virtually no bottom
She quickly leaves
- We enter the room for the first time as the  does
She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot glasses
Now, we drink
He pours them out and hands one to
(') To friends
Yes, Anatoly, yes
Cheers
He drinks
He blinks
Something felt funny about that
Dizzied,  swoons and passes out on the floor moves to the closet door and opens it
reaches up to his face -- -- and tears away a mask of flesh He's no middle aged Russian mobster, he's  , an American in his early thirties
He gestures to  contemptuously
hands a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the room
(in English now) Get rid of this scum
Immediately, there is activity, and  everywhere come into the room and carry  out
goes quickly to the body of the dead woman
He cheeks the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye
He strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the dead woman's thigh
He checks her pulse again, checking a stopwatch
In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open
is her name, a French woman of thirty or so
She half rolls over, , and wipes some of the blood from her mouth
Did we get it
We got it
On your feet
want to sleep
Can  sleep here
Walk, just walk
Start walking
'm walking
Talking's good, walking's better
Sleeping's better
Meanwhile,  in overalls take apart the room
The ceiling lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to come down, revealing the "hotel room" to be an elaborate set in the middle of an empty warehouse
comes into the room from the closet
He hands her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring stops what he's doing, noticing
She looks up at him questioningly
Are you all right Ethan
What's wrong with you
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch
Oh yeah
comes into the room from the closet
He hands her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring stops what he's doing, noticing
She looks up at him, questioningly
Claire
Jack
She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger
notices
He turns and  to the room at large
' Just waiting for you, tubs
He walks across the room and out the door
, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding ring
We move in on it -- : - -- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a 's finger
One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner
He shoves some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a fleeting glimpse of a photograph of
The pilot's voice makes an announcement
(
) Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight thousand feet-and we should be arriving in Prague right on schedule
makes her way between the seats, passing out menus
Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen
passenger takes one
The  continues on
(') Would you like to watch a movie Mr Phelps
The  with the wedding ring looks up
is in his mid-forties, good-looking, intense
He's a tired man, and not just now, it's a profound fatigue
He looks up at the and smiles warmly
No,  prefer the theatre
look crosses the  ' face; her tone becomes stilted
Would you consider the cinema of the Ukraine
Perhaps you'd choose one for me
The  turns and walks away
sits back, shakes a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the armrest
The   opens a case loaded with video 8 cassettes of feature films
She opens a panel in the top of the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there
' The  returns with the tape and hands it to
He takes it without a word and she moves on
reaches down and turns a lever on the support between his seat and the empty one beside him
He flips up a small movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the other passengers
He puts on a headset, opens a door in the armrest, and puts the tape in
He presses play
, the image of a man comes on
is fortyish, but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than tieless
But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever look away
He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera
(on the tape) Good morning, Mr
Phelps
The man you're about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- The screen winks and shows an image of , a burly man in his forties
The image is herky-jerky videotape, presumably taken from a concealed camera as  walks down a foreign street
(
) -- a former  Line  officer now working the international black market selling intelligence
This morning, we learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half of a   list, the list of our non- official cover agents working in Eastern Europe
The screen shows an image of what such a list might look like, code names and other information scrolling by on a computer screen at high speed
(
) For security reasons, the  list is divided into two encoded halves
Golitsyn already has the cryptonym portion, which contains agent code names and targeting areas
This portion is useless unless combined with the second half -- the true name list that is kept in the  station in our Embassy in Prague
The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava River
(
) We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the true name list at an Embassy function tomorrow night
Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to obtain photographic proof of the theft, apprehend those involved, and return the stolen list
don't have to stress the importance of this matter, Jim
We're keeping it internally black
Because of its urgency, 've already sent to Prague a team selected from your usual group
Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already seen --  ,  and
(
) Ethan Hunt will of course be your point man, as usual
He's in Kiev; we're getting word to him now
- sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his tired brow
himself comes back on the tape
(
) As always, should you or any member of your  force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions
This tape will self- destruct in five seconds
Good luck, Jim
inhales deeply -- -- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a plume of wispy smoke -- -- and  exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of cigarette smoke
: - and , a German woman in her mid-thirties enter
Another legend: -  - The  team's safe house is a sparsely furnished Prague apartment with a panoramic view of the city
The  team is scattered around the room
Sketches, pads, overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere
and  seated next to each other -  demonstrating the  glasses to her
is seated opposite  at the computer
and  are in the kitchen taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room
Look to your right, then back to me
There's a camera built right into the bridge
Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here
Can you hear me
Of course  can hear you
No, in your
ear piece
You have a lovely smile (eyes)
Can you hear me now
Loud and clear
What's going on
don't know
Why don't you take a look
Jack
that's spying
That's what we do isn't it
Jack you're so wicked
Too wicked to have a drink later
think  might just take that look
and   are in a heated conversation
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is 've got more than ninety days leave coming
hundred and sixty-seven,  think it is
Take it all, if you want
After this one
thought 'd take some now
(quietly, to Ethan) What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time
Claire's in a weird mood too
Oh
What's the problem
don't know,  had to go to Chicago again
You were in Kiev
You tell me
Tell you what
When you started noticing your short term memory loss
What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev
What problem
(laughs) Ah, God, forget it
What are we talking burnout here
guess
Ethan, you can't burn out
Why not
Because  can't afford it
And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out
, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to be the reference point in the following exchange: How was Chicago
Wonderful
Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel
You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years
His wife's got a year old kid
So he says "All right
Who was it
My friend Harry
"  She says no
"Oh, it was my friend Sammy
"  She says it wasn't Sammy
"Oh,  suppose it was my friend Lou
"  "No, what's the matter, don't you think  have any friends of my own
" laughs
doesn't
The back of ' head is in his line of sight
(') Boy, you really are grim
Come here, take a look
He leads  to the window, which overlooks the city
- 's  of Embassy
- nods
(') Beyond Charles Bridge there is our Embassy
See it
Tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over Eastern Europe
Up for grabs to the highest bidders -- third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- any and everybody who'd love to get rid of long term coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them
If they're exposed, they'll be executed
Come over here
Take a lock at this
, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a quicktime video image in a box on her screen
In it, an old edition of the McLaughlin Report, the  news show, is playing
is distracted by it
- , a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, is holding forth: 'll go you one further
say the and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst
It's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the Pentagon's "black budget
"  These covert agency subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one -- who are these people We were living in a democracy the last time  checked
looks back at
You're going to use Walter
He's our guy
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing
Not this week
This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides
He won't be back in a hurry
No, not in a hurry
What do you think
You think the plot'll work
Sure
If the main character does
If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable
comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum
Sorry, am  interrupting
Always
shows the gum to
Stick of gum
If you come up against a lock you can't pick -- Half the gum is red, the other half is green
(') Red light
Green light
Mash them together, asta lasagna
Don't get any on you -- you have five seconds
He offers the gum to
Are you gonna take it
glances up from the computer and catches 's eye
may have caught the glance, but is focused on
(relenting) Give me the God damn gum
Just don't chew it
Thank you
: - The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River
Party at the Embassy tonight
- , wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator shaft through a small door at the base of the wall
He looks up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's looking for -- -- a gray metal box , protruding from the wall one floor up
- is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching the bank of monitors  wired together earlier
The monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of the elevator shaft
wearing an  headset and speaks into the mouthpiece
Ethan
Jack's inside
Window's open by twenty-three hundred
- Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair that's in full swing on the second floor
, the man who was on , walks up a grand staircase, headed in
An   in a tuxedo hurries up to him
How do you do, Senator, 'm Rand Housman, the Ambassador's aide
If  could just steer you through the reception line here -- The  pilots the  by one arm, guiding him to a reception line at the base of the stairs to the party
(') Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the director of the National Gallery -- Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- , a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator
Of course  do
How are you, Miss Norman
He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so whispers something in his ear
He's in pocket
Under the archway behind me
Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team
The  pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket (and if we didn't know the  was  before, this confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder
, , the Ukrainian, has just come in from outside
- sees the 's point of view of , through the glasses, broadcast back to ' monitor
He speaks into his microphone
Sarah, mark the package and go to two
- still has the 's attention
Your advance team mentioned you'd want a tour of the facility, so 've gone ahead and set that up for you -- Terrific
Let's get going
(to the Diplomat) Will you excuse us
He slips an arm around  and they walk off, not into the party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads further into the Embassy
Uh, sir
- climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal box
He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a noise from above
He looks up and sees the elevator above him descending
quickly pulls himself flush against the wall
The elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him to the wall
Great
Come on
- As the  and  pass behind the entering , pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse
But as she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing herself and hitting the back of ' head
He never notices
They move on and down the flight of stairs
- monitors the Visco views of the party
He looks to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy one, as someone hurrying up stairs
Hannah
He's marked
Lets go
- On a flight of stairs, , dressed for the party and slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs
En route
She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the party below
She pushes a micro switch on the side of her glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the lenses
(/) Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to night vision)
HANNAHiS the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands out
That head is ', his hair a fluorescent green where  sprayed it
/  - The  (let's just call him ) and  come down the stairs and pass a sign that says "Denied Area -- Political Attaches Only
"   checks his watch
23:00
He nods to , they round a corner, and come to an elevator at the end of the corridor
sign in front of it says "Out of Order
"  They head for it anyway
appears from behind a side door, catching them by surprise
Governor's in position
We have the elevator
Excuse me, can  help you
-- which leads directly to the Denied Area, the only limited access area in the whole facility
flashes an  at the  and keeps talking
(') As you can see
this area has both a Marine guard and video surveillance, and is strictly monitored at all times
She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank and slides her thumb inside
The panel lights up and flashes a message -- "
"   and  trade a look
(') (covering) Senator, don't you have a young man on your staff named She tries the thumb again, Still no soap
Jack believe we did have a young man named Jack Not a reliable man, as recall
Constantly late or behind in his work
Now the , noticing that Sarah's not being allowed access, comes closer to them
Excuse me, let me see that  again
- is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening to their conversation
(
) Jack's pinned down Sarah
Should be a second
Keep dancing
(
) (with the Senator's southern accent) We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times
Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and  is freed
Relax your crack, Foghorn, 'm workin' on it
He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of circuitry
He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download
there's a split-screen of 's thumbprint and the picture
downloads her file into the security computer
/  - Ignoring the ,  turns and slides her thumb into the thumbprint analyzer once more
The panel glows, this time the message flashes -- -- and the elevator doors slide open briskly
The , surprised, now catches sight of the
Oh
Sorry, sir
He snaps a salute
and  get into the elevator and the doors close behind them
- looks down at the elevator below
Through a grating, he can see them inside
The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely off
- moves from 's view of the elevator car to 's view of the party on his video monitors
(a touch of impatience) Hannah -- 'm blind again
Hannah
- , stationed on the second floor of the Embassy, moves to get a better view of the party
She reacquires 's glowing head
He's heading to the denied area
- This work room is filled with combination lock filing cabinets and various computer terminals
hands his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them upside down on top of a filing cabinet
straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, switching several times
(to Sarah) Higher
Higher
Higher
Right, right
Good
adjusts the glasses
, the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but clear
Anyone sitting there will be recorded
- On ' monitor, we see , via his Visco glasses on the filing cabinet, standing next to the computer barks out a warning
Get moving, Ethan
He's rolling to you
- pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already moving up
Jack we're in position
/  - In a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall simultaneously -- on one side,  is lying on top of the rising elevator, on the other side,  and  are waiting for it to arrive
Jack
Jack
didn't touch it
The elevator stops, the doors open -- -- and  gets on
descends in the elevator with  on top and  and  waiting down below
- sees 's point of view of the elevator, with inside
(tension rising) He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box
- and  are waiting in front of the elevator, the one is about to step off of
looks around, for a place to hide
Taking Golitsyn's exit
Jack, open the doors
What about my coat
'll freeze
(
) don't have it
- whips over to a laptop and starts typing
Opening the doors
Go under
He jabs  on his keyboard
- The elevator doors  open, revealing the empty shaft beyond
and  jump into the shaft
- and  jump down into the five foot empty space below the work room floor
Above them, the elevator continues its descent, with them hiding below
The elevator drops to just over their heads and stops
- steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides a 3
5 computer disk into the computer in the work room
Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, downloading the vital information
( ) - Waiting below the elevator,  takes off his jacket, starting to reverse it
He checks his Visco wrist monitor as perpetrates the theft
He smiles and speaks into a microphone
He's got it
Saved your ass again Jack
(
) Give me a break, Pops
Such a nice ass
(
) And a lonely ass
Sarah's reconsidering
Claire, transport in five minutes
(
) Roger that
( ) - Back inside,  strips off his mask and wearing his now reversed jacket, he and  exit the small door at the base of the elevator shaft
( ) - rapidly disconnects his equipment
But as he pulls the final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes and
- and  exit an Embassy service area by the waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous couple
In position
Jack open the door, let the package roll
(
) Roger that
Opening doors now
Stairway, youire wrapped, go to transport
ETHANiS voice comes over HANNAHiS earpiece
En route
breaks off and goes up the stairs
- The button marked "" lights up, seemingly all by itself
( ) - The car engages with a sharp jolt -- Hey
--and starts to rise
looks down, into the elevator car, through the grate
Thereis no one in it
- On one of his monitors,  sees the elevator moving in the shaft
Jack, what are you doing
( ) - Iim not doing anything
( donit have it either)
- is typing at his keyboard and jamming the enter button but gets no response
donit have it -- donit have control ( ) - JACKiS face pales
He looks up, above him, at the approaching ceiling
Uh -- then  have a problem
- pulls out the now-programmed disk from the computer, slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door
( ) - looks up through his Visco glasses at the approaching roof, covered with spikes
- Through the monitor,  sees JACKiS
of the roof of the building approaching
Fast
Cut the power
Cut the power Jack
Do you hear me
( ) - On top of the elevator,  has ripped open the control panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get the thing to stop
He swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster
He looks up
The roof of the building is nearly upon him
(
) Come on, Jack, come on
looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his hands, he  -- -- and heis crushed to death against the roof - is staring at the static on the monitor that once was JACKiS signal
Jack
Jack
He closes his eyes, knowing what that means
- also sees the static
Man down
Stay where you are
Iim on my way
He gets up and races out of the apartment
- , who now has the disk , jabs again and again at the elevator button but it wonit even light up
He studies the elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as  and did moments before
He hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small door at the shaftis base
- hurries towards the bridge
En route
- dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the river, toward the Embassy
He throws a look back, over his shoulder
Paranoiais setting in
(    ) - Outside the Embassy,  escapes, pushing through the service area door and racing past a   who are in the midst of a loveris quarrel, in Russian
Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where  is still racing to meet
But he stops suddenly, as if hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening gloom
- and  hear PHELPiS voice over the monitor
The package is in the open
Jim
Jim
Heis in the open
(
) Iive got a shadow
Can you lose him
(
) No
Abort
Over ETHANis shoulder,  sees  getting away
Fog starts to roll over the river towards the bridge
Ethan
Heis out of pocket
(to Phelps) Jim we canit
(
) Abort
Thatis an order
Negative , Golitsynis on the move
- Seated in the getaway car,  listens to  and argue
(
) No, damn it, no,  said
- Outside the Embassy,  and  argue
Sarah eye on the package
Jim, Iim coming to you
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away
No, weire going to recover the disk, understand
Now move
takes off for the bridge, leaving  to shadow - hurries toward the getaway vehicle
- moves to the bridge stairs
(
) Where are you
About two hundred yards from the bridge
(
) Theyire covering this frequency, Ethan
Cut all radio communications
Repeat
Cut all radio communications
continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge
Past who sits in the getaway car
He looks on his monitor and again sees PHELPSi
Only ominous silence
Phelps is looking back over his shoulder
The bridge is deserted
- follows  as he hurries toward the shore, where a cobblestone promenade runs along the river
He disappears into the fog at the edge of the river
- checks his monitor again
PHELPSi point of view changes radically as his head swivels on the darkened bridge
He whirls again, looking over his shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible, pointing at him and before  has a chance to react a over the monitor
The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down to a bloody hole in his own chest
His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge and makes the long, hard fall into the river below
- ETHANis face goes white with shock
- He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereis no sign of
runs to the railing and looks down into the river but sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming obscured in the gathering fog
He turns and looks to the embankment
He can faintly see , hurrying along the promenade
gives chase
- runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIREiS outline, visible in the driveris seat
But as he descends the stairs -- -- the car explodes and bursts into flames The force of the blast knocks  back
He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a stunned  starts to gather
Remembering , he rushes down the stairs towards the embankment
- comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees again, slowing down
comes out of the fog an seems to ask  for a light
draws closer
Behind her, the   seems to be hanging with her for some reason
- continues towards the embankment
- is almost to
Suddenly, the  in front of pulls him towards him Sensing something wrong, quickens her pace
The  is now hunched over , facing away from , going through GOLITSYNis pockets
The figure finds what itis looking for -- the disk -- and takes it
comes closer -- -- and the figure whirls
It brings a knife up sharply, plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight
races around the corner onto the embankment
He bursts out of the fog, just in time to see  fall to her knees, over GOLITSYNis body
sees the knife in her chest and He pulls the knife out of , who is close to death
He looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated edge
The   seem drunk no more
In fact, theyire watching
Through the fog and night, they see him leaning over , holding the knife in his hands
goes still
lays her down, turns the other body over and sees that it is
He quickly begins rummaging through his pockets
hear police sirens and sees
Prague police boat,  wailing, arrives at the dock in front of the Embassy
The   and  stop suddenly
As   leap off the boat and race toward the explosion,  leaps over the gate and races up the alley and out of sight
--   - unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver
Heis holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a modernist cockroach
He  the cockroach into the guts of the phoneis wiring, piercing it with its little prongs
He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phoneis tongue down for a second, releases it and listens
He has a dial tone
Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by heart
After a moment, a   comes on the other side
(
) Satcom seven

(
) One hour
He hangs up
does the same
He stares at the phone for a moment, thinking
He checks his watch
- steps out of the phone booth and starts down the street
Every face seems to be starring at him now, every sound is menacing
He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd
- makes his way past the old town clock, a towering, gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by residential buildings
ETHANiS Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built on the portico of an old palace
Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza
- ' walks in the glass front doors, right next to an enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall
He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen  are scattered around

He and make eye contact
walks to the table, a couple of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he goes
has been working on a pretty good-sized lobster
He rises to greet  and they sit
can't tell you how sorry  am
know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan
Personally as well as professionally
Yeah
He spots a stack of documents on the table
picks them up
There's a Canadian picture bearing photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, driver's license, etc
Passport, visas - you know the drill
We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley
Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects
Follow me
Yeah
follow you
We've lost enough agents for one night
You mean 've lost enough agents for one night
seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, carefully: You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan
Who else is left
Yes
see your point
Why was there another team
What
Of  agents
At the Embassy
Tonight
don't quite follow you
Let's see if you can follow me around this room
(eyes moving around the room) The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock
The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11
The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock
The other  team
You're worried about me
Why (a tight little smile) You're right
Maybe this'll save some time
The figures around the room have grown restless tries to indicate that it's okay
He pulls some papers out of his jacket
(') For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in operations
We have a penetration
The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max
" The arms dealer
That's right
Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents
This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our  list
An operation he referred to as "Job 314"
The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley
"Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours
This whole operation was a molehunt
Yes, the mole's deep inside
And -- like you said
You survived
stares at him levelly
(') want to show you something, Ethan
He now shoves the papers across the table
They're xeroxed copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of  and It shows a balance of $127, 000
(') Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter  and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank
Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan
So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and  wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole
(') Ethan,  can understand you're very upset
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset
takes something from his jacket pocket
While talks,  unwraps whatever is in his hand
All right, enough is  enough Hunt
You've bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on intimate loyalties to get away with it
You're determined to shake hands with the devil and 'm going to make sure you do it in hell
We see what  holds in his hand -- it's the piece of bubble gum, half red, half green
He squeezes the gum, mushing the two sides together
lashes out, swatting ' glass of wine off the table in one quick motion
As he does, he hurls the piece of gum
Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine glass
follows the trajectory of the glass -- -- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank
His eyes widen
The tiny piece of plastique explodes,  the fish tank
hundred gallons of water flow over the  and , knocking them to the ground
At the same time,  bolts for the door
- races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the deserted square
-  - Silence
enters the darkened entry
- glances up at the stairwell
Naked light bulbs illuminate the way up
He slips off his jacket and shirt, then puts his jacket back on
-   - unscrews a bulb
He crushes the bulb in his shirt and scatters the glass fragments on the steps
He climbs to the next bulb
-  - At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft sound of another bulb being  in cloth, glass fragments dropping and ' at the door
- In the darkened safe house,  goes to a vase with flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a Sig Sauer automatic
He moves through the rooms, checking them as he goes
- checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can
He unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various denominations from various countries and a couple of passports
As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the mirror
He's a mess
He splashes water on his face
- greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst
- He comes back into the living room
Still drinking, he notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the static from the four monitors  was watching
One by one, he switches them off

The computer emits a  , then  as it hits its connection
It prompts  along: job 314 Job

The computer replies: tries again: max

He tries something else -- "scroll usenet groups
" The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying speed, by the hundreds
That's not going anywhere
pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the others on his computer screen
He
Job three fourteen
Job -- (a realization, the Biblical pronunciation) It's Job He rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and finds a Gideon Bible
He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the Bible passage "Kings and Counsellors
" He thinks for another moment, then punches back into the Internet and under the command "Select Usenet Group" he types: The computer replies: 126  , : The computer presents a multi-colored screen of religious icons and artwork with an accompanying message: types his answer "Job 3:14" and the screen presents a "stickie" for him to write his message on

No,  got out of the car and  ran to the bridge

The coat hits the floor like a dead body

It accentuates ' shivering

Then the clock begins to chime -- , , ,
In the wake of the bells' reverb, releases his grip on her wrists
- sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, still waiting for a response
sitting on the end of the bed
Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet
Why haven't they brought us in yet
've been disavowed
They think  killed Jim and everyone else
Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account
Kittridge assumes 'm a mole they've been tracing and 've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our  list
long moment while she stares at 's back
What are you going to do
'm going to get it for him
Whoever the mole is,  think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time
1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the  list, he'll find me
Ethan, you're not making sense
Let me go in and talk to Kittridge
'm going to tell him you had nothing to do
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me

Why
You wish to meet Max
This is the price of admission
Reluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car takes off
'  - The black hood still on his head,  has trouble sitting upright
He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are drawn
The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art
Somewhere down the block, a dog , steadily, every few seconds
In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone is

You misunderstood
No one sees Max
Then what am  doing here
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say

She's handsome to the point of severity
Who are you and what are you doing here
need one hundred thousand dollars
Really
And you thought if you simply showed up  might give it to you
Why not
You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand
The penny drops
You are not Job
Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications
And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful
Job is not playful
So you're something of a paradox
That depends
On what
Whether you like a paradox
want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
It's quite out of the question
The disk Job sold you is worthless
It's bait, part of an internal molehunt
And how might you know that
Are you another Company man
Like Job
Ah, but, we're asking about you
'm
Was
Now disavowed
Why, may  ask
That's the question  want to ask Job
don't know Job any more than he knows me
Even so, 'm sure you could arrange an introduction
Why should
Because  can deliver the actual list
The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say  can't look at the information and see if it's worthless
Not a tenable position, sir
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits

Okay, use it

You're a good sport
Do accept the compliment
Thanks, Max
Or is it Maxine

(abruptly) My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan
Obviously it didn't pass muster
Deal's off
What was your deal with Job
Six million dollars
'll give you the same
But  want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe
won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous
want the entire list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world
Ten million
Ten million in negotiable Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached
And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange
Done
Bring it to me in London
want it by the end of the week
How will you make sure Job will be there
How will you make sure 'll have the list in three days
It's been a delight
Now where can  drop you dear boy

The man's gone black, Barnes
He's under until he decides to surface
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved
Close off his transportation
What can we do, Barnes
Put a guy at the airport
How many identities do you think Hunt has
How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries
These guys are trained to be ghosts
We taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake
So what do you suggest
Let's not waste time chasing him
Make him come to us
Everybodyis got pressure points
Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze

Luther, relax, it's worse than you think
The terminal's in black vault lock-down

He comes to an impressive guard station and rests his chin on a strange-looking optometric device

Even the vents have laser nets over them
Apparently the device approves and the  is buzzed into a "" area of the building

He shoves the curtain aside and comes to a large, vaulted door

) Inside, there are three countermeasure systems that can only be deactivated by authorized entry
Which we won't have

It's not large but it's impressive

) The first system is sound-sensitive, anything above a whisper sets it off
The second system is on the floor and pressure-sensitive -- The  closes the vault door behind him and walks across the room
As he walks, the floor tiles light up under his feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them

) --and the third detects any increase in temperature
Even the body heat of an unauthorized person in the room will trigger it

There is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it

He pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her
She takes it, waits
It's cash
And a second passport
If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me
Just walk away
You don't think we're going to make it

When it appears ready to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw
The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip with a gentle , as to a magnet
The screw is pulled up, through the shaft
Now the whole shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand
It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct
rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees gentle  is audible as frosty air blows through the tube, cooling the room
- The  defaults the security systems outside the terminal room
-   - It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw earlier
No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the gentle  of the computer as it waits to be put to use
Now 's head descends slowly into the room, his hair falling in front of him
At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his ankles and understand
He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and temperature read out on the computer
Suddenly  is lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the computer as the  enters the room
-   - The  crosses to the computer and sits down, a stack of work to his right
- The  is working away at the computer
He pauses and wipes some sweat from his forehead
- With a strange look on his face, the  looks up
It's almost as if he senses  above him but instead -- Oh, God
-- he vomits
He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again
Puzzled, sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves
-   - Even sick, the  still thinks to re-activate the alarm systems with a card-key
They  back to life efficiently, a light flashing: - descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in front of the computer
heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the set of pulleys
- holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out on his forehead
-   - Unfortunately, he's three feet away from it
He stretches his arms but can't reach
He blinks, unable to believe this
He curls himself into a situp and looks up, into the shaft
- sees the predicament
-   - gestures to him, pointing to the floor
Slowly, drops him another few feet
Now 's lower than the terminal and still three feet away from it
He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal
- In the fire truck, , who is watching on the Visco monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what sees
He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and begins to whisper
We hear only the moist, airy sound of his breath, not the words

He reaches out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it and starts typing, softly
The computer , activated
unbuttons his pocket, withdraws a 3
5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy drive
The computer accepts it with a soft
winces, even that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances
But no alarms go off

He  more commands

The  list

- shakes with the strain of holding the rope
His eyes suddenly widen as he sees something next to him
It's a rat
stares
The rat stares back
Neither moves
Puzzled by ' lack of response, the rat crawls forward, inquisitive
's eyes water, his nose twitches
He's about to sneeze
- pulls himself together and  another command into the microphone
You've done it
Eject it
-   - The 3
5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive
pockets it and signals to be raised
Slowly, his body starts to move up
As it does, a bead of sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip
ignores it
But below him, he sees the floor tiles, four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the computer terminal
His eyes widen as he realizes something -- --the drop of sweat falls -- --and he catches it with his right hand
- ' - crosses corridor from restricted access door to bathroom
toilet , smashing the silence, and the staggers out of the bathroom
He goes to the sink and throws some water on his face
He's still unaware of the piece of shiny metallic tape stuck to his shoulder blade
He walks out of the bathroom, crosses corridor to door
- On one of ' laptops, the blinking cursor starts to move down a corridor

He's rolling

Holding the rope with one hand, holds out his other, demanding something

He's at the vault - get moving

He drops the knife
Merci
We're not outta here yet
-   - The  deactivates the alarm systems, swings the door open and comes back into the room
He turns to close the door behind him and in so doing just misses seeing ' head as it is pulled back up into the ceiling
: - throws smoke cannisters and he and  crawl frantically back through the duct, the way they came
-  - walks quickly past the  in the reception area and out of the building
-   - The  enters the room and shuts the door
He sees the knife, picks it up, looks at it and then puts it down
He resumes his work at the computer but when he punches up his program, something prints out on his screen
Its header: -- 11/18/95 9
58 And it goes on
The ' eyes widen in disbelief
He spins back in his chair and reaches for the nearest telephone
-   - In the communications room, tempers are running a little high
is on his feet, berating his staff
Think , for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face
What does Ethan Hunt want Same thing he wanted in Prague
Same thing he's always wanted
The  list
Okay
Now it's coming together in ' mind and a horrible thought occurs to him
(') And where is the list vulnerable
There is nervous silence for a moment
Behind , on the other side of the room, the phone starts to ring An  gets up to answer it as a creeping fear pervades the room
(') (joking) Other than here
Nervous laughter goes around the table
It fades
On the other side of the room, the  who answered the phone turns, receiver in hand, face ashen
He holds the phone out to , terrified, the bearer of extremely bad news
They all turn slowly and look at him
He holds the phone out to , shaking slightly
It's for you
Kittridge, yup
: - It may be a   or it may be a '  but it echoes over the forest as a lone fire truck  away from the headquarters building, making its escape
-  - , ,  and , the victorious team, are in the truck's cab
They exchange looks of massive relief
But no one speaks
, in particular, looks heavily troubled by what they've just done
looks at , who is jammed into the seat next to him
She drops her head on his shoulder, exhausted
, in the driver's seat literally and figuratively
just looks straight ahead and to
: - The  who discovered the theft of the list sits at one end of the now-empty conference table in the communications room
sits in a chair beside, staring gravely at him
He gets up and walks to the door, where   hovers
lowers his voice, it's barely audible
(') (to Barnes) You and  know about this -- and that's where it stops
Understand
It never happened
What about him
He gestures to the , who watches them anxiously
want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day
Just mail him his clothes
He leaves
Barnes turns to the , who looks up at him anxiously
: - Night
This street is a row of nondescript hotels, one after the other, with anonymous names like "Hotel Pomeroy," "Hotel Vincent," and "Hotel Berridge
" - This barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings it's in
hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered bible he's used to contact Max
He flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk
, alone in a chair across the room
is seriously preoccupied
is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a lager and watching
is at the window staring out, anxious
glances over the back of the sofa at
You contacting your buyer
(no answer) Ethan
From the desk,  glances up
Then goes back to the computer
continues to glare over the sofa back
(') Ethan
Oh, 'scuse me Mr
Hunt
ignores him, working
His computer jams with static as it connects to a
The screen blinks and displays the familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted Max
When it asks him which chapter and verse for the posting,  flicks through the Bible, looking for the next code
He  begins to type
-- Now might be an excellent time to interpret Scripture face to face
Meet on , noon tomorrow
Take seat 27
Bring our mutual friend Job
suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible out of Ethan's hands to the floor
You're not going to any meeting without me
My contact is extremely shy
He goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the "" button
and  watch this growing conflict closely sighs and stands up
pulls out the blue disk he took from  in the computer room and waves it in front of him
don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you
Not while 'm holding this
Krieger
Stay out of this
Lachez - moi 'agueue Don't you mean this
He reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical disk
He puts it back in his jacket pocket
stares for a second
That's not it
That's not the list
What's the matter, you don't know this trick
He holds the jacket pocket wide open, for  to look into
does
The pocket is empty
(') (mock surprise) Where did it go
It's
walks over to , reaches into the pocket of the trousers she's wearing and pulls out the disk
(') But not too far
He palms the disk in his right hand
(') know what you're thinking, Krieger
You're thinking, back in the computer room --  was up here -- he was down there --
He was carrying two discs
While he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from
When he rotates it back, the disk is gone again
He holds up his left hand
It's there now
(') So hard to keep track of these things
shows his hands -- now both are empty
(fuming) Where is it
pats his pockets, pretending to be frantic
thought you had it
Do you actually think 'd let you have the  list
just stares at him, shaken
laughs looks at her
He turns completely red
When he looks back at ,  holds two disks -- one in each hand
Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and Iill cut your throat
He tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms out,  the door behind him
picks up the Bible and sees Drake Hotel
'm so sorry
Krieger was my call
've never worked with him
'm sorry, Ethan
We did what we had to do
'm going to try and get some sleep
She leaves, closing the door behind her, leaving  and alone
waits a moment, then casually walks to the trash can, picks up the disk  threw out and brushes it off carefully
He replaces it, in the trash, with the blue disk from his jacket pocket
Krieger did have the  list
Now  want you to hold onto it
What makes you trust me
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it
'm not letting this list get out in the open
Exactly, that's your job
Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open
What's the range of this thing
It's hard to tell
'm gonna have to be close
'll get you close
Claire opens the door
Ethan  need to talk to you
follows  into her room where she shows him the television screen
- On the screen, an anchor in the  news center
The unlikely setting
a farm in the heartland of America
the State of Wisconsin, where federal agents claim to have broken the brain trust behind an international drug ring
For a report we go live now to  correspondent (Joe Jones) in the state capitol, Madison
(Joe)
reporter speaks to camera, on the steps of a courthouse
Authorities have identified the couple as Margaret Ethan Hunt and Donald Hunt
looks
behind him
- An  , mid-sixties, exit the doors and are led down the steps of the courthouse in shackles
The Reporter and other news crews race up to the door
Here they are now
Camera follows the couple downstairs
Police roughly pull them away from the news crews
- They were apprehended this morning by the in a major sting operation for the illegal manufacture of the drug methcathinone, known on the street as "cat"
- (
) Similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen by officials as one of the most powerful and dangerous drugs in the world
Some thirty-four cat labs have been seized so far, but the recently widowed Mrs
Hunt and her brother-in-law are believed to be involved in a global drug distribution network
public official exits the building
The reporter and other news crews charge up to him
Mr
Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment please
The image on the television changes to an interview with a who faces a bank of microphones
think it's sad, really
Farmers, unless they're a conglomerate, are always operating on a paper-thin margin
'm afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means
That was John Fairchild, the  agent in charge of this investigation
Officials tell me that international law enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question the Hunts
This is Joe Jones, , Love in Madison, Wisconsin
Kittridge
Bastard
switches  off and paces away from it
His anger erupts and he kicks the old filing cabinets, then picks up a chair and throws it across the room so it smashes into the wall
tries to get hold of him, but he shakes her away
Don't
don't touch me
between them
What are you going to do
(turns to her and gestures at ) He's expecting my call
(strides to door) 'm going to the station
(o/s at door) And 'm going to call him
-  - comes out from a side street by Liverpool Street Underground Station and crosses the road to the main station
watches him from the window
- hurries down escalator
on him
He crosses to the
He starts to dial a number
: -   - light flashes and a phone
in shirt and tie, picks up
and several other  are monitoring newscasts and engaged in various activities related to the Hunt case
(picking up) Kittridge
(
) see you've been out visiting the folks
(covers receiver) It's Hunt
What do you need for a pinpoint
(to Ethan) Been watching a little
, have you
One of the technicians frantically scratches something on a piece of foolscap and waves it at :  "80 "
nods
-  - Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was an especially nice touch
-   - At the console, the number 44 flashes on the ' screen
He's in England
scratches England and 22 seconds on foolscap and waves it
(covering receiver) Get MI5
The  opens another line on his console and begins patching through to Whitehall
Ethan,  want to reassure you that my first order of business after you come in is to get these ridiculous charges against your family dropped and eliminated completely from their files
Come in now, we can plea down the charges against you as well
The wall clock is thirty seconds and counting down
The is frantically signalling  to keep talking
is momentarily stuck
Fortunately: (
) Can  ask you something, Kittridge
Certainly Ethan
-  - If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own  team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse
-   - don't know, Ethan
Suppose you tell me
Click
has hung up
looks hopefully to the who says: Lost him
We needed three more seconds
Surprisingly  is not as upset as he is puzzled
He wanted us to know he was in London
Clearly that's the question that  is turning over in his mind and he doesn't have a simple answer to it
: -  - Close Digital clock
It reads 23
59
Angle widens to show looking at it with grim satisfaction
He opens the door of the phone booth and almost  right into -- --the pale, weary, ghostlike figure of a man standing just inches in front of him
Startled,  looks up, but what he sees shakes him to the core
The man is and almost falls back into the phone booth
leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly
You're a hard man to catch up with
falls towards
tries to speak, but can't even form words
-    () and  opposite one another in a booth, looking clammy and listing to one side
But the banter seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close colleagues able to follow one another's reasoning easily, finishing each other's sentences: the next day  managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you
anyway,  checked our aliases
- and picked us up in the States - - but you left before  could get there and  could check just so many places
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records - - so  watched Europe
Once you showed up in England
it was easy
You knew  liked the rentals at Liverpool Street
Hey,  showed 'em to you
remember
smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an upright position
He opens a medicine bottle and takes the pain killers
Jim, who do you think you're kidding doctor's gotta look at that
You can't sit up straight
can sit up straight
just can't
sit up straight very well
It's not important
saw who shot me
Ethan, saw the mole
It was Kittridge
(a fist into the table) Kittridge
grips the sides of the table
Kitteridge
Oh my god
Kittridge is the mole
Yeah
How did Kittridge do it
-  - reprise of ' narrative only now ' telling it and camera is showing the events as  sees they actually happened
- first he took care of Jack in the elevator - At the Embassy  sends the elevator to the top of the building, watching it go and crush Kiefer
- he shot you on the bridge - On the Charles bridge  using the Visco glasses aims the gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them into the Vltava River
- he must have had back up take out Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence
There on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is who takes out  and  thru the fence
How did he do Hannah
Here it is  with back to camera who presses the detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion brilliant behind her
No
No
He could've taken out Hannah himself
presses the remote detonator and the car blows
-  (
) looking intently at him
Why, Jim
Why
Awkward moment
when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable
no more Cold War
No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself
Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission The son-of-a- bitch
How dare he
You realize itis over, youire an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youive got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year
Kittridge, weill go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time
We donit have to, Jim
Heill come after us
Whatis going to make him do that
What he didnit get in Prague
The list
Jesus, Ethan
Good for you
meeting tomorrow on the , enroute to Paris
Tight security
No guns
Real plus
If  supposedly deliver the  list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me
Iill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train
Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris
looks away
Seems badly shaken
Jim
was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house
alive and beautiful
and thinking Iim dead and gone
God knows what sheis had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done,
breaks off abruptly
Apparently some inner struggle over this threatens to overwhelm him
Then, controlling it: - no
She canit know about me
No one can
Not til this is over
Thereis too much at stake, Ethan
Youire probably right
usually am
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash
Iill call you from Paris
You got it
And get a doctor
Good luck
- CLAIREiS  - The door to ' room in the safe house opens, throwing a shaft of light over her form
creeps in and closes the door behind him
It is approximately one a

is huddled in the corner
enters and stands looking at her
What happened
(walks towards her) sent the message to Max
Weire on for tomorrow
Okay
(he steps towards her, stops) Is this the only way
Yes
come here
viens pres moi
She draws him down by his hand to kiss her
He kisses her again, more fully
She wraps an arm around him and he holds onto the kiss
The room appears to revolve around them
: - Suddenly itis bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our eyes
and  step off a military helicopter, blinking at the sunlight and hurry down the steps
immediately flank  at the bottom and fall into step alongside, ready to brief him
One of them holds out a small package with "for Job" written on it
looks at him
He rips it open
note inside simply says: Noon
looks at his watch
Itis ten to twelve
As he reads the note, something else falls out of the envelope and  to the ground
He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it
Cradled in his hand, we canit see what it is
But to him, itis very interesting
He steps up his pace, headed for the car
(to the Agent) How long to the London Terminus
Twenty, twenty-five minutes
Youive got ten
Move - The sleek front power car, looking like the nose of an , gets its 25,000 volt charge from the overhead catenary
The rear power car gets its jolt
The  starts to move, pulling out of the station
-  - The business car is similar to the one  saw on the first train they look across Europe
Itis crowded, maybe and  in suits, most of them already immersed in work on their laptops or talking on their cellular phones
One such woman is  in her seat, number 27
and the  , last seen dropping off  in Prague, sit across from her, her laptop is on the table next to her, in her briefcase
How long until we reach the Chunnel
Twenty minutes

We only see his hands as he proceeds to take the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and assemble a wicked-looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous electrical parts inside

Couldnit be helped
Thereis a piece of black cloth under your seat
Tear it away and youill find the disk
reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer disk as promised
She hands it to Matthias who strips off the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the computer in the briefcase
He boots it up quickly and turns the briefcase containing the computer toward  for her to see
One half of the screen, with the heading " " is already jammed with information
The blank second half of the screen acquires the title " ," and information starts filling itself in rapidly -- names, addresses, identities
As the two sides match up, a legend flashes: (back into phone) Ha, dear boy

) It doesnit, dear girl

Only four more cars
And if we donit find him - weill search the whole train again
Whatis Hunt doing on the
High speed train
No-one gets on
No- one gets off
High security

But why tell us
Heis putting on a show, Barnes
What kind of show

If heis got that list, heis going to want to check it
We should be looking for laptops
Good idea
- () -  - sees them coming
He smacks the laptop shut and positions his jamming phone on the table to point at Maxis computer
He gets up, taking his computer with him, headed for the rear of the car
sees the phone and goes after  with it
Excuse me, Sir, your telephone
PASSENGERSi phones nearby go haywire

Hello, Luther
Whereis Hunt
Mr
Kittridge, the  list is being modemed off the train
Where
-  - enters a little breathless
Spotting PHELPiS profile in the darkened car
Ethanis right behind me
Listen to me Jim
Is it such a good idea to kill him
We take the money
Ethan takes the blame
No-one else has seen you alive
No-one will believe him
Of course - Iim sorry to hear you say that Claire
Ethan
Yes
Ethan Hunt, darling
Remember him
Here  pulls out his assembled pistol
You knew about Jim
Course he did
Just exactly when he knew is something of a question
Before or after  showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan
Before London
But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago
They stamped it, didnit they
Those damn Gideons
PHELPiS watch alarm goes off
Two minutes til Krieger shows
Thisill have to be quicker than Iid like
Certainly quicker than youid like
Ethan, if you knew about Jim
Why
Why the masquerade
Why take the risk
Well, Claire, youive asked the question and you are the answer
knew about Jim
But, he didnit know about you
In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you
But  was supremely confident - having tastes the goods
"Thou shall not covet thy Neighbouris wife", Ethan
Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it
And like all the worldis lovers, heis tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way  do
" turns to
Well Claire do you
Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here
goes to
(') The money Ethan
hands her the money
Youive earned it
goes to Jim with the money
Count it
starts to count
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town
Keep counting Claire
It was me
did it
hands  the money
Satisfied
All ten million
Fold it
Fold it tight
Arenit you going to thank me Jim
Ten million is better than six

puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door and climbs through it -- - -- halfway out onto the roof of the train
He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle on the end of it
He  the suction cup down on the roof and pulls himself the rest of the way out
He pulls out a second suction cup and  it down on the smooth surface of the train
Now for the tough part
Using the suction cups, slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and replanting the cups as he goes
He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, a window for the
Half kneeling on the roof,  pulls out the clip from his belt
He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train
From out of the fog, a helicopter approaches
turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is going
In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching the tunnel under the English Channel
His eyes widen
- is at the controls
He sees the approaching tunnel as well
- crawls like hell to get into position
Looking up, he sees  pointing frantically behind him
turns
is climbing out the trap door
cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost touching the roof of the train
crawls closer to it
, behind him, is in a far more precarious position
Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to grab small holes on the roof
He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way
Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof
- sees the Chunnel entrance approaching
He gestures to  and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing over  and then back to him
- grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto his belt,  slides into him and they both crash onto the roof
grabs the cable out of  hand and clips it onto the roof
and  struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously closer to the chunnel entrance
They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance
- sees the tunnel, only seconds away now
He paws at the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever
- kicks  and he falls off the far side of the train
falls off the near side and holding onto the strap manages to pull himself back on
-- The train  into the tunnel -- --
/ -  - As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes nearly dark and the message on ' computer screen changes one last time
This time it says: ' face falls
Damn
/'  - Another  races into the power car, past his inert companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the train
He grabs a radio and  into it
No, no, it's the tunnel
(
) Stop the train
It'll crash into us
Accelerate, accelerate
/ - For a moment, we see no one
No
No
Moving around to the other end of the car, we see where they've gone
They're dangling from either side of it paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself back onto the roof of the train
reaches for the other cup
The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, pushing it up to full speed again
But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the train
/ - , nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of ' copter
He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the other direction
Another train
At the last moment,  notices the reflection of the oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as it blows by
The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and misses the skid
tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate with the rotor
jumps onto the skid, but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel
and chunks of cement fly
levels the chopper quickly
uses the moment to leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid
and  now hang on the skids, facing one another
Crouching on the skid,  digs in his pocket and pulls out -- -- a red and green piece of bubble gum sees it and  at , who scrambles frantically for his gun
Red light, green light
Asta Lasagna mother fucker
mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the copter's underbelly and turns away from it
kicks vainly at the gum,  -- -- but the gum
The force of the blast rockets forward, he lands on the train's windshield
The helicopter whirls and  into the tunnel, veers wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing  under the skid and  in a giant fireball
, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him
It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor blade barely missing his throat
lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly drained
/ -  - comes back into the business car and is joined by , only slightly bruised, stands up next to them and gestures to  and her laptop
think this is what you're looking for
looks up, stunned
leans over and peers at her screen
He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to wait for her to speak
When she finally does, she's almost charming
My lawyers will have a field day with this
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflicts -- leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as friendly
Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of this one
'm sure we can find something  have that you need
You know,  would love to try
- sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while he sips a beer
television screen is featuring follow-up coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in the chunnel
Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was there were no other fatalaties
There are intermittent sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of arrivals and departures
into shot
He sits beside Reach your folks
( nods) How they feeling
About what
The official apology from the Justice Department, the  treatment, you know, the whole nine yards
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the  could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys
picks up his beer
(Laughs and with a British accent) Cheers
They drink
Here's to  you, Luther
(clink glasses)  To being off the disavowed list
Hey, 'm the flavour of the month
You're more than that, Luther
They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it
They want you back in
Sure
They want me back in so  won't break in
They still can't figure out how we did it
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing
figured 'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and then , maybe, talk about it
(laughing) It's all one big negotiation, isn't it
Why don't you come back with me
Just don't know why 'd be doing it
You really liked Phelps, didn't you
He was a good guy for a long, long time
Just - not long enough
(looks up) Gotta catch my flight
(rising) So
How's it feel being a solid citizen again
Oh man
don't know
'm gonna miss being disreputable
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better 'll always think of you that way
The two men understand one another and  will say no more
The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a moment  disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative looking after him
- slumps down in his scat, dosing makes her way down the aisle, holding a case filled with movie cassettes
She stops before a lady passenger
Would you like to watch a movie, Miss Clarke
She then stops before
Excuse me, Mr
Hunt
Would you like to watch a movie
No, thank you
Would you consider the cinema of the Caribbean
just stares at her
This couldn't be what it's sounding like
Aruba, perhaps
The camera moves into 's face
They found him
They want him back
He looks up at her and
