She's carrying books and looking very collegiate
black stretch  with darkened windows drives past, , and backs up
The Young Woman stares at her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all about
Finally, the    zips down, revealing , age 30
He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a little shaggy
He's wearing a dark suit
Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school
'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost
(heavy European accent) Go straight aheads and makes a left over za bridge
Lloyd checks out her body
couldn't help noticing the accent
You from Jersey
(unimpressed) Austria
Austria
You're kidding
(mock-Australian accent) Well, g'day, mate
What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie
The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away
(') (to self) Guess  won't be going Down Under tonight
He  and zips the window back up

Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front seat
Then he puts a '  on his head and drives away
We see that '
The dispatch radio   : (v
o
) Carr 22, come in, car 22
Lloyd grabs his  mike
This is 22
22, where the hell are you, Lloyd
You're running late on the East Side pick-up
Cool your jets, Arnie
'm on my way
(v
o
) Well hurry it up
And make sure you park legally
One more ticket and your ass is history
: - This building is white with black spots on it, like a Over the front door is an awning shaped like a ' , whiskers included
van pulls up outside
The vehicle is decorated like a  , with four legs hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout on the front grill

He's in his early 30s and dressed in a ridiculous  , including a He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm of  pile out
Okay, gang, single file
You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies

The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss,
, sticks his head out
Hey, why aren't those mutts on leashes
The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell
Just get them in here now
They all have to be bathed and clipped in an hour
Palmer disappears back inside
Harry  to the dogs but they pay no attention
He struggles to keep them from wandering off
He grabs a couple of   and sits them on a wall
You kids stay right here
As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck
The truck drives away, taking the two dogs with it
(') (at truck) Hey, wait a minute
Harry chases after the vehicle
: - Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined driveway
He gets out and looks up in awe at an He  to himself, then walks to the front oor and
The double-front doors of the mansion open and appears
She's 25 and gorgeous
Lloyd's jaw drops open when he lays eyes on her
Hello
(beat) 'll be just a minute
4
As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of Binaca
He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind his ears
: - Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the window, lost in thought
She's got a  resting on her lap and she fingers the leather nervously
Lloyd keeps glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he is speechless
Then: Why you going to the airport
Flying somewhere
(dead-pan) How'd you guess
Well,  saw your luggage, then when noticed the airline ticket,  put two and two together
(beat) So where you heading
Aspen
Oh, you're gonna love it
hear California's beautiful this time of year
Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another glance
(') Name's Christmas
Lloyd Christmas
'm Mary
- we can almost see his mind work
He's desperate to impress her
Uh, this isn't my real job, you know
It's only temporary
5
Oh
Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store
That's nice
(smiling) got worms
beg your pardon
That's what we're gonna call it: Got Worms
We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms
lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants
They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids
Aren't ants quiet, too
Lloyd realizes she has a point
Uh
well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate
And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back
see
And best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry
wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what mean
To her credit, she doesn't
They continue driving
Mary looks at her watch and crosses her legs
Lloyd can see that she's concerned about something
6
(') What's the matter
Little tense about the flight
(beat) Something like that
Lloyd   and  over his shoulder at her
It's really nothing to worry about, Mary
Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport
You know, like in a head-on crash, or something
Um, Lloyd, could please keep your eyes on the road
Good thinking
There's a lot of bad rivers out there
Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel
: - Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart
He closes the trunk and turns to Mary
She looks nervous and disconcerted as she reaches into her purse
She pulls out a ten-dollar tip
Here you go
Keep it
It was my pleasure
For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile
This makes her more lovely than ever
(') Relax, Mary
Just get trashed and pass out
You'll be there before you know it
Thanks Lloyd
(beat) And good luck with your worms
7
Then she     and walks into the terminal, followed by a  pushing her bags
Lloyd watches her, , until she's out of sight
Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,
For a moment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key
He just drops his head against the steering  wheel,
There's a  on the window
Lloyd looks  up to see a standing there
Come on, move it, you're in a red zone
Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away
: - Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of travelers
Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are focused straight ahead
She passes a row of phone botths and two  one dressed in an  , the other in a   watch her
She's gonna leave the briefcase at the foot of the escalator
You make the pick-up
Piece of cake
- As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport window and When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for her ticket
Lloyd's attention is distracted by a
He turns to see a car irectly behind him
(to car's driver) Drive around me, you pinhead
When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees that ' , and she's Lloyd jumps to
8
He pulls the car into a   and hops out
He starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim
The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to approach the briefcase
Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching for the handle,
He three steps at a time
The two men look at each other, dumbstruck
- Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the  monitors that post the departure times
He looks frantically at the confusion of numbers
Damn
of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away
- Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who He starts walking down the sidewalk when suddenly he
- his limo is being towed away    under the supervision of the Police Officer
He takes off after it, but to no avail
You can't do this
'll lose my job
As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his fingers through his hair
: - We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb dejected Harry climbs out
At the same time, a taxi pulls up and drops off Lloyd
(He's clutching Mary Swanson's briefcase
) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building
They disappear inside without acknowledging each other
9
- a black Cadillac pulls up and parks
Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat
They are
and   (aka )
Who the hell do you figure this guy's working for
don't know, but we'd better find out
Mental takes some  and starts  them
(') Your ulcer
It ain't gonna kill me
Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently toward the door of their apartment
- Lloyd and Harry  and   pass each other quietly as they both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs
(Lloyd still has the briefcase in his   lap
) Harry's caged parakeet, , tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there
The place is a mess
Wallpaper's peeling off the walls
The carpet is threadbare and filthy
In the corner we see a miniature   and a large terrarium filled with dirt and worms
Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture with stuffing spilling out of the gashes
got fired again
Lloyd shakes his head
don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser
No offense
None taken
Were you shitcanned, too
10
Of course not
(beat) quit
Why'd you quit
had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me
Why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded
Winners control their own destiny, Har
Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one to him
You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that  just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle
(beat) The alarm alone cost me two hundred
Big deal
That car's an old bomb anyway
What are you talking about
It's only six years old
That's forty-two in dog years
They open their beers and drink simultaneously
Then Harry notices the briefcase
What's with the briefcase
It's a love memento
Huh
11
The most beautiful woman alive
Her name was Mary
drove her to the airport
Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved
She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life
End of story
What's in it
you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private property
Why not
(beat) It's locked
They take another sip of their beers
Suddenly we hear a at the door
Petey the parakeet starts to
The guys look at each other, , then Harry tip-toes to the '  - a -
Shay and Joe Mental are standing at the door
(') ( to Harry) Friend or foe
() We don't have any friends
Harry is still squinting out the peephole
(') Can't recognize them
Could be student loan thugs again, or the , or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced a check on
12
Hey,  ordered Mystic Mint
The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butter Praline
Well, whoever they are, they look serious
One of them's even wearing plaid
(cringing) That's a hostile pattern
say we bail and get down to unemployment
Lloyd    and the two of them  out the window and down the fire escape
: - The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building and
Lloyd and Harry climb out
Lloyd takes a trash can and places it ,
'  -   - is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs
Gentlemen, 'm delighted to say that neither  nor the unemployment epartment of the state of Rhose Island can do anything for you
(beat) You've run out of chances
You're unemployable
Remember last year
Middle of winter  busted my butt to - fifty an hour, and you went and blew it
Blew it
For your information, we only missed three days in two months
Yeah, and that was because of a blizzard 13
(exploding) Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted
Come on, Stan
'm sure you can find something else for us
How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline
Grabner jumps up
: & '  - Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom
The briefcase ain't here
He must've taken it with him
Shit
(beat) Well he's gotta come home sometime
Joe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage
Maybe we should leave him a little message to let 'em know we're playing hardball
Mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around the bird, who (') (a la Tweety Bird) taut  taw a puddy cat
Mental smiles, and as we  to
Shay, we hear a bone- chilling
and Petey the bird stops
14
(') (still Tweety) did,  did
: The Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb
depressed Lloyd and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building entrance
Give me what's left of our dough
'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities
Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills
(') What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night Train
Get Robitussin it's a better buzz
: - Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries
He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his  and removes a quarter
He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes that he '     to pick up the newspaper
He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper, and as he does so Lloyd , puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks his pockets
Just then, an struggles by using a
Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar
Change
No, 'm sorry,  don't
Well could you do me a favor and guard this while  go break a dollar
My wallet's locked in this machine
15
Of course, young man
Lloyd runs back into the store
We      as Lloyd  a few seconds later with a handful of quarters
Suddenly he stops in his tracks
The  ,  , As he takes a closer look, he sees that : - thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up the steps to his apartment
& ' The door opens and Lloyd
Harry is sitting on the couch, looking almost comatose
Where's the booze
It's gone
got robbed by Grandma Walton
She got my wallet, too
Harry drops his head and lets out a
(') Come on, man, cheer up
We've been own before
'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere
It gets worse, Lloyd
My parakeet Petey he's
he's dead
Lloyd looks touched by this
Oh man, 'm sorry, Harry
What happened
His head fell off
His head fell off
16
Yeah, he was pretty old
Lloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately
(hopeful) don't suppose he had a warranty
Nah,  bought him used
As Lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset
That's it
've had it with this ump
We don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old Okay, calm down
No  won't calm down
Lloyd flops down in a chair
(') What the hell are we doing here anyway, Harry
We've got to get out of this town
Yeah, and go where
'll tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano
(dramatic ) 'm talking about Aspen
Aspen
That's right, Aspen
17
don't know, Lloyd, the French are assholes
Let me ask you something: do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a Dear Abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak
Or do you want to enjoy your life
(beat) Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's eath be in vain
Don't you see what he was saying
Spread your wings, man
he was saying
Spread your wings, man
Fly
(confused) What are you talking about, Lloyd
His head fell off
(dawning realization) Wait a second,  know what you're up to
You just wanna go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there
That's bullshit
'll drive
(beat) And what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline
(torn) don't know, Lloyd
think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store
'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors
Lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry cityscape
You know what 'm sick and tired of, Harry
'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life
'm sick and tired of being a nobody
() 18
(') (beat) But most of all, 'm sick and tired of having nobody
There's a deadly  as they both think about this
Then Harry tries to lighten the mood
He opens his arms wide
Come on, Lloyd
Give us a kiss
On the other hand, maybe you're right, Harry
Maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court
With all those lawsuits against us, 'm sure we'll win at least one
It could be a boost to our egos
Harry sees that Lloyd has a point
He stands and approaches Petey's cage
His eyes fill with tears
(emotional) Petey,  made a promise to you once, man
(thinking hard) and 'll be damned if  can remember what it was
: - The Mutt Cutts van is going down the highway while Danny Wilson's "Mary's Prayer" plays on the soundtrack
The van drives past and we   a sign that reads: " ,
" of the car travelling down the road while the song continues to play
- Harry's behind the wheel and Lloyd's in the passenger seat
The Animal's "We've Got to Get Out of This Place" is on the radio and the guys are  : 19
& "We've got to get out of this place, If it's the last thing we ever do, We've got to get out of this place, Girl, there's a better life, for me and you
" Lloyd turns down the radio
Well, we're finally doing it
Do you realize that in all the years we've known each other, this is the first time we've done this together
Been run out of town
Taken a trip
Harry reaches over and
Lloyd watches, curious
(') Why'd you do that
What
Take your seatbelt off
Because we just cleared the danger zone
Huh
Don't you know anything, Lloyd
Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home
We've already traveled 6
3 miles
: Well what about the people who live around here
What if we got into an accident with one of them
20
Harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back on
Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio
Where'd you get those
Bought 'em when we filled up
Lloyd,  thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures
We're on a tight budget, remember
This didn't come out of our travel fund
was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left
You know, so we could live in style
Where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks
sold some stuff to Billy in 4-
You mean the blind kid
That's right
Lloyd looks out the window guiltily
What did you sell him, Lloyd
Just some odds and ends
Specifically
Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid
Well who else was  gonna sell it to
But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a head
21
Put your mind at ease, friend took care of it
: - At the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a little blind boy,
He sits in a wheelchair playing with a     -
He throws the ead bird up, but it flops into his lap
Fly
Joe Mental and
Shay approach and climb the steps
: - taped to Harry and Lloyd's apartment door
It reads: -       -     - to reveal Joe Mental and
Shay
Those bastards
They're rubbing it right in our faces
Shit
Andre will have a goddamn aneurysm if we don't get that briefcase back
Don't   worry, we'll get it back
And 'll   tell you something else
They ain't   gonna reach Aspen, either
'll   make sure of that
Mental takes out more   and starts to chew on them
- pissed-off Shay and Mental  the building
Mental pops more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs
Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the air
22
Come on, boy, fly
Plop
Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and : (') Excuse me, mister
Is there something wrong with my bird
Mental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and as hard as he can
Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew south for the winter
: - Harry is still driving while Lloyd studies a map spread out before him
How far have we gone
According to this map, about an inch and a half
Shit
We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there
We don't have enough gas money
Relax
We have more than enough
believe you're wrong, Lloyd
And  believe 'm right, Harry
still say wrong, Lloyd
How much you wanna bet
don't bet
23
Lloyd looks at his friend, incredulous
What do you mean you don't bet
mean  don't gamble, you know that
Never have and never will
Oh, bull
'll bet you our next meal that  can get you gambling before the day's out
There's no way, Lloyd
You can't do it
'll give you three-to-one odds
That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose
You're wasting your money, Lloyd already told you,  don't gamble
Okay, five-to-one  can get you gambling before the day's out
Sorry, pal, no way
Make it ten-to-one
Harry sticks out his hand
You got yourself a bet, sucker
As Harry  ' , Lloyd breaks into a
Harry immediately realizes he's been had
: - The Mutt Cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor- trailer trucks
24
Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables of tough-looking
Harry oesn't look happy
middle- aged, no-nonsense  approaches their table with a couple of burgers and drinks
She puts them down in front of the boys and starts to walk away
(to Waitress) ,
The Waitress reluctantly returns to the table
(') What's the soup du jour
It's the soup-of-the-day
Sounds tasty
'll have a bowl
(sarcastic) Anything else before  leave the area
Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well
Could you please bring me a spoon
The Waitress  and picks up the milk
Then she , There
Now you don't need one
The guys watch her stomp away
- back country-folk, don't it, Harry
Harry wipes off his straw with a napkin
As he moves to put it in the ashtray, he accidentally 25
Uh-oh
What's the matter
You spilled the salt
That's bad luck
We're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck
Quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder
What for
Because that's good luck
Harry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it over his shoulder
Suddenly they hear a (o
s
) What the fuck
Or was it the left shoulder
They turn and see a burly  wiping salt out of his eyes
Who's the dead man threw shit in my eye
The huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry
He's wearing a    that says:  ',  ', - '
It was a terrible accident, Sir
Believe me,  would never do anything to offend a man of your size
Please accept my most sincere apology
The Trucker  and approaches the table, egged on by his equally burly
#1 Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass
26
Sea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger
You gonna eat that
Um
the thought had crossed my mind
At this, Sea Bass leans over and   , Still want it
Harry stares at the burger non-commitally
Nah, you go ahead
Sea Bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to the  of his friends
: - Shay is at the gas pump filling the black Cadillac while Joe Mental stretches his legs
large truck pulls away, Mental smiles at this, and we : The Waitress drops the check on Lloyd and Harry's table and away
Harry studies the bill and
Perfect
'm out eight bucks and still haven't eaten
Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals
(brightening) Wait a second
think  just had an idea
Follow me
Lloyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals nervous Harry trails after him
27
(') Excuse me, gentlemen, 'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier
Huh
What 'm trying to say is, my friend and  would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet
Harry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the Truckers seem to like the idea
Make it four boiler-makers
Whatever you want, sir
'll have the waitress send them over
Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road
Lloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the
Lloyd, what are you doing
You know we can't afford to buy them drinks
Lloyd hands the Cashier their check
Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check
They said just add this to their tab
(skeptical) Sea Bass said that
Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass
He points across the room to Sea Bass and company
Sea Bass , The Cashier is convinced
Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants
28
Harry smiles at this
He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter
Oh, and put these on there, too
You got it
(to Cashier) By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here
: - The front door   and a red-faced Sea Bass , followed by his buddies, the Cashier, and the Waitress
'm gonna kill those sons-of-bitches
Hurry and you'll catch 'em
They was on their way to Rhode Island
The Truckers jump in their rigs and     in the our boys are headed
: - The Mutt Cutts van breezes by
- jubilant Harry's driving and chewing on a mouthful of Beef Jerky
just wish we could've seen Sea Bass's face when he got the bill
hope we never have to
Don't worry
That fish-head is probably half-way to Providence by now
29
hope so
Harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously
Hey, stop the car
gotta take a whiz
Are you crazy
'm not stopping now
What if they figure out we went the other way
They'll be on us in no time
But  gotta go
What am  supposed to do
Hold it
can't hold it
'm about to explode
Well
just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle
There's a couple on the floor in the back seat
Are you serious
Yes, 'm serious
'm not stopping now
We could get killed
Lloyd
He takes an    from the back seat and  his fly
Suddenly we hear a
Then: Uh-oh
What's the matter
The bottle's almost full and 'm still going
Well stop going
30
can't stop once  already started, you know that
Quick, get me another bottle
Harry can      as he reaches way in the back seat for an empty
(') Jesus, be careful
You almost went off the road
'm sorry, Lloyd
'm doing the best can
He hands Lloyd another empty and Lloyd quickly makes the switch
Here, hold this
Before Harry knows it he's holding the full
- As the Mutt Cutts van travels down the highway, it passes a on a motorcycle hidden in the bushes
The Trooper takes off after them
Harry is doing his best to steer while now holding Lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat
What are you, a goddamn camel
Hey,  haven't gone all day
Just then they hear a : (o
s
) Pull over
They turn to see the   cruising right beside then
Harry rolls down his window and  : Huh
31
Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at the Trooper
(calling out) No, it's a Cardigan
But thanks for noticing
He rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled Lloyd
(') Jesus, what is this, the fashion police
The Cop turns on his
: - The   is walking up beside the stopped Mutt Cutts van, staring at it with isapproval
License and registration, please
Harry hands him the papers
(') You know, you fellas were all over the road back there
Yes, sir, we had a little
ifficulty in the car
Uh-huh
(beat) Have you boys been doing a little rinking maybe
No, sir
32
Then what's that
He points to the ,    hidden in the seat between them
Oh, that's nothing, sir
Do you know it's against the law to rive with an open alcohol container in this state
But, your honor, he's telling the truth
It's not beer
The officer smirks
Is that right
The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles
He inspects the beer label, then Sir,  wouldn't  --You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you
(under breath) ,
Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins  down the piss
He pauses uncertainly and a He takes a
Then: (pained) Get the hell out of here
: The Mutt Cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on his knees
: 33
- The van is making steady progress through the dark night
- Lloyd is driving now while Harry sleeps in the passenger seat
The song, "Cut Flowers" by The Smithereens, starts to play as Lloyd  about his future in Aspen
: ' : Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase
The sky is absurdly blue and children are making a snowman on the lawn
It's all out of a dream world
He  on the door, tentatively
Mary opens it
She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks into the ,   he's ever seen
Then she slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow
Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway
As he trails after her, she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances over her shoulder at him
around a corner and now we're in a The shower is running and we see the silhouette of two people behind the curtain

- her   hair is slicked back, making her look better than ever
As   the    toward her breasts, we are surprised   to see not breasts but a The headlights
Then
- he blinks, confused at what's happening
- an eighteen-wheeler is on the highway
Lloyd quickly veers back into his   lane and avoids tragedy by a whisker
shaken Lloyd lets out   a   , and we : - The Mutt Cutts van is parked outside this seedy establishment

(v

) Hey, it's the only motel that charges by the hour
We can't afford anything else
- Lloyd and Harry are sitting in a large, -
Lloyd is sipping a beer and Harry is absorbed in the Enquirer as the water swirls around them
Yep, this sure is the life
Cold beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink sheets
You know, there's only one thing that could make this moment any better
35
What's that
If you had a nice set of knockers
That's two things, Lloyd
Right now 'd settle for one
Lloyd takes a swig of beer
Harry puts down the paper and looks around at the romantic decor
don't know, Lloyd, these places just don't do it for me
Brings back too many memories
What happened, Harry
Some little filly break your heart
Nah, it was a girl
Fraida Felcher
We stayed at a place like this once No-Tell Motel out on Route 31
Felcher
You mean the babe who worked for the tractor company
Harry nods
The same
We had this incredibly romantic time
Boy,  thought we'd be together forever
() Then about a week later, right out of the blue, she sends me a John Deere letter
That's cold, Har
Give you any reason
called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that wasn't really paying attention
36
Harry reaches for a beer and busts it open
He takes a big gulp
(') Thing that really hurts is  think she was seeing another guy
Never id find out who
- he does his best to hide his
: - We see that the black Cadillac is   parked a few cars over from the Mutt Cutts van with
Shay in the passenger seat
to a payphone
Inside is   Joe Mental
Outside the booth, an   impatiently   paces back and forth as he waits for the phone
(into phone) The boys are holed-up in a little love nest for the night
think they're a couple of fucking weirdos
'  - is pacing around the room with a cordless phone
He's in his late 30s, wears a ponytail, and dresses in Aspen/Rodeo Drive chic
What in hell are those guys up to
Is it possible that they're Feds
Unlikely from what 've seen
The   taps on the phone booth and motions for Mental to hang up
don't like this one goddamn bit, Mental
You and Shay were supposed to grab that bag so we could end this shit
Now  don't know what the hell's going on
Andre  and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip
The Anxious Man  on the booth again
37
Hold on a second, Mr
Andre
Mental puts the phone down and motions the    Anxious Man closer to the booth
The Man moves forward a few    inches
Mental motions him even closer
When he's about a    foot away, Mental punches his hand through the glass of the    booth and knocks the Anxious Man out cold
Then Mental picks up the phone again
(') Sorry, boss
You were saying
Look, Mental, just find out what they're up to
want to know who these guys are
Don't worry
'm on it
Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van
He's joined by
Shay
As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see a dog but there isn't one
They both take another step forward, and the
Again, Mental and Shay stop
He peeks under the car
Nothing
What the fuck
Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle
As soon as he touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a
Mental jumps back and pulls his gun
Where's the goddamn dog
Shay shrugs, nervous
The  grows   now, forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene
: -  - of a luxurious mountainside home
38
- An agitated Mary Swanson (the young woman who lost her briefcase) is pacing back and forth in , - - younger second wife,
It just doesn't make any sense left the money exactly where they instructed me to
Actually, it makes a great deal of sense, Mary
We should have called in the authorities the moment we knew Melvin had been kidnapped
Now, Helen, we've been through this already for Christ's sake, Karl, these bastards will extort us into bankruptcy if we let them
But 'd never forgive myself if something happened to Melvin
Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen
She's been through quite enough already
It's not her fault, Daddy
We're all a little on edge
Just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed Nicholas Andre
He looks appropriately solemn
Has there been any word, Mr
Swanson
Nothing yet, Nicholas
Andre looks upset
Perhaps  should call off the Preservation benefit this weekend

- schedule
No, Nicholas, it's imperative that we carry on as usual
The atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber
Karl Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter
Don't worry, sweetheart
'll do everything they ask
Nothing's going to happen to Melvin,  promise you
Thank you, Daddy
Karl Swanson looks out the window, concerned
: - The black Cadillac pulls over to the side of the road
Joe Mental gets out of the car and props the hood open
He takes out his gun,     , and puts it back in his pocket
(to Shay) Lie down on the front seat
After they pick me up  want you to follow us
Then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van to come along
: - Lloyd taps Harry's shoulder
You're it
Harry taps Lloyd back
You're it
Lloyd immediately taps Harry
40
You're it
Quitsies
(tapping him back) Anti-quitsies
You're it
Quitsies
No anti-quitsies
No startsies
Lloyd shakes his head, defeated
Damn, you're good, Harry
(beat) Hey, didn't  tell you this trip would be a blast
- Joe Mental squints down the road, sees the Mutt Cutts van approaching, and starts    to flag them down
Through the windshield we can see Mental waving
The guys don't slow down, through
The just   as they Harry also toots the horn, which makes the See,  told you these country folks were friendly, Harry
- As an angry Mental watches them disappear down the road, Shay sits up in the front seat
What happened
These fuckers are really pissing me off now
: - We hear The Zombie's 'Time of the Season' as the van flashes by
41
- Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd: what exactly do we do when we get to Aspen
Well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous Aspenese air
Fresh, huh
The freshest
They say on any day of the week you can smell a moose-fart ten miles away
(sincere) Wow
talk about paradise
(beat) And after we're finished breathing, what next, Lloyd
Then we make a splash on the social scene
Just then, Lloyd notices something up the road
(') Harry, look the golden arches
Pull over, 'm starving
: ' - The Mutt Cutt car is at the drive-through window
' That's two cheese burgers, two fries, and two medium Cokes
Five seventy- two
Harry hands a ten-dollar-bill to the Employee, who returns a handful of change
Thanks
42
Then, before he can  give them   the bag of food, the guys absentmindedly
As   they pull out of the parking lot, the McDonald's  Employee   sticks his head out the window and       at   them
' Hey
But the guys are already around the corner
- The Mutt Cutt van is on the road again, cruising along
- About this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we don't even have any money
Look, once we drop the briefcase off to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll plug us right into the party circuit
After that, we do a little of the ski , -   - rubbers, and walk out of there in the spring with enough business connections to open a first-class worm operation
You see, you don't get rich working, Harry
You get rich knowing the rich
Where'd you hear that
Some bum down at unemployment
Harry thinks about this
don't know, Lloyd
What's the matter
Money does terrible things to people
mean, we could lose our friendship
43
Lloyd thinks about this
Yeah
So
Harry nods and looks out the window
Suddenly (') Hey, wait a second
Hold everything
What
Aren't you forgetting something
Harry thinks about this
(') Back at Mickey 's
little matter you might've overlooked
Harry wracks his brain, but to no avail
What
Lloyd rolls his eyes
My change
As a sheepish Harry gives Lloyd his change, they notice something up ahead
& '  -      , This time the Cadillac is , think this guy's in trouble
Why on't you pull over
Lloyd looks at Harry
Harry remembers that he's driving
He pulls the car to the side of the road
Mental approaches the passenger window
44
You guys going as far as Des Moines
My car died and 'm late for a business meeting
: - They're back on the highway and Joe Mental is , looking extremely
The guys are in the middle of an argument
It's a fruit
It's a vegetable
'm telling you, it's a fruit
And  happen to know it's a vegetable
Tell you what, why don't we leet an impartial judge decide
Fine with me
Harry turns to Joe Mental
Hey, Mr
Mentalino, settle our bet: Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables
Mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his mouth
He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though, Lloyd hits the breaks and  to a stop beside a bunch of hitchhiking

Someone's playing a and the gang is  a

Harry and Lloyd are playing a game while Mental stares straight ahead, furious
His eyes are watering and he looks ill
Okay, Harry, my turn
Let 'er rip
Harry lifts a cheer and lets out a
Lloyd  a few times, then closes his eyes and  it up toward his nostrils, as if it was the aroma of a fine wine
(') Hmmm
full-bodied, delicate bouquet, aged to perfection will rip no fart before it's time

All right
'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog extra onions, garden salad with blue
And
Kit-Kat bar
Harry throws up his arms, defeated
He hands Lloyd a buck
You're the best, man
(beat) Okay, my turn
Where are your manners, Harry
We have a guest
Harry punches Mental's shoulder playfully
Come on, Mr
Mentalino
Let one fly
It's only a buck
: '   - large neon road sign beside the cafe shows a man's exasperated face with     , The sign advertises: 46
' Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a table with a hateful Joe Mental
The boys are each holding up a 'll do one if you will
Okay, you go first
No, you go first
No, you go first
Why don't you both stop being a couple of pussies and go at the same time
It ain't that hot
Lloyd and Harry exchange a look, then simultaneously Hmmm, not bad
Yeah, more tingly than hot
Suddenly the boys' smile begins to curl on Mental's lips
He pours them a couple glasses of water from a pitcher
Have some water
It'll help
Lloyd and Harry who are both sweating profusely now start to  down their water
This, of course, makes it burn more
(') Aw, shucks, that's right
Water just makes it worse
The boys run to the bar and , much to the elight of a  Joe Mental
: 47
'  - Mental is on the phone outside the front door  to Nicholas Andre
It's Mental
'm just sitting down to a nice meal with our boys
Good work
What did you find out so far
Nothing yet, but 'm gonna shake 'em own for information at lunch
(beat) Then 'm gonna kill 'em for dessert
Well eat fast, time's running out
And whatever you do, don't let them get any closer
don't need them here running around Aspen
Mental pulls a     out of his jacket
Relax, they ain't gonna be running around anywhere after  dump a little cyanide in their pops
'  - Back at the table, the boys are soaked and  as if they just finished the Boston Marathon
The burgers have been served, but Lloyd and Harry are still too traumatized to touch them
That really wasn't very polite of him, was it
Maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair
Harry Dunne, 'm surprised at you
Perhaps it's about time you brushed - fearing adults call the Bible
It's crammed with all kinds of pithy rules to live your life by

(humbled) You mean like 'turn the other cheek
' No,  mean like 'an eye for an eye
' Hand me those peppers the atomic ones
Harry passes the jar and the two of them   ' ,
(whispering) Here he comes
Lloyd and Harry bite into their food as Joe Mental sits back down at the table
Feeling any better, boys
As he pours ketchup on his burger, the guys glance at each other and
Then he picks it up and brings it to his mouth
Just before biting into it, though, he
(') So tell me, why you fellas headed to Aspen
Vacation
More like re-location
Mental starts toward the burger but stops again
Doesn't look like you packed much
All  saw was a couple bags
and that briefcase
The briefcase isn't even ours
Some lady just left it at the airport
We're bringing it back to her
This is news to Mental
You mean you don't even know her
Not really
was just her limo river
49
Mental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're serious
Then he Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Lloyd and Harry share a     confused look
Mental shakes his head and        ,
Almost immediately, his happy     demeanor is replaced by a His       , ,
The boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help him
Hey, you okay, man
It was just a goof

Harry checks Mental's coat pocket        for his antacid pills but unwittingly brings out the

Mental  and keels over,

can't believe it
50
Life is a fragile thing, Har
One minute you're chewing on a burger; the next minute you're dead meat
But he blamed me
You heard him
Those were his last words
If you don't count that gurgling sound
Harry lets out a
(') Hey, relax, man, 'm just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me,  on't feel guilty at all
Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids
() Don't you get it, Lloyd
've got a ead guy pissed at me
His restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy-five years
That's ridiculous
You probably won't live to see forty
Harry perks up, cheered by this thought
Oh yeah
(beat) Wow
What a relief

They were driving an '84 poodle

Dale does a double-take
An '84 what

(straight-faced) Well it might have been a wire-haired terrier, Detective
They're very similar in appearance
The Detective looks confused, as we : - The boys are extremely exhausted as they plow through the black night toward Aspen
Let's get off and crash at a motel before  crash into one

Giving you a hard time
Melvin's not the problem
It's these two other guys that have me worried

Andre hangs up the phone and then disappears down his basement stairs
- The room has a dirt floor
There's a stone  in the middle
We hear    coming from deep within the well
Andre walks to the edge of the dark hole
How you doing today, Melvin

Andre takes a hit off his cigarette and flicks it into the well
: - The Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate
- Lloyd is now   in the passenger seat as Harry drives on
roadsign reading  - 602  whizzes by
Todd Rundgren's "Too Far Gone" begins to play while Harry peers at the empty highway
As the song plays we see a series of quick shots: new sign says  - 421
Lloyd is still asleep with his feet now on Harry's lap
Another sign reads  - 201
Harry stares straight ahead, practically catatonic
Lloyd's feet are out the window and his head is on Harry's lap
The next roadsign says  - 157
Lloyd's feet are now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet should be
Harry looks on the verge of blacking out
Finally, a sign reads    - 25 /, - 2:10 The Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump
In the background are several tractor-trailer rigs and a cafe
Harry climbs out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the passenger door
Lloyd tumbles to the asphalt,
Harry nudges him with his foot
Come on, wake up
You pay, 'll pump
Lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet

When he gets it to the   door, he struggles to lift the engine on it's side, finally   managing to slip the key into the lock
- Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas
Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee pulls up and a long-legged, tanned,   climbs out
This seems to wake Harry up
The Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and starts to fill her   jeep
Harry makes a feeble attempt to brush his hair into   place, then    and nods to the skis on her   roof-rack
Skis, huh
That's right
Great
She continues to pump gas
(') They yours
Uh-huh
Both of 'em
Um, yeah
(impressed) Cool

Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere

Harry turns to see the gas
He immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump as she smiles to herself

He starts to read the graffiti scrawled on the wall
Finally, he comes to one that says:    ,     8, 1993, 2:15 He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch
- the date reads  8

Actually, 'm moving to Aspen
've got to get away from my boyfriend
He's such a klutz
My astrologer told me  should avoid accident-prone guys
Just then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on ,    , (holding out mirror) Here, this is a little loose
She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a cigarette

The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks
Harry tosses the match to the ground, and we hear an

This only helps to fan them

Are you sure you won't forget

He begins hopping around violently
Is something wrong
Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from screaming

It's so funny how your mind god sakes, give me the damn number

Sea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees
Then the trucker steps back and
The sound of the zipper brings a green color to Lloyd's face

In his desperation he and thrusts his flaming foot into the toilet, Harry breathes a   of relief
Only then does he notice Harry has to do a - for this to sink in
Then he lets out an admonishing You've got some serious explaining to o, young man

Sure thing, Lloyd

He hurries to the  in  charge
Any sign of them yet
No, but we're expecting them shortly
motorist said he spotted a pooch about thirty miles back headed this way
Detective Dale nods, satisfied
: - of a mini mart
- The door opens and Lloyd gets in carrying a bag of Doritos and a soda
He settles into the driver's seat and pulls a Beef Jerky out of his back pocket
Hey,  picked you up a Beef Jerky
When he gets no response, he notices that Harry is already fast asleep in the passenger seat
Lloyd shakes his head
(') Boy, some guys just weren't cut out for life on the road

The van hits a bump which causes Harry's eyes to flutter open
Hey, Mr
Sleepy Head, welcome back
(groggy) How long have  been out
'd say a good five hours, anyway
Harry yawns and stretches
Great
We must be getting real close, huh
Should be
've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night
Good man
Boy, 'll tell you, this is one angerous highway
You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing  couldn't even recognize
That's awful
Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there
hit 'em
Harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing
62
Funny
expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this
was thinking the same thing
That John Denver's some full of shit, huh
They both stare out the window
(') must say, Des Moines sure is a pretty little town
Yeah, it really is
(beat) Wait a minute when did you visit Des Moines
Last night
We drove through it
What are you talking about
You were snoring like a baby when we went through Des Moines
Lloyd shakes his head in amusement, then in Harry's face
(sing-song) Hello
Hello
Anybody home
Rise and shine
() You were the one who was asleep, numbskull
Here, take a sip of coffee
You're delirious
confused Harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing terrain
Then something starts to awn on him
Slowly
Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west
In our country it does, yes
63
Then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7:30 in the morning when we're heading west
Lloyd thinks about this and then looks
: - The Mutt Cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and Harry is sitting beside it on the pavement, a  man
'm only human, Harry
Anybody can make a mistake
But Harry just sits there, practically catatonic
(') Come on, man, pull yourself together
You know,  got half a mind to just jump on the bus to Europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever
(rolls his eyes) You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo
Oh yeah
Why not
You don't have a passport
Harry lets out a defeated
(') Come on, stop being a baby about this
Okay, so we back-tracked a tad
tad
Lloyd, you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction
Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we on't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough to eat, we don't have enough to sleep
64
Well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it
If we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out
Harry thinks about this
You know, you're absolutely right, Lloyd
He stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward the highway
Where you going
Home
'm walking home
You can't be serious
(sarcastic) Why not
We're probably only five miles away
Harry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches
( ) Thanks a lot, Mr
Perfect
Like you never screwed up
Harry suddenly     and turns back to his friend
He seems completely rained
Look, man
'm sorry
(beat) never should have let you talk me into this in the first place
You've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you
But let's face it, Lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in Aspen
(beat) There's nothing waiting for me anywhere
65
Lloyd just stands there, , as Harry turns and walks away
Out of frustration, he  the snout of the car, causing it to
: - Harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out unenthusiastically
few cars  by, the cold wind whipping at his clothes
station wagon blows by and throws a     out the window
It lands at Harry's feet
-  ' - a  slowly rolls down his cheek  (like the Indian in the commercial)
to the bag of  garbage
We see it's a    that's ripped open
Suddenly a  pulls up and stops
It's an ominous-looking vehicle and Harry hesitates
Then the passenger window rolls down, revealing a contrite Lloyd at the wheel
Got room for one more, if you still want to go to Aspen
Harry looks the hearse over
Where'd you find this baby
Used car dealer
traded the van for it
Plus  got   the guy to throw in fifty bucks for   gas money
(beat) Come on, man, what   do you say
We still partners
: - An impatient Detective Dale is still staked-out at the Colorado border with several other officers
It doesn't make sense
They should've been here hours ago
Maybe they're smarter than we thought
66
How smart can they be
They're riving a goddamn dog
Another  rushes over holding his walkie-talkie
#2 We just got a report that they were spotted about two hours ago heading east near Des Moines on -80
(incredulous) Des Moines
Why that's five hundred miles from here
#1 Guess they got wind of our welcoming party
We're wasting time
Let's mobilize
Dt
Dale heads for his cruiser while the other Cops follow
As the officers climb into their cars, we : - Lloyd is driving and Harry has his feet out the window
Tell me something, Harry
Would you really have kept going home if hadn't come back to get you
Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard
We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again
Do you remember that
Lloyd thinks hard about this
We were never Cub Scouts
67
Exactly
Just then several   whiz by them in the opposite direction with   and
When Harry glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a in the rear of the vehicle
(') What the hell is this
There's a coffin in the back
Relax, it's empty
don't give a shit
'm not driving anywhere with a casket
You know 'm superstitious calm down
We'll dump it off first chance we get
- Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse
Ahead of them is a
The lead car is a
( ) - (This is the car right behind the funeral hearse
)   and a  are arguing
married a cheapskate
Shut your trap, Gerdie
'm so embarrassed
'll never be able to show my face again
knew something good would come out of this
We could have given him a more ignified burial
68
Your uncle was a cheap man
Remember what he got us for our twenty-fifth
friggin' fern
There's no way 'm gonna spend a load to get him planted
- While the couple  , Harry and Lloyd cut in front of them
The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the : - Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the market
The procession comes to a halt behind them
The guys get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back
Then they unceremoniously - The Woman's jaw is practically on the floor
You son-of-a-bitch
want a ivorce
: ' '' '
: - The hearse drives past a sign that says  , : - The boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows, studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of the ski town
69
Isn't this wonderful
What more could a couple of single guys like us ask for
How about food and shelter
You're so materialistic
(beat) Why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary
Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two
Jolly good idea, chap
And where oes the lovely young lady reside
Um
good question
Harry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone booth next to them
Well what's her last name
We'll look it up in the phone book
Hmmmm
You know,  don't believe caught that either
Harry's concern grows
What about the briefcase, Lloyd
There must've been a name on it, right
(brightening) Come to think of it, there is
It's engraved right into the leather
What is it
Samsonite   spelled just like it sounds
70
Harry starts flipping through the phone book
Then abruptly and puts the book down, a  look on his face
: - The car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a picturesque bridge
Harry and Lloyd are shivering in the front seat as a ,    though the hearse
They're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and sipping it
Any soup left
little
Shall we share it
Please
Lloyd opens a    and squirts half of it into Harry's cup and the other half into his
They pour a few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons
Mmmm mmmm good
Lloyd smiles bravely at Harry
Harry notices something and leans toward him
Hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth
Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it
Hmmm
looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky
: Wanna split it
You're pathetic
Get your own
Loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it
Another gust of wind swirls around them
71
'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd
Roll up your window
It is rolled up
Then  guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working
You really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter
What anti-cold system
Lloyd points to the dash
Right here the / button
put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder
Harry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted
He opens the car door and starts to climb out
(') What are you going out there for
To warm up
- Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms crossed
Lloyd comes from around the other side
What are you worrying about now
'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling 'm about to give you
Huh
Suddenly Harry  at Lloyd, who takes off around the other side of the car
Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd manages to evade his grasp
72
(') Harry, calm down
You're acting like a wild animal
Get over here and take your medicine, Lloyd
Sorry, doc,  can't take medicine
'm a Christian Scientist
Lloyd continues to outrun him around the car
Frustrated, Harry opens the car and (') What are you doing
Something  should've done a long time ago
This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along
Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river
Don't do anything foolish, Harry
Foolish
This is the most sensible thing 've done in years
'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river
Lloyd starts to follow after Harry
You're making a big mistake, Harry
'll never forgive you for this
Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose of the briefcase
(') Harry, hold up
Things are gonna get better,  promise
In fact,  think feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar
It's yours, Harry, all yours
Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued
73
You're bluffing
No 'm not, man look
Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar
Harry squints at it
That's a filling, you liar
Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry
Harry turns and runs, but Lloyd   as they reach the bridge
The briefcase , and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another in the snow, rolling over and over
Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand
He climbs on top and '
(') used to have a life
miserable one, but a life, nonetheless
Suddenly Lloyd's    as he sees something
behind his friend
( ) Harry, look
Harry turns and    ,
He lets go of Lloyd as we see -         , ,
: - Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching the briefcase
The city is lit up with millions of tiny lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland
Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel
74
Sounds good
And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs
We'll be meticulous    right down to the last penny
That way, whatever we borrow we can pay back
Absolutely
We're good for it
You know, as soon as we get jobs
It'll come right out of our first paycheck
: - tuxedoed Bell Captain, , is showing the guys around an
The place is big enough to throw a touchdown bomb in
This is the Hotel Danbury's Presidential Suite, gentlemen
It's normally reserved for royalty, visiting dignitaries, and illustrious stars of stage and take it
The Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased
(') Very good, sir
Are there any bags you'd like sent up
Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our own chicks
(peevish) wasn't talking about ladies
75
Oh
Then go ahead and send thim up
What are their names
Barnard
Sir,  meant your luggage
Harry forces a
embarrassed half-smile
Tell you what you can send up, my friend how about some chow
The Bell Captain nods
'll bring you a menu
Don't bother
Just order us one of everything
At this, Harry serves Lloyd a reproachful look
One of everything
Lloyd
Lloyd looks guilty
Oh, sorry
(beat) Make that two of everything
Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of out of his pocket
He rips one off and tucks it in Barnard's top pocket
(') And here you go, Barney
You keep us happy, we'll keep you happy
The Bell Captain, Barnard, is energized by this tip
Yes, sir
He bows and leaves the room
Then Lloyd cracks open the briefcase and inserts a 76
(proudly) Our first
Signed and dated
: - Helen Swanson is  on her step-daughter's bedroom door
She's holding a tray with a couple of mugs on it
Mary
You awake
(o
s
) '  - Mary is sitting in a chair looking sadly out the French windows when Helen
brought you some tea
thought it might help you relax
Mary smiles
Thank you
She takes a mug, sips, and pulls back
(') Yech
What's in this, whiskey
Uh, sorry
that one's mine
Helen grabs the mug from Mary and hands her the other one
(') Feeling any better, honey
Mary can't take her eyes from the window
Just knowing that Melvin's out there, being held by God knows who
(fighting back tears) It's all my fault
should've been there
77
Bullshit
You can't blame yourself for this
If you'd been there they would've taken you, too
Helen pulls out a joint and torches it up
She takes a hit
Maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing over with
Now Mary, everything that can be done is being done
You've got to stop torturing yourself
What am  supposed to do
Go about my life as if everything were fine
That's exactly what you should do
Get the hell out more, go skiing, socialize
Don't you see, honey
We can't let on that anything is wrong
If the press or authorities get wind of this, the kidnappers might panic
(beat) Who knows what they'd do to poor Melvin then
, : - The Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse
Several   rush to help them
Harry and Lloyd get out wearing    , complete with fur boots,  designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors everywhere
The Employees all grab the shopping bags and then line up as Lloyd    handsomely
-   - The huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies
Lloyd is going through it all
Harry is sitting out on the balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the mountain view
78
Oh god, it's really true
Last night thought  might've been dreaming
It's no dream, Har
We finally cracked the big time
And it was so simple
All it took was somebody else's money
Harry        , takes a hearty puff, and (') You know, Lloyd,  think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today
He blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony
What's the big deal
We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right
Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards
Surfboards
thought those were beginner's skis
This suddenly makes sense to Harry
Ahhh
was wondering why you had those bindings put on them
Lloyd opens a box and holds up a
Where'd this come from
(sheepishly) bought it
What for
79
like the feel of it against my skin
(defensive) mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it
Lloyd inspects it more closely
Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size
Look, leave me alone
'm rich now
'm supposed to have a few eccentricities
There's a  on the door
Enter, parlez vous
The Bell Captain, Barnard,  with a champagne bucket and a newspaper under his arm
brought you your newspaper and some champagne, gentlemen
Unfortunately, we didn't seem to have the, um, label you requested
Lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns
All out of Boone's Farm, huh
You have a rapier wit, sir
took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: Dom Perignon
Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh
Lloyd smiles and over tips him
Thank you so much, sir
He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads for the door
80
Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense with the 'sir' crap
Let's     face it, Barney, we're all from the     same mold
(winks) We just have a little more     dough than you right now
Barnard smiles and
Harry comes back in the room
He picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger, sending out a resonant
Cocktail hour has commenced
He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins thumbing through the newspaper
(') Hey, later on what do you say we
He notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something he's found in the paper
(') Lloyd
you okay
(dumbstruck) Harry, it's her
Who
Mary with the briefcase
This is her
He shoves the newspaper at Harry
- it reads: ; '
Underneath this is a photograph of Mary with her parents

-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed
-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers
The lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both guys' hair in curlers
-Lloyd's getting shaved by an  with a straight-razor
Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck as if he's been nicked
from between his fingers
The other  stare in horror at this
Lloyd and shows everyone a    hidden in his hand
Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing
-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped
to the floor to reveal a -Then a   shot of a  next to them getting a pedicure to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard Hughes
Sparks are flying as an  wearing safety goggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric sander

He pulls a hundred dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and in her ear
She smiles
-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back
-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery
Harry comes out of the dressing room in a very elegant
He couldn't look any more suave
The  nods, impressed, but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in
-Harry reappears in another stylish
The Salesman looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves
-This time Harry comes out in a -- - , complete with
The Salesman looks sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up
from the haberdashery - an apprehensive Shay is sitting in a parked car, : 82
- Throngs of  in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering the building
Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and Lloyd
Harry's wearing his blue tuxedo
Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange
('
) When the hearse stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred dollars
Thanks for the lift, Barney
Nicholas Andre is greeting people at the door
However, when Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them the once over
Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner
Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug
Then Lloyd takes out a    and peels off  , much to the amazement of Andre
This should cover a couple plates
'm kind of hungry, Lloyd
What if we want seconds
Lloyd thinks about this
Then he peels off another thou
Put us down for four plates, my good man
They  the party
As Andre watches them go, his associate Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face
() Jesus Christ, boss
it's them
- the guys make their way through the affluent crowd
'm getting nervous, Harry
83
relax, Lloyd
These people are just like you and me
What are you talking about
They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated
So what
We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound
He points out a busty   entering the party
Lloyd rolls his eyes
Don't do this to me, Harry
'm already a wreck
What if Mary oesn't like me
Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup
little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence
The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they make their way to the bar
(to ) Two martinis, straight up
As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away
(') Shut up, Harry
didn't say anything
Yeah, well  know what you were gonna say and 'm telling you to shut up in advance
How do you know what  was gonna say
84
read you like a book
Okay, if you read me like a book then what was  gonna say
You were gonna say: (in Harry's looped ) 'That's one fiery bush  wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in
' Harry raises his eyebrows,
(') And  would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly
The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o
s
of a glass
The guys turns to see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium
Next to him is a ,
On his other side are Karl and Elizabeth Swanson
If  could have your attention, please
The crowd

As you ,     - founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of endangered species

Tonight, we are deeply honored to have Mr
Karl Swanson welcome our twenty-fourth

The crowd  as Mr
Swanson takes Andre's place at the podium
Ladies and gentlemen,  give you the Icelandic Snow Owl
He pulls the cover off, revealing  , Everyone  and
(') These magnificent specimens were ,   - year, two-million-dollar effort on our part
Together, they constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on the planet

He looks pale
Here these lovely birds will be allowed to breed in a natural but protected habitat
And, God willing, with your help and that of the Society's, we will see these wonderful creatures flourish once more
More
(') Again, thank you, and enjoy your evening
Oh, and feel free to take a closer look at our new friends here
Enjoy
The crowd  and begins to mingle again
Lloyd turns back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass
Two more, please
Harry stares at Lloyd with concern
Lloyd, 've never seen you this uptight
You've gotta chill out
can't help it
This is a very important night for me
() 86
(') (beat) Harry, have you ever wondered why you and  never have long-term girlfriends
What are you talking about
went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks
That was a fluke
(beat) The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: We're afraid of the  word
That's crazy
We live for the  word
'm talking bout commitment
(beat) Oh
Well 'm ready for commitment, Harry
The first time  laid eyes on Mary Swanson,  knew she was the one
(beat) Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin
This girl makes me feel it all in the heart
Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room
- ' spectacular black cocktail dress
Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar
(') Oh shit, there she is
87
(checking her out) Wow
You weren't kidding, Lloyd
She's an angel
(beat) Well, what are you waiting for
Get over there and talk to her
She's gonna think 'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far came just to see her
You have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you
And then what
She'll take it back and that'll be it
'm a nobody
Harry thinks about this a moment
Look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl
Don't quit on the last fifty feet
(brightening) Wait a second,  have an idea
You go over and introduce yourself
That way you can build me up so when come along  won't have to brag about myself
Tell her 'm good-looking and 'm rich and  have a rapist's wit
can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd she's got eyes
Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini
Please Harry, 'm appealing to you as one loser to another
Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over
Please
Harry
88
All right
But you're gonna owe me a big one for this
Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls
(') Nice set of hooters you got there
Mary turns to Harry, stunned
beg your pardon
The owls
They're beautiful
Oh
Yeah
(beat) Are you a bird lover
Well,  used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson
She smiles at this
Thanks
love dogs, too
So how are you involved with them
Oh, 've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; 've even bred them
Really
Any unusual breeding
Nah, mostly just doggie-style
But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu
Really
That's weird
Yeah
We called it a Bullshit
(breaks out ) Just a little breeder joke
89
She seems strangely charmed by this
(') Anyway, the real reason  came over is because  want to introduce you to a friend of mine
Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches
She's holding a martini and looking a little sloshed
Mary,  don't believe 've met your friend
Actually, we haven't been introduced yet
(holds out hand) 'm Mary Swanson, and this is my stepmother, Helen
Harry Dunne
Pleasure meeting you both
saw you come in earlier, Mr
Dunne
was hoping we'd get a chance to meet
(taken aback) You were
That tuxedo  love a man with a sense of humor
So does Mary
Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry
Really
For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages to snap out of it
(') Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr
Dunne
Because believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with
Whuh
Helen, you're embarrassing me
90
Well you are, aren't you
(to Harry) Poor girl doesn't get out enough
So what do you say, Harry
Are you available
Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a hopeful Lloyd
Oh,  don't know
You see, my friend your friends for one day
You and Mary will have a ball
Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer
(') Um
well
don't know
You see, the thing is
sure
- he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns
How come you didn't call me over
Relax, you're golden
got you a ate with her tomorrow
Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest
He's Wha
you
it's
(smiles) love you, man
love you
Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a
Okay, get a grip, Lloyd
You're making a scene
Lloyd steps back elated
This calls for a toast
He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it
91
(') You're gonna be my best man, Har, mean it
It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal
Suddenly the - In quick succession we hear a

falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage
- , Owls    , its species now one bird closer to extinction
Harry and Lloyd look on in horror
Harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar
(under breath) think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd
The guys    and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for Nicholas Andre, that is; we  to show that he's been standing nearby watching their every move
And he doesn't look very happy
: - Nicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand while
Shay looks on nervously
Maybe it was just a coincidence
Don't be stupid
It's a message, plain and simple: We killed their bird, now they killed ours
92
But how could anybody off a bird with a cork
These guys arent' just anybody
They're good
Look what they did to Mental
He was the best, and yet he fell right into their web
But the bastards already got our money
What the hell more could they want
Andre runs his fingers through his hair
(at wit's end) don't know, god damn it
: -   - jubilant Lloyd is fixing his hair in the mirror
In the b
g
, Harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a pair of thermal tights
Mrs
Christmas
Mary Christmas
Mrs
Mary Christmas
You know, it has kind of a ring to it, oesn't it, Har
Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little
mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type
Impossible
know my type    when see it
Now let me get this    straight, she wants me to meet her at    the Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main Street
That's what she said
Ten o'clock sharp
This is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up
93
Time out
Where are going ressed like that
, uh, thought while you were making your love connection 'd try my luck on the slopes
You mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights
These aren't tights
They're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers
But you can see the outline of your who-who
Harry looks down at his crotch
Really
Turn sideways
Harry turns his profile against the window
(') Actually, it's just a tiny little lump
No one will ever notice
You're right
can't go out dressed like this
: - of the building
People are putting their boots on and their skis are lined up on the wall behind them
Mary is waiting by the fireplace in an incredibly sexy snowsuit
94
Suddenly Harry appears in the room, dressed ridiculously
As he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward Mary, we see that he
He kicks over a row of skis and gets glares from all sides
Finally he reaches her,
Sorry 'm late
It's a bitch driving a clutch with these things
- Harry and Mary are at the front of the lift line
The couple ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into position
Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair
The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a smooth pick up of Mary, that is
An embarrassed Harry is , having missed the ride
Mary looks back at him, confused
Suddenly he pretends to be stretching
( ) You take the first run alone
'm gonna loosen up down here
: &  - Lloyd  the bar as the  are setting up for the day
'm sorry, we don't open until eleven
This is disconcerting news to Lloyd
'm meeting someone
Mind if  wait at the bar
The Waiter shrugs and Lloyd sits down at the empty bar
: - Harry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top
Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously
Beautiful day, huh, Harry
95
Glorious
Mary takes a
God, it feels so good to get up here
haven't been outdoors much in the last couple of weeks
Why not
(evasive) There's been
family problems on't want to bore you with them
Thanks
He looks mindlessly off in the distance
Then Harry notices a    on the chair lift bar
(') Oh, look
frost
He licks it and his He tugs a few times, but it won't budge
Are you okay
(lisping) Sure
do this all the time
: - As Mary and Harry arrive at the top of the lift, Mary disembarks but Harry stays on
(lisping) See ya at the bottom
Harry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down the hill
: 96
- The chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on it, stuck to the bar
Two   climb on with him
(lisping) Hi
(off their looks) Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you
The two kids just stare at him
: &  - despondent   Lloyd's got a couple of empties in front of him now
The bar   is open and there are a few  sprinkled about
Lloyd   takes a sip of his drink and looks up at the clock on the   wall
It's 12:30
We see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to him
to reveal that it's the Athletic Beauty that Harry had tried to pick up at the truck stop
Hi
Lloyd  a hello
(') Bad day, huh
Lloyd  once more
(') (big smile) well don't worry, Mercury's supposed to be coming out or retrograde tonight
Things will get better

She looks around the outdoor patio for Harry
She spots something and does a - 97

Anyway, after my boyfriend backed into my garage for the third time, said to myself, 'Run, Cathy, run for your life before he kills you both'
Then you know what the klutz does and to be perfectly honest,  on't really care
(beat) Look, 'm sorry, but 'm not very good company today
'll say

Why don't you tell me a little about yourself
Maybe some other time
Lloyd motions for the

Sure
Her family comes in here all the time
Do you know where she lives
Yeah, they got that big place up on Alpine Drive
: - The hearse pulls up to the house and stops
've got to tell you, today was really just what  needed
Thanks a lot, Harry
My pleasure, Mary
She beams and gives him a  on the cheek
99
So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45
Better make it quarter to eight
've got a few things to take care of first
Harry watches, lovestruck, as Mary gets out of the car and walks toward the house

: of Lloyd walking through the hills of Aspen, totally : -   - Lloyd is sitting forlornly on the bed while Harry feigns surprise at what he's just heard
It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd
She told me ten o'clock sharp
Are you sure you went to the right bar
Believe me, it was the right place
() don't know, Har, maybe she just had second thoughts
have a hard time believing that, Lloyd
The girl said she couldn't wait to see you again
Harry paces back and forth when suddenly 100
(') Wait a minute
What
It just occurred to me
She must've meant ten o'clock at night
(brightening) Do ya think
Of course
Why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning
(shrugging) just figured she was a raging alcoholic
Harry     at their stupidity
Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties
knew there was an explanation
And here  thought she was standing me up
That'll teach you to jump to conclusions
(beat) Anyway, since you have your night all planned,  think 'll run out and catch a flick
As Harry walks into the closet to change, Lloyd clenches his fist and glares after him
Then he regains his composure and moves to the bar
Will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out
101
(o
s
) Sure thing, pal
Whatever you think will help your chances
Lloyd    at this
He fills two mugs with coffee and throws a splash of Bailey's in each
He check to make sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a -
,    - take
Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you
Uh
it's for mature audiences on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door
see
Lloyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax
Then he lifts his own glass

Harry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway
Mmmmm

Suddenly we hear a , He reacts and rubs his stomach
102
- The hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out
He's walking up the steps to the house when we hear more from his stomach
Harry stops in his tracks, gets his insides under control, and continues to the front porch, where he  the bell
Mary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings
Hi
Come on in
Harry follows her inside
Make yourself at home
'm almost ready
Just give me one more minute
As she disappears down a hallway, we hear Harry's again
He notices a bathroom off the hallway and rushes inside
Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and nestles onto the throne
He lets out a    as he does his business, then leans over and to air the room out
He's still glued to the toilet when he hears a  on the door
(o
s
) Are you in there, Harry
(nervously) Be right out
(o
s
) hope you're not using the toilet
It's broken

Huh

Um, no,  was just
shaving
confused Mary is standing outside the bathroom door
Shaving
(o
s
) Yeah
was running a little late
Thought this would save time
Okay
Well 'll be in the living room whenever you're ready
Harry's got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the toilet tank
He starts tinkering with a few valves
(under breath) Come on, flush, you bastard

She looks at her watch, then flips on the

We see Billy the blind boy from apartment 4- sitting in his wheelchair, holding up Petey the parakeet with its head Scotch taped on its body
thought he was real quiet
104
The Reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial
Mary  at this and turns off the television
Suddenly the
She gets up and opens the front door
- a dapper Lloyd is standing there in his new Aspen- chic clothes
Yes
Hi
(beat) Don't you remember me
Um
'm not really
South Bend
drove you to the airport last week
(dawning on her) Oh my god
Lloyd, right
Lloyd is thrilled at this
You remembered
What are you doing in Aspen
brought you your briefcase You left it at the airport so  picked it up for you
Mary's
You're the one who took my briefcase
Yeah, it's back at my hotel room
Come on, let's take a ride
'll give it to you
Mary is torn between getting her briefcase and waiting for Harry
Wait right here
105
She goes to the bathroom door
Inside we hear the of metal against metal
(') Harry, what are you doing in there
Harry's got the eintire toilet completely  now
Various pieces of the commode litter the floor, including the big plastic float ball
He's on his knees tinkering with some pipes coming out of the wall
Uh
just cleaning my teeth
Give me a minute, Mary, 'll be right with you
(o
s
) Sorry, but something important's come up and  have to run out
It's sort of an emergency
'll explain later
But Mary -- (o
s
) --'m really sorry, Harry
promise we'll do this another time
Harry hears her  echo down the hallway and then the front
Harry slumps against the sink, defeated
Great
: '  - Lloyd is in the passenger seat, wearing a subtle, An anxious looking Mary is at the wheel
- The Jaguar pulls up in front of the hotel
As Lloyd and Mary get out, we   to reveal that they were being followed by Nicholas Andre and
Shay in a Mercedes
106
' Andre pulls a  from beneath his seat and slips it into his coat
They're mine
The door opens and Lloyd and Mary
So anyway, as soon as  got to town  tried to look you up but idn't know your last name
He leads her to the closed  which is sitting on the bed
don't believe it
You really have it
'Course  have it
When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has to o
Mary looks at Lloyd and smiles
This is incredible
You mean to say you drove two thousand miles just for me
Well
no
mean, you know, there were other reasons
(beat) Actually, yeah,  guess  did
She can't believe her ears
That is the sweetest thing 've ever heard
107
He drops his head and Mary leans over and kisses him on the cheek
: - sullen Harry is driving back to the hotel
( to himself) It's all Kharma, Harry
You screw your best friend over and it's gonna come back to haunt you, plain and simple
: '  - he's starry-eyed in love as he spills his guts
Look, Mary,  know this may seem a little sudden but 've given it a lot of thought: You're the woman 've been waiting for my whole life, and 'm not ashamed to admit it -- (holds up his hand) --Please, let me finish
( ) 'm crazy about you
've never felt this way about anyone
You make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires
( ) Listen to me,  feel like a schoolboy again
(beat) schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet, sweet love to you
Suddenly we hear
that Lloyd has been talking to an The bathroom oor opens and Mary comes out
She looks around, expecting to see someone else
Oh
thought  heard you talking to someone
108
Lloyd is flustered
He swallows hard
It's the moment of truth
Mary
( ) desperately want to make love to a schoolboy
(taken aback) Maybe  should be going now
No, that's not what Imeant
meant
really like you, Mary
like you a lot
She smiles at this
(') 'm gonna ask you something flat out and  want you to answer me honestly: What do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy like me ending up together
Mary is obviously thrown by this question
Lloyd, that's difficult to say mean we hardly -- -- asked you to be honest, Mary
But Lloyd,  really can't -- --Come    on, give it to me straight rove a    long way to see you, the least you can    do is level with me
What are my    chances
Not good
You mean not good, like one out of a hundred
109
'd say more like one out of a million
(Duh) So you're telling me there's a chance
Just then, there's a  at the door
When Lloyd opens it, he's face to face with Nicholas Andre
Nicholas
what are you doing here
've been looking for you, Mary
've got some interesting news about your husband
Lloyd looks at MAry, devastated
Husband
Aren't you two going to invite me in
Lloyd and Mary hear a  and turn to see Andre at them
Andre steps into the room, and we : -  - As Harry mopes through the lobby, we hear someone  : ' (o
s
) Hey
Harry turns to see the Athletic Beauty approaching
You
What are you doing here
: Nicholas Andre has his gun pointed at a stunned Lloyd and Mary
110
Well at least you two got to say your goodbyes
Who are you
Don't play dumb with me, asshole
'm the rightful ower of that briefcase you've been carrying
Uh-oh
Mary can't believe what's happening
Nicholas, you
you motherfucker
My family trusted you
Shut up
Uh, sir, about the briefcase,  want you to know, my friend Harry and have every intention of reimbursing you
Andre looks alarmed
He motions Mary to the briefcase with his gun
Open that damn thing
Mary opens the briefcase and a pile of , - fall out along with a few packets of hundreds
(') What the hell's this
Where's all the money
That's as good as money, sir
Those are our IOUs
You can add them up yourself
Every penny's accounted for
Andre looks like his head is about to  in anger
You're fucking dead
111
Now don't do anything hasty, man
: Harry gets out of the elevator and lets himself into the Presidential Suite
Harry  looking contrite and  : Lloyd, are you home
We've gotta talk, man
have a serious confession to make
Harry comes around the corner and
- Lloyd and Mary are lying on the bed, their arms handcuffed to the bedpost
(') Oh good, you found her
'll just leave you two kids alone
Harry turns to go, but bumps into the   '
Why don't you stay and join the party
: - Harry is sitting beside Lloyd and Mary on the bed
Nicholas Andre keeps his gun trained on them while he  on the phone: want a one-way ticket to Rio De Janerio departing as soon as possible
- Harry and Lloyd can't look each other in the eye
You mean you two know each other
112
(cutting) Yeah, we used to be best friends
Until he turned into a backstabber
Me a backstabber
You got a lot of nerve
saw her first
Hey,  couldn't help it if she found me irresistable
Mary    at this
But you knew how crazy  was about her
Yeah, and you knew how crazy  was about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't stop you, did it
(waning righteousness) What are you talking about
Don't deny it, Lloyd
Fraida told me the whole sordid story
Lloyd can't muster a defense
Look
was gonna tell you about that
It was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will
swear, you can ask my lawyer
Harry glares at him
Well  guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we
You said it, pal
Maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were
113
Guess not
mean, if one beautiful girl   could rip us apart like this, then   it seems our friendship isn't worth a   damn
(beat) Maybe we should call it quits   right here
Just tell me where to sign, bud
Suddenly they hear the metallic - Okay, which one of you losers wants to die first
The guys exchange a look and
wouldn't pull that trigger if were you
Why not
It'll look like just another Aspen love triangle
You caught the two of them in bed, handcuffed them to the post, murdered them, and killed yourself
(smug) Except you're forgetting one minor etail
What's that
Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful
If you kill us, you'd be killing yourself
(puzzled) Huh
114
You see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being
In other words,  am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened idiot -- --Shut up
Mary sees that they're in deep shit now
What about my husband
Did you kill him, too
Husband
What husband
Mary's married, Harry
No need to worry about Melvin
(beat) Now this is the last time 'll ask: Who wants to die first
Harry gestures with his head at Mary
Kill her
The bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport
It would've saved us a lot of trouble
Andre points the gun at Mary
No, 'll go first, Harry
was the one who got you into this mess
Andre points the gun at Lloyd
No, wait, do me first
'm the one who stole your girl, Lloyd
eserve it
115
Andre  and points the gun at Harry
Then, as Mary and Lloyd look on in horror, he
Harry grabs his stomach and falls off the bed to the floor
Jesus Christ
You killed my best friend, you bastard
Andre smiles
If it's any consolation, you're about to be reunited
He aims the gun at Lloyd,
Suddenly, a and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand
- Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol at the stunned Nicholas Andre
Harry
You're alive
Just them, the door   and storm in with their weapons drawn
#1 Get your hands up, asshole
Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air
stunned Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head
He reluctantly raises his hands
Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted by the turn of events
There's a sudden commotion in the room
Pushing her way through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty
She flashes an
Special Officer Kathryn Frick
Federal Bureau of Investigation
(dumbstruck) You gotta be kidding
Good work, Harry
Lloyd looks to his friend, confused
Harry opens his shirt, revealing a -
116
She grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up
They slapped this on me and gave me a gun
(to Athletic Beauty) But how did you
We've been following   you two all the way from Providence
Mr
and Mrs
Swanson had a homing   device plated in the briefcase
The guys glance guiltily at one another
Yeah, about that dough
Every bill was counterfeit and marked
Harry and Lloyd
: - There's a swarm of  as Andre and
Shay are hustled into a police car and driven away
While Mary to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly
She's something, ain't she, Har
You were right, Lloyd
She was efinitely worth the trip
Guess we have to admit it, she was too good for us
Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out
Oh god, baby,  missed you
Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as   climbs out of the car
Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys
117
(') can't thank you enough, fellas
It was so darn dank in that well, really thought it would be the death of me
Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond
They look at each other, and we : -   - Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid
- The guys  the hotel and approach the Bell Captain, Barnard
Hey, Barney
Yes, gentlemen
Look, we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay
And we're, um, sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony
Don't worry about it, gentlemen
The Swanson family has promised to reimburse everyone
This seems to please Lloyd and Harry
The hearse is delivered to the front door
Well, anyway, thanks again for everything
They turn to go, but Barnard   : Where are you two headed
118
dunno
'm sure we'll find a trailer camp somewhere to call home
Why not right here
Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused
This joint is a little out of our budget, Barney
(smiling) Oh,  think we might be able to find you a free room somewhere -- after all, like you once told me, we're all from the same mold
(winks) You just don't have any dough right now
The guys are  by Barnard's generous offer
Are you on the level
Absolutely
We'll just slide you into one of the employee rooms
The guys beam at this
(') Provided, of course, you don't mind working one or two afternoons a week
Harry and Lloyd lock eyes
Then: You know what, Barney,  think we'll take out chances down the road
Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their hearse and drive off
- As the hearse drives down the road, we hear
: 119
