"Three Kings", shooting draft, by David  Russell a screenplay by David
Russell Story by John Ridley and David
Russell Draft Date: 6/22/98 : - of wide open desert, flat grey sky
is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the distance
There are
sounds: ' ,
Hear a 's
The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders in the  of the , running
This is , Sargeant,
Army, 25 years old
On his helmet is a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby
Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an stands
Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares at the figure on the berm
The Iraqi flutters a white flag over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun
Troy turns around, we see his face for the first time
Are we shooting people, or what
#1 (
) Are we shooting
That's what 'm asking you
#1 (
) What's the answer
don't know the answer
That's what 'm trying to find out
40 yards away --   -- #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth
put out their hands and get pieces of gum
100 yards away --   --  #2 stands with his head tilted back while  #3 looks into his eye
#3 It looks like a grain of sand, but don't know how 'm gonna get it out-- , 37, crab-like, is in the far distance
If they surrender, don't shoot, if they don't surrender, then shoot
Troy, faces the , , scared, then turns back to the dune and runs a few yards
Stops and stares, raises his rifle
He aims at the figure on the horizon
The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs
Hear Troy's breathing, loud, as he pulls trigger slowly
Slow motion  sound
Silent pause
The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck explodes like a sack of blood
Silent, except for sound of Troy's   as he walks toward the big berm, and up to the crest
All we hear are his footsteps and breathing
#3 (
) That guy just shot a towel head
#4 (
) Bullshit
lies on the ground
piece of his neck is blown away
He is rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other
He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him
-
, ,
- , covered in blood and placenta, is pulled from between the legs of Troy's , holds the   aloft, proud and happy
(
) (deep southern accent) Congratulations, you got yourself a rag head, my man
-  () The rasping Iraqi dies
, 18 or 20, wiry, intense, deep south, wearing Army issue glasses, out of breath
Dag
Troy turns, upset, murmurs " Get Around" by the Beach Boys
"Gettin' bugged drivin' up and down the same old strip, gotta find a new place where the kids are hip,  get around --" #1 didn't think 'd see anyone get shot over here
It looked like the guy's head blew three feet into the air -- The Iraqi's head pops three feet into the air
#1 Bullshit, that's not what happened
said it looked like that happened, but then we got here and he was still breathing
#2 Oh, my God, it's just like 'Predator,' where the guy, the black guy -- #3 Carl Weathers
His arm gets shot off
And when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on firing
'' Carl Weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing
#5 Take my picture
Do you still want to sell pictures
(distracted monotone) For twenty
#5 Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life
You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war
War's been over five days, Jim, ain't gonna be much more of this
#5 Bobby, take my picture
He holds the camera out
#4 If he shot the guy, it's up to him
#5 It's not like he shot a fucking deer
It's the enemy
Troy's enemy, yours for twenty
Soldiers get their cash out, Troy takes it
Accept no substitute, this is the real thing, oh, Jesus [winces] -- What's wrong
got a really bad headache all of a sudden-- #7 bends next to the corpse and holds his camera out at arm's length
No free pictures, motherfucker
Vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they roll down the sand berm
" Just Want to Celebrate" by Rare Earth comes on
Troy walks away holding his temple in pain;  gather to stare at the dead Iraqi, getting their cameras out
- dance on a road in the desert
" Just Want to Celebrate" as the    the soldiers
, past bare chested soldiers pumping free weights; jogging in formation; sunbathing on big water storage mattresses;      , past a soldier taking a makeshift foxhole desert bath, past a dead Iraqi on the road, a chopper hovering in the distance, to , as music continues -- (
) Spirits are high and the music is boisterous as these young troops celebrate -- Shit
Let me try that again
the dancing soldiers to see: hundreds of stripped Iraqi soldiers lying face down in undershorts
(
) Spirits are high and the music is fucking motherfucking sand in my eye -- , 45, in white safari jacket over Desert Storm fatigues, cleaning his eye; nearby a cluster of   who are mugging into the camera
, 55, Lieutenant Colonel, Special Forces, wearing sunglasses, talking to , a Special Forces Captain on  with a broken leg
Is that what you got from this experience
goddamn watch
Ees a great fucking watch
Close up: portrait of a sheik on a Rolex
There's 700 million in gold out there and you're fucking around with a watch
Bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of gold, man
One bunker of gold and we retire from this horseshit, Hashy-- Gates
Just a second
The problem, Hash, is how do you find it
Like one sowsan bunker out sair -- Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair, Hash, how do you find Saddam's bullion
Could  have some help over here, for Chrissakes
My goodness, Bill, what seems to be the problem
'm trying to do a story here and the fucking sand is blowing in my face -- You want me to stop the sand can't do anything about that
No, you're too busy talking about the fucking gold, which by the way makes a great story if you'd get me a goddamn lead on it -- think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking,  mean, he's still here beating the shit out of his country
Would you just be my guide and not my fucking producer
You're my guide
, go do your celebration story, Bill
: Rowdy soldiers mug for Smithson's camera
#5 We're number one
#6 Waaaa-hooooo-- You're heroes
#6 We're heroes
#7 Give war a chance
You've exorcised the ghosts of Vietnam with a clear moral imperative -- #5 Is that what we did
Where the hell are you going
Archie is walking off with   a young reporter
'll be right back
don't want you helping other reporters, goddamn it
#1 We kicked ass
#6 We didn't get rid of fucking Saddam -- #8 Which totally sucks a big dick
#6 Those people are getting reemed -- #7 Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man
Who's getting reemed
The Shiites
#8 don't know who they are, man -- #6 We got big firepower but we ain't saving them -- #5 Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait
#1 Weehaaaaaaa
Five soldiers chant Lee Greenwood's anthem, "Proud to Be An American" into Smithson's camera -- () 'If tomorrow all the things were gone that  worked for all my life and  had to start again with just my children and my wife--' , ( ) ''d thank my lucky stars to -- Dissolve to  from chopper - night - of twinkling lights of vast
Army camp below
"Proud to Be An America" blasts
sing off key
'--be livin' here today because the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that awayyyyy --' - "Proud To Be An American"  on as Troy, wearing a checked Arab headdress is paraded on shoulders
He holds up a Coke can in one hand and a Bud can in the other, like torches
(screaming the song) And 'm proud  to be an American, where at least  know 'm free
And  won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me
And 'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt  love this land, God bless the    -- Soldiers scream and go nuts
Beer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths
" Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man" by Public Enemy blasts
, 19, quiet, tall, Southern operates two parallel boom boxes like a
Soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top of another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee
Vig wearing a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements
Soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at Troy
He whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes
Soldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as the music blasts
Two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal
Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Vig screams into Troy's face at point blank range
Rahhhhhhhhh
Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Goddamn it, where the fuck did this beer come from we gotta take more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow
- -     walking in the desert, hands raised above their heads
() Hasnala shi aluno quibaan -- We will not hurt you
Lay down your weapons, get on the ground -- with bad face wounds get medical help
on their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as they disrobe
They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as he holds his -16 on the begging Iraqis
It's cool, no one's gonna hurt you -- Vig whips out his big Thunder 5 pistol and points it in their faces
Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait, Abdul
The Iraqis wail for mercy
Troy pushes Vig's pistol away
You're making them all hysterical
Vig points the big pistol at an    who is the only one not taking his clothes off
Take your fucking rags off, take this off
No comprende English, motherfucker
What is your fucking problem, Conrad
'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off
(leans down) Sir
We need you to disrobe like all the other towel heads,
The Officer does not move, Troy punches his head once
Vig and Walter forcibly pull the Iraqi Officer's pants off
Troy takes out a bottle of aspirin, eats two
Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy
Vig points to the Officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled up piece of paper is sticking out -- There's a document in that guy's ass, Conrad
That's the freaky thing
Do you think he ate it
It wouldn't come out perfect like that if he ate it
Troy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket
Go get it, Private
Hasa man timal
The Officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by Walter as Vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the rolled up, greasy paper from the Officer's ass -- Troy looks disgusted
Open it up
You only gave me one glove
'm sorry  don't have another, but you gotta open it up
That's how the chain of command works
Vig takes out a
Army pen and uses it to unroll the greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand
- is a handwritten map, with scant Arabic writing, a few spare roads, numbers, and three small boxes
What the hell is that
Important enough to squeeze your cheeks for
- In the half-light of dozens of  monitors playing Iraqi news from around the world, Archie Gates madly humps on a lawn chair which is slamming into the monitors
You are a trained warrior, trained warrior, trained warrior, Jesus Christ, Colonel
monitors crash to the floor as she climaxes
Archie lays on the floor catching his breath, stares at a sideways monitor of soldiers celebrating; she stands, dresses
(breathless) What's Bill got
Just the celebration story
That's it
That's it -- How about you
Did you find anything
It could be another bullshit lead but  need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold -- Who's the guy
Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company -- Barlow
Got a map out of a prisoner's head
Out of a prisoner's head
Or his ear, or his ass, or his dick, and they got like a fifty page full-color mini atlas of Saddam's bunkers -- Out of a guy's dick
The door explodes open and two MPs grab Archie, pants around his ankles, and drag him from the truck
- Archie is faced by an     ( ), a     ( )
This is not the way we service the media, Major
Stop her -- Cathy runs away as she dresses, MPs grab her
You are in violation of code 37D, grinding Major Gates
They let her go
Soldiers in gas suits laugh
You guys have no manners whatsoever -- Bill Smithson runs up, agitated
told you he was with her -- We're handling this,
The  pushes Smithson away
wanted help with the gold story, and he took off on me-- That's a lot of bullshit
Smithson is walked away
Archie pulls his pants up
give you a prestige job in the media war of the century and the guy feels neglected
'm helping him plenty with his big celebration feature -- Where did you get this fucking star
Archie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of General Horn's collar, with its one star
They made me a general, pal
For what
don't even know what we did over here, but Schwartzkopf gets a book deal, you get a star, Powell gets to be fucking president-- Are you high
This is a huge win for us
Running the press pool's a real big win for me
You want us to kill more Americans to occupy Iraq
'm just saying it's ironic, that's all
What the fuck is ironic
We got the biggest army in the world here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that's how the world works  guess
Just take care of Smithson and maybe he'll hook you up to consult on movies
It's either that or be a security guard when you retire
Fuck you, Ron
'm a general now, you can't say fuck you to me
, sir, but there's another thing 'd like to say, if you don't mind
Go right ahead, Colonel
Archie leans wild-eyed into Horn's face and whispers -- Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn
'  - -- rubbing alcohol is poured over Vig's extended hand by  , 25, stocky, black, no nonsense
You've washed your hands like a thousand times, Conrad
Lord knows what vermin live in the butt of a dune koon
Why do you let this cracker follow you around
He's a good kid
He's a wall-eyed cracker
He's got no high school, man, he's from a group home in Jackson -- don't give a shit if he's from Johannesburg
don't want to hear dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody
Captain uses those terms
The point is, Conrad, 'towel head' and 'camel jockey' are perfectly good substitutes
Exactly
'm sorry, man, it's a little confusing is all
What can  do for your headache
Doc Elgin opens a case full of pill bottles
Got any Vicadan
All gone
How about Caffergot
Excellent
Let's translate my Iraqi ass map
Troy pops the pills, Doc pulls a document from a folder and opens it as he hovers over a table with Troy and Vig
Van Meter's at the big pow wow
We're cool for at least three hours, but keep Walter on the door
Walter stands by the door wearing night vision goggles
Would you take those fucking things off
never got to use night vision
They don't work during the day and stand outside the tent
Doc unfolds a big aerial-photo map of the Iraqi desert, next to the rumpled ass map
These are definitely Saddam's bunkers near Karbala
What's inside
According to Intelligence -- Picasso, Armani, Rolex, Mercedes, Sony you name it --  Kuwait was Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam sacked it
Man, get an awesome stereo system with like ten  speakers  -- Silver Lexus convertible
Lexus doesn't make a convertible
Yes, they do
Infiniti has one coming
You're wrong
You can't get a car home from here anyway
If  get enough Rolexes  could buy one when  got home
One gold Rolex,  get a very fine split level outside Jackson
My one problem, see, is the risk here -- What risk
We already did the risk
signed up last year to bank some computer training-- Tell me about it
Next thing  know 'm sitting here waiting to get hit by a Scud put my life on the line for what purpose 'm not sure, and now the good Lord puts this map in my path -- He could put a land mine in your path if we try to find this place -- You're safe with me
Cuz you have a galactic plutonium forcefield
don't talk about it
But  do have a ring of Jesus fire
You have a ring of Jesus fire
was fire baptized
was baptized in water
'm fire baptized
don't even know what water baptism means
For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't, no explanation will suffice
You can benefit from my Jesus ring if you do right by me, you got that
'   -- right up to Walter
This tent is restricted -- Get the fuck out of my way
May day, may day -- Troy and Doc scramble to put the maps under the table
Good afternoon
He walks up to them
Would this be the proctology tent
Yes, sir,  mean, no, sir
Then maybe it's the urology tent
Captain's at a staff meeting
That's , 'm not looking for a proctologist or a urologist 'm looking for Sargeant Barlow
Archie fixes his gaze on Troy, walks up, reaches under the table, and takes the map, smells his fingers
You're on the path to truth when you smell shit, isn't that what they say
don't recognize you, sir
Are you in this division
He's not in this division
He's Special Forces
Troy and Vig are impressed
He's the guy taking Bill Smithson around
And you would be the Three Wise Men, right, Mappy, Slappy, and Pappy -- He points in order to Doc, Vig, and Troy, who picks up his family photo button
That leaves Cappy outside
Walter, outside the tent, practices blocking positions
Damn
Freeze
Do not pass
Hold it, freeze
Stop
Freeze
His name is Walter
Did you good soldiers present this map to Captain Van Meter
Not yet
Then 'll take it to him
Troy stands and grabs the map
We'll take it to him
Sir
It won't do either of us any good then, will it
He's our commander, sir
We'd have to tell him you took it
Both Troy and Archie hold the map, staring at each other
Everyone is tense
It could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one Eye-raqi to another -- It's a series of bunkers near Karbala
Maybe
Not maybe, definitely
Recon photos match the map
May  look at the goddamn map
Troy lets go
Archie holds the map up to the light
He then pours some of Doc's rubbing alcohol on the map, and holds it to the light again
He puts the map on the table, turns the light off and clicks on an infra-red flashlight he pulls out
completely different map appears in green markings
Dag
That's what makes Rangers badass, we get the best flashlights
They stare at the new map in the infrared glow, captivated
Still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages
bit farther to the west
Seventy-five klicks north
More like 65
Much closer to Karbala
Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal
Of course -- He turns the overhead light back on
-- there could be nothing inside but starving Arabs and stolen watches, but  think it's worth checking out, even if  have to do it with clueless reservists like you
They look at him
mean,  could take the map, but you could talk, it starts to become a pain in the ass for me, so we'll do the gold together
What gold
You don't even know what's inside these bunkers, do you
Rolexes
Rolexes are swell, but 'm talking about Kuwaiti bullion
You mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup
No
Not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup
Gold bricks
5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's market
For one gold brick
'm sure Mr
Hussein has divided his bricks
into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs
Unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs
Dolly: Troy, Doc, Vig stare at Archie
-
- - Troy walks in white shirtsleeves, dark tie, pulling a cart with a salesman's black case on it over a curb
- - Troy kneels at a disassembled photocopier, tools and parts all around him, opens a bag of toner, which spills black dust all over his white shirt - - Doc is a red cap
He lifts suitcases from the trunk of a black Mercedes while a rich white father (mother and two small children behind) tells him to be careful
- Vig fires his pistols with fury at a series of stuffed animals on logs -- blowing the stuffed animals to smithereens
don't really have a day job
What about the risk of taking a Humvee and all that -- We do this shit all the time
What else did you do, sir
In Panama we went sailing in Noriega's boats
Wow
In Vietnam, we got a big gold Buddha, which we unfortunately dropped in a swamp by accident
What about Iraqi soldiers
Let's see
They had the shit bombed out them for two months, they're deserting all over the place, and they've completely surrendered to us
That's a beaten army in every sense of the word
He looks at them
You are now under my command, salute -- They salute him
He straightens Troy's salute
What's the guy's name outside
Walter
Cappy Walter comes in
You will take Bill Smithson on a special mission to find the gold story, but it will be a meaningless ride that lasts all morning and takes him nowhere near Karbala, is that clear
How am  gonna get out of the company
Your captain will be detained by a friend of mine
Is it true you got to take an enemy ear to be Special Forces
No, but if you talk to anybody about this, 'll kill you
Vig smile fades as he looks into Archie's cold stare
-   - Three figures in fatigues crouch low to the ground as they run to a motorcycle and side car
Walter kickstarts the motorcycle
the cameraman sits behind Walter with a video camera
Walter's face is painted beige and brown with camouflage spots, so is Bill Smithson's, as he crouches in the sidecar and dramatically gives Walter the thumb's up
'  - Cathy Daitch stands next to a cameraman filming Van Meter while another man holds a boom over Van Meter's head
How about if  lean on it, like this
Very dashing
Does it look too posed
Would you ever stand like that
Van Meter tries a couple of poses
think  might, Jesus, this feels stupid
You'll get used to it
First question: did you dream as a boy you'd be commanding an infantry company in a desert war
As a boy,  wanted to be either a veterinarian or a sharpshooter -- -   - Bach's Gloria, from Mass in  Minor plays as Pow pow pow, Vig fires his big pistol into the desert
Pull
Troy throws a painted football into the desert
Doc fires the -16 and blows the ball to pieces
Archie drives and moves his hand to the Bach
The convertible Humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a mounted 60 mm machine gun, a Bart Simpson doll on the grill
The Humvee rolls into the vast desert, littered with burned out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no people
Pull
Troy throws another ball, Doc blows it away
Pull
Doc throws a football from the moving Humvee, Troy fires a pistol and misses the ball as it bounces to the desert
gave you a better arc, Doc
What are you talking about
threw the ball in a higher arc that was easier for you to hit
Bullshit
Blacks make better receivers than quarterbacks
Stop speaking right now, Conrad
Warren Moon is an excellent quarterback
The Oilers have gone nowhere behind Warren Moon
Randall Cunningham
Don't get down in the mud with him, Doc
The Eagles will never get to the Superbowl with him
Archie moves his hand to the Bach
Doug Williams took the Redskins to the Superbowl and won,
We can all agree there are many excellent black quarterbacks
Doc throws a ball
Vig fires his giant pistol twice and misses
Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker -- This gun's too heavy to shoot one-handed like a movie star -- Vig fires: blam, blam, bam
The Humvee stops abruptly
Shut the fuck up
They sit in embarrassed silence; the joyous Bach choir plays
No more music
Troy, Doc, and Vig stand spread apart
They wear white anti-gas suits and hold pistols and drink from plastic water bottles
bomb crater is nearby, a wrecked, burned truck to the side, a   meanders
When we pull up to the bunker, the approach is something called violence of action, which is standard in special operations
It means your movement is so fast and decisive that the guards are frozen and we haven't fired a single shot
Troy kicks at something in the sand -- and a decayed human arm springs out, attached to a body with a half-rotted face
Shit
We dropped a lot of bombs out here and we buried some guys alive -- What do you mean
Bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the trenches -- - on the front of a Bradley pushes sand right (
) They had the option to surrender, but they chose to die for their country
five terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the sand rolls over them
Let's rehearse
- They sit in the Humvee and hold their pistols ready
We'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker
We pull up fast, and stop short
Got it
And -- Go
The cow stares as the Humvee pulls up to it fast
Troy and Doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow -- The cow steps back, and explodes
Troy and Doc stand splattered with cow entrails
The cow's head lands with a thud on the hood of the Humvee
Who's hurt
It's all cow,  think
Yeah, it's all cow
He picks cow entrails off himself
They said this was swept for mines
Mines are forever, Doc
They never get all of 'em
(low murmur) 'If you could, help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda --' Archie watches Troy
Did you guys see any action at all
Only night bombing on , except for Troy's supercool shooting that guy in the neck-- Archie takes Vig's   and    and puts them into his pocket
Is sepsis cool
What's sepsis
Infection of the blood
As in septic tank, because that's what happens when a bullet hits you
The lead tears in there -- - Slow motion, a bullet pierces flesh, makes a cavity -- (
) Makes a cavity of dead tissue that closes down in a convulsive motion typical of all gunshot wounds
The cavity fills up with bile and bacteria and you're fucked
Bile fluid fills the cavity
But other than a wound that blinds, paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound 've ever seen is something called tension pneumo thorax -- heard something about that -- Tension pneumo what
bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon
And that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart
Your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time -- kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once told
That's not fatal, they can stop it
If you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an overinflated tire
They look at Archie, scared by this
Can we play the Beach Boys when we go in
The goddamn Beach Boys
'm not ashamed of liking the Beach Boys
It calms me down
Better than Mozart
Bach
-  - ' Get Around' by The Beach Boys  as the Humvee speeds along
big American flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at the back of the Hummer
The Humvee drives fast into the central square of a small village of low, sand-colored stucco buildings and shanties
Vig drives as the Humvee speeds around the town square, zooming past scared Shiites in black robes, a few skinny dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi soldiers
Where's the bunker
It should be right -- He studies the map and points to a decayed green building
There
Vig jerks the wheel right
They drive fast
No -- there
Archie points left
Vig jerks the wheel left, drives straight toward a low cement building with two Iraqi soldiers in front
Iraqi soldiers look scared as the Humvee drives up, like it's going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze
Vig stands and speaks into a megaphone
We are the Army of the United States of America
We are here to protect you
Remain calm
Troy and Doc leap from the Humvee with pistols drawn and their free hands held up in a 'halt' sign
The look stunned as Troy and Doc simply take their machine guns and put the Iraqis face down on the ground
Troy and Doc pull out plastic twist hand-cuffs , as used in urban riots
Archie bounds forward holding up a thick white document
Orders from President Bush, step aside
Troy finishes handcuffing one of the Iraqi soldiers, as a gaunt mother, with a baby in her arms, opens her blouse, revealing her small breasts
Other peasants gather
No milk
Baby milk
Troy looks shocked until Archie suddenly pushes him past the Iraqi mother and to the door of the bunker, which Doc holds
- Five   look disoriented and scared as they hold their hands up in the air
Do not panic
Step outside -- - (into the megaphone) We are here for your protection and safety
Iraqi women and children kiss Vig's feet
The five Iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands raised, and the starved Shiite civilians spit and throw stones at them while ' Get Around' keeps playing
Ya'll be cool now, this is the Marines in charge here
- Archie runs down the narrow stairs of the bunker, followed by Troy and Doc
- Doc lashes an Iraqi's hands behind his back and cuffs him
Troy shoots the door lock with his pistol
Then backs up and gives it a running shoulder
The door doesn't budge
Shit
He holds his shoulder in pain
Archie kicks the door repeatedly
Troy joins him, it finally flies open
Freeze
Troy is embraced by an Iraqi soldier, about 25
am love United States of Freedom
am hate Saddam
Troy tries some karate moves, jerking his elbows to dislodge the Iraqi from the bear hug -- Ya -- ya -- ha -- Doc points his pistol in the Iraqi's face
Let him go
The Iraqi throws his hands in the air
No problem, my friend
Archie goes to a series of   the size of file cabinets, where Doc helps Archie take off his back pack
Archie pulls out a bolt cutter and a pneumatic saw, both attached to a small air tank - and opens the crate, which is filled with hundreds of Kuwaiti passports
You look for the chemical weapon
No
We look for the gold
They use the power tools to open the second crate -- also filled with hundreds of passports
Where's the gold
They move the gold
Archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the Iraqi, who says nothing
Kill him
Not yet
Kill him now
They point their guns
It's a show
Archie holds the map
Where
(points to map) This bunker
'll take you
- , armed with rifles, run from the far side of the square and start shooting
30 rock-throwing Shiite scatter at the gunfire
fall to the ground as they are shot
Ma-Maa
Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone as he points his big unloaded pistol
The soldiers point their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of them look to the side and shout
Ganan azwar
a shiny    three hundred yards out, bearing down fast on the village square
The soldiers open fire on the truck
- The Shiite riding shotgun fires back, as the windshield shatters on the truck
The driver is dead
The other Shiite grabs the wheel
Archie bursts out the front door, followed by Troy and Doc
They freeze as -- The tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet away
An Iraqi soldier fires a grenade-launcher off his shoulder which explodes the container on the back of the truck -- Milk explodes everywhere, gushing around the wheels of the Humvee and the feet of Archie and the others
Shiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk
Other Shiites crowd the Humvee and climb in
Iraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck
Troy and Doc point their guns in the crowd
Move
Out of the way
Archie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee
Hos-pital
She holds a   of 7 with a bandage around his entire chest
Doc pushes her off the Humvee
America help
He grabs Archie
Troy shoves the man off the vehicle
Vig starts the engine
Give them 's
Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army Meal Rations to the crowd -- Vig leans on the horn
The friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it starts to pull away
Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out, and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites
Archie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away
- Raging oil fires, 50 feet high -- billowing black smoke
Walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke
Paco the Cameraman sits on back
Bill Smithson sits in the sidecar
This is boring,  already did this damn story, goddamn it, where the hell is the gold
How about rare pelican migration out by the marshes
What
These brave pelicans are migrating in spite of massive pollution -- Fuck that
Stop the bike
Walter keeps driving
- Doc gets out of the stopped Humvee, shaken, and walks around
'm all right, 'm cool
He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest
Archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset
What is the art of war, because it is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few --  am burning up in this goddamn suit -- He angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat-drenched green -shirt underneath
Troy and Vig guzzle water
Discriminating use of violence as a last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that's what learned, that's what 'm good at
But now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks  and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people
The others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits
(agitated) don't even know what happened back there
Civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us -- They already surrendered to us
Now they're after Shiites
What exactly is a Shiite
They make up the ethnic majority but they don't have any power
When Bush pulled us out, he told them to start a civil war to bring Saddam down, and now they're getting wasted
(totally puzzled) The civil war
How could it be the civil war
-  : Vig looks puzzled
It's a war inside the same country, Conrad
That's a civil war
Archie chucks each of them   without name tags which everyone puts on, except Troy
Put these on, we are now
Marines
can't do this,
Because 've got a family and if  shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz  got shot after the war's already over that would be pretty fucking stupid, wouldn't it
What is the most important thing in life
What the fuck are you talking about
What is it
Did you hear anything  said
Respect is the most important
Too dependent on other people
Money
Comes and goes, man
What is this bullshit
What's the most important thing
Necessity
That's what dictates what will happen at any given time in life
Necessity says we don't spend American lives taking out Saddam,  which leaves Saddam the necessity of taking out the Shiites so he can stay in power, which leaves us to take the gold
We could've been shot
Did you notice they didn't touch us
We decimated their entire country
They're scared shitless of us
[looks at his watch] There's time to try another bunker
say we go
Let's do it
Rock and roll
And 'll be wearing fashionable kevlar
As a necessity
He pulls a vest out of the Humvee
The motorcycle is stopped by the marsh
Siberian pelicans fly all around
Many lie dead on the ground
Bill Smithson paces with a cell phone
(on cell phone) 'm at some goddamn marsh, all we've seen are Russian cranes
Pelicans
(on the cell phone) think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, Al
Let's grow some balls and do the Shiite uprising, for Christ's sake
Bill Smithson closes the cell phone
We're going north to do the Shiites
thought the gold was the hot spot
Karbala's the new hotspot, and 'm driving
Military regulations, you cannot drive
Smithson mounts the bike
The cameraman sits on back
Walter points his pistol at Smithson
Get off the vehicle, sir
Smithson starts the bike
Don't make me shoot you, sir
The bike pulls out, leaving him behind
He runs after the bike and jumps into the side car
- Captain Van Meter strolls, handling an -16
The -16 is the basic weapon of the infantry
During Vietnam, it was fully automatic
(
) Doug
Yes, General
What the fuck are you doing
Well, 'm giving an interview to Do you have authorization
Van Meter pulls out a folded paper and gives it to the general, who looks at it
No
No
Who gave you this
Major Gates
Archie Gates gave you this
Jesus Christ, Doug, come with me
don't get to do the interview
No, you don't get to do the interview
- Faster
Bach's 'Gloria' plays loud as Vig drives and Archie stares straight ahead as the Humvee picks up speed
- The Hummer zips into a bigger village piazza with an old fortress at one end, and races straight to the entrance to an underground bunker in the middle of the piazza
(into the megaphone) United States Marine Corps
Put your weapons down
Troy and Doc leap out, hold pistols out at arm's length as they accost    pointing rifles at them
Drop your weapon
Put it down
Troy and Doc shove the two Iraqis face down in the dirt and cuff their hands behind their backs
Don't make me smoke your ass, Abdul
- Archie runs down a narrow cement corridor, pistol held at arm's length, white document in the other hand; followed by Troy and Doc, pistols drawn
An   steps into the corridor at the far end, sees Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back
Archie and Troy run right past the scared Iraqi
Doc comes third, slamming the Iraqi face down and cuffing him
Archie kicks a door open and goes in, followed by Troy
,    - Archie and Troy burst in, pointing their guns aggressively
Freeze
large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new appliances: blenders, cuisinarts,  players, small TVs huge portrait of Saddam Hussein covers one wall
television plays a rerun of 'Happy Days' in Arabic
Another : 's first reports of the Rodney King beating
An   sits in a chair in front of the TVs
sit loading rifles
Two others sit at a radio
They all jump to their feet when Archie bursts in, except for the officer watching 'Happy Days' and
By order of the cease-fire signed in Safwan, March 3, the United States Marines hereby confiscate all material stolen by Iraq from the Emirate of Kuwait -- One of the rifle-loading Iraqis tries to run
Troy heads him off with his pistol -- Down
The other rifle-loader stands looking scared
- Isnam panan fatwa aznir -- Doc, who turns the shortwave radio off, pushes the   to the ground
One goes peacefully, the other resists; Doc smacks him in the side of the head with his pistol, which fires accidentally
Everyone grabs their heads and ducks -- except Archie
Never hit anyone with your pistol, Doc
Sorry about that
Archie is offered a cuisinart by the Iraqi Captain
For wife
've been divorced three times
Troy has one rifle Iraqi on the ground, but the second is on his knees, putting a  into a mini-stereo
#2 Newest and best
No, newest and best has better noise reduction
The Iraqi looks puzzled
Less distortion
Get down on the floor,
He pushes the man face down, cuffs his hands
Olivia Newton- John's " Wanna Get Physical"
This is bad music, understand
It's bad for you
(
) Hey -- the resistant Iraqi struggles to break away and Doc punches him in the head twice, the Iraqi starts crying
(to Iraqi Captain) Where's the gold, Captain
Tell us so we don't have to kill you
There's another room over here
Troy pointing to a narrow door in a corner of the room
Archie kicks it open
- bound, naked    , clean shaven, sits on the floor in a five foot square shallow metal box, four inches deep, filled with water
There is an electric cable going into the water
The naked Shiite in glasses shakes
Troy watches Archie walk over and yank the cable out
am just do my job, buddy
Archie pauses, then gives the Sargeant a backhand that sends him flying to the corner
Archie steps on the man's wrist, takes the pistol out of his hand
Troy watches
Archie turns and sees   across the room: 3 , 3 , 4
The men and women are bound and
Archie steps toward the Shiites, but the , 35, also a captain, steps in his way
These Shiite
Iraq problem
United States is out now
Archie stares at the  with contempt
We take them outside, so it don't bother you, , sir
Kata fanam
The disarmed Iraqi Sargeant  and opens a small rear door and pushes the Shiites out
Archie walks back to the main room and points his pistol in the Captain's face
Take us to the basement
- Vig keeps the     on the ground at gun point as 15  with crude clubs and sling shots encircle
One of the Shiites shoots a rock from the slingshot and nails a handcuffed Iraqi in the back of the head
Don't start this shit again
The Shiites back away as Vig motions with his big pistol
know ya'll Shiite gettin' yer asses whipped --  Hey, what the hell is going on here
the ten Shiites, and the naked Man with Glasses, who is getting dressed, exiting the side of the bunker, ushered by the unarmed Iraqi Sargeant
Git on the fucking ground, Arab
Prisoner stay
Gabar matan
What the fuck are you talking about
Suddenly a   runs up to the tortured Shiite Man with Glasses and embraces him, sobbing
with dirty casts on both broken arms runs up and hugs his legs
The bound Shiite prisoners start to walk away from the bunker, and the unarmed Sargeant has a fit
Kinam vanir
Vanir
He chases the prisoners, pushes them back
The free Shiites shoot rocks and club him
Goddamn it everybody calm down
- Archie runs down several narrow sets of cement stairs, followed by the Interrogator, the other Iraqi Captain, Troy, and Doc
(  ) It's my ass, donkey dick, Saddam will shoot me dead
Saddam worries more about the Shiite than the gold
- The Shiite crowd curses and spits on the Iraqi soldiers
The Sargeant is beaten
Suddenly an Iraqi armored truck with a mounted machine gun races up and    pour out swinging clubs, followed by an  , about 45
The Iraqi soldiers savagely beat the Shiites
Vig looks horrified as he watches
grab the Woman from the Man With Glasses, and drag her into a circle with three other soldiers; the ten year-old girl with dirty casts on both arms, screams and punches at them
The Man With Glasses is held down at knife point
(into the megaphone) This is the United States Military
The Iraqi Major glances over at Vig, but the soldiers do not stop brutalizing the Shiites -- they round up eight more Shiites and make them lay face down
Troy and Doc disarm   outside a door in the basement
Archie goes through the door, followed by the Iraqi Interrogator and Captain
2 - Bright white cement, many overhead lights and a high ceiling
empty but for 15 brand new, jumbo-sized Louis Vuitton suitcases standing neatly in a row in the center of the room
Archie stands looking at the suitcases with Troy and Doc
Several of the big Vuitton suitcases are laid on their sides by Archie, Troy and Doc
The Iraqi Captain paces frantically punching and kicking the walls and talking ( in )
It's Saddam's gold
Shut up, he signed the treaty
The suitcases are quickly unzipped
One suitcase is full of gleaming antique silverware
One suitcase is full of jewelry
Archie opens one full of hundreds of gold Cartier watches
Troy and Doc slip a handful of jewelry into their pockets
The Iraqi Captain goes nuts, throwing himself on Doc's back, choking Doc, who flails about
Troy punches the Iraqi in the head and rips him off Doc
Archie puts his pistol in the man's face
Listen to me: we leave you alone to kill your Shiites, but everything you took from Kuwait, that belongs to us now, understand
He turns to Doc
Put it back
Why
Stick to the plan
The plan is for gold
Doc and Troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of jewelry
Archie opens another Vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside - it's full of Kuwaiti passports
When Doc opens the next suitcase, he freezes
Archie looks over and freezes
Troy closes cuffs behind the Captain's back and looks over his shoulder -- wide-eyed
The very large Vuitton suitcase is filled with five-kilo bricks of gold
They all stare
Troy picks one up
Is this five kilos
Archie holds another brick
Yeah, that's five kilos
Five, six, seven, eight, there's sixty bricks in this suitcase
Times 50K each -- Three million dollars
Archie opens another large Vuitton suitcase, and it is also filled with sixty bars
Troy opens another suitcase, there's another sixty bars
Doc opens another, another sixty bars
They frantically check all of the suitcases
The handcuffed Captain is crying
Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each
That's thirty million dollars
Archie, Doc and Troy look at each other in shock
With effort, Doc and Troy help Archie pick up the heavy, jumbo-sized suitcase sideways, like a table top
'm gonna get a fleet of Lexus convertibles in different colors
told you Lexus doesn't make a convertible
'll bet you a Lexus they do
, you're on for a Lexus, but it won't be a convertible
Suddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to the floor; one lands on Troy's foot
He jumps in pain
Shit
Archie, Troy, and Doc hoist another suitcase sideways and the bricks rip through and fall to the floor -- They didn't get it here in these bags
The tensilary strength goes to 200 pounds
The what
Tensilary strength, it's what the suitcase can hold
Why would you know that
He works at an airport
60 bars, 13 pounds each is like -- 800 pounds
The smaller Vuittons handle 65
You got any more luggage here
The Interrogator looks at him
- 120 small, round, Vuitton overnight bags, laid out and opened, cover the entire floor of the basement
Troy and Doc finish putting 5 bars in each bag
Archie paces, sweating, speedy like he's on cocaine
It's crazy to take it all, we're not prepared for it
It's crazy not to take it all, how can we leave it
Troy and Doc look nervous
What's the shipping plan
told you that's handled
How is it handled
You have to tell us now
Yeah, tell us now
(pacing) 've got a friend, he's in French Special Forces
He's gonna put it in barrels filled with oil and bury it
In a few weeks, he'll drive it to Yanbu -- Where's Yanbu
It's a port in Saudi
Havichon talks to an   in Lacoste sportswear (
) Where another friend will ship it on a Turkish boat up the Red Sea to Perpignan, where a French boat will take it to Baltimore -- don't know about getting them to Baltimore, but these hat boxes ain't gonna fit in the Humvee
We need a trailer
, 'll call -Haul in Karbala to see what they have on the lot today
See what you can get, Barlow
Troy runs up the stairs
- Troy runs out the front door
Conrad, we need a trailer -- The Iraqi Major stares coldly at Troy
Troy stares at the two soldiers beating Shiites; five others clustered around the woman on the ground
Did you get it
Troy, did you get it
Yeah, we got it
Is it a lot
Yeah, it's a lot
Troy and Vig untangle, with difficulty, an ox cart from a messy pile of old ox carts against a bombed out building
Troy looks troubled -- (under his breath) 'Little deuce coupe with a fiat head mill, she'll walk a Thunderbird like it's standin' still --' is smashed in the face with a club
pulls a heavy chain from the Humvee
'She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored --' The Little Girl with arm casts is screaming while her father, the Man In Glasses, tries to hold her
Troy and Vig quickly chain the ox cart to the Humvee
'She's my little deuce coupe --' Archie, Doc, the Interrogator run up carrying Vuitton cases
- They hurry past the huge poster of Saddam, the TVs playing 'Happy Days' and Rodney King, the many shelves of stereos, etc
, and past the soldiers lying face down, handcuffed
- Archie, Doc, and the Interrogator charge out of the bunker with Vuitton luggage and put it onto the ox cart Troy has rigged
Archie and Doc stop and stare in shock -- Soldiers 6 & 7 drag and beat Shiites; 5 wounded men and women lie on the ground bleeding
cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with a bleeding head
Five soldiers continue to encircle someone (the Shiite woman)
The Man In Glasses and the Little Girl in  as they bow on the ground
Troy and Vig stare back at Archie, looking tense
The Iraqi Major greets the Interrogator warmly and they embrace
Then the Major salutes Archie
You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes
We take the Kuwaiti gold
Yes
Saddam cannot keep
No, Saddam cannot keep
Saddam have too many problem today
He certainly does
Shiites run past throwing rocks at Iraqi soldiers 6 & 7 who tackle and pummel them to the ground
You need help to load
We can do it ourselves
The Major turns and shouts -- Hazal jarat finan
Iraqis 6 & 7 jog over
The soldiers are out of breath
These man help you
You go away fast from this bullshit
Archie looks at one soldier's hands
:  on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists
of the Iraqi soldiers
Let's load up and get out of here
Iraqi Soldiers 6 & 7 carry suitcases up the narrow stairs
- Luggage is loaded into the Humvee and the cart while Troy directs Iraqis 6 & 7; Doc and Vig help
Lay that one flat; , sideways -- This isn't gonna work
Sure it is -- The cart collapses from the weight into a pile of broken wood
The Vuitton bags roll onto the debris-cluttered ground, one goes through a pool of blood
Doc picks the case up
You need a truck
We'll rig two carts
Let's take the truck
We're not taking their truck
Why not
We cooperate with peace accord
Please take truck
Let's take the truck
Archie looks vaguely disgusted
Troy backs the truck up
Vuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck, which is completely full
Archie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee
Vig sits next to him
Archie starts the engine
Iraqi 6 taps on the door of the Humvee by way of saying goodbye
Archie nods
The Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman
Nazaran yafit haisul
Archie watches as Iraqis 6 & 7 walk directly to the circle of soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been raped
They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in an open area and shoot her dead
Troy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away
Doc stares
Archie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman
The Girl in arm casts screams
She is grabbed by the hair and pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses punches him and takes the girl
The soldier chases them with a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally
Archie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers
This has to stop
The Iraqis look at him
The soldier with the knife continues to slash the Man In Glasses
You get your ass kick in a war, it feel good to be strong again
What did you say
You go now, please
He salutes Archie
don't think so
'm sure you know about the Geneva Convention, right
Geneva convention
You bomb my house, man
That Shiite man is leader of uprising
He kill my man
Archie, let's stick to the plan, sir
The plan is for gold, right
We can help them first, then be on our way
No, we can't
It's not what we're here for
How much
What
How much gold do you want to let these people come with us
The Iraqi Major smiles
The Interrogator laughs
Cannot do
What do you mean, cannot do
'm offering you a lot of money
The Iraqi Major continues smiling
Cannot let Shiite go -- Saddam kill us
Saddam kill to me if we let them go,
Now you go
Cover me
Jesus Christ, we can't save everybody
Are you listening
said cover me
Troy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee, and they nervously point their pistols
Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also come forward
To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight prone Shiite prisoners laying face down
Vig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer
No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is that clear
Yes, sir
Because we know what bullets do to vital organs, don't we
Make infected pockets filled with bile, sir
That's right, that's what they do
Troy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl
Archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling the blade away from the man's body
He holds the soldier's wrist up
The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting the Iraqi into a choke hold
The soldier drops the knife in the dirt
The bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground, clutching the Little Girl in arm casts
Troy, Doc, Vig point their guns
The Iraqi Major is pissed
Archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away
Archie helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl, and walks them over to the Humvee
Two Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick them back down
(pissed) is out of Shiite war
The Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down
No shooting
Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc
the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee
Archie winces, but doesn't let go
The Major does it again, smashing Archie's hand
Archie winces, doesn't let go
The Major tries to jerk the barrel up, but Archie pushes it down, and it fires by accident, into the Major's leg
The Major howls with pain
Blood dribbles out the bottom of his pants leg like piss
Troy covers Iraqi 6 with his rifle
What's happening
Accident
Stay cool
Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun from one Iraqi in the rear to another, but doesn't shoot
Iraqi soldiers point their rifles at the Americans
No
Iraqi 6 jerks his rifle toward Archie and fires
The sound cuts out
:   from Iraqi rifle to Archie
The only  is the     of Archie's lower left arm and tearing his muscle as it passes through
Archie grimaces violently in pain

Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest
The dead Iraqi Major lies face down in sand with eyes open; the Interrogator holds his hand and
Archie's lightly blood-flecked face stares down at the dead Major, clouds pass overhead
Dead Iraqi 6 lies with legs twisted under his body
rivulet of blood trickles through the sand
spider runs across it and gets stuck
up at Doc, stone still, staring straight ahead as clouds pass slowly above him in the sky
Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun back and forth
Troy, drenched in sweat, looks pained as he unbuttons his shirt: there's a gunshot in his kevlar vest
The slug drops out of the dent, into his hand -- he exhales
Iraqis 2, 3, 4, and the Sargeant, throw their hands up in surrender and drop their weapons
Big Iraqi 2 walks toward the Humvee in surrender, and bows down
Archie points
Cover these three
Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites
Doc
Doc follows Archie over to the three Iraqi soldiers
Down
The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy
Kazal stan hamir in fatar
Doc takes the Iraqi soldiers' guns and pushes them down
Put the Shiites in the Humvee
There's no room
Make room
What the fuck happened to necessity
It just changed
Not for me
Shiites and Iraqi soldiers watch the debate nervously
Obey the fucking order, Barlow
This is fucked up
Doc points to the Shiites
What if that was you
Troy displays the gunshot in the Kevlar
What if this was you not wearing Kevlar
Suddenly,   of an
They turn
tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street, followed by a truck with a rocket launcher
Great, a fucking tank
That should send us on our way
Grenade launcher, sir
Vig struggles to lift the grenade launcher
No
Let's get out of here
It's about fucking time
Troy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine
Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig
the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee
Doc jumps in
The tank approaches
The Humvee pulls away
The tank rolls in from the side, but the tank turret  and , stuck in place
An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank
Hazal mafan
He gestures to the whining, stuck, turret
Another Iraqi tries pushing the turret
The truck with the small rocket launcher pulls up
/ as it bounces along fast
Archie is in pain while Doc pours disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left arm, and wraps it
Vig looks terrified as he drives
Troy, driving alone, speeds the truck as fast as it will go, bouncing along the road
We were home free, you stupid son of a bitch
the truck is 60 yards behind the Humvee (
) What's the tank doing
through Doc's jiggling binoculars of the tank turning
(
) Lining us up -- Vig pushes the Humvee's accelerator to the floor
The Shiite Man In Glasses and his Little Girl cling to the Humvee as they sit on top of the Vuitton hat cases with eight other Shiites, including    ,
- Two Iraqi soldiers take a  , four feet long, and load a clear plastic canister of brown fluid into it , a soldier is hit in the arm
a Shiite boy with an old rifle in the third floor window of a small stone building
Iraqis shout and point at the sniper
The tank turns to the building
- The Humvee drives fast over the bumpy two-lane road
- The tank fires a round at the building which
- , ,    pray at a crude table when the ceiling collapses
- The Iraqi soldiers fire the rocket launcher
(
) Incoming
- Vig turns the speeding Humvee off the road
Archie jerks the wheel back
Stay on the road
don't wanna get hit
: Doc looks straight up with the binoculars
: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke across the sky
,  : half the Shiites hunch down, bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their necks, looking straight up into the sky
They cower when there is an  above
-  : the   in the sky a hundred yards above the Humvee --
Gas
Troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast
Archie and Doc grapple to put on their gas masks
Vig reaches around behind him for his mask as he drives
Where's my mask
He accidentally veers off the road into the open desert
a field of mines sitting right on top of the sand, 20 yards ahead
[Iraqi mines were often placed this way] Archie's alarmed face Mine
Archie dives from the Humvee followed by Vig, Doc, the Man In Glasses holding the Little Girl, the other Shiites, including the Two Five Year Olds
The Hummer drives ten yards, hits the first mine with an explosion and flies into the air -- Flying debris smashes the windshield
Troy instinctively jerks the wheel and the truck flips onto its side and slides across the sand
The airborne Humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces
Troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked Humvee
wheel on the wrecked Humvee spin in the air, squeaking
Louis Vuitton suitcases are scattered all over
One has opened and the gold bars are spilled around
Shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some limping
They cover their faces with their clothes as the dense brown fog descends around them
Vig's right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess -- he gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down
Archie puts his gas mask on the Little Girl with arm casts
Doc takes his mask off when he sees what Archie has done and gives it to the Shiite Man in Glasses
Doc picks up Vig's glasses and hands them to Vig, who stands, blinking his one good eye, while blood streams down his face
Cover your face, Conrad
Cover your mouth, man
Vig is in shock
Doc lifts Vig's bloody hand to Vig's mouth
Unseen in the fog, Troy climbs out of the overturned truck
He picks up two Vuitton hat cases, looks up, sees the from the Humvee, running across a mine field Hey
Stop
Troy stands watching as the children run farther away, crying
Goddamn it
He runs, hard, after the children, who are now 70 yards away, the Vuitton hat cases banging against his legs
Doc pulls a syringe from a sterile packet, is about to stick it into his leg when Archie grabs his hand
Don't do it, this isn't sarin
We'd be dead by now
Is it mustard
It's
What's that
Tear gas times ten, but it's not lethal
Where's Barlow
don't know
- Troy chases the children through the brown fog, he drops one of the suitcases, catches up to the Girl and scoops her up in his left arm and covers her face with her coat
' as he runs between land mines after the Boy, who is way ahead
Troy drops the other Vuitton bag, catches the Boy and has both children under his arms like footballs -- when suddenly Troy is grabbed from behind with a cord around his neck -- he lands on his back with the two children in his arms
' the Iraqi Interrogator, wearing a gas mask, kicks Troy in the head
The screaming Children are torn from Troy's arms by Iraqi soldiers
Troy reaches for his pistol and it is ripped from his hand as he is dragged to an Iraqi jeep
- Does anybody see Barlow
Archie and Doc circle through the thick haze carrying a Vuitton hat case and cover their mouths and noses
can't even see the truck
About five Shiites wander around, confused
Look out
Archie spins around, drops the bag and points his pistol
pick up Vuitton hat cases
Don't move
Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side
More black cloaked figures appear
There are
Archie, Doc, and Vig look disoriented, point their pistols around as black robes appear and lead the Shiites away
What's going on
The robes lead the Shiites to a 4 in a mound of desert earth and disappear into it
Vig stands and rubs his one good eye
Doc grabs Vig by the arm and pulls him back toward the tunnel
Get in the tunnel
Vig jerks his arm away
Troy
Doc grabs Vig
You're gonna die
Vig punches Doc in the side of the head
Doc punches Vig in the stomach
They fall to the ground, fighting
Archie searches for Troy in the brown haze
Barlow
Two black-robed figures pull Vig off Doc and drag him to the tunnel
Another robed figure pulls Doc to the tunnel
Archie walks, looks for Troy, chokes, vomits into the sand
black robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back to the tunnel, where they disappear inside
- Chaos
People choking and vomiting
The tunnel is 6 feet tall
Buckets are passed, filled with oiled rags that people use to wipe their faces
Archie takes a dripping rag and wipes his eyes, nose, mouth
We have to go back
We can't leave him there
Vig's mutilated right eye is bleeding
We have to wait until it clears
You made the choice and we lost Troy -- had no choice
You had a choice
had no fucking choice
He screams at Vig, who looks scared
can't walk away from a crime like that and take the gold and live my life like nothing happened, and if you can, then hope you die right now
Vig starts crying
Doc hands a bandage to Archie, who puts it over Vig's wounded eye socket
What about Troy
What choice does he have now
the Man In Glasses wipes his daughter's face
- Iraqi soldiers strip Troy's clothes as he stands in front of Oasis Bunker surrounded only by fortress ruins in the desert
The Iraqi Interrogator pulls off his gas mask
Two Iraqi tanks are parked to the side
Small numbers of soldiers and civilians mill about
() Can we shoot him
#2 () We're not even supposed to have American prisoners
() He's proof they broke the cease- fire
The Iraqis turn to look
They're taking the tank
7 Shiites with rifles climb the unmanned Iraqi tank
4 Iraqi soldiers  back at the Shiites
Troy, naked, tries to break away in the chaos
He runs a few feet, is tackled and dragged toward the bunker
Bill Smithson drives the motorcycle up and stops
Start shooting, Paco
don't like this, we gotta go-- Iraqi soldiers pull them off the motorcycle
Hey
Let me handle this
Troy is led, naked, down the corridor by two soldiers

His clothes are thrown on top of him

The door is slammed
Stolen blenders, radios, CDs, stacks of new Levis litter the floor
Troy kicks all the crap angrily and hundreds of cell phones tumble from a box
Troy looks at the pile of cell phones, picks one up, tries it for a dial tone, drops it, tries another, until he gets one that gives him a tone and dials
(
) Jalam nafad
Troy looks stunned
(into the cell phone) Um
Do you speak English
(

) What number, please
Operation Desert Storm
(
) 'm sorry
The big army in the desert, come on, it's an emergency
(
) don't have that number
Maybe you could -- hello
The phone is dead
Fuck
He throws it to the ground, tries another, no dial tone, throws it, tries another, no dial tone, throws it
Come on, come on, come on
He tries another, chucks it, another, gets a dial tone, dials, and waits
Troy dials a number
He waits while the

- Archie, Doc, Vig, and dozens of Shiites crouch as they walk through the tunnel, single file
Dissolve They are still walking in the long tunnel
- Archie climbs out of a small mound in the desert, squints in the light and looks around
strange minaret stretches skyward from the flat desert, 200 yards away
The minaret is made of yellow stone, it twists 150 feet into the air, like a twisting wedding cake
Archie leads the others toward the minaret
No one is around, except for a few black robes
Archie, Doc, and Vig enter the old wooden doorway of the ancient Minaret
- line of   with missing limbs and bandages stand and watch Archie, Doc, and Vig enter
They make eye contact
,   - : the hands of an Iraqi soldier carefully wrap a bare wire around Troy's right ear
(heavy accent) What is your rank, bro
Master sargeant
Your company
Company, infantry, United States Army
The wire is wrapped under Troy's chin around his other ear
My main man
Tell me something, What is problem with Michael Jackson
What do you mean
The King of Pop
''m bad, 'm bad, you know it --' Yeah, Michael Jackson
He is fahking the small boys, man
What are you talking about

Hello with the white glove

No girls
Just the boys
He likes kids
Yeah, he like to fahk them up the ass
Bullshit
Troy is smashed in the face with a clipboard
He looks angry, and like he could cry at the same time
You are the blind bullshit, my main man
It is so obvious he like the small boy so he all the time travel with them
Fine
And if it really true
You say -- say it's sick
That's because you got a sick country, bro, you got no respect for the children
That's why you bomb them over here, right
don't think so
Michael Jackson is Pop King of sick fahking country
Wrong
Troy is smashed in the face with the clip board
Blood drips from his nose
Bullshit wrong, dude
black man make the skin white and the hair straight
You know why
No
Your sick fahking country make the black man hate hisself, just like you hate the Arab and the children you bomb
don't hate children
Do they care, buddy
Does who care
Do your army care about the Shiite children
Do they come to help
No, they're not coming
The Interrogator signals someone
and suddenly voltage races through the wire, causing Troy to gnash his teeth together so hard they chip
He writhes in pain
(in subtitles) That seemed like too much volts
You got to build it up slow
gestures defensively at a console that is connected to the wire around Troy's jaw reaches forward and turns a dial
The   murmurs defensively and turns the dial back
Just figure it out
The Interrogator turns back to Troy
Are they coming to help the Shiite
No
He is jolted again -- his face contorts, he bites his lip
Tell the truth, dudesky
Save us the big bummer
Troy starts to cry, represses it
His lip is bleeding
Does it hurt
Troy says nothing
ask you question, bro
Yes, it hurts
You bomb my family
Do you know that
Troy starts shaking slightly
You blow up my home
The whole street

Those legs cut off now
Emotion comes into the '  as he says this

Yes
He is one years old
He is asleeping with his toy doll when

He lose his daughter same way: big  bomb

She is safe in Ohio without the bombs and concrete and all this shit-- - pushes a baby carriage down an idyllic tree-lined sidewalk
() How old is she
() Ten days old

What makes you decide to tell me about Krystal, my main man
Because we're both fathers
'm not a father no more, dude, remember
My son is dead now
- are laying down, being treated by in black who squeeze aloe onto facial blisters
At the end of the hall, Archie grits his teeth in pain as a uses a turkey baster to shoot alcohol into his infected wound
Archie  in pain
Doc paces, exhaling; he has white ointment on his face
'm
'm cool
'm a survivor
Shiite changes Vig's bloody bandage, while a   is laid next to Vig and wrapped in cloths; two clerics chant
Is that guy dead
Where you gonna put him
shrine
What kind of shrine ya'll got
Shrine that wash 700 year of sin
Hey, that's a pretty good shrine, right, Doc
Doc stares at Vig
'm sorry  hit you, man
was scared for Troy,  don't want nothing to happen to him, he's my friend
Doc
Come on, man,  know you was comin' to help me -- Vig reaches out blindly for Doc's hand
Doc looks for a moment at Vig's hand in the air, reaching, then takes it
They remain silent for a moment, hands clasped
Maybe we got kicked out of the ring of Jesus fire, on account of stealing
That's not how it works
How does it work
take care of what Jesus puts in front of me
That's what we did with the gold
What about now
'm gonna see
Archie walks up, his arm bandaged, and inspects Vig's face
How you doing, Conrad
'm good to go, chief
Let's check the suitcases
Archie, Doc, and Vig check the Vuitton suitcases, opening them, looking at the gold, shutting them
children in bandages watch Archie inventory the gold
We're missing 28
That leaves 92 suitcases, five bars each -- They think
23 million dollars
Not bad for a disaster, provided we can find Barlow, get back before dark and not get busted
He looks at Doc and Vig
It was my choice today
So you can head back if you want
'll find Barlow myself
What about the gold
Take what you can carry
Try to find a vehicle
Bury what you have outside camp
Be careful about it
They look at Archie
want to find Troy
Doc thinks
'm in
, where does that leave us
We don't have any water, we're dehydrated
You got a radio here
The Shiite Man In Glasses puts oils on his Little Girl's face
How is she
The Shiite Man In Glasses does not answer
How -- is -- your -- little girl
Vig wears glasses over his eye bandage; he mimes the Girl
Broken -- arms
Girl
She's traumatized, what the fuck do you expect
They look at him, surprised
went to b-school at Bowling Green
What's b-school
Is that like terrorist training
Business school, Conrad
came back to open a couple of hotels near Karbala
'm almost in the black when Saddam starts this stupid fucking war and you guys bomb the shit out of my cafes
Now we try to get rid of Saddam, Bush leaves us twisting in the wind, Un- be-fucking-lievable man
You got a radio
No radio
No water
He wipes bits of white foam from the corners of his mouth
Where's Barlow
They got him,  saw it happen
And they won't take him back to the same place
Where would they take him
Oasis Bunker
It's full of Saddam's hard core guys
Where's that
Like 17 - 18 klicks from here
Take us there
We got no wheels
We'll walk until we find some
Why don't you call in the Marines
With what
We don't have a radio
, we'll find a vehicle
You drive back to get the choppers, they fly in to get your man
Doc and Vig look at Archie
We can't do that
Why not
You got a huge army here
We're not supposed to be involved with Shiites
We killed Iraqi soldiers
We broke the peace- accord
Tell them it happened when you reclaimed the gold
Don't tell them it was about us
They'd find out, we'd go to jail
You know what  think
think maybe you're boosting the gold
That's what  think
Archie looks at him
You're wrong
They got half a million men in the desert, they send four guys to pick up all this bullion
don't think so
Archie looks at Vig and Doc
We need to find our man
How much do you want to take us there
Fifteen suitcases
That's too much
Give it to him
We've got a lot
We're gonna need it to buy our way back today, so we better spend it wisely
'll give you eight
You need some guns, right
You lost your gear
Yeah, we need some guns
You need some fighters, too mean, you can try to take Oasis on your own, but look at these grunts -- Doc and Vig look pissed
Archie's arm is in pain
Yeah, , we need some fighters
So that's worth more than eight suitcases
Ten
Fifteen
Archie looks at him
That's four million dollars
think we need it more than you, John Doe, don't you
He extends his hand
They shake
Archie Gates
(  ) Imam Katar
'll give you back five suitcases to get us over the Iranian border
What
We gotta get to a refugee camp or we're dead
The camps are in Iran
We can't go to the Iranian border
Then we don't have a deal
Give me a fucking break, man
We saved your life
And we saved yours
We lost a man for you
What good is it if you leave us to get wasted
The big army of democracy beats the ugly dictator, saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you go to jail if you help us escape the same dictator
You saw what happened to my wife
Look at my daughter
Archie looks around
He sees Imam's daughter, other bandaged children looking at him
few mothers
Who's going
Everyone but the priests
That's 55
Fuck it
We'll find this place on our own
It's not on a map
You can look
Somebody else will take us
Doc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up Who will take us to Oasis bunker
Fifty Shiites turn and look at him silently
Doc dumps a whole suitcase of gold bars
Imam translates
Jarat yalam fantam uraz
People stare at the gold and say nothing
don't think so
This is a human life we're talking about
(laughs) Tell me about it
His daughter looks at him and laughs -- until her laughter becomes scary, hysterical and Imam tries to hold her still and she won't stop as Archie, Doc, Vig watch
- -- Head of a golf clubdriver: "Made in
" Interrogator holds the golf club near the head, paces

We got a lot in common, dude got training and guns from America
Not from America
Oh, yeah, specialist guys come to Iraq, train us when we fight Iran
What did they train you in
Weapons, sabotage
Interrogation

The Interrogator lights a Marlboro, exhales
on '  as the smoke envelopes him

'  - Darlene looks up and beams as Troy walks into the room, they embrace on the bed
(
) So what we get from this dirty Iraq war you and me, huh
- holds the naked baby against his naked chest
(whispers) don't know
(laughs) You don't fahking know, right
We all scahmbag soldier who get fahked, right
Right
Interrogator laughs and takes a practice golf swing
So why are you doing this to me
It's my job, man, for Saddam, just like your job when you bomb my house
It's not just a job, it still matters what you do
Bullshit
It's all a job
It still matters what you do, what you're doing right now matters
Bullshit
The art of war is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many with minimum violence, minimum -- Then why you bomb my fahking house and kill my son
Can you think how it feels inside your heart if bomb your daughter
-   - silently destroys Troy's suburban house
Worse than death -- It feels like this -- Holding the driver at the head, he raps the bridge of Troy's nose
Don't -- Everyday, inside my heart -- He raps Troy's nose repeatedly to make his point
Like this, like this, like this -- He breaks Troy's nose with a crack
rug is pulled off the old stone floor, a panel is lifted
Old pistols and rifles are pulled out
Doc and Vig load and handle the old pistols
Did we save anything from the Humvee
This bag
Archie pulls two of the colored footballs from the beat up pack
He looks at Doc as if to say "Great
" Archie's arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of light blue plastic explosive around a football, presses small nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a fuse in the end of the ball
Another ball-bomb just like it has already been constructed
- Archie leads a line of 55 Shiites across the desert
Everyone carries at least one Vuitton bag
Imam carries his daughter
You got the same name as the tall model who does David Bowie
That's Im- an , with an 'n
' He's Imam with an 'm
' That's the same name
It's not the same name
Whatever
They're both attractive names
- Archie crouches low to the ground, moving quickly, secretively
He turns and makes a hand signal to, Doc, 20 yards away, who turns and makes a hand signal to Vig
:  lone Iraqi military truck, mint condition
' Archie, Vig, and Doc form a semicircle, surrounding the truck
They are all 40 yards back from the truck
This is the United States Army
Come out of the truck with your weapons in the air
No response
Suddenly Vig's pistol
Shit
Sorry
His gunshot blows a hole in the Iraqi truck -- which deflates like a huge beach ball, circling wildly until it lies in a heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while 50 yards away -- 55  flip sand-colored blankets off and stand up in the desert to look
Doc lifts the limp canvass of the deflated truck
They used a lot of decoys to throw off our bombers
Where are we gonna get a vehicle
know a place that's full of deserters
Maybe they got something
: They walk in a single file line in the desert
Archie in front, carries a Vuitton bag
'  - Archie now walks among Shiites toting old rifles
There are bomb craters, destroyed cars, a few mud dwellings nearby
America
#2 America
Friend
Freedom
Thank you to America
Shiites cheer and pat Archie, Doc and Vig on the back as they walk to a bunker built into the side of a small hill come out smiling to embrace a disoriented Archie and Doc
- They pass through a cluttered room with six cots, down a hallway, to a larger room where two more sit watching
There is a defaced poster of Saddam, two peacocks and three monkeys in the room, and the half-eaten carcass of a zebra
The soldiers rise and half-bow to Archie
Food
You give food
We don't have any food
Where'd you get these animals from
(translates) Kishan tramai jahal
Kuwait Zoo
Nabal hazala fan taq
This is for you, my friend, to eat if you are hungry
The Iraqi Soldier offers a live monkey to Archie
No, thank you
They're not barbarians, they're starving
'm getting really dizzy, man
Vig sticks out a   and nods
We need water
Water all gone
No one have water
Radio
No radio
No radio, no water, but yes
The other Iraqis nod their heads and laugh nervously
George Bush get rid Saddam
Not exactly
Congratulation
He embraces Archie, who looks at Imam
Would you explain to these gentlemen that we need a vehicle of some kind
- It is dark
With a click, several bare ceiling lights come on
Archie, Doc, Vig, stare in amazement : It's an underground garage filled with nine luxury cars:   , a , a , an  ,  , a The friendly Iraqi smiles
From Kuwait
Doc stops at the convertible
Could  ask a question
The Iraqi deserters look at him
Does Lexus make this model
No
Infiniti convertible only
2 No Lexus convertible
Exactly what  said
Listen
We use these cars to go fight Saddam soldiers
The Friendly Iraqi looks at Doc and laughs
What's so funny
Cannot take
What do you mean, cannot take
We kicked Saddam's ass
We definitely take
We are the United States military
The Iraqi laughs
You're three guys with a bunch of Shiites and no Humvee
Need money
Have no money
To eat
To live
Kish falan azar yat imal tanat
He says the Americans have many tanks, many airplanes
We have nothing
The Iraqis do not look happy
Imam does simultaneous translation as Archie holds forth
We will rise up together
Jihala vamat
Rise up together
Doc and Vig look taken aback as Archie goes messianic
Look at us
Working together
Many races, many nations
Tell him, Doc
We are united
They raise their joined hands together
United
George Bush wants  -- To stand up for yourself
George Bush
He wants -- You
Praise Jesus
Make the fight for freedom on your own
Oh, yes, you can
Go, baby, go
Archie walks around, looking into the eyes of each Iraqi soldier, touching them on the shoulders
Then America will follow
Jahal yaqat
Jahal yaqat, brothers
God bless America, and God bless a free Iraq
Iraqis burst into cheers
What do you say now, my friend
Cannot give car
Then  guess we'll have to buy them
- The luxury cars ride across the desert, single file, Vuitton bags strapped to the roofs
- Judas Priest will pump you, Doc -- already had it with the Beach Boys today
One song
Doc slams in a --
The Shiite riflemen in back smile as Vig scowls
Archie drives
Imam sits in passenger seat with his daughter on his lap
They listen to Iraqi music
- Shiites finish passing 92 Vuitton suitcases into a trench
The bags are buried
Archie drives a stake to mark the spot
We get our man, we come back to pick up the gold -- And my people
My gold isn't here, and  mean all of it, your people will not survive
Doc and Vig pull off distributor caps from the Cadillacs and Limousine (but not the Jaguar) and put them in Doc's pack
understand
Let's load and go
Imam hugs and kisses his daughter goodbye and tries to put her, crying, into the arms of an older woman
Wait a second,  want to talk about this plan some more -- We're going to drive in and get Troy, exactly like we discussed
have a bad feeling like we're gonna get wasted
You're scared
It's good to be scared when there's guns around
Vig looks uneasy
Archie hums Bach's 'Gloria' and moves a hand in the air, then puts his hands on Vig's shoulders and Vig eventually joins in the chorus
'm cool
'm all right
He lies down and breathes with a hand on his chest as Archie and Vig keep singing
- Bach's  Minor Mass plays as the Mercedes, Infiniti, and Rolls Royce Drive across the desert
-   - The Interrogator finishes putting tissue in Troy's bleeding nose
Your son wouldn't be dead if Saddam didn't invade Kuwait
- smash the windows of a Benneton store, then a Cartier store
(
) know
(
) heard about some bad shit that happened there
- drag patients from their hospital beds and dives on top of a crying  and starts to rape her while a  is taken from an incubator, which is stolen
Who's got the sick country
Maybe Saddam is very crazy, right
And then you are crazy to bomb all of Iraq
Too much bombing is crazy, but not saving Kuwait
You come here to save Kuwait people
Yes
Really
(to the Second Iraqi) Jahaza fan
The Second Iraqi dips a bucket into an oil drum
Lots of people in trouble around this world, my man
You don't fight no fahking war for them
You invaded another country
You can't do that
Why not, dude
It makes the world crazy
You got to keep it stable
For what
Your pick up truck
No, for stability
Stabilize the region
The Interrogator pulls a  from Troy's pocket and jams it into Troy's mouth
This is your fahking stability, my main man
The Interrogator uses the  as a funnel to force-feed the crude oil into Troy's mouth as he pours it from the bucket
Archie, Doc, Vig, stand on a sand ridge and look down on the Oasis bunker in the distance
Behind them are the three cars, Imam, and a handful of Shiite gunmen
They get into the cars
An empty ridge
The Infiniti, Rolls, Mercedes shoot over it, arcing down toward the bunker, engines roaring
It is quiet
Slim Jim is unwrapped as an   slowly raises it to his mouth, bites it, chews, and looks puzzled at the cars approaching in the distance
- looking straight down
The cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the bunker
The Infiniti is in the middle, flanked by the Rolls on the left and the Mercedes on the right
Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward the bunker
Shiite sits up front with him
Fifty yards from the bunker, Vig turns sharply and drives in circles
, one chewing a Slim Jim, look bewildered as they stare at the circling Infiniti fifty yards away
Archie, with Imam in the passenger seat, two Shiites in back, speeds the Mercedes past the guards, around the right side, to the back side of the bunker, skidding across the sand
The Mercedes and the Rolls diverge around the bunker on either side: Rolls on the left, Mercedes on the right
Doc drives the Rolls around the left, to the bunker's rear
Iraqi soldiers fire a grenade that blows up right behind the Rolls as Doc skids right up to a rear entrance of the bunker, the grill touching the metal door
Doc parks, blockading the rear door shut, and, with three Shiite riflemen, jumps out
Shiite helps Vig wedge a piece of wood onto the gas pedal
Vig suddenly grabs his hand in
The Shiite looks at him
Splinter
Come on
Vig and the Shiite bail out of the moving Infiniti
Wads of plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it speeds towards the bunker, then drifts to the side -- Go straight, go straight -- He jumps up and down and points, but the Infiniti goes far to the side of the bunker and explodes into some ruins
The two guards point their guns at Vig and the Shiite and they run into the desert as bullets pop around them
Archie skids the Mercedes to a halt on the right side of the bunker, jumps out, slams the door, followed by Imam and the two other Shiites
They run toward the bunker, Archie with a wad of plastic explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in the other
He  the  of a car alarm being activated as he runs to the bunker
Imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker, pulls off a grill
Archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic explosive, and drops it into the vent
- Troy gags and spits, his front is covered in oil
The Interrogator raises the bucket
Are you feeling stable enough for more
An  elsewhere in the bunker causes the lights to flicker out
Iraqi soldiers scurry in the darkness with flashlights
They go to the rear door, pile up in the dark, pushing
The parked Rolls Royce blockades the rear door
Archie and Imam run back to the Mercedes, but the car is locked, his pistol sits inside on the front seat from the bunker roof shatters the window of the Mercedes, setting off
Archie reaches in, grabs his pistol, and bolts as a launched grenade blows the Mercedes
- 12 Iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as 3 Shiite riflemen with Doc fire on them
Two Iraqis go down, with only the sound of bullets piercing their flesh
6 Iraqis run for it, into the desert
2 Iraqis throw their hands up in surrender while 2 look ambivalent, one holds stack of new Levis
Doc raises a hand to stop his Shiite gunmen from firing, but they fire anyway and 3 Iraqis fire back -- the Shiite next to Doc is hit in the face
Stop shooting, what's the matter with you
He reaches out and holds the rifle of a Shiite
Everyone stops firing, slowly the Iraqis drop their guns
Doc has Archie runs up from the right, grabs Doc's arm and they run past surrendering Iraqi soldiers and into the front entrance
of the bunker
Imam takes cover on the side of the bunker while Shiites and Iraqis aim at each other
Vig approaches cautiously from the desert,   , and looks up
An Iraqi helicopter comes in fast and opens with   -- Shit
Vig runs toward the bunker for cover, but is cut off by from
Shiites  rifles up at the chopper
Chips of metal and plastic fly off as bullets hit the chopper
Arabic chatter is heard over a crackling radio
- 100 feet below -- Vig and six remaining Shiite riflemen are running into the desert away from the chopper
- Vig and the six Shiites frantically search for cover
The chopper  and one of the Shiites running with Vig is hit in the head, thrown by the force of the gunshot into Vig, who goes down, faking it
Vig lies face down, out of breath, with the dead Shiite on top of him while the chopper hovers above
Jesus God,  don't wanna get hit, please Jesus, watch over me -- It is dimly lighted by a few mounted emergency lights
Archie and Doc run down the empty stairs, through the big main room -- it is empty
Archie goes down the right side, kicks open a door -- It's the bathroom full of stolen stuff and cell phones -- Doc goes down the left side of the room -- kicks in a door -- a room full of Benneton sweaters in all colors
Archie kicks in a door -- a room with shelves full of large snow globes, thousands of them
Doc kicks in a door -- a room cluttered with debris, but there is another door at the far side of the room
He approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success
Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the emergency light with a screwdriver -- In flickering light -- Archie  one Iraqi guard squarely in the chest, then the other -- the only and the   into their bodies
Archie turns to the Interrogator, who stands next to Troy
It's , buddy, we are just talking now -- -- Archie shoots the Interrogator in the thigh
,   -- Blood thinly splatters across Troy's face as the Interrogator grimaces and falls to the floor
The light flicks on a few beats, then off a few beats
Archie rips the wires from the table controls, goes to Troy, unhinges the wire from his jaw
The Interrogator writhes in pain on the ground
Archie takes the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol
Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears
He gets up, looks down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into the Interrogator's face
The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back
Archie watches, out of breath
Troy  the gun just to the side of the Interrogator's face, into the ground
The Interrogator looks terrified, crying
Troy stares back, looks unhappy, lowers the gun
Troy and Archie look at each other for an intense moment
Let's go
Doc shoots the lock on the inner door and it finally opens
He looks inside and sees, in a sunken room, 50 more Shiite civilians huddled together
Archie rushes by with Troy
Come on
- Archie and Troy run out of the bunker -- - The chopper hovers right there
It    which next to Archie and Troy
They scramble back into the bunker
- Archie and Troy run into Doc at the door, knocking him over
They crouch inside the door; the chopper hovers low outside
- Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands and knees with the dead Shiite on his back
You gotta be my disguise, Mr
Shiite, cuz they need my help over there -- - The six Iraqis who took oft from the bunker are still running
Their  is in  and  in Let's go back and get them
#2 Fuck a donkey, no way
There's a chopper, we can do it
He and another Iraqi stop while the other two keep running
They killed your families, you fucking cowards
The Tough Iraqi and his partner, sweating profusely, out of breath, split up and head back toward the bunker
- Archie's in great pain
He grimaces as he tightens the bandage around his forearm
Troy is shaking uncontrollably
Doc grabs Troy's shoulders firmly
We're gonna get out of here alive, just do what  say, do you hear me
Troy nods
Archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in -4 from his small pack, and hands it to Doc
Archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand
Step, throw, one-two -- 'm gonna give it a five second fuse
That gives you two steps out the door
Troy and Doc listen intently
Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife
The three of them stand at the door, ready
Archie holds his pistol ready
Doc holds the football, Troy holds the lighter
Wait -- Imam, lying in a ditch, is concealed on the side of the bunker, and aims an old rifle at the chopper
ring off the side of the chopper, chipping plastic
The chopper banks toward Vig in response
Vig watches the chopper turn toward him
God help me
Troy flicks the lighter and with a shaking hand tries to light the fuse
Archie steadies Troy's hand
The fuse is lit
Go
- Archie  his pistol as he goes out the door with Troy, also  a pistol
Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning
Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up
The chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the plexiglas window and bounces off, not exploding
The pilots look perplexed
The ball hits the ground and
Archie, Troy, Doc, stunned -- turn back to the bunker
- They run inside and take cover, catch their breath
Troy and Doc look terrified
Shorter fuse this time
He pulls out the second ball, cuts another fuse, affixes it
They wait at the door again, watching the chopper
Imam, from the side of the bunker,  again, the chopper swivels toward him to   -- Troy lights the second fuse
They bolt out the door, Troy and Archie  pistols, Doc in the middle with the ball
- -- with just : Archie, Doc, Troy, three abreast, mid-stride
-- Doc unleashes the football
-    -- the ball hits the chopper broadside and
: The chopper comes crashing to the ground in a heap of metal
The rotary spins off, whips over Archie, Troy, and Doc's heads and smashes into the bunker
Silence
Troy and Doc look at each other, and punch their fists together
Troy notices that he's wet his pants
We're not done
Check every Iraqi here
Archie rolls over bodies lying on the ground, pulls out their weapons
Troy and Doc take rifles from wounded Iraqis
(agitated) Where's Conrad
Don't let your guard down
Doc nervously scans the area with his pistol pointed
50 Shiite prisoners start streaming out of the bunker
Stay there, don't move
Imam directs the Shiites to stay clustered near the bunker
Jakar yizam ut naral -- How are we getting back
We got the Rolls
An   jumps up just as Archie knocks him to the ground from behind and twists the gun away
Doc binds the soldier's hands with a plastic cuff
You got a Rolls
It's been a busy day
Archie pulls pistols from the bloody bodies of the two Iraqis in the chopper
Hey
That's a convertible
He points to the flaming wrecked Infiniti
Keep your fucking guard up
Is that leather interior
think he's in shock
It's a fucking Infiniti convertible, isn't it
Yes
So  owe you a car
'm not in shock
We can talk about cars later,
Freeze -- He points his pistol at Imam
Take it easy
Who is this guy
He's with us
Troy and Imam look at each other a moment, Troy still points his pistol at Imam
You're the guy with the little girl
That's right
What are you doing here
He helped us find you
All right
You're all right
He hugs Imam
How's your girl
She's safe
For the moment
All right
Excellent
How can we help
Calm down, man
'm calm
Don't  look calm
We had a deal to get us to the border, but we need more vehicles for these people
Troy moves nervously
We're gonna work it out
We can do it
We have to work it out
'm not sure how
This is a lot of people
, you choose who we take
You tell the others it's not convenient, they'll have to die
Take it easy, man
You think  don't know what 'm saying
know what 'm saying
We're gonna do more than steal, that's what 'm saying
We're gonna help these people out
This guy was worth saving
He's a soldier
Troy and Archie look at each other, smile slightly
(
) Yes
Yes
All right
They all turn to look
-- Vig pops up in the desert, 150 yards away
You made it
Vig comes running
thought that was you
Yeah
Troy smiles as he steps in the direction of Vig
Suddenly a , Troy jumps
-- Vig is hit in the collar bone, He is jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering toward Troy, 125 yards away
Troy looks stunned
Archie turns sharply to his right and  a rifle
An  , 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire
Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig
Cover him
Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed
Archie scans the area and directs 3   to spread out
Lock it down
Shoot anything that moves
(translates) Haza janav yasat
Troy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and embraces him
Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's shoulder, as Vig tries to talk
You made it, man -- Troy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms
Help him
Doc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the ground, cradling his head in his lap
Vig spits blood
What happened to the Jesus fire, Doc
It's around you right now, man, it works on this side or the other side
You never told me that part guess  could go to one of them shrines that erase the bad you did -- We made the right choice today, Conrad
We did good, right
We made the right choice
The hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood
Troy puts his hands over it
Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to turns Vig's head to help him breathe
Dear Lord watch over this man, help him if you can
Our father who art in heaven -- 50 Shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near the bunker watch from afar
Troy stands up looking around helplessly
Help
-- hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done -- gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the sound of tearing tissue
Troy looks stunned as he is spun around by the shot
Archie spins around in the desert and looks at Troy
Goddamn it
He runs hard across the desert toward Troy
Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other
Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great difficulty --
' His breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to the left side
' looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but there's    ' The  turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing
, but with weird, #5 Take my picture
Do you still want to sell pictures
(distracted monotone) For twenty
#5 Twenty bucks
War's been over five days, ain't gonna be any more of this, Jim
#5 Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life
You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war
#5 Bobby, take my picture
He holds the camera out
#4 If he shot the guy, it's up to him
#5 It's not like he shot a fucking deer
It's the enemy
It's Troy's enemy, yours for twenty
- Troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide
' Archie and Imam step into frame
Archie looks down at Troy, opens his waist pack, pulls out a sterile wrapped scalpel
'      -- - The Jaguar pulls up in
Imam's Little Girl gets out of the passenger side, ,
Imam scolds her and gesticulates, indicating she should be back with the others where it is safe
The Little Girl embraces Imam and stares down at Troy over her father's shoulder
Troy's eyes are wide, staring up at the Girl as he has great difficulty breathing
Archie rolls Troy's shirt up, exposing Troy's chest, with the bullet wound
Archie points to a spot on Troy's upper chest, near the collar bone -- Doc squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel onto this spot -- the only sounds are the squirt of the ointment and Troy's breathing
Archie looks nervous, then focussed as he brings the shiny metal scalpel down
Troy is in great pain as he watches Archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest
Archie twists the scalpel to open the incision wide -- There is a pronounced  as trapped air rushes out
Huge relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally
Regular sound   ,      ' ,   -- '    , 've been waiting 18 years to get that right
He tears open a short
tube and plunges the
into the scalpel hole
There is a small valve on the end of the tube, which he tightens
-- Archie turns and looks over -- chase down and shoot, at 30 yards, the last Iraqi gunner in the desert
Troy sits up slowly and watches for a moment
- Shiite women and children chant and pray around Vig's corpse as it lies in the open trunk of the Jaguar
Archie, Troy and Doc stand together watching
Troy and Doc do a muted version of Vig's Karate arm dance as they look down at his corpse
He's got no family
Archie sadly takes Vig's big pistol from Vig's clenched hand
We're his family now
He wanted to go to one of those shrines
Kajatar in Iran
We can take him
Archie takes Vig's glasses off
Good
Take him
- Archie fills a single rusted oil drum with gold bars and tapes it shut
Troy sits in a folding chair nearby
He looks pained and uncomfortable
Air pressure will build up about every fifteen minutes
Release the valve, close it up again
Archie unscrews the valve on the tube in Troy's chest, and air hisses out
Troy looks relieved
Archie closes the valve
How long can  keep doing this
Maybe four hours, if you're not bleeding too bad inside
'm really thirsty
There's no water anywhere
(to Archie) got you hooked up if you want to call your man
- Archie operates a radio hooked up to a car battery
(into the radio) Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do you read me
We're gonna be court-martialed
No, we're not
Troy watches, tense
(into the radio) Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are you reading this
- Walter drives the motorcycle, nude, wearing his helmet with radio attachment
Smithson and Paco ride along
Archie is heard in a crackling radio transmission inside Walter's helmet
Walter speaks into the small mouthpiece
(into radio) This is Tar Baby, come in
(
) Where are you
(into radio) About two clicks outside camp
(
) We're about ready for the briar patch, over
(into the radio) Right
He looks uncertain, worried
(
) You got me, Tar Baby
think so -- who handles the briar patch
(
) You do
Oh, , and the Tar Baby goes to the briar patch if everything's , right
(
) No, the other way around
Shit, 'm sorry, sir,  don't remember how the code goes -- Archie, who looks exasperated
He is sweating with a fever and his arm hurts
Six personnel trucks and a Humvee
Wow
That's a tall order for a secret operation, sir
Talk to my friend Hash
Each driver will get 100K
Did you say 100K

are pulled from the shelves and put into old cloth bags
- Doc cracks open a snow globe with pliers as all the water and dollars drain out
Imam filters the water through a cheese cloth held above an urn
the plastic Three Kings and Baby Jesus with the Mobil gas station glisten in the wet palm of Archie's hand
Archie looks at the Three Kings in his hand
Troy cracks open a snow globe, filters water with a Shiite
Dozens of Shiites are doing the same
Archie passes an urn to some parched Shiites who drink the water thirstily
Troy, Doc do the same
- Captain Van Meter, General Horn, and two radio decoders stand looking at logs of transmissions
There's so many transmissions -- Narrow it down to what sounds like Archie Gates and a Humvee
Humvee with  and Walter drives by behind the oblivious General, leading a convoy of several trucks
want a direction, we're not gonna comb the whole goddamn desert -- runs up and hands General Horn a paper
This is from Barlow's
at Fort Bragg, something with his wife

'll be damned
Walter and Hash drive past Smithson and Paco and Cathy
Where the hell is he going now
say we keep watching the General
She takes off and Smithson follows her
- Imam pours gasoline on a pile of Vuitton suitcases, Troy throws a match, the suitcases go up in a rush of fire
- Imam hands two gold bars to a Shiite peasant, who takes them and moves on
There are two long lines of Shiite peasants patiently waiting to get their gold, as it is handed out by Imam and another Shiite while, Archie, Troy, and Doc watch
Shiites stash their gold bars inside their clothing and bags
Everyone sits and waits: Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, 105 Shiite peasants
Troy looks pained, then releases the valve on the tube sticking through his chest bandage and there is a hiss of air
He looks relieved
There is the
An approaching convoy in the desert: six open
personnel trucks, led by a Humvee
Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, dozens of Shiites watch the convoy approaching -- they hold their guns ready
The
Military trucks and the Humvee pull up to the bunker
Walter stands in the front of the Humvee with Hash, both wearing sand goggles as they pull up -- Walter salutes
Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got yourself shot
Those better be words of sympathy
6  , among them the disillusioned infantrymen interviewed by Bill Smithson earlier, get out of their vehicles, greeted by Doc, Archie, and Imam
Walter walks up, carrying a medical pack
Watcha doing out here, Troy
They bang fists in greeting
Protecting the free peoples of the world, Walter, you know how it is
We better get you fixed up to go home to the land of the brave
Walter pushes an
needle into Troy's arm
Give me that penicillin, baby
Doc pushes an
needle into Archie's arm and tapes the penicillin sack to Archie's shirt
Where ees bullion at, my man
Bullion ees buried

Iranian border
Part of the deal
'est super, Archie, you got yourself a pain in the ass mission of mercy
Sorry  fucked up the code, sir
It means we gotta move
They might be coming for us
Bach's "Gloria" plays powerfully
Shiites pile into the six open trucks
The lone oil can full of gold is loaded, as well
Imam and his daughter are helped into a truck by Doc
Archie whistles loud from the front seat of the Humvee -- which leads the way as the convoy pulls out
Doc, in the back of a truck with Shiites, waves
Troy smiles as he sits in the back of a crowded truck with Imam, his daughter, and other Shiites
, The six truck convoy, led by the Humvee, rolls across the two- lane desert road
-   - are  on the ground as Captain Van Meter, his White Assistant, and General Horn board a chopper
Smithson, Paco, and Cathy and her   rush aboard the last chopper in the line
- The Humvee slows to a halt
Archie stands in the front of the Humvee with a rifle at his side -- looking straight ahead -- concerned
Troy, Doc, Imam, and daughter stare ahead, concerned 50 yards ahead -- a low wall of razor wire
100 yards beyond it, dozens of Iraqi tanks are lined up along the border, 100 feet apart, stretching into the distance either way
There are 50    standing at the border station, marked by razor wire on the one-lane road
On the far side of the border,   with wearing   wait by white school buses and stare at the American convoy
Archie stares at the border, thinking
Imam helps Troy down from the truck
Doc carries the Little Girl
What are you seenking
see an opening we can walk through
But it's not wide enough for a truck
Archie gets out of the Humvee and looks at the border
We'll walk them to the border
The Iranians will take them
We'll walk back to the trucks and get out of here
Doc turns and signals to the drivers to come up
Troy takes the safety off his -16

Drivers get out with their rifles ready
They release the safeties
Havichon, with his leg in a cast, stays back to man the mounted machine gun on the Humvee
Iraqi soldiers on the border nervously watch the Americans and the Shiites, holding their machine guns
- -- cross hairs pan from Doc, to Troy, to Imam, to Archie
Make a close group
(translates) Jihad yamat -- yamat
105 Shiites empty the trucks and gather in a crowd that walks toward the border
Two Shiite men carry Vig's body, wrapped in Arabic cloths
Archie, Troy, Doc, lead the crowd single file through a narrow opening in the razor wire
On the other side, the crowd spreads out and keeps walking
Archie, Troy, and Doc walk three abreast, 7 feet apart, rifles ready
Imam and Walter are behind, flanking them
:   -  Children, Women, Men, as they fearfully walk toward the border
The five
Drivers flank the Shiites on either side, rifles ready
- Troy suddenly drops to one knee
Let the air out
It's not the air,  don't know what it is -- Stay back
'm all right
'm just dizzy or something -- Iranian soldiers and relief workers stand watching
- The backs of the Iraqi troops and tanks, and the approaching Shiites and Americans, walking in the distance
Archie helps Troy as they walk three abreast with Doc
in the distance
They grow
Imam turns and looks back
Archie turns around and looks
approach from the distance Archie
Double time
He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border
Troy cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others
The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog
Doc and Walter look up also
Archie does not
Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the choppers as they pass overhead, loud
Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his path, blowing up dust
Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the blowing sand

jump from the landing choppers, followed by another
with rifles
Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively
grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from the Shiites
Troy shouts over the choppers
Wait
soldiers push the Shiites toward the border
The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward the border unaccompanied by American protection
Let them get over the border
Troy pulls away from , resisting arrest
Let them get over, wait -- Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back
have to reach this -- Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front -- Put his cuffs in front
He and Doc are pulled away from Troy
Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them, throwing some to the ground
Troy looks over his shoulder at this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is thrown to the ground and dragged
Look what's happening
He collapses to one knee
Not our mission, Barlow
Troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs prevent him from releasing his valve
Troy struggles
Cut my cuffs -- Captain Van Meter leans down to Troy
He shouts over the choppers
You fucked me and you're fucked now, so shut your goddamn mouth
Shiites are lined up in a firing squad
He's gonna die
Troy lies on the ground suffocating
Archie drags the holding him as he goes to General Horn
Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical attention, don't let him die -- We are not involved in the Shiite problem, do you understand me
You are , you are a fugitive, you are under arrest
Cut his cuffs
General Horn walks away as  stare at Troy on the ground, concerned
stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade, crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the  standing by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs
Troy reaches with difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes
Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border
Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad
Vig's body is dropped in the sand
We got the gold
What
We got the Kuwaiti bullion
Bullshit
Archie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward the lead truck -- where MPs grab and wrestle him down
Pull that barrel
Pull it
An  jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold bars spill to the sand
The General looks at the gold
Troy and Doc, held in custody, watch
The General makes a '' signal to the choppers -- and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows
Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in custody -- stand and watch Archie
How much do you have
4 tons
General Horn picks up a gold brick
Where's it at
Get them over first
They helped us get it, Ron
made a deal, and that's soldier's honor
You can't fuck them now
General Horn looks at Archie
You can return this gold, be a big hero, get another star maybe
Everyone stares at General Horn
After a pause, the General fires his pistol into the air
Iraqi soldiers freeze as they are about to fire on the Shiites
Let's go, Doug
Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk 40 yards to the frozen Iraqi soldiers and the terrified Shiites
Archie, Troy, Doc in handcuffs with , watch
Walter and the other
Soldiers watch from afar as Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk into the midst of Iraqi soldiers
Who's in charge here
An    steps forward and salutes
We have to talk about this situation
Archie, Troy, Doc,
soldiers watch from a distance
' General Horn talks to the Iraqi general
Soldiers watch
' General Horn and Captain Van Meter walk back toward them
It is
No one says anything
Pan across Paco taping
In a morbid tableau these men have recovered some of the gold bullion stolen from Kuwait -- --in violation of American policy, saved over a hundred Shiite refugees while recovering stolen Kuwaiti gold -- Turn that damn camera off
He walks up and forcibly pushes the camera to the ground, Van Meter pushes Cathy's camera down
That's a 75 thousand dollar camera -- What the fuck are they doing here
thought they were authorized -- They are not fucking authorized, for Christ's sake -- MPs take the tapes from the cameras
Haven't  taken care of you, dammit
He signals the choppers to start up
into gear
'm gonna get that tape back
General Horn walks over to Troy, Archie, and Doc
You are under arrest
You are going to be court-martialed
And you will show us where the bullion is right now
He walks into a chopper, which is now revving at full speed
Troy, Archie, Doc turn to the border and watch
Walter, the handcuffed Drivers, the  and other
Soldiers also watch
The Shiites are released by the Iraqis
They collect themselves and gather in a group
The group walks over the border and is received by the relief workers
Troy, Archie, Doc watch
Soldier  through the loud choppers
#10 Yeah
Then another Soldier joins in,  and
Then another soldier, until all twenty
Soldiers and MPs present are whistling and cheering Troy, Archie, and Doc as they stand there while the choppers throb
50 yards away: Imam holds his daughter, on the Iran side, about to get into a Red Crescent bus
Imam and his daughter wave
Archie raises his handcuffed wrists to wave back; Troy and Doc follow, raising their cuffed hands to wave
