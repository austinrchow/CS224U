From the sudden darkness, the Shadowy Figure speaks up

Look at that- Each photo costs a fortune to suppress
And then, naturally, they pop up on the net

It's sleek, more modern, fitting snugly to his gills and neck
His goggles are new, too
He examines a photo of Hellboy bounding down a city street, brandishing his mighty, high-caliber Samaritan
He's looking straight at the camera lens
2 6 Oh, Lord- He's smiling in this one

It's the provocation
This is asking for trouble
His ego- Manning leans close to a voice-recognition security mike
"Man-ning
" He enunciates each syllable perfectly, then turns to Abe

And  think it's all deliberate on his part

Layers of steel doors trundle open in sequence
No, he doesn't
He's just- enthusiastic

Oh, you know

Since they moved in together- Good days and bad
On cue, the concrete wall explodes

Once the explosion dies away- Hellboy's revealed, lying on the floor, his back smoking and in flames
Oh, hi Blue- Manning- He puts out a small flame on his forearm and steps into the room
2 7 ' (yelling at Liz) Well- 'm not afraid of you
You hear
Abe and Manning peek inside- 9

Oh, and 8 track was the way to go- one day mankind will realize its mistake
What about me

Not much, but just enough to find- to find- my- toothbrush
She flares up, losing control
Is that what this is about
Your toothbrush's right there, behind you- (Liz turns) There- there- with the cat food
Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from a heap of spilled cat kibble
Damn it, Red- there's no room for me here
You can't just act like- Suddenly, the alarm
Hellboy is elated
2 8 Oh, heavenly bells are ringing

Tight-lipped and grumpy, Liz dons black army pants and a leather jacket

They use plasma-screen night-vision scanners to survey the devastation
No one here
No survivors
No bodies

-  15 Two agents lead the way down the adjacent hallway
Hellboy follows, a few feet behind
trains his flashlight on a fallen display case
Broken glass glitters
Same story here, babe- (on the intercom) Don't call me babe- said "Abe"- 'm sorry- wrong channel- Hellboy falls back to talk privately on the intercom
(') Liz- -
(on the intercom) Yes
2 10 () When we get home
'm gonna clean the place up; okay
Even the bathroom
That's not the problem and you know it

You want to get rid of the cats
You can't mean that- No
That's not the problem either- () Then, what--
Not now, for God's sake

-  16 Abe, Liz and Agent Mudd fan out, moving cautiously toward the auctioneer's overturned podium
Abe discovers an empty cage
and on the iron door, the embossed
Abe hears a high-pitched chitter- chatter and looks around: Nothing
Red- 'm afraid  do detect some activity- As the agent and Liz inspect the other iron cages, he extends his webbed fingers
What kind of creature
- 17
-  17 There's more than one-
He hears a scratching noise
2 11 (on the intercom) More- Many more- How many- ten-
No
Maybe a hundred- or two- () - As  nears a wall, it bulges and splits open
The ceiling cracks, too
He hurriedly loads a pair of lever-action 18
-  18 They're all around us- Sounds of  from burrowing, unseen creatures- What are they
Uh- If 'm right, we should leave now and ask for backup
19
-  19 Manning is holding forth in a sidewalk press conference
The situation is completely under control
Earlier tonight, customs agents discovered a few illegally imported items
This caused a minor confrontation
The reporters go wild with questions
(') Federal agents have now taken over the premises
We ask that you all step back- Manning basks in the flashbulb glow and acknowledges a pretty young
2 12 (') () Yes, Debra-
20
-  20 Plaster spills from widening cracks in the wall
Hellboy shoots, blowing open a massive hole
He peeks inside- Small bodies burrow away like moles
What are they-
Abe
21
-  / -  21 Abe finds a human femur, wet and gnawed
Ah,  knew it
( ) They're vicious and cruel and- The floor ripples with activity
(') Have you noticed the floor
(looking around) Uh- thick rug, deep pile, light brown- Red- there is no rug- Hellboy lifts his foot, realizing he's been walking on an inch-thick layer of- ahem- poo
Aw, crap- Precisely
() These things have a very active metabolism
They, um- excrete as soon as they eat and then need to eat some more
There are no corpses 'cause there are no - 2 13 Spit it out, brother blue
What are they
22
-  22 Alright, but- Damn it Abe, just tell us
Okay, then- They're- um- tooth fairies
Abe, c'mon- cut the crap
She checks her boots, sticky with poo- Third century, the Teutoburg forest
Famished
They feed on calcium- () And they do go for the teeth first
How do you think they got that name "Tooth Fairies"
Liz senses movement in the darkness
She holds out her hand and starts a small fire on her palm
She pans it like a torch, firelight sweeping the darkness- - 23
-  23 Agent  comes upon a lonely little creature peeping out from a crack in the wall
It's about 9 inches high, with olive skin and almond-shaped eyes gleaming in the half- light
It whimpers softly
Hey, this guy is cute -i
He reaches out to touch it
Are you scared, buddy
Across the room Hellboy sees the Agent nearing the Fairy
2 14 No, don't- The thing , leaps and sinks its tiny teeth into 's finger
Then it dives under 's shirt and goes to work
gasps and drops his gun
Dozens of creatures emerge from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble's clothing
Gasping, he tears open his shirt as claws and teeth dig in
ribs crack
blood spurts
The agent falls
24
-  24 Liz lights up both hands, illuminating a surging tidal wave of hungry critters that engulfs the room, gnawing at the wallpaper, the furniture
The things sweep over Agent Mudd, ripping into him like wriggling piranhas
(backing away) Oh, my- 25
-  25 Hellboy protects the other agent, but he feels the things swarming over him, reaching for his lips and ears
Bellowing in disgust, he fires his shotguns, splattering dozens of creatures onto the walls
Every blast, however, reveals a buzzing, hungry mass pouring from the walls
claws at dozens more, which cling to him like baby monkeys
26
-  26 The room is awash with hissing creatures, crawling over the iron cages
For an awful moment, no sign of Liz or Abe
(sudden panic) In reply, he hears a faint scream
He bats at the things with the , wading further into the room
2 15 (') Liz
Where are you -
He sees a horde of little beasts gnawing at the metal bars of a cage
Liz cowering inside
Hellboy just has time to look deep into her eyes
quick moment of silent communion
Do it, Liz, do it
And Liz obeys
Closing her eyes she- () The fire's not my enemy
It is part of me- -gets covered by a gentle film of blue flame
-- He takes refuge as- It is mine- -the gentle flame blooms into a cloud of fire
Liz goes supernova
27
-  27 ball of fire erupts from an upstairs balcony
The crowd and reporters look up, amazed
() Evidently we have a- gas pocket- somewhere in- The reporters stampede towards the explosion, leaving Manning alone and fuming
(') Hey guys, hey guys, come back
2 16 28 az, ,a 2 8
- Hellboy stomps down hard, popping some creatures, bashing others with the butt of his shotgun
As flames leap up, the things regroup and renew their attack
Liz and Abe run for the stairs
Red, Red, this way- Hellboy kicks the critters away, shooting again and again
No- 'll deal with them-
He dumps his backpack and pulls out a belt full of  66 grenades
Holds it high
(') Vulcan 66, boys
Come and get 'em- Liz and Abe take cover on the stairs
They see Hellboy luring the tooth fairies toward the windows overlooking the street
10 As the creatures climb onto him, he pulls the pins on all grenades
Soon he's a mass of swarming, gnarly fairies and - () No, Red- Not there
Move away from the- -B00000MMMMMM`
massive explosion- 29  /  -   29 Like a cannonball,  flies out the upper floor window
ball of flame, he arcs downward, covered in fighting, writhing fairies
Below, the onlookers scatter as the massive Red Giant lands in their midst, cracking the pavement
30 30
- Liz and Abe go to the window and look down 2 17 (into her radio) Are you alright
31
-  31 The crowd is screaming
Half a dozen smoldering fairies climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd
People shrink back in horror
One of the hungry critters jumps at a woman but- Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and efficiently shoots its fellows
Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat
He holds it up by the tail, like a rodent
Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy
(looks at Manning) Gee whiz, Manning- () guess we're out now

That guy's make-up is so fake

2 And what's with his forehead
Is that goggles
He looks out the window and sees the standing by the gates
2 (') Hey, we got us a wino
He grabs his nightstick and steps outside
35 35
- Waving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder
Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall
2 Hey- buddy- get the- The    whirls and drops his coat
He unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the guard
The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts and collapses
36 36
- Guard 1 tunes in a game show
Looks outside- -no sign of his buddy
Behind him, at the window, appears
Its   punches through the wall and hauls off the  and then slams his massive   down
wipes off his sword over the crumpled remains of Guard 2
Screams and bone crunching can be heard

smashes the fence and follows him through

-  37 few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars
Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks
and  stop as a dozen   in helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel
After a pause, a  joins them
He bows low in a show of respect for the Shadowy Figure
Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please, follow me, Sire
38
-  38 The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more guards
The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an intersection
The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword-  growls
beg you, your majesty
Before entering the chamber you surrender your sword
will not
Then,  regret to say, you may not see your father
It is the protocol, sire
For peasant and prince alike
Please- for the last time- surrender your sword
tense beat and then the Prince relents
The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down- Mr
Wink however- cannot dispose of his weapon
He will wait here- snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a huge, rusting iron door
2 20 39
-  39 An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber
High-ranking heads of outlandish   are there: goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves
At the center sits   The One-armed King of Elfland and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful  , the Prince's sister
Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece dangles from a chain
Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the fine scars marring their perfect faces
They're  and , almost the same being
The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him
The armed guards watch his every move
He bows his head and kneels
Father
(eyes the Princess) - The  gestures for him to rise
Why have you done this
His voice trembles with anger
(') Why
The Prince looks at him, defiant
have returned from exile to set us free
All of us, Father- And to reclaim what has been taken from our people
The land and the freedom that is rightfully ours
No- You have broken a truce that has lasted for centuries
2 21 shameful truce, worth nothing
How can you abide it
How-
They have no respect for themselves, their Gods or the earth- () And they scorn us- every time they raise a dead, cold building, destroy a forest, or take more land- The  then steps forward
What they do is in their nature
We must honor our side of the agreement- Honor-
() Look at this place
Is this where you hold court
( ) Is this how we are to live
Amidst their filth, in their rubble
Picking at scraps from their table
Where is the honor in that
And what would your solution be-
War
Why
() It may just be that our days are ended
It may be- but we will not go quiet
We will not fade like this
Better to burn than fade away
And for this
Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of the clans
we'll need the help of the Good
the Bad
and the Worst- He brings out the gold artifact from the auction
Holds it high
The crowds
The King instinctively covers the companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion
No- you cannot be that mad- 2 22 Yes
am
This is the path you wish to take
Knowing the cost
Yes, Father- it is
The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his head
Then,  am sorry my son- you leave me no choice
(looks at his guards) Death
His two   unsheathe their swords
() agree
Death it is- And the guards turn toward the king and stab him
The Princess screams
The Prince looks away as the old monarch tumbles from his throne, dead
The heads of the clans try to flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards
Hear me all
There are some amongst you that have already seen the light- (he nears the guards) Seen the future
The   cover his back as he leans forward to his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion

He joins the pieces together, they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of Minute gears and hooks join the pieces seamlessly into an almost complete
The Prince raises - (') All of those in favor, make it known
2 23 All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then kneel
(') Good-  see the council is as brave as it's always been
() And now, my sister- The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone
He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door
(') Find her- Find her- His minions surge into the tunnels
40
-  40 Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs down a tunnel
gathers behind her, chasing her as she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel
With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down a chute
She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves
41
-  41 The Princess rushes to a small cabinet
She grabs an ancient, leather-bound tome
She turns to leave, but a horde of  rushes and quickly surrounds her
One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty sword
It opens a gash in the princess' left arm- 42
1 -  42 The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the , suddenly doubles over, cursing
Blood pours from a wound in his left arm
No- no- you fools- 2 24 43
-  43 As another troll lifts his sword high- (calling out) Yrdrig
, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an alcove
He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious
In seconds, he's upon the
Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls
The Princess slips through a secret door

2 --  44 The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll screams echo off the walls
When they finally- 45
-  45 -reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late
Dead and dying  lie in a heap on the floor
The Prince finds no sign of his sister
He clutches his bleeding arm
: 46
'  -  46 Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd  monitors in Hellboy's room
All the news channels feature footage of Heliboy's "outing" the night before
is grinning at the camera
Now he's signing an autograph
Yes- yes- 'd say  am that strong- 've fought many creatures over the years but none as strong as me- He winks at camera
Liz rolls her eyes
2 25 Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of beer
think  did good
And  looked good, don't you think, Liz
Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls
Look- there's Manning
He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by microphones
Evidently we have a- gas pocket- somewhere in- gas pocket
Ha-
love it
The door opens
Manning is there, holding a plastic box overflowing with mail
- Disgusted, Manning turns off the 's
Aw- this is a disaster
disaster- you hear
Worse than Cheney with a shotgun
Only Liz- () Only Liz handled herself with any dignity
(glancing at ) No one asked me anything
Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a table
Don't bother starting a fan club
It's trending five to one against us
Against

() "Unwelcome species

Ungodly freaks-

You really did it this time- 'm under review
(to Hellboy) But so are you- As of today, there's a new team leader
New -
What
Yes- You heard me
new team leader
We're to meet him at the conference room at 0900- (looks at his watch) Now
47
-  47 The   is row after row of stacked cages, each one imprisoning a different
patrol the pens, feeding the occupants, cleaning the pans- looks at Manning, who is edgy and nervous
What's the matter, Manning
Don't you trust me anymore
Oh-  never did- But after last night, Washington wants a new public face for the - 2 27 What about me
What's wrong with my face
Or mine
The press loves me
But now you've ruined it all- But, who-
Who is this guy
How would  know
Evidently, he's quite the big shot- (he reads a file) His name is Johann Kraus- Akkk- Kraus
He's German- () -a physical medium, head of the European branch of the - () You know  have a problem with Germans- () -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult Practice from the University of Munich and a very eloquent speaker- () -Germans make me nervous- guess they need a nice open face- face people can trust
Finally, next to steel cage, they meet- : about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment suit full of tubes and taps
His hands are encased in thick latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his head
Oh, my God- 2 28 is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas
He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the Fairy Cages
Johann approaches Liz
He takes her hand and bows
Johann Kraus, at your service
His unearthly voice is velvety and warm
Almost soothing
Liz smiles
Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns toward them
(whispers to manning) That's an open face for you
48
-  48 Johann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies
Hellboy and the others gather around him
Poor things, bought and sold on the black market
Smuggled in tight, cramped cages
Let's see what they can remember- Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die- (nudges Abe) -but maybe  can be of help- Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet
Oh, no, no- No amulets are required
He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock
What are you doing
can inhabit inanimate things: organic, - - 2 29 - Exactly
emanation seeps out from his fingertips, slightly deflating his body
The tendrils enter the- -"Dead" Fairy

Two more do the same from another pen
(') (points at Hellboy) You scare him- The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at
(leering at it) Whaddayawant
You chewed off the tip of my tail- Yes, you- (') Rough translation: He says you are rude, brutish and not too bright- Touche
More high-pitched jabbering
Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen
(') Enough
it seems our little friend here remembers a noise
very peculiar noise in the last place where his cage was traded: market sounds- () Troll language- The troll market-
2 30 Exactly, Miss Sherman
The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and weak
Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too good
'm losing my grip on its limbic system- He feels nauseous
'm afraid he's about to die- Wow- You have that effect on me too
The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses
Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's fingertips
How can we find the Troll market
Its location has been a source of speculation for centuries Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges- And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist- places it under Washington Bridge We've looked there before-- Staked it out for weeks- Yes, but this time  have asked for a very special piece of equipment- He moves in to a large crate marked "Lot 336" "336" The schufftein glasses
(smiles knowingly) On loan from the Smithsonian
Plus we have this clue- He produces the sketch of the
2 31 In my mind we have enough to go by- Any questions
Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises his hand- Yes- what is it
If you're really German- how come you don't have a funny accent
() Get ready
We are on the move
49 49
/ Hellboy is suiting up
Liz and Abe do the same
What a moron
"We are on the move" He thinks he's so hot
We've been looking for that place for years and we've never found it- (looks at Abe) You said so- Abe pulls out  headsets of  , made of copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces
He tries it on
Get used to it
He might be here for good- For good
He has a nice voice
Yes, very commanding, very soothing
think he's a jerk
like him
2 32 Well, then you're a jerk, too
"The brains of the operation-" give me a break
They head towards the garbage truck
Manning, Abe and are waiting there

Hellboy stays behind- thinking- thinking real hard

By him
Not just him- this whole thing you did
The - the reporters- did that
Yes, Red- absolutely
'Cause you did it without thinking- You just wanted to be in the public's eye- well- you're there- but so are we
Hey- We got some hate mail
() We'll deal with it
Together

Something else bothering you-
Liz nods quietly
So- Tell me about it- will, but not now- 'm sorry if- - () don't like being watched

feel like a freak only if someone's watching me
Suddenly: Angry
then fists pounding the walls and fenders
The doors open and they are inundated by reporters and and cameras and flashes
There are, literally, hundreds of them
This time from all over the world: Japan, , Germany
: 52
,   -  52 Agents cordon off the street with yellow tape, holding the press at bay
As the truck rolls by, hordes of bystanders push forward, hoping for a glimpse of Hellboy
Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying support/hatred signs
May  suggest that tonight you refrain from signing autographs
It's the garbage truck
It makes the wrong statement
About who we are
You think that's what this is about
Transportation
2 34 53
-  -  53 The truck stops near other official vehicles
Overhead, the soaring roadbed of the Brooklyn Bridge
At the sight of the  team, some protestors throw eggs
Hellboy shields Liz from the barrage
2 'mon- show us your powers- Oh- No, no, no, it's not a parlor trick
1 What are you, a mermaid
Oh, goodness, no- - 2 You say you can read things- things about people- so read me- c'mon- read me- The crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds
2 (') What do you see
Very well, if you insist
(webbed hand on reporter's chest) You
keep
a large, battery-operated vibrating egg by your bedside
shrieking   runs up loaded with video equipment
You
Demon-man
Will you take a  test
It's "Hellboy" not "Demon-man"- One of the projectiles hits him
The crowd roars
Hellboy gazes back at them- seething
Let me take care of this
Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd
2 35 (') Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann Kraus and  beg you to allow us- (interrupted by catcalls) -Please, we need space to work- please- - The  bombard him with questions
He signals for silence
(') In due time- very soon- we will provide all the answers you require, all the whos, whys and wherefors- But for now- An egg hits him in the face- hard
The crowd roars- Great
He gets ready to pummel the crowd
Liz stops him
Shh
Give him a chance
-it's been a long
long time
for many decades really, that the  has served you- all of you
in silence
We have waged an unknown war - but a very real one
Heroes have died unrewarded and unrecognized so that you might go about your daily life
To work, to marry, to bid your children goodnight
Little by little, the crowd grows quiet
In exchange, we have been consigned to the lies and racist innuendo of the tabloids
And there we have lived without complaint - until now
54 54 Johann's speech is replayed in broadcast  , , and  all over the world to a fascinated human population
All colors and creeds
2 36 (') But perhaps soon- after learning of our hardships and sacrifices, you may decide that our humble lives may, in some way, have a value
and a meaning- -  -  55 55 The camera lights reflect off Johann's glass head
pray that you will allow us to defend your good fortune- to guarantee the blessing that is a peaceful night's sleep
night free from monsters and nightmares
And if so- (chokes back tears) If so- then all we ask in return
from you
is a little respect and the chance, remote as it may be, to prove ourselves worthy of a tiny, tiny place in this- God's Earth
(rolls his eyes) This is sooo corny- moment of silence ensues-- Then, the wet-eyed reporters applaud- the crowd applauds- Liz applauds, Abe applauds
Hellboy is agog
What-
What-
() He has a nice voice
All business now, Johann steps over to the group
Come on
We have work to do- 56 56
- Hellboy, Abe and Johann peer over the cornice of a bowling alley rooftop
The  are visible in the distance
Hellboy looks through
2 37 Nothing yet, Sparky, over- 57 57
- The  truck is parked behind the bowling alley, directly under the bridge
Its back door is open; Liz and manning are at the communications center
read you, Red
Keep looking- Manning is bored, looks at his watch
Looking at what, for goodness sake-
(looks at the Schufften glasses) What do these things do-
Liz starts locking and unlocking a series of lenses and prisms
Both Abe and Johan wear similar gear
In 1778 Emil Schufften, a Good friend of Benjamin Franklin, designed these optical sets with the intent of photographing fairies in England
Let's get out of here- We're never going to find it- ' Hey- Sparky,  think we got one
Manning studies the image on the monitor: a bag lady pushing a shopping cart full of cats- That
Oh, please, she looks as sweet as she can- Red, turn on the "antiglamour" filter
(to Manning) Fairy folk use a spell called "glamour" to seem human and nice- () These lenses allow you to see their real appearance
2 38 ,,f 58
-  58 Bellboy turns a few knobs on the goggles, then raises them
59 59
As a series filters enter the visual field, the bag lady transforms into an ugly, muscle-bound troll
60 60
- Oh, dear Lord
() What about the cats
She eats them
"She
" That's a "she"
We're moving in, Sparky- 61   /  /    61 , Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady
She opens a service - /
62 62 The bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and through a basement door
The room  with the sound of rolling balls and toppling pins
() Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh
(splays his webbed fingers) Bowling balls- they give me trouble
How about a beer, then
Now that we're "out"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr
2 39 Sorry
don't drink
- 63
63 Hellboy and Abe enter the basement: no sign of the old woman
Just a Warehouse- ' Adjust the prisms to "2" Abe moves his glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own- unsuccessfully
Now the   transforms under the new optical elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree trunks and stone columns are visible
- Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty mechanical lock
What the heck is that
locking mechanism- Mmh- 'll take care of it- He clenches his stone fist, rears back
No- You destroy it
We'll never get in- He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock
Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch- Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the- 2 4 0 64 64 -filling it, making a few complex gears turn and move- 65 65 Opens and the floor drops away, revealing a stone staircase
Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off the valves
Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market
66
-  66 Troll Market is a steamy, medieval nightmare
labyrinth of narrow alleys and foetid vapour
Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking through garbage, scattering vermin
Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy puddles
Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and century
At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive) cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men, Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology
dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring
Instead of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another while violent bettors laugh and shout
At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in rags making her way through the crowd
He catches a glimpse of her slippered feet
which flash with pearls and gold embroidery
His curiosity aroused, he follows her
67 67 The woman inspects a pile of ancient bric-a-brac at a market stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly revealing her face
It's the
In these grotesque surroundings, her beauty is transcendent
2 41 Abe is thunderstruck
As she turns to leave, they briefly make eye contact
On her bandaged arm: a bracelet adorned with the seal's coat of arms
(into microphone) Brother Red
() Not now, Abe
As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe hurries after her
68 68
- Hellboy and Johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a surly
Never seen anything like it
No one sells `em down here - over in Jersey, maybe
Behind him, there's a faceless  : a tall and gnarly ogre, his naked chest crisscrossed with scars, his feet encased in iron shoes
Growling, it bares its teeth at
smiles back- Hiya, Chuck- -  69 69 Abe follows the Princess down an alley - and then another one, narrow and dark
Panhandlers pull at his belt; he bats them away
70 70
- Now Johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop owner
What about this
Do you recognize this seal
2 42 The shop owner's face suddenly grows pale
You'd better go
Now
Please
We'll make it worth your while
The shop owner claps his hands
takes two steps forward,
Its iron shoes go -
(') He's not friendly- Hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature
Well, neither am - With a single uppercut, he sends it flying toward the ceiling, shoeless
The shop keeper watches in awe until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the dogfight
The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing with blind instinct
Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him close
The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a boxer's speed bag as  "gently" slaps him around
Teeth fly everywhere
Feeling more chatty now
It's rumors
just- No- don't hit me, all right
There's talk of a revolt- a revolt against the human world- Hellboy releases him, then looks around
Where the hell is Abe
He pushes his belt locator- 2 43 1
,,,d 71
-  71 The Princess has entered a shop selling  and
Abe stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates to purchase a silver and crystal  contained in a safety holding case
The  denies it at first but after the Princess hands him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to her
He extracts the cylinder from its holding case and hands it to her
red locator light flashes on Abe's utility belt
() Hey, Abe, gimme me your twenty- 'm following a lead, Red
Keep your locator -
large  cuts him off- Excuse me- What do you think you're doing
() Are you in trouble
Talk to me, Abe
Another  comes up behind Abe
(') don't think you- The  opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty looking Insect:
(') Oh, my- The second  loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet - into a blowpipe
Abe turns just as he blows
The bug lands on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh
He groans
Abe
What's wrong
2 44 Abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot
But his vision blurs, he staggers forward and falls, face first, onto the cobblestones
() Abe
Come in - Abe
Dammit - 72
-  72 The locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann look at each other
Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the crowd
73
-  73 Abe opens his eyes and slowly gets up
He looks around: he's surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books
The door is locked
Instinctively he looks for his belt- It's not there
If you are looking for your weapons, my guards took them
Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet away
She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in fine silk robes
She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large, featherless /
-  carry no weapons, madam-  assure you
Why were you following me
Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer
He's utterly beguiled by her
(') Are you seeking to join my brother
Your brother-
2 45 In his revolt against the humans
revolt
No, no, no, - You are sorely mistaken
He takes a step forward but the  comes out of nowhere, barking and growling
Then answer me truthfully- Why were you following me
My name is Abe Sapien - () There is no such name
Horrible-  know- but- Please, hear me, beg you
am an agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense
If we can assist you- Give me your hand
Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his palm
The Princess' face brightens
She smiles and gestures for the  to yield
Down Yrdrig - he's a friend
The  jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all three tongues
(') Yrdrig's really just a puppy
The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw
() Nice puppy
The  lifts Abe with one of its mouths and gives him playful shake
2 46 My father gave him to me
Yrdrig, leave our guest alone- The Yrdrig drops Abe onto the floor
(') Out
Out
Bad Yrdrig
As the animal skulks away, she helps Abe up- (') (bows her head) My name is Princess Nuala
(bows his head) Your highness, the honor is all mine
May  apologize, Mr
Sapien, for the manner in which we brought you here
couldn't be too sure
She offers him the locator belt
Please, it was nothing
Love the puppy, - And under diplomatic immunity - may seek asylum
We would be
honored, 'm sure
But, may  ask: from whom do you seek asylum
Suddenly, a  outside
The door flies off its hinges
Hellboy and Johann burst in, leaping over a pile fallen guards outside
Red, no
'm all right
The Princess shrinks back, but Abe motions for calm
Gentlemen
Some respect, please
The Princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards
The   buzz around , who swats them like mosquitoes
2 47 And that was my royal guard
Red, apologize at once
We are in the presence of
royalty
Hellboy's never heard Abe sound like this- giddy as a schoolboy
(to Abe) You're vouching for her,  take it
Mr Sapien
Oh, most definitely
She's from an ancient, noble line - - of warriors
The Children of the Earth

With such a fierce bloodline, we cannot take your claim of allegiance at face value
He produces the

-  74 Standing at a long deal table, the Princess lights a candle and examines the ancient seal
Where did you get this
Human side, two nights ago- The Princess studies their faces
In ancient times a seal like this was delivered to the enemy as a declaration of war
signal from the underground realm to the entire world
It prefaced the awakening of the Golden Army- Johann sits down heavily
feared as much

What-

Johann shakes his glass head, overcome with worry
Golden Army
The unstoppable tide
There has been nothing to substantiate such a - Not a tale- At the dawn of time
Even before the great flood, man and the Children of the Earth shared this planet
(she sighs) But as man in his greed expanded his dominion, there ensued a bitter war

Two for the sons of the Earth
So, you do need our help

She extends it: the map just shows three coordinates
Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here- But nothing else- She rolls back the map into the cylinder
So far, this is a family matter

Hellboy dives, just in time to catch it
He's about to throw it down a sewer, when he listens to its clockwork innards then:
It's a dud, your royal assness -

How do you like that

Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in fascination
Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden

Flames leap up
The Elemental grins with delight, turning his baleful gaze on the Princess
As she shrinks back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling
In a single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel
Good dog
(to Elemental) Now, Woody
You want to fight someone, you fight with me
Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee
The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off
(to the Princess) This may not be the best place for you, your majesty
With your permission
He offers the Princess his arm
She takes it and allows Abe to lead her away
moment later, the Elemental smashes the ground where they had been standing
Every time the  moves, he trails behind roots and branches
The roots connecting to its feet and leading to the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord
Johann sees this- 2 58 have a plan- He looks at Abe- 87      87 -as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the garbage truck
Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine

Growing and discarding branches and roots

Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section of the corridor as Hellboy runs

-  90 Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of reach of the Elemental
(to the Elemental) What now, Big Boy
You get a ladder
The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him, barking in frustration
Hellboy's  crackles: (on the radio) This is Blue
The Princess is fine
2 59 So what
So, lead him to the bridge
Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn Bridge in the distance
That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl
You'll figure it out
What's at the bridge
Abe -
Liz
Hello
No answer
Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing neon sign reading "Hotel"
The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"
so Hellboy climbs the "0" to the roof
91
-  91 Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge
Johann is sitting next to her
92
-  92 Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building
He sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice
and almost loses his grip
He hangs on for dear life
Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent roof
As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental pulls down a
wall of water rolls toward Hellboy, like an ocean wave
Hellboy leaps to the next roof
and the water shoots over the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below
93
-  93 Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge
Using binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy bringing the Elemental closer
2 60 Johann - they're almost here
Johann moves among massive construction machinery
He stops at a stack of heavy
Abe comes running, pointing at the cable
Yes
had the very same idea
He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine which holds a half mile of steel cable
(gazing at the controls) but how do you operate this
If you'll permit me
Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into the mechanism
Instantly, the diesel engine
(to Abe) Stand back, Abe
hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable
It splashes down near the far shore of the East River
Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the other side
(seeing Hellboy coming) Quickly, Abe
94    94 Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water
Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan shore
95   -  95 Hellboy makes it to the bridge
as, behind him, the Elemental wades into the river, pushing aside boats and barges
2 61 96 96 Abe makes it to the other side, surfacing with the cable, towing it to a half-submerged pontoon
(') (on the radio) Macht schnell
Abe - make it fast
The cable is a yard short of the anchor point
Abe tugs on - need more
No more available
The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as he encounters the submerged cable
97 97 Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down
past rusting cars, oil drums
and a couple of rotting , their feet in tubs of cement
Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him unconscious
Blood seeps from his wound
98 98 As Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone calling out from above: (to Hellboy) Haven't you managed to kill it yet
You, who were so eager for a fight
The Prince is standing on top of the tower
He points at Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental
(to the Elemental) Over here, dear friend
The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet
Hellboy wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages
2 62 The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel spire, his coat flapping in the night wind
This might be a good chance for you to come to your senses
Help us
've been all through this
The answer's still no
Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable, bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a steel snake
The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the Elemental and tightening around his ankles
The cable - (to Liz) Burn the roots
Burn them
i He points at the roots trailing into the river
Liz concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet
Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the river
With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he tosses Hellboy high into the air
On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings back and forth like a red monkey
He lands atop of the Elemental's back, right behind his head
Nap time, Big guy- He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back of the neck
The cable tenses- -The Elemental pitches forward- The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at him; his mouth opens as if to scream
The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop the bridge
exactly where the Prince had been standing
Putting an end, it seems, to both of them
2 63 The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy leaves
strangely beatific and precious change
Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges, bleeding, but alive
Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly, laughing and happy to be together
Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at him
Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance, jealous, alone
: 99
-  99 Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan again and again at a target in the dark firing range
Hits a button, brings the paper close for inspection
Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye
Suddenly, from the next alley,
Johann leans over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke
You'll permit a small criticism
You take too much time to aim, to think
Nein
Just point- like afinger- as if you wish for something
Oh,  wish for something
Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster of shots, dead center
Speed is of the essence
You must work on it
'm willing to spend some - Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's onto the floor
Hey, watch it
You're winding me up, don't like it
2 64 On the contrary
100
-  100 Hellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where Johann stands at a mirror, polishing his glass head with a terry cloth towel
You keep wiping that thing like she's gonna care
She- Who-
You know who- She- () She's not gonna care
(long beat) You think 'm after Liz, don't you
(Hellboy walks out) Well, 'm not
Why not
() Not good enough for you
Hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind Johann
Well- From now on, you don't come near her
You don't talk to her- You forget
'm part of the team now, such interactions are inev- Well- you better start making them "evitable"- That's not a word- Yes, it is- 2 65 No, it isn't- Hellboy raises his stone fist
Now it is- Oh,  see- you want to punch me- That's how you win an argument
try
Well, you're big, 'll give you that much- "Give me
"- You don't give me sh- -and you're strong- but you're slow
Slo-
Very- slow- 've seen your fighting style
Very slow- -
Hellboy cracks Johann over the head with his massive fist
To his surprise, the Johann's glass ball cranium shatters
Slow enough for ya-
With a loud , Johann's odd suit sags to the floor
Ow- Johann
buddy
Sorry- - - got carried away
(leaning over the empty suit) Johann
You still hear me
An ectoplasmic  reaches out from the suit and penetrates the closest locker
It was an accident, okay
'll get you some help- 2 66 With a
-- the bank of lockers comes to life
Metal doors smack Hellboy's head repeatedly, like a pinball machine
his face imprinted in the metal
See
Speed is the key
The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers and wanders away
The locker room doors open and close as he goes by
Hellboy tries to stand, wobbles and sits
Chicken shit
: -  101 101 Abe floats in his tank, smiling at the Princess, who's at one of the book stands, reading to him

Now, he's near and he's looking for me

Men

But they need our help and patience
You were very brave, vouching for me
How do you know 'm not the enemy, bringing me here
It's as you were saying,  suppose
From intuition, feeling
've never met anyone like you
but that's my instinct
They gaze fondly at each other through the glass, as bubbles swirl out of Abe's gills

'  - Liz is patching Hellboy's injured head
In the background the 's are playing up:  ,   and some programming
He caught me off-guard- but 'll get him next time
He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc
There shouldn't be a "next time" we're all part of the same team
2 68 We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac
You can see right through him
() That's a joke, Liz
Liz remains silent
(raises a letter) Look
They wanna do a cartoon series, based on me
And this: (he holds up a box of cereal) Product endorsement - breakfast of demons
And a videogame
As   ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume up
Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It always gets me- Red- There's something need to- (taking the remote) No, wait
(switching to Leno) Look that's us- Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident
So- this "Hellboy" what is he
Is he really on our side
mean, he's red, has a tail and shaves his horns- horns, Ladies and Gentleman
Horns are never a good sign
() Ha- He's funny
Maybe we should have him come over and talk to us a little, uh
Whaddayathink
The crowd roars
That's a great idea, don't you think
2 69 No,  don't- Did you know that during the commercial breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the guest can't talk to Jay
keeps the conversation fresh
How do you know these things
read it in  Guide
You're really liking this, aren't you
We should do this- It's a bad idea
All of it- Do you really need everybody to like you
What's in it for you
Are we not enough
She leaves
Hellboy glances at Leno on : a dog outfitted in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball balanced on its nose
Hellboy chuckles
That's funny

-  103 Liz is looking out into Trenton 's light landscape
Johann approaches her
Are you alright-
Liz nods weakly
May  be of assistance
Maybe
2 70 He's a big brute, isn't he
Liz chuckles
But he has a good heart

He means well

In what way, Mein Frau
Just a mistake- nothing important

Lis looks at him with renewed interest

long, long time ago
And only after  lost her- realized that my life would never be quite the same- And my loss lead me to become what  am today
Johann's human face materializes inside his glass helmet
-  tried constantly to make contact with her- : -   -  104 104  -  2001 Johann's mouth opens and out of it emerges a large tendril of ectoplasm
His neck engorges and the substance continues to flow freely out of his mouth and fingertips-- It was only there- in the Ethereal plane that  ever gazed upon her again
close in on several ceremonial candles burning in the room
Their flame illuminating the eerie scene

They cross to- 105    105 Once there- they reform into humanoid shapes, vaguely reminiscent of their mortal bodies

' But it was there, while he was partially on the ethereal plane, that disaster - He is about to embrace his wife's form when a horrible rumble occurs and the void bursts in flames, destroying and distorting everything around him- His wife's shape screams and evaporates
106
-  106 agents break in on the scene
Smoke and flames billow in the room, wax puddles stand where the were and seated around the seance table, charred corpses hold hands in eternal contact
As the Agents move around a pale, vaporous shape emerges from the soot-stained darkness: It's Johann
' All the seance attendees were incinerated
The only survivor -and only to some extent- was me- Why
'll never -- The form moves towards its body and attempts to climb back and reanimate it, but the   is barely amble to amble a few steps forward before collapsing into ash and bone
The shape of Ectoplasm stands there, alone and lost- Then, Professor   wanders into the scene and approaches the form- ' It was then that Professor Broom and the devised a containment suit for me

He brought me back to life- He grows silent for a brief moment
But 've never been able to see her again
My reach became limited- My loss, infinite
Liz puts her hand on his shoulder
Johann takes it
Loss- the very threat of it makes us vulnerable
makes us care- You can see that, don't you
Without her  became but an empty shell
Liz leans her head on his shoulder
Don't give up on him

Liz chuckles
No

He stops, puzzled
Strains of Barry Manilow are emanating from the library
109
-  109 Hellboy enters the library and goes over to the tank
Abe is there, listening to Vivaldi
2 73 Ah, hello Red
You're up late
Liz and - we had a fight- - Hellboy eyes the  player
Did  hear Barry Manilow just now
(smiles hypocritical) Barry - oh, Gosh- no- no- (fast, stammering) It was er- urm- Vivaldi
Il cimento dell'armonia  believe  particularly admire the passage
Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's  player
The music stops and he pulls out a different  from the changer
What's happening to you
Ooh- Ooh- () All my life  thought  was alone, a made- up name and a random pasted on a cylinder
But then  saw her- She's like me
creature from another world
Alone
Brother Red-  think 'm in love
You say that like it's a good thing
(looks at the ) What track
() Track eight- () Oh, God- you're disgusting- know- 2 74 "Can't smile without you" 'd cry, but  don't have the glands for it
() What am  going to do, Red
Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs heavily, looks around- miss him- Father- don't you
() Everyday
He would tell what to do- He would tell what's right- what's wrong- He did that for all of us
The opening strings of "Can't Smile Without You
" (sips beer) You know
-  never much appreciated Manilow's artistry that much- until now- Now it seems to be a grand poet and speaks directly to my innermost feelings
Jeez- You need to get out more- The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the syrupy music
Then, slowly, the two of them start singing: low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and teary-eyed
110 110
- The Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then feels a chill down her spine
She shudders and moves to the panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the distant city lights below

dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening and watching

All of them dressed in
This is a whole new ballgame and  want you to take my lead

-  113 Three gleaming Hummers await them
2 76 gift from General Motors
One for each of you
Each Hummer has custom paint: Hellboy's with scenes of Dante's inferno, Liz's with flames and Abe's with an underwater vista
This is more like it
'm not driving that- Abe has opened the hood on his Hummer
This is a most unfortunate vehicle
The sheer waste of precious fossil fuels
An American custom, it's called product placement
What's the harm
: --  114 114 mob of   outside the  studio
The frenzy intensifies when they see the Hummers pulling up
As the  team exits the cars, autograph seekers break through the   and swarm around the heroes
Every agent on the field is on the case
They will solve it-- Hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a flourish
There you go, pal
"To Jason, best wishes, Hellboy
" (squints at the signature) How am  supposed to read that
You don't like it
2 77 Irritated, he scowls at the fan
Manning takes him by the elbow and leads him away
(to the fan) That turns up on e-Bay, 'm gonna find you, "Jason"

Manning sits in the first one, looking at himself in the mirror
Can you do anything about this

(lowers his voice) -double chin
No, you're not being made up
Why not
They said, you're too normal
You don't need anything
But- Believe me- 'm not normal at all

2 So, what color is that- green
Carribbean Blue, actually
to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest
3 Are these really scars
Well, yeah
Each one tells a story- His grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz
He abruptly gets up and goes to them
2 78 That about you, glass-man
few squirts of Windex
'm not going on
And if  may- a word of - (long beat, then sotto voce) -it's not a good idea to hint that you two have

Thanks a bunch
'll decide that
You don't know how people may react
It's a love story
They'll lap it up
know you don't like me, but trust me on this one

Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't have approved of your behaviour

He manipulates a wooden marionette:   in
In the distance- lights, bright lights and the train
The Puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves to the edge of the platform alongside other passengers
The lights grow in intensity and the  becomes deafening
But something's wrong, really, wrong- Hooy na ny
The lights are in reality, the eyes of a giant dragon and it roars into the platfrom, demolishing pillars, crushing people and eating the puppeteer in a matter of second
Pandemonium ensues

Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we saw some extraordinary things on
And tonight you're in for more

Please extend a warm, warm welcome to Hellboy, Liz Sherman, Abe Sapien, and Special Agent Tom Manning
Uproarious applause as the  team comes out and make their way to the couch

The massive Yrdrig is curled up at her feet
2 80 Wow, So - He's pointing at Manning
what planet are you from
Washington,

It's hot and inhospitable to human life
Funny
(to Liz) Why are you just "Liz" and not Fire Girl

Hey, we do call her Sparky now and then
chuckle from the crowd
Hellboy smiles in satisfaction
(to Abe) And you, Abe
Is it uncomfortable at night with that toilet seat around your neck
The Princess smiles as the camera singles out Abe for a closeup
Actually, Mr
Leno, my lungs are more like gills
need to convert the air's nitrogen into oxygen, otherwise 'd suffocate in five minutes
() Gotcha
We call that stand-up comedy

This is turning unpleasant

Cameras zoom in on this
Whoa
What's that- Are you two an item
Uh

Sounds like you're contemplating marriage
(after a big pause) You know, Jay, we are- together
We are
Rumble of consternation from the audience
Uh oh
Manning,  think your polls just tanked
He turns to see the map- lit like a christmas tree
Mein Gott- 121 121 Leno smiles at the audience, which is buzzing
Folks, this is modern America

What's a little inter-species romance in this day and age

Then, may  ask what you're doing here
Shouldn't you be out protecting humanity instead of hooking up with our women
At last, Hellboy explodes
Bellowing, he rips up the desk and throws it through the backdrop

- The Princess snaps off the , looking worried
Alone with her thoughts, she examines the curved gold piece hanging from a chain around her neck
She closes her eyes and shudders - trouble is near
The Yrdgrig wakes up and whimpers

From her waistband, she produces a long, thin  and wields it timidly
Somewhere in the building,  start clanging
The Yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs
With a , it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest trolls
As the fighting creatures crash into the spiral staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice: Hold
The Prince steps into the room, carrying a long spear
The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to kill him
Come-
The trolls release the Yrdrig and bound over to the Prince
The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by the neck and brutally twists -
The animal's three mouths yelp and cough, fighting for air

No
Where is your sense of shame
You mingle with

Manning and Hellboy jump out of their vehicle and see - 2 85 - a couple of dead  sprawled on the loading dock
What in God's name-
Hellboy, Abe, Liz and Johann race past him, disappearing into the building
The alarm bells are deafening

Several  employees are lying on the floor, wounded and confused
129
129 The top-level human agents are clustered in the lobby, their guns drawn, all of them aiming at the Prince and his drooling bodyguards
Standoff
As Hellboy and the team arrive, Abe sees the Princess, her arms tied
Her brother holds her by the hair
Princess
Without thinking, he darts forward
Instantly, one of the trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest- Abe
No, get back
Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to the desperate features of the beautiful young woman
Hellboy manages to restrain him
Mr
Sapien, don't
He'll kill you
'll kill you all, if that's what you want
No
Why don't you just start with me
Hellboy strolls up to the Prince
You challenge-me
2 86 You bet your ass  do- Your weapon of choice
(holds up his massive hand) Five-fingered Mary
In the background, Manning arrives, wide-eyed
Just in time to see the Prince hand off his captive to one of the trolls
He drops back, flips his spear to horizontal and waits for Hellboy's attack
130 130 Hellboy feints left, goes right and whips around, swinging his tail at the Prince
The Prince leaps and jabs with the spear, poking a hole in Hellboy's coat
The surrounding crowd backs away as the combatants circle each other
The Prince is nimble
The Prince is quick
He thrusts the spear again and again, driving Hellboy into a display case full of antique weapons
The glass breaks and a number of swords and axes fall to the floor
(to Hellboy) Arm yourself
Use the flail
Not my style
Watch and learn, fish bowl
He punches the Prince, hard
The blow knocks the Prince to his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal combination
In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back and forth, as if struck
moan of pain escapes from her lips
(seeing this) , no
Stop - you mustn't harm him
As the Prince totters, Hellboy turns to look at Abe, momentarily distracted- Then- 2 87 Hellboy grimaces and looks down: the Prince's   is half-buried in his chest
The Prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank, breaking off the blade
Hellboy's eyes roll upward; Liz She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he collapses
The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans
His eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy's side
(showing off the Princess) If you want to see her again, you'll give me what's rightfully mine
Many people died for that crown
Bring it to me
He and his trolls escape into the night

In -, Abe's webbed fingers lightly touch the glinting metal that protrudes from Hellboy's sternum

Abe, stop studying
Pull the friggin' thing out, why don't you
Liz, 'm sorry
It's a magical alloy
Every time  touch it, it moves closer to his heart
() Come here, 'll show you
Liz backs away, shaking her head
No
don't want to see it
(to Johann) We've got to do something
2 88 cannot reverse the magic- we have to look for the Prince or somebody that can help Red
Go after that son-of-a-bitch and get him to reverse the spell
He'll demand the gold piece- So
We find it
We give it to him-

- Johann walks into the control room
In every screen a crisis situation is visible
,   shows a Yeti at large in Nebraska and a Plesiosaurus at large in Scotland, etc, etc- lupgarou loose in Picadilly, a Winged creature nesting in a skyscraper- We have a situation in almost every point of the map
Johann looks back at a map with  indicators signaling each crisis in the globe
They keep turning on a dozen a second
The Rebellion's spreading too fast- The only way to stop it is to stop the Prince

-  135 Abe enters the dark, soaking library and surveys the ruins of his tank
He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in pieces on the floor
He comes up with his copy of "Jane Eyre
" He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece
Any luck
Liz has come in behind him
Abe quickly palms the precious thing in his webbed hand
No
Sorry
It doesn't matter
No -
No
Forget the gold piece
Let's us just find this royal asshole
() Fire and water, me and you, Abe
We'll kick his ass
Abe looks supremely troubled
Abe, let's do this for Red
Abe nods, unable to find a good answer
He manages to tuck the gold piece into his belt
: 136
-  136 Abe stands at a lectern
Behind him, a projected image of the Princess' map from the troll market
His finger traces the strange, elvish text
2 90 The map contained within the cylinder seems useless- () Now the case itself proves very useful- He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map
Glyphs and coordinates become visible
silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too
Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her brother were born there
They hold it sacred
Even if you're right, we sit tight and locate the gold piece, make sure he never ever gets his hands on it
If there's any truth to this legend, the fate of the world depends on it
What about Red
Don't you care about him
moment of silence
Nobody knows what to say
Finally: Liz
That may be his destiny
Manning is right: we can't take the chance
Liz glares at him
see
Red was right about you
Welcome to the team, Johann
And goodbye
She leaves the room

His cats purr all around him, oblivious to his pain
He sits by the bed
Liz enters the room
He smiles weakly at her- 2 91 Don't worry, Sparky- It's all going to be - Abe stands nearby, in silence
Liz looks at him, teary-eyed
We'll make it alright
Screw Manning- You are right, Liz- We should just do this together: the three of us
Liz smiles

Engine, starting- refer to -7488-

Here's an easy way to remember that "port" means "left
" They each have four- from the door: it's Johann
Good evening, friends
Don't try to stop us, Johann
2 92 On the contrary
've been giving it some thought, and we should be able to save Hellboy
After all, the Prince lacks the gold crown
Without it, his army poses no threat
None at all
Abe is very quiet
(in despair) Its useless- - - can't-  can't pilot this thing
Johann sits down in the co-pilot seat and melds with the controls
'll give it a try- Abe smiles at the sound of the engines starting up
140 140
- Manning bangs on a vending machine in one of the corridors
As a dribble of hot coffee splatters into his cup, a couple of  run up
Sir - you'd better come, fast - Got it - ow
He burns his fingers on the coffee as he hurries after the agents
141 141
- The  airplane is , amid clouds of exhaust fumes
The plane spins around and around in tight circles, its wing tips knocking into ladders, lights and shelves
bunch of agents are cowering in the doorway as Manning arrives
Not  of them, it's not possible
Isn't that Johann at the controls
2 93 Sure enough, they get a glimpse of the transparent head through the cockpit window
Abe's there, too
He raises a webbed hand to wave goodbye
The plane taxis outside onto the runway
142
-  142 and takes off, barely under control, just missing the New Jersey treetops
: 143  143 The Prince pulls the Princess through fractured, roaring tunnels
Here and there, the walls are pierced, allowing light and ocean waves to enter
Rounding a few corners, the Prince stops near a wall decorated with a large, elaborate
It shows a stylized family tree, hunting scenes and naive renderings of trolls, faeries and ogres
Maybe this will help you remember who we are, who you are
What our destiny is- The Prince pushes his sister through a low doorway, out onto - 144  144 -overlooking a vast cavern, big as a stadium, lit by a thousand torches
The mechanical  stands knee-deep in heaving seawater and foam
They - they - will be mine to command, whether you like it or not
Only after our victory will you appreciate my sacrifice
and yours
145
-  145 The  plane exits a bank of clouds and starts its descent upon an Irish island surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean
2 94 Massive granite mountains encircle an impossibly green valley
146
-  146 Early sunlight washes over Hellboy's body, who weakly groans in Liz's arms
(to Liz) Where are we, Liz
Near the ocean, Red
We'regonna make you well here
147
, -  147 148 :,
148 The back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and - 149
-  149 Liz and Abe help Hellboy up to a gnarled , twisted by eons of wind
Abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar, weird tree
This should be the portal
By all rights- Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully
Abe, bring the mapcase over here
He's found a roundish  in the tree, where the lowest branch joins the trunk
Abe slips the map back into its crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a perfect fit
Yes
Try it, Abe- 2 95 Before you do anything
remember what we're in for
world unlike anything we've ever known
Dangerous, deceptive
You're wasting time
Abe inserts and twists the cylinder
The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground, bending them into a swaying arch
Dangerous, deceptive
and hard to leave
They walk under the tree roots, into
150 150 transformed landscape
perpetual nightland- Still overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing with pale colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours
The men start down the hill, into a valley bordered by a rugged coastline
: 151
-  151 The team reaches the stony shore of a mile-wide inlet
Abe brings out the map
(pointing to the opposite shore) Renvyle is over there
They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat
Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air
speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the shallows directly in front of them
By his side, sitting atop of a tree:   and a  observe the group
bid you welcome, strangers
Would you be seeking safe passage to Renvyle
2 96 Yes
Can you help us
() Careful, Liz
'm sure you can come to an understanding
The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the rocks
He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little coracle
Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns
Room enough for all of you
(looks at Hellboy) Even your weary friend
What will it cost, boatman
The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of triangular teeth
Ah, next to nothing
Make me an offer
Abe, Johann and Liz confer among themselves: How much
He won't want money
(to the goblin) have a
belt
Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it in front the creature's bat-like face
have no use for such a thing
Liz shows him her binoculars
Here
is a wonderful set of eyes, magic eyes that will bring the world- 2 97 already have binoculars
No,  see something special
He points toward Hellboy's chest
Under his bandage -
Quick as a squirrel, the creature hops to Hellboy's side and brings out a
In one sweep of the blade, he reveals 's terrible wound, and the speartip protruding from it
That
(points at the steel) That - in exchange for your crossing
Don't you touch it -
She rushes to Hellboy's side, pushing the Goblin back, ready for a fight
The Goblin shrugs
Is it so precious to you
Let me pull it out
You mustn't
One touch can kill him
The Goblin's eyes grow wide with understanding
Ah
see
We must go to the Angel of - He'll know what to do
152
-  152 The tiny boat is a dot on the golden waves of the inlet as the Goblin rows them to the opposite shore and docks near a cove
The Goblin leads the way as Liz, Abe and Johann arrive and help Hellboy up
2 98 Strange  hang upside down form the Cave's roof has been carved out of the cave's rock at the other end
Black, ancient figure is hunched there, warming its skeletal hands by the fire
raspy voice utters something in an ancient language
The Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the floor
In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the crackling fireplace
The    extends its and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale, eyeless face
So
This one
The boy-  remember him well
Anung-un-Rama
Oh, my God
She knows -
helped bring him into this world - in my fashion
It pulls a set of a glowing, red-hot  out of the fire
It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in Hellboy's flesh
(') warn you: it is his destiny to rule over the destruction of the Earth
Not now, not tomorrow - but some day
You are sure you want him to live
Yes,  say yes-
Abe and Johann exchange a silent, worried look
Very well, then- but let it be said: The day will come when you will pay the price fire girl: This will bring you and the world much sorrow
And 'll deal with it when that time comes
Now save him
The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the tongs
cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody point from his chest
2 99 The    holds up the speartip and looks at it with distaste
Harmless now
(looking at Hellboy) See -
Hellboy's eyes flutter open
(to Hellboy) Sleep now, child
Your strength, it will return
guttural  from the corner: the Goblin is jumping up and down, pointing at the speartip
Our ferry captain - he wants his payment
Ach, outside with you
She tosses the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up and bounds out the door
instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around him, chattering in excitement over the latest prize
She gazes down at Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on her
He smiles wanly
: 153
-  153 Alone on a hilltop, Abe surveys the coastline
Through the binoculars, he discerns a   half-hidden behind wild, breaking waves
Glancing back at   's cave, Johann strikes off on his own, headed for the cave
154
-  154 Outside   's hut, a bandaged  is sitting up, blinking in the sunlight
He sips some tea and gazes at Liz, who is happy now
2 100 almost lost you- Hellboy smiles and grabs her hand- thought you were mad at me
Well, no one can stay mad forever
'm sorry for all the attention, thought it would be good for us
We're never going to make them all happy, Red
What we have is ours and no one '- can turn my back on the world
don't care anymore  don't- as long as you stay with me- as long as you think 'm still a good man
( ) Am  a good man, Liz
Am
Yes you are
You are the best man 've ever met
You still seem sad
Is there anything you want to tell me-
Yes, there is- Say it now, then
Whatever it is, 'm ready
() Is it about Johann- No- no- what are you talking about
Before she can go on, Johann appears
He carries a poultice and fresh rags
2 101 Abe and  have found the entrance to the Golden Army's resting place- Liz come with us- (looks at Hellboy) You should stay behind and get some rest- And call you in the morning, right
Like Hell  will
'm keeping an eye on you, - : 155 155
- Johann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff high over the sea
Johann refers to the map, then points to the cave opening a half-mile ahead
Abe is standing there, - There
Abe points at the violent sea below- The only way in- 'm afraid we'll have to jump in- (looks at Hellboy) Can you make it-
Hellboy nods
Strange
If this is the entrance- know- Why isn't there more security
With a ,
- jumps out and throws a  around Bellboy's neck
The chain is connected to his   which now dangles around Hellboy's neck
The two creatures battle each other fiercely
's destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects twice with Hellboy's head
But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in two and twirling the mace like a boleador
2 102 He hits Wink again and again- See
It hurts
It hurts
Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then, like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead
With a mighty , Hellboy tosses him overboard
hits the jagged rocks once- twice- thrice- Ouch- ouch- ouch- (looking around) We better go swimming before any more ugly fellas show up- He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding
The wound has re-opened
Red, are you-
Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on- 156 156 Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by the rough seas
moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the water, too
Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the cave entrance
157
-  157 As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling
Liz starts coughing
Hang on, people
'll be right back
158 158 Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron  six feet under the surface
He tries to turn the control wheel, but can't make it budge
2 103 Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in his huge hands
Using all his strength, Hellboy finally manages to turn it
His bandage, however, floats free
and his wound opens up, emitting a plume of blood
Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface
Johann stays behind and swings open the lock, revealing
159   159 carved from the living rock, leading upward into the depths of the cliff
: 160  -  160 The trio cautiously climbs the stairs, finding their way with light sticks
Hellboy stops to lean against the wall
He dabs at his chest with a rag
(to Johann) Hold up
We need to rest
Says who
'm fine,  tell ya
He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off his pain
(to Johann) This was a mistake
He's - Mein Gott-- The stairs lead to- 161
161 -a vast underground arena where a thousand torches are flickering
to reveal rank upon rank of Immobile
Silent
Waiting
2 104 162    162 Hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues, pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the infantrymen
Hey, amigo
You got some gum
Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that terminates the arms of each soldier
Most ingenious
versatile, highly mobile killing machine
Make that machines, Johann
see more than one
Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms faintly, sending  up into the dark cavern
Wow
You hear that
Listen - He thumps it, harder
The mechanical thing rocks backwards
Uh oh
The thing falls onto the soldier behind it
Then, the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as - a toppling    races away like falling dominoes
Whoops
The sound dwindles, then builds again as   of falling soldiers bears down on them
Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside
The soldiers crash past them until - - the din suddenly stops
The  stands revealed at the head of the column
2 105 As a boy, they say  enjoyed toy soldiers
So do you,  see
He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick aside some of the weapons
(to Hellboy) You're bleeding
Most unfortunate
Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound
Yeah
Now it's your turn
Do you envy these contraptions
They never bleed
They feel nothing
Not even the zest of combat
The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann
These fighting men are the very model of patience
merely awaiting word from their lawful commander
From his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold segments
he fits them together
You have the remaining piece,  presume
We do not - () Then you are most foolish
He gestures to some troll  near a tunnel entrance
They lead the Princess out in chains
(') You came here expecting what
Mercy
The death you would unleash will never happen
What you need is far from here and will stay out of your reach forever
2 106 reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind them
Stop -  have it
Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in the palm of his hand
() Here
For her
Take it
Oh, my God
What has he done
Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece to the Prince
Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed
Abe - (to Hellboy) You cannot fight him- not without hurting her
( ) What would you do if it was Liz
The Prince fits the gold parts together and places the resulting crown on his head
am Prince Nuada and  command my army to life once more
Does anyone dispute my right
With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army comes to life
Up comes the lances and shields
(') (points at the team) Kill them
Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back
(to the Prince) That was your price
ransom, you said - paid in good faith
() 2 107 (continued) (to Hellboy) Why, he lied to us
Abe old buddy
If we survive this, we need to talk
The Army swings into action, marching toward them
The four friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls
He - he's a cad
Can you imagine, a highborn heir to the throne, last in a noble line of- Not now, Abe, okay
The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their terrifying weapons slashing in unison
Hellboy brings out his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and swings it like a club
couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms
Let me - Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each hand
With a yell, she unleashes a searing  at the oncoming fighters
The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening scores of soldiers
For a moment, the  team regains hope
but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming, marching on and over their scorched comrades
Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it his best
His wound is running with fresh blood
He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect
At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on
Invincibility
So - the only one thing may stop them - Johann unzips his suit; with a , his ectoplasmic self flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier
2 108 Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts chopping
Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as Johann rips into the enemy
But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen
As the  team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell is surrounded by the other , who methodically dismember it like marauding insects
As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless, Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit
Ach
They are too many
Anyone have another idea
Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his feet
(a bellow) Prince Nuada:  challenge your right to command this army
With a soft , the clockwork troops come to a halt
All the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a ledge with his sister
(follows ) No= please- no- Hellboy moves away from him
challenge must be answered
Raise your sword
challenge from you
nobody
You are no one
No
He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the Fallen one- He has the right
Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way
The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks up his sword
2 10 9 Very well
(to the  team) May his fate show you the cost of pride and blindness
As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords- Hellboy's too weak- Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army
Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe looks at him, pleading, and  has no choice but to keep parrying off his enemy
Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in dismay as it trembles
His muscles can no longer respond
The Prince is ready to kill him
(witness to a nightmare) No
sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps forward and
Using her concealed , she   in the right arm
In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger
Instantly, the Prince drops his arm
his hands come away red with blood
He looks over at his sister
They share a hard look of mutual understanding
Love and hatred
Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding
He quickly raises his sword
The fight resumes, but this time,  has the advantage
He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest
- have- won- No
You have not- 2 110 He impales himself on 's sword
The blade goes through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side
Hellboy pulls it out, but it's too late
Both the Prince and the Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded
() - Abe hurries to the Princess
Takes her into his arms, blinking in despair
The pale young creature is now a ghostly white
She lifts her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face
We'll find each other again, somewhere
And she dies in his arms
In the center of the arena: (to Hellboy) You
think you're any different from me
The humans - they will tire of you
They will disappoint you
And in the end, they will betray you
You
are living a lie
Your time will come again
May you make a better choice
Then, he, too, is dead
Both him and his sister turn to fine, pale dust
And the wind carries away the ashes from Abe's hands
Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head
Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities
Suddenly, he rips it into pieces
As he crushes the first segement
an entire division of the golden army collapses into a heap of scrap metal
Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and another massive division of the army tumbles into junk
is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when it explodes in his hands
The last of the army disintegrates
Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards: 2 111 (to the trolls) You - and your kind
Leave here
And stay in the shadows - where you belong
As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at Hellboy
He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words
: 163 163
- The  team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through the magical hills
Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance
164 164
-- They reach the strange, twisted tree
Johann takes the map cylinder and fits it into the slot
Any last minute requests
(very quiet) Do it, please
- 'm ready for the real world now
Johann turns the cylinder
The tree roots form their arch
and the  team walks through
165 165
- On the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the countryside, looking for them
Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere
() Whoa
Where'd you come from
We were just- know, here to help
Well,  appreciate that Manning
2 112 Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment pack
Yes, Mr
Manning
want to thank you, too
For all you've done for us over the years
He gives his stuff to the astonished agent
What
What, exactly is this
(walking away) quit
Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and shrugs off his pack, too
Come on
You're resigning
Looks that way, doesn't it
Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun back
(') think 'll keep this
He finally meets Liz's gaze
She crosses to him and takes him by the arm
She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging tightly to the big, red daemon
Liz -- not you, too
(to Johann) They can't do this
Stop them, Johann- Manning, you're an asshole
166
-  166 Miles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections
Liz and  sit next to each other on some mossy rocks
Overhead: blue sky, puffy white clouds
2 113 What you said before - about us living - mean it
`Course, 'm thinking
but, hey - you decide
(breathing deep) Let's find a place in the country
Clean air - green hills - fresh milk from the farm
Milk
Yech
yard
With lots of room to grow in
(he looks blank) Grow
who gonna grow-
Our baby, that's who
Our b-
On Hellboy's immense grin:
Roll
At the end of the credits- 167
- 5   helicopters land on the hard, icy surface of Amundsen's glacier
row of  in black garb flank each helicopter
Out of one of them exits  , billionare, madman
He carries a mechanized container, a little larger than a hat box
follows as he enters through a crevace and
168
,  - Light shines through the ice walls and into rows and rows of machinery
