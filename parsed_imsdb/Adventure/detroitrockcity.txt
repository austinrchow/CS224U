She carries a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, Erma Bombeck's The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic Tank
"We've Only Just Begun," Mrs
Bruce crouches next to her wildly-ancient entertainment center complete with 8-track
She flips the first record forward on her Ronco Record Mate
Album after album flaps forward
Olivia Newton-John, Neil Diamond, the Osmond Brothers
She stops on the Carpenters and sighs at the serene cover art
Just what the doctor ordered
Placing the vinyl on the turntable, she  the dustcover closed and  "Play
" Reclining in her Lazyboy, she sips her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of Karen Carpenter
Suddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun
Caustic  ''  assaults her senses
She jumps, spilling her wine all over herself
This isn't the Carpenters
'
Racing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand
The music is even louder now
Flustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover
It's stuck
She screams and covers her ears
This is Hell
Running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to reach the plug, but can't
Fingertips millimeters away
As the cacophony  she shakes the entire stereo with all her frantic might
The needle scrapes across the vinyl with a shrill, finally coming to a stop
Whew, silence
Then, , the dustcover opens unceremoniously
Shaken, she grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label

Bruce's blood boils
The devil's music
'  - small, two-story house amid a suburban neighborhood of other two-story houses
Uninspired architecture
Spindly trees
Two-car garage
faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across which shadows frantically dart
Over the , we hear , -  ''
, , inhuman
to the cellar window
Inside we see four who are to blame for the racket
Band practice
' / - An inner-sanctum of  devotion
Faux-wood paneling is plastered with countless  posters, pictures, fold-outs
The ceiling is wallpapered with more  posters
dolls, magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag-carpeted floor
Fast food wrappers heap over the  garbage pail
The four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast a familiar tune offensively off-key
" wanna rock 'n' roll all night and party every day
" They stink, but they sure are trying hard
Meet the band "Mystery
" Concert tee-shirts, holey jeans, total burn-outs
, a scraggily-haired, disenchanted youth, strains his vocal chords on the microphone as he  at his rhythm guitar
Hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but knowing the others, that doesn't say much
a bass with earnest determination
Lanky with bad posture, Lex is already sporting worry lines
He takes everything way-too-seriously
lead guitar like he's hammering nails
All id, Trip is slightly out of his mind
But, is it the chemicals or just his chemistry
He always wears a knit cap
, a sensitive kid (but no wuss),  on his drums like a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart
The big drum bears the word "Mystery" painted on its skin with a lightning "" just like the  logo
They bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and thrust their hands over their heads in the  symbol
Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience
Thank you, Cleveland
You're a great crowd
But after three and a half hours of kick-ass rock and seven encores on top of that, 'm sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back to our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies
Behind him, Trip grabs Lex's bass and swings it by the neck at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again
Lex quickly yanks it away from him
What the fuck, Trip
That's my bass
Jam emerges from behind the pile of drums smiling
That was curly
Just one more day of school to get through, girls, before tomorrow night
Live
(getting excited) Hall
Detroit, Michigan
(like an announcer) You wanted the best
You got the best
The hottest band in the world
They all make that   that mimics a screaming crowd
Suddenly, headlights swing by in the window above them like a spotlight
Lex hops onto the unmade bed and looks out the cellar window
' baby-shit green, Ford station wagon with fake wood sides into the driveway
Mrs
Bruce gets out and toward the house
Lex gasps at the sight
Shit
It's Jam's mom
Jam  as if he's just shat out an whole can of Lincoln logs
My mom
Oh, no
What's she doing here
Lex quickly throws a  towel over a  tray hiding a bong, cigarettes, overloaded ashtray
Trip kicks half-empty beer bottles under the bed
Hawk sprays Lysol frantically around the room as Jam shovels gum into his mouth
, ,
Mrs
Bruce pounds on the cellar window crouching to see in
She looks like a crazed, underlit psycho
(muffled through glass) Jeremiah
Jeremiah Bruce
You get out here this instant
The boys looks up like innocent, wide-eyed angels
Jam waves
Oh, hi, mom
(screams) Jam quickly pockets his drumsticks and grabs his worn, denim jacket off the pile of jackets on the floor, then runs upstairs
The others follow
' /  - The front door opens
Jam steps out to greet his mom with a nervous smile
Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand at a safe distance in the foyer behind him
What's up
Mrs
Bruce grabs her son by the ear and holds up the record waving it in his face
The devil's body count, that's what's up
Don't you know what  stands for
"Knights in Satan's Service
" She hauls Jam across the lawn
Hawk, Lex, and Trip step onto the porch looking on in sympathetic embarrassment
Mrs
Bruce stuffs the record in the trash can then throws Jam in the front seat
, the station wagon pulls away
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us
had a nightmare once that something like this might happen
hope he doesn't get grounded again
If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, don't know if he'll be able to handle it
Lex, quit trying to always jinx things
Don't worry, dudes
Nobody's missing that concert tomorrow night
- The   album sitting in the trash can on the round label till it
The record begins to spin like on a turntable as    the little hole
This  us
" ''   "  the way it's supposed to sound
The jammin'  classic is accompanied by a barrage of   depicting  mania
appearances
Concert footage
Magazine covers
Comic Books
Posters
Art work
merchandise, dolls, lunch boxes, clothes, etc
We see the  do their thing in authentic , , ,
The  is a colorful, kick-ass kaleidoscope of the entire phenomena

The   is the  ""
'  - The sun's early morning rays beam through the  "Destroyer" poster taped onto a window shade
The phone
Jam bolts upright, his profile blocking the poster
He has just awakened under the only other decoration in his room: a crucifix
Still dressed in last night's clothes, a plain black tee- shirt and blue jeans, Jam leaps out of bed unwittingly planting a foot in the handle of a Bullworker (a piece of exercise equipment comprised of a powerful spring with two handles on either end) whose other handle is stuck under one of the bed's legs
Jam runs to a phone on his dresser, drawing the Bullworker's powerful springs out to maximum tension
No sooner does he pick up, when he is yanked to the floor and dragged across it as if tied to the bumper of a speeding car
Despite the Bullworker pulling him back toward his bed, Jam does manage to get the phone to his ear
Hello
The phone's cord stretches taut causing its cradle to leap from the dresser and  Jam on the head
' / - Hawk is on the phone as Lex and Trip scour every inch of the cluttered room on their hands and knees searching frantically for something
Jam, listen up
(
) Hawk
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary
'  - Jam clutches the phone with his shoulder  as he does battle with the Bullworker for possession of his foot
(
) Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones
Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana
It's my Bullworker
(
) Anyway, listen up
They're gone
What's gone
(
) The  tickets, you nimrod
They're just fuckin' gone
Please tell me you have'm
(panicked) Gone
Why would  have the tick
(
) Just check whatever you were wearing last night
Now
Jam briefly scans his surroundings double-taking at the denim jacket lying on the floor
He checks the pockets and sees four tickets labelled  -  7, 1978 -  , Whew
Oh, God, Hawk
got'm
Somehow  musta taken Trip's jacket by mistake
' / - Hawk  like a deathrow convict pardoned at the last second
(to others) He's got'm
Lex and Trip collapse with relief
Trip, he took your jacket by mistake
You must be wearing Jam's
Trip reaches in a breast pocket and pulls out Rosary beads
Spooked, he drops them like they were a bug
(into phone) Cool
(
) 'm really sorry about that, man
Don't be a fembot
So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what
'  - Of course, but has that ever stopped me before
Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late
No sweat
See you guys in school
Jam hangs up
' / - Lex buckles his belt with its huge  belt buckle
Poor, Jam, man
Imagine having to stash your  records inside Carly Simon album covers
No question, Mrs
Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell
You're one to talk, Lex
Your mom's a fuckin' dyke
Trip pockets his wallet which is affixed to a long chain attached to a side belt loop
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make
And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on
Shrooms
And even if it was , can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day
Both you assholes,
Lex and Trip shaddap
Enough of the mom-bashing, all right
Lex's mom is cool about us crashing over here while she's out of town
And if it weren't for Trip's mom, we wouldn'ta smoked that fine Panama Red last night
So leave the women who gave you life out of it
They're both cool
Trip and Lex cease and desist the mom-bashing and continue getting ready for school
Suddenly, Lex pushes Trip angrily
Trip, you fuckin' asshole
What
Lex points to a wet mess on the pillow
You spilled my Sea Monkeys all over the bed
'  - Jam gives the Bullworker one final yank
This time it comes loose
not from his foot, but from under the bed
Its handle lashes up  him across the face
Ouch
Fully awake now, Jam throws on Trip's denim jacket
He stuffs a drumstick into his left sock
We see "Mystery" written on it
Just as he's about to stick the other one in his right sock
Without a second of warning, or even a knock, Mrs
Bruce suddenly
Immediately Jam stands
Jeremiah, what are you doing
Uhh
nothing
She turns to his closet, the door blocking her view of the poster
Jam leaps to the window and yanks the "Destroyer" shade
It shoots up,  around its rod
He's done this before
Mrs
Bruce peeks at Jam from around his closet door
He stretches in front of the window
Ahh, sunshine
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon
Change
What's wrong with what  got on
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes  bought you
You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so  wouldn't push my luck
Now get out of those rags
But, mom
Besides, those jeans are so tight can see your penis
Jam reluctantly takes off the denim jacket as Mrs
Bruce grabs the single drumstick from his hand and shakes it at him
Someday you'll see the futility in forging a musical career with those idiots
She turns and rummages through the closet
(to himself) They're not idiots
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight
'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic  music
well, need  remind you of the consequences
Grounded for the rest of the year
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah
And so handsome
She pulls two Sears department store boxes from the closet and lays them on the bed
Jam is visibly horrified
/  ' - The suburban high school is teeming with morning activity
School buses pull up to the curb
arrive in droves and immediately find their cliques
The  and make up the popular crowd
There's  ,  who look like grade schoolers, and
At the smoking section hang the
Hawk, Trip, and Lex stand amid the other long-hairs
School
What a fuckin' waste of time
Two  with tons of make-up, hair so feathered it could fly, and tight clothes, saunter by  gum
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead
Stellas
hate stellas almost as much as  hate dogs
Same species when you think about it
Their words say one thing, but their eyes say another
They can't stop gawking at the chicks' asses
Girl #1 sneers back
#1 Don't stare too long, you'll go blind
The boys quickly cover
(defensive) Yeah, right
She wishes
Look at that big ass
You know what they say about a big ass
big shit
They chuckle
Just then, Jam steps off a school bus in an unbelievably geeky outfit, white corduroy slacks, plaid shirt buttoned to the top, argyle socks and brown deck shoes
Hey, that dork looks just like Jam
Hawk and Lex look and laugh when they see him
Shit, that dork is Jam
(to Jam) ,
Jam gives them the finger
- Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam grab books from their lockers
stickers, photos, and rock magazine cut-outs line the insides
Jam's locker door is covered with Peter Criss only
So, Jam, who did your wardrobe, Tad the preppie sailboat captain
Hey, my mom had me over a barrel, all right
After last night,  had to let her dress me today
It's a give and take relationship
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it
Okay, enough
Enough
Gimme the tickets
wanna hold onto them
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket
They're what
She was standing right over me when was changing for fuck's sake
That's some sick shit right there
Did she comb your ass hair for you too
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing  for the third year in a row, the third year
Don't worry about it
They're perfectly safe
We can pick them up after school
My mom won't be home
It's no problem
All right
After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City
Check
The
As they say in the Tampon biz, see you next period
They shut their lockers in unison
- The    grades papers
On the wall a picture of President Carter hangs next to Old Glory
The words "Be Quiet" are written on the blackboard
Students study, read, doodle, sleep
Jam is at his desk touching up the word "Mystery" on his drumstick
Next to him sits
Quirky, but cute, she stares longingly at him wanting to say something, but not having the guts
Pleased with his work, Jam puts the drumsticks on the desk and opens a Peter Criss album cover notebook depicting countless doodles of the  logo, the Mystery logo, and renderings of Peter Criss
Beth  and opens her own notebook
Drawings of hearts fill the pages
In them is written "Beth + Jeremiah" and " love Jeremiah
" Then, one of Jam's drumsticks rolls off the desk and onto the floor
Beth quickly reaches down to grab it for him just as he bends to get it too
, they bash heads
Oof
(whispering) Sorry
Rubbing her head, she smiles and hands him the drumstick
No problem
Thanks
He stuffs his drumsticks in his socks pulling his pantlegs down
Jam and Beth stare at each other
There's a mutual crush, but both are apprehensive about making the first move
Both want to speak, neither does
They awkwardly go back to their notebooks
Mustering the nerve, Jam breaks the ice and whispers
Beth
Beth spins too quickly
Her pen flies out of her hand
Yes
The pen hits Jam in the eye
Ow
Feeling awful, Beth moves in to help
The teacher looks up sternly
Mr
Bruce, Miss Bumsteen, is there a problem
No
No problem
Jam points to his eye
Just a little pink eye
No reason to panic
Unamused, the teacher goes back to grading
(whispering) Sorry
(handing back pen) It's okay
Beth resumes doodling feeling like an idiot
Jam does too
Ah, teenage awkwardness
Finally, Beth musters up some courage
Jeremiah
Yeah
She hems and haw, then
wanted to tell you something
Suddenly, Beth is rudely interrupted by - coming from the
The '   over it
' Jeremiah Bruce, come to the office immediately
Jam throws a startled glance to the speaker as the class sings in unison
Oooo, you're in troubaaaallll
' Your mother's here and would like to see you right away
More  as the mike on the other end changes hands
' Give me that microphone
Jeremiah, you get your sorry self down to this office, mister
All the kids except for Beth burst into hysterical laughter
Mrs
Bruce's tirade continues over   of
'   - Hawk sits at his lab table burning an eraser with his Bunsen burner
His eyes widen with horror behind his goggles as the other  laugh till they hurt
' found some things in the pockets of your jacket while  was picking up your disgusting laundry today
'   - Lex's eyes bug with terror
The basketball game is at a standstill as everyone is crippled with laughter
' Cigarettes
Marijuana
Prophylactics
'   - Trip dozes at his desk as an out-of-date film about sputters on
The room is deafening with laughter
Then, as if hit by a ton of bricks, Trip wakes up alarmed by the familiar, shrilly voice
' And something much, much worse
Holy shit, my jacket
4- We see Jam, Hawk, Lex, and Trip agog in dread
' If you know what's good for you, you'll get down here
'   - Jam slowly sinks in his chair under the profoundly humiliating weight of an  '
- Mrs
Bruce sits next to a stand-up ashtray in the high school's waiting area
Scowling, she fans the  tickets out with one hand
Jam sits across from her, one leg jittering anxiously
They sit for an uncomfortably long time until
Mrs
Bruce pulls a cigarette and lighter out of her purse
made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St
Bernard's
We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot
You mean, you're sending me to
b- b-boarding school
What else can  do
Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets
Jeremiah, do you realize what this means
That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces
Now you want to see the devil in the flesh
You want to reach out and touch pure evil
and in Detroit no less
She flicks the lighter, not yet lighting the cigarette
Mom, three of those tickets don't even belong to me
They're for the guys
Mrs
Bruce holds the tickets over the lighter's flame
And if the "guys" have parents who truly love them, they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these blasted things
Mrs
Bruce lights her smoke with the flaming tickets, then drops them in the ashtray where they burn for a cruel eternity
Jam stares semi-catatonic through his mom's sour expression
It's been a long time coming, son, but you're finally going to get the kind of discipline you deserve
She stands and pulls him out the front entrance by his arm
Hawk, Trip, and Lex peek around it, their heads forming a totem pole
One-by-one they pull back
They slump against the wall devastated
knew it
knew this was gonna happen
had a bad feeling since last night
Remember
We are so totally fucked
Waitaminit, dudes
got it
Maybe we can glue the tickets back together
What are you, high
Yeah
For once Lex is right
It's over
Things can't get any worse from here
Suddenly, a caustic voice  from down the hall
hope you rodents have hall passes
The boys whip their heads around to see a potbellied, yellow- toothed, security officer with long sideburns and slicked back hair at the far end of the hall, fists on his hips
Meet
Wanna bet
Could that be three detentions smell
Elvis laughs and breaks into a run barreling down on them like a maniac
Keys  furiously
Second floor girls' john
Two minutes
He'll never look there
Check
They take off in three different directions
Still laughing, Elvis stops where the boys just were
Which one to follow
He bolts after Hawk who has taken the nearest staircase
/
'   - Beth looks sadly out the window watching Mrs
Bruce push Jam in the car
Beth puts her hand on the pane wanting to touch him
- Meanwhile, Elvis  and  up a flight of stairs arriving at a set of swinging doors
He goes to push one in, but it swings out at him with a vengeance knocking him backward
From behind it pops Hawk wielding a fire extinguisher
hail of foam covers Elvis's face
Hawk shoves the extinguisher into the man's arms and pushes Elvis backwards down the stairs
He topples ass-over-head till he hits the landing
You're way out of your league, Elvis
Elvis rises and shakes the CO2 off like a wet dog
Looking up, he sees the door gently swinging in and out
No sign of Hawk
'  - Trip kicks a bathroom stall violently
Fuck
Shit
Lex sits on the toilet in the stall
Hey, take it easy, man
This is the girls' crapper, remember
Wake up, Lex
We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin'  tickets
Not  Speedwagon
Not Journey
Not the Bay City Rollers
If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, 'd sure like to hear it
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay
Quit acting all squeezed out
Trip grabs Lex by the collar, yanks him off the toilet and shoves him against the wall
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch
You fuckin' jinxed us
Smug, Trip
Not snug, smug
Hawk bursts into the bathroom
We're clear, dudes
They run to exit
Hawk first
Suddenly, Hawk backs up again into Trip and Lex as if a swarm of killer bees was out there
skirt just came around the corner
Hawk, Trip, and Lex run back and pile into the last stall
All three stand on the toilet bracing their arms against the walls for balance
hurries into the stall next to theirs
We see the top halves of three heads peek over the stall's partition
The three boys don't make a sound as they watch her sit down
As she glances up, they recoil fast
They whisper super-quiet
That's Sherry VanHafton
've been in love with her since the second grade
Then, a
They all throw their hands over their mouths to stifle the giggles
Suddenly,
She lets out an
The boys are awestruck
Whoa
she just farted
have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life
Weird
Pause
Peeeyeewww
That stinks
Just then, the    , as the toilet they're standing on breaks into pieces with a
They topple over pulling the stall walls down with them exposing the foxy chick sitting on the can
Water  everywhere as she screams bloody murder, getting doused ruining her Farrah-do
They bolt out the door slipping and sliding across the torrent of toilet water
Lex turns and shrugs to the traumatized girl
Heh-heh, sorry
He's gone
106 / '  - Mrs
Bruce uses a finished cigarette to light another
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah
boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you
(numbly) If 'm anything like you, 'll deserve him
What
said, 'm sorry
If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before
God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you
He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it
' - Mrs
Bruce's car turns off the road and drives through an imposing set of wrought iron gates
The sign reads: St
Bernard's Veil of Tears
School for Catholic Boys
'  - Jam looks at what lies ahead
His face becomes a mask of pure terror
We hear a   as Jam puts his hands together and closes his eyes humbling himself
He whispers
Please, God, help
' - The car winds up the path leading to a dark, Gothic edifice over which tumultuous storm clouds continuously hover and bolts of lightning shoot at the blackened crucifixes along the structure
We hear a   theme
/
- Except for the tinkering  that are heard as the work on their projects, there is silence in Electronics Class
The teacher,
, sips from a coffee cup and reads a newspaper, his feet on the desk
The headline says: "Mass Suicide in Jonestown
Cyanide in the Kool-Aid
" Above him is a long banner reading: "Sorry, Absolutely no bathroom breaks"
Hawk, Trip, and Lex sit before a half-built radio on a work bench, sheer desperation etched on their faces
Lex solders two copper wires together
Hawk attaches a dial
Trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long plastic tube
He blows air into his face repeatedly with it
(re:squeeze pump/tube) Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away
Hawk turns the radio on and a    pours from its speaker
He adjusts the volume, then the tuner, until a 's  comes through crisp and clear
' and this is Simple Simon on the rock of Detroit,
, home of the biggest  giveaway in the history of the universe
Detroit
Hawk, Trip, and Lex react like they've just been hit by phasers on stun
God is intervening
' got four, count 'em, four front row tickets along with four backstage passes to the concert tonight at Cobo Hall and 'm giving them to the 106th caller who can tell me the real names of each  band member
again, then the radio loses reception
Hawk exchanges an anxious glance with Trip and Lex
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or
Never mind with the too bad shit got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off
: Mr
Johansen still sits with his feet up, reading
The next page's headline reads: First Test Tube Baby Born
Trip runs up to Mr
's desk, one hand behind his back, the other on his crotch
His face is drawn in an expression of sheer agony
Hawk and Lex watch anxiously in the background
Mr
Verudi, get back to your bench
Trip puts one leg over the other always keeping a hand behind his back
But  gotta take a piss like you would not believe, Mr
Johansen
Put a clothespin on it till the end of class, Verudi
You know my rule
But ever since my doctor put me on salt pills, it's been like Niagara Falls every half hour
Please, Mr
Have mercy
Suddenly, a wet stain grows across the crotch of Trip's pants
Salt pills
Don't insult my intelligence, Verudi
Mr
stops when he sees the stain starting to spread
Jeezis, 'm taking a leak in my pants
We now see Trip is squeezing the pump from before
He holds it behind him feeding water into the tube running down the back of his pants
The stain travels fast, hitting Trip's knee in a nanosecond
In a state of shock, Mr
slowly opens a long forgotten drawer on his desk, finding a cobweb and dust-covered pad of bathroom passes
He tears one off and dust flies everywhere
He holds the pass out to Trip like it was a cross he was holding before an advancing vampire
(hoarsely) Get the hell out of here, Verudi
You disgust me
Hawk and Lex observe that Trip has been successful, then do a Three Stooges-style handshake, whispering "Curly
" - The  sits at her desk in the reception area filing paperwork
She pauses when she hears
Trip charges past, a big, wet stain on his crotch
The secretary notices the pump and tube flopping from the back of his pants as Trip turns a corner
- Trip runs up to a pay phone on the wall, pumps every nickel he has into it, puts the phone to his ear and dials
need to be connected to the
contest hotline
Now
lady
Hello, is this me
'm Trip
- cubby-of-an-office
Cluttered beyond belief
Elvis leans back on his chair against the wall reading a  Magazine
transistor radio plays
He bolts at the sound of Trip's name causing his chair to slide out from under him
Am  on the air
Yeah
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter, uh, Criscoula
yeah, that's it
- The secretary hears an ecstatic "" and turns to see Trip wheeling back around the corner, leaping in the air as he runs,  like a rodeo cowboy
He bounds past her
She watches him and shakes her head
(to herself) Moron
- Still on the floor, Elvis grabs the little radio with rage, flips it off and screams at it
Why you little
Over my dead body
The bell
/  - Students pour into the hall
Hawk and Lex exit the class just as Trip comes zigzagging down the corridor dodging the hordes
All three converge as Trip can't contain his enthusiasm
did it
did it
We won
We won
Fuckin'
Woooooo
The three burnouts jump, scream, , and play air instruments like loons as if they're the only ones in the hall
They can't stop
The rest of the student body are not amused - Hawk, Trip, and Lex hold their trays over the counter as the fill them with Salisbury steak, hard dinner rolls and scoops of bluish pudding
Ah, public school nutrition
(stoked) This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school
Not only are we on again for  in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line
dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario
(double stoked) Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is
" There's gotta be a catch
Yeah
have a saying too, Lex
It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole
" We're going this time and that's all there is to it
'm afraid our constipated little friend is right this time, Trip
There is a catch
Hawk's really got their attention now
Namely
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer
Jam's mom said something about sending him to St
Bernard's, right
We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere
But
but, St
Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county
So
Your mom's car has a , radar detector and cruise control, check
We are not stealing my mom's car
Damn straight we are
Hawk, all  need is one ding on the Volvo and presto
There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway
Sunday, but
Then lighten up
She'll never know we touched it
Alright, here's the plan
We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St
Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit
Simplicity, Hawk
Simple-icity is more like it
And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before
Wait till Mrs
Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex
You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity
Yeah, 'm vaguely familiar Well, Jam is in absolute trouble
He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass
You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole concert, check
Lex nods
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence
Just for the record,  understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever
was just explaining to Lex here what you and  already know
Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand
Very funny, Hawk
Okay, 'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, 'm blaming you
'll say you drugged me or something
Curly
Hawk scopes out the cafeteria to make sure the coast is clear
Ok, dudes, follow my lead
Wait a minute
We ditching the rest of school
About fuckin' time if you ask me
'm just going through the motions till  drop out anyway
Hello summer detention
As  was saying, follow my lead
And maintain
Elvis just showed up
Hawk points across the cafeteria and sure enough Elvis has just entered
Luckily, he hasn't noticed the boys yet
Elvis swaggers to a table of , puts his leg on a chair and starts a one-sided conversation with them
They promptly push their trays away, having lost their appetites
Meanwhile, back at the condiment tray, Hawk and Trip each grab a big handful of ketchup packets and head to a table
Lex reluctantly follows suit grabbing a big handful of ketchup packets too
All three of them put their trays down and sit
(eyeing Elvis) Five second rule, boys
See you on the other side
Hawk approaches the exit door, glances either way, then leaves
Trip and Lex look at their watches for five seconds
Then Trip heads for the exit door also
Lex still stares at his watch
After five, he looks at Elvis, who stops talking to the cheerleaders
As if possessing some sixth sense, Elvis turns quickly and looks '  -- He spots the swinging exit door and an empty table with three full lunch trays sitting on it
Excuse me, ladies
Relieved he's gone, the cheerleaders start eating again
Elvis moves through the cafeteria in   toward the exit door
The hunter in action
- Elvis pushes through the door and into a hall, dead-eye stare focused up ahead where the hallway turns sharply
He catches a glimpse of Lex
Smiling like the devil, Elvis bolts
- Lex catches up with Hawk and Trip just as Elvis swings around the corner and marauds after them  maniacally
mad chase ensues
Down hallways
Around corners
Upstairs
Down ramps
Hawk, Trip, and Lex scramble as fast as they can to escape the clutches of their sideburn-clad nemesis
As the boys pass a classroom, a  comes out pushing a projector on an  cart
Thinking fast, Hawk grabs it out of the nerd's hands and pushes it down the hall at Elvis
Hey, 'm responsible for that
Elvis bashes face-first into the rolling cart
He and the projector go tumbling
Not wasting a second, Elvis is back on his feet and after them again
The nerd grabs his hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector
Elvis  around the corner and trips on a fire hose stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water fountain pipe
He slides on his belly along the polished floor unable to stop
- Old   is lecturing on
The kids are dozing
Then a cry from the crow's nest
"Thar she blows
" Suddenly, a screaming Elvis slides into the open door on his stomach and bowls Miss Hibbs over like a Brunswick
He clamors to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned
- Pausing at the corner, Elvis takes a breath and leaps around it
He smiles at what he sees
Up ahead, Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand on a 3-stair stoop, desperately pulling at a locked door
Elvis smiles
They concert
Kiss my ass morelike
nice, fat detention oughta put a crimp in this evening's plans
Elvis takes his key ring off his belt and begins twirling it
The boys turn and face him
He savors the moment
Looking for something, rodents
Yeah, Elvis
Hawk's brow furrows as he pulls about fifty ketchup packets out of his pocket
Trip and Lex do the same
Your ass on a lunch tray
Elvis laughs and lurches forward -- the boys' cue to drop the ketchup packets at their feet and
On your marks and
Trip and Lex ready themselves, then
Fire
They start stomping on the packets, squirting Elvis's face and torso with tomato-based condiment causing him to let out a scream that lasts the rest of the scene
Ketchup spatters across his body in
shot hits him in the mouth and he  it back out in mid-scream
The boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his arms back, body quaking at every splat
It's kind of like the scene in "The Godfather" where Sonny gets it
Beaten and spent, his scream now dried up to a hoarse , Elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet
He hits the floor with a  right in the goop
He lays there letting out looking like a bunless wiener
Hawk jumps off the stoop
Taking Elvis's key chain away, he hops back up and unlocks the door letting Trip and Lex out
Hawk whips the keys back at Elvis, hitting him in the head, then flashes a pearly Error Flynn smile
Elvis, you ain't nothin' but a hot dog
Hawk bolts out the door
Elvis tries to get up only to slip in the muck again and fall back down twice as hard
Nooooo
- / on the grill of a moving car, Ohio vanity plate reading: Ob-
to reveal it's on a brand spanking-new, brown Volvo 242  hauling ass
Hawk drives, Lex rides shotgun, and Trip sits in the back, arms draped over the front seat
' - The Volvo turns and barrels up St
Bernard's gated entrance
- Well, here we are back at fucking school again
Huh
St
Bernard's
Figures it's named after a canine
Hawk and Trip roll their eyes
'   - Mrs
Bruce and  McNULTY stand outside his office
The door is open a tad
Jam sits just beyond it, but all we see are his corduroyed legs which shake
Jam is one nervous kid
Again, many thanks and praise to you for seeing Jeremiah on such short notice
Father McNulty has a look of utter compassion on his face
Anything for a potential tuition
to be given to charity of course
God bless you, Father McNulty
He already has
They hug
She exits
And the look of utter compassion on Father McNulty's face disappears
'  - The priest enters,  the door shut, startling Jam, and sits in front of a painting of the Virgin Mary on his wall
The name plate on his desk reads:
McNULTY
Before enrolling you, Jeremiah, let me just say it would be greatly appreciated if your career at St
Bernard's was an uneventful one
Some students believe they can get expelled through disobedience and recklessness
What they don't understand is even after God's vengeance is meted out, He forgives
That His devastating anger is followed by His nurturing compassion
In a nutshell, St
Bernard's may punish you even for the slightest digression, but will never cast you out, even for the largest
So here you are, Jeremiah
here to stay
Father McNulty sticks the pencil into an electric pencil sharpener and it makes the same  a '  does when burrowing into a molar
Jam shudders
The Father removes the pencil and blows the shavings away from the needle-sharp tip
Let's begin the enrollment, shall we
' - Mrs
Bruce exits the building and approaches her car
She stops when she sees the '78 brown Volvo parked behind her
It's empty
She shrugs and gets into her car, driving off
Inside the Volvo Hawk, Trip, and Lex poke their heads up
The coast is clear so they can sit straight again
They stare up at a second story window where they see part of Jam's profile
Now, how are we gonna do this
Gimme a second, dudes
Lemme think
They hear an  and turn to see a delivery truck labelled parking behind them
holding a pizza box steps out
Trip's mouth waters
(licking his chops) Mmm, pizza
Seeing the boys, the delivery boy stops at the Volvo
Hey, you guys know where
(looks at slip on box) Philip McNutly's office is
Hawk, Trip, and Lex exchange an anxious glance, then Hawk smiles
He is officially inspired as he turns to the boy
Yeah, 'm Philip McNutly
'  - The Father  his pencil looking impatiently at Jam who has totally withdrawn
He sits motionless staring into space
Jeremiah, are you aware you need to answer these questions, not just listen to them
Jeremiah
Jam doesn't respond
Please don't become difficult this early in your stay
hate disciplining boys before  get to know them
enters
Forgive me, Father
young man here with a pizza for you
Ah, yes
Send him in Sister Conimaria
The nun exits and a second later Hawk enters wearing Lex's baseball cap pulled down over his eyes
Well, what's the damage, pizza fellow
Ten even
The priest swivels his chair around and unlocks a box labelled "Donations
" While he looks for cash, Hawk gives Jam a discreet kick in the shin
Jam looks up and recognizes Hawk
He then looks out the window seeing Trip, Lex, and the Volvo below
For the first time we see what Jam looks like with a big, fat, shit-eating grin on his face
(whispering to Jam) If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check
(whispering) Check
Father McNulty swivels back around with a ten
Here's ten and 'm donating your tip to the church
The Lord thanks you
Tell the Big Guy not to mention it
Hawk takes the ten, tips the brim of the baseball cap and leaves, giving Jam a cautious wink as he goes
And not a moment too soon
'm famished
hope you brought a lunch for yourself
No, but 'm not hungry anyway
Father McNulty raises his eyebrows, then opens the pizza box
Well
It finally speaks
There's one barrier we've broken through
Father McNulty smiles, taking a big bite
Jam smiles for an entirely different reason
The priest mumbles with a mouthful
You know, your coming here reminds me of a gospel called The Prodigal Son
Jam grins a bit feigning interest
There was once a farmer who had two sons
Both grew up on the farm, helping their father until
(suddenly alarmed) Father McNulty  sticking his pizza-covered tongue out
He pours himself a glass of wine and sucks it down looking concerned for the moment
Finally, he
That was a very stale mushroom
(beat) Where was
Ah, yes, one day the elder son decided to leave the farm
- Hawk, Trip, and Lex look up at Father McNulty's window
Usually takes anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour
They look at their watches, then back at the window
Shit
This is such a lousy view
How the hell are we gonna know when he's lit
Just then,   bellows from the window above
He's lit
'  - The Father has undergone a metamorphosis
He's redder than a boiling lobster, his eyes bulge and he's laughing the deepest laugh a man can without risking psychological evaluation
Jam watches fascinated as the priest tries to finish the story
It's not every day you see a holy man tripping on shrooms
(in mid-guffaw) So then, the younger one says, "But dad
've been helping you on the farm my entire life
(belly laugh) You never once slaughtered the fatted calf for me
" And then
(more belly laughter) Forgive me, Jeremiah, it's just that
've been telling this gospel for years and
just now realized it's the work of some comedy mastermind
The Prodigal Son is a barrel of fucking monkeys
Father McNulty belly laughs so hard this time, he slides off his chair hitting his chin on the edge of his desk
He is in pain only momentarily, then laughs again, this time at his own pratfall
He hoists himself back into his chair
Hawk, Trip, and Lex suddenly barge into the office, followed by the outraged nun
You kids can't go in there
It's okay, we're old buds of Father McNulty
How's it hangin', padre
little to the right, pizza fellow
Father McNulty laughs some more
That was another dude
Anyway, we're here to take our bud Jam to the big satanic  concert tonight
Okay with you
(waving) Rock on
Jam gets up and all four boys exit
(yelling after them) Give my regards to the guy with the really big tongue
The nun looks at the priest, deep concern in her eyes
What the hell are you doing, Sister Gonorrhea, waiting for a bus
He lets out a belly laugh as the shocked nun runs from the office
Father McNulty laughs even louder at her behavior, his fists on the desk, tears rolling down his cheeks, until
He suddenly glimpses at the painting of the Virgin Mary and abruptly stops laughing
What appears to be extreme contrition washes over his face as he moves closer to the painting
Jesus
Christ, look at all the colors
- Hawk drives, Trip rides shotgun, Lex and Jam sit in the back
Stoked beyond belief, Jam  his drumsticks on the upholstery to the beat of a rockin'  tune playing on the 8-track
Oh, man, my mom is gonna send me to Alcatraz for this and  don't even care
'm gonna see Peter Criss's drum solo
Lex taps Jam on the shoulder
Not looking like that, Mr
Rogers
Lex hands him a paper bag with jeans and a tee-shirt in it
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City
The boys do their Three Stooges handshake and say "Curly
" Jam starts to change
Just then, the Volvo passes a two-tone Chevy Impala with luggage tied to the roof
The passenger in the back seat turns and spots Jam pulling off his pants
It's Beth
Her eyes bulge
Beth parents are in the front
Jam spots her and beams
Their eyes lock
She waves and starts to yell something, when
suddenly
The boys look out the driver's side of the car to see the rear hubcap rolling away
They've got a flat
(screams) My mom's hubcap
The car fishtails and weaves but Hawk manages to pull over
The Chevy continues on, Beth gazing out the rear window sadly
Shit
(looks at car clock) Anybody know how long it takes to fix a flat
- a status report
The 2:45 is now leaving
We see is Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam running alongside a train as it picks up speed by the second
They  for it to stop, but it's hopeless
The train is gone
So much for the 2:45
- Lex looks at the speedometer
Hawk's got it up to ninety- five
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit
Lex, am  gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit
Don't worry, these babies are built for speed
Trip holds his stomach as we hear it
'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime
Totally
All 've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo
Trip spots a sign on the side of the road: Next Exit, Sandusky
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk
What's in Sandusky
Pizza, and  been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St
Bernard's
: - The boys chomp on their pizza slices and chug cans of Hawaiian Punch
Another raucous  tune
Behind them, a car horn starts  rhythmically
Hawk looks into the rearview mirror and sees two guys and two girls in a tailgating Trans Am
The guys have 90
haircuts, tacky, wide-collared shirts, and massive amounts of jewelry on their necks
The girls wear 10-layer make-up, mega-jewelry, and hair teased so high, it touches the car's roof
Only a car full of guidos and stellas would ride someone's ass on a two- lane road and beep
- The speakers  a   to which the four passengers sing
, the driver,  to the disco beat
They're slightly older than our heroes and very full of themselves
Kenny and his best girl  sit in the front
and  are in the back
It's a double disco date
- Trip lifts a rubbery slice of pizza to his mouth and the top layer slides off  into his lap
Eyowch
This is one hot pizza
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery
Trip grabs the wad of goop and throws it out the window
- Just as the   playing in the Trans Am hits the next chorus, a fistful of pizza  across the windshield
Freaked, Kenny swerves and zigzags all over the road
Righting himself, Kenny's entire family might as well have been insulted
Stop singing
He turns off the stereo and floors the accelerator, swerving into the left lane and passing the Volvo
Bobby is just now noticing the mess on the windshield
He starts to laugh
Hey, Kenny, look
There's a hunk of fawkin' cheese on your windsheel
- Lex is looking at the mess on the Trans Am's windshield and the anger in the eyes of its passengers
Holy shit
We just pissed off the Incredible Hulk, his idiot half brother and two circus clowns
The Trans Am runs alongside the Volvo and Hawk turns to see Kenny pointing to the breakdown lane
Stop the friggin' car
Hawk rolls up his window
Kenny yells,  , and points to Hawk who pays absolutely no attention whatsoever
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off
What
Are you mentally deranged, Jam
Just then, , the Trans Am bangs up against the side of the Volvo pushing it onto the shoulder
What the fuck
(freaking out) The paint
- The Trans Am muscles the Volvo into the breakdown lane
Parking the ass end of the Pontiac out a bit, Kenny blocks the Volvo in
Kenny and Bobby climb from their car and storm over to the boys
Hawk opens his door just as Kenny's hairy-knuckled hands pull him out through the window
He grabs Trip, yanking him out too
Bobby opens the back door and does the same with Lex and Jam
With a kid in each hand now, Kenny and Bobby  the four boys against the Volvo in a line
The size difference between the burnouts and the guidos is painfully obvious now
Kenny and Bobby are Neanderthals
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' of what you just did
Hey, disco dude, it's cool
Kenny hauls back and  the row of boys in the faces Three Stooges-style
Trip, Lex, and Jam clutch their faces in pain
Hawk looks merely disenchanted as Kenny pokes a muscle-bound finger at his chest
Getting in Hawk's face, Kenny yammers loud and fast
Lemme paint you a friggin' picture ahright
Imagine if you will a 1978 Pontiac Trans American in pristine condition
(beat) An appealing portrait, nesspah
Hawk starts to say "yes
" What's that spec on the windshield
Could it be a wad of melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce, and various friggin' meat products
Hawk is unimpressed
Could be
And if it ain't cleaned off
Kenny, come on with the macho crap already
Like this kid could take you in a fight anyway
(ignoring Christine) Answer me, hippie girl
And if the mess ain't cleaned off my car
It could
bake on
Kenny looks at Bobby and they exchange moronic grins
You're a smart little homo, aren't you, hippie girl
But, while astounded at your nimble, friggin' insight, still detect an issue hanging fire, namely: where does a sharp-witted faggot like yourself get off doing such a dopey thing like that there
Hawk figured out that any answer he gives will be incorrect and has decided to wait till Kenny's done
No really, 'm perplexed
mean, could you have done stupider if you were born without a '
(using "oh" to mean "enough") Oh
With the language
Shut-up, Christine
Christine snarls at Kenny
Okay, Kenny
don't mean to drain your keg or anything, but could you speed up this process
(beat) Don't get me wrong, we'd love to stand here and get shit on by the cast of Saturday Night Fever, but we're also on a schedule
So step on it
Cold silence as Kenny replays Hawk's insult over in his head
Are you gettin' wise with me
No, 'm dumber than a goddamn slug
Now can  please clean your windshield and leave without further ado
Break his fawkin' legs, Kenny
Kenny's temper's rising faster than the price of gasoline
Hawk on the other hand is cooler than an Otter Pop
Oh, you're dumb all right, you hairy ass punk
But please, allow me to clean the friggin' windshield insist
And with that, Kenny grabs himself a fistful of Hawk's long hair and pulls him over to the Trans Am
He wipes the pizza off with Hawk's hair, tugging Hawk's head up and down, back and forth
Hawk  with each wipe, but doesn't give Kenny the satisfaction of hearing him scream
Trip, Lex, and Jam watch helplessly, trapped under Bobby's dull-witted, but equally threatening gaze
Kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and looks at his handiwork
There
Nice and clean
He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby
Then, he suddenly hears the  tune coming from the Volvo
Uh-oh
Oh, no, no, no
It's the fag band
Kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo, reaching in the driver's door
Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist
Whoa
This is about pizza
Let's leave  out of it
Please
bunch of guys who make bad music, dress like freaks, and wear more make-up than all my sisters combined
These assholes must be stopped
Kenny pushes Jam away
That's it, Kenny
'm leaving
Christine gets out of the car and starts walking down the highway, exiting the scene
Oh, Christine
You googatz in the head or something
We're on the side of the freakin' highway
Let her go, Barbara, she'll come back to Kenny
She always does
(to Kenny) Right, Kenny
Kenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo
Kool and the Gang, now there's real music
Kenny takes the 8-track from the car
But this
is crap
He flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed to bits under the wheels of a passing semi
a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the road, landing at Jam's feet
to Jam's face
He raises his eyes and turns to the , a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the Indian in that "Keep America Beautiful" litter ad
Hawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him
So
All that having been said and done,  believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion
Namely: Have you learned your lesson yet, puke
Hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it
He blows some smoke in Kenny's face
Well, let's recap, shall we
You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our   8- track under the wheels of a passing semi
(puffing on cig) So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes
'd say we learned it
(beat, in disbelief) Excuse me, 'm a little deef-a- hearin'
Can you repeat yourself
Okay
Ahem
You
Are
Dick
With
Ears
And
Really
Bad
Haircut
Oh, yeah
Out of original material, Kenny goes for an old stand by
That's not what your mother said last night
Trip, Lex, and Jam exchange "uh-oh" glances
Meanwhile, Hawk's eyes glaze over
It's not, huh
Well, then, tell me
Hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly empty can of Hawaiian Punch, holding it discreetly at his side
what exactly did my mother say last night
Kenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one
You heard me, prick
What did my mother say last night
Kenny chuckles and looks at Bobby
They have a good little laugh
the homo's got balls
Then Kenny turns back to Hawk
Okay, fagmo
'll tell you what your mother said last night
(beat) She said that  was the fuck of her life
Hawk is a little mad now
He tosses his cigarette to the ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker
(very Clint Eastwood) How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch
(smirking) Sure
Quick as a shot, Hawk  the bottom of the can into Kenny's nose, crushing it flat against his face
Hawaiian backwash spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards from the impact
He hits his head on the ground
Taking this as a cue
Trip whips out his wallet on a chain
Lex rips off his  belt
And Jam yanks out his drumsticks
As if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet, snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain
Lex Bobby in the face with his big  belt buckle leaving a reversed, red,  logo branded in his forehead
Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet
When he hits the ground, Jam's right there  his balls
Bobby shrieks
Meanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose with fruit punch for snot
Hawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes the final insult
Hawk messes Kenny's hair
Kenny lets out a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity
Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head swiftly against his kneecap
Kenny falls to the ground, unconscious on top of Bobby
Their heads collide knocking Bobby out cold
Terrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered
Not so fast, stella
: Kenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt
Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of Barbara's shoulders
Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the stella, snickering
When they wake up, they're gonna come looking for you jerks
You best hope they don't find you, cause if they do, they're gonna kick your asses
Hawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road, walking up to the Trans Am
Right, stella, and we'll deserve it
But let's really make it worth their while
Hawk puts the rock on the Trans Am's accelerator letting the engine  in protest
(Again we are cautious not to show the guidos' faces
) By the way, when Kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me
Tell him, quote, Kool and the gang bite my bag, motherfucker, unquote
He throws the Trans Am into drive
All who are conscience listen to the brief , then watch the Trans Am as it barrels without a driver into the woods skirting the highway
It races into ditches, bounces off trees, and  through ponds, all Smokey and the Bandit-like
The disco-mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way, and finally,
It explodes on final impact
The boys all look at each other and shrug
Hawk walks back to the Volvo and gets in
Trip, Lex, and Jam follow suit and pile in as well
Lex shouts back to Barbara
Oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample make-up supply
You must have the entire Revlon factory in your purse
, ,
We now see them from the front
Lo-and-behold, Kenny has been made-up like Gene Simmons, Bobby like Paul Stanley
Whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their musical taste
and kick their asses all over again
Very funny
hope you choke
- Hawk starts the engine and takes off
Trip pulls a baggie of weed and some rolling papers out
Hey, look, it's that girl
Jam points out at the road ahead to Christine
She's a few hundred feet away walking sadly in the breakdown lane
That's no girl
That's a stella
Stella or no stella, we should pull over and help her out
Oh no, Jam
'm not falling for that twice
Well, couldn't you slow down so can at least state my case, Hawk
If you don't like it, you can speed up and 'll never mention it again
Hawk slows down, turning into the breakdown lane, travelling about two miles per hour
Christine doesn't notice as they edge closer to her
What is it with you, Jam
You got a thing for that
thing
She's a teenage girl walking on the side of the highway
They make very scary movies that start out like that
Well, they may not make movies about four dudes going to a  concert
But if they ever did, the four dudes most certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny
Pause
Unless there was gonna be a scene where the disco bunny blows the four dudes on the way to the show
- Christine sits between Jam and Lex in the back  gum
Jam and Lex stare at her like cats looking at a fish bowl
Hawk looks in the rearview mirror at Christine checking herself in a compact
She swathes on some 7-Up flavored, Bonnie Bell lip gloss
Trip meanwhile twirls the joint he's just finished rolling in his mouth, sealing it
He winks at her disgustingly
Oh, great
just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads
'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno
Mind droppin' me there
(smirks) What's it worth to you
(grossed out) What the hell is that supposed to mean
It doesn't mean anything
Don't pay attention to him
(rolls his eyes) Disco Inferno
Disco's infernal morelike
Trying to be suave, Lex moves in close, putting the make on her
Your clothes may say disco, but your eyes say rock 'n' roll, baby
Well, your tee-shirt may say rock 'n' roll, but your breath says pepperoni, baby
She pushes him away
Jam laughs
(frustrated) So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what
(thoroughly offended) What
That's disgusting
Trip
That's so fuckin' rude, man
Oh, quit bein' the wussy, sensitive guy to impress her, Jam
She's obviously not gonna put out
She's a fuckin' tease
Tease
What the hell did  do to tease you mongoloids
You got in the car, didn't you
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere
Whatever
stella
Trip lights the joint and takes a lungful of pot
He passes it to Lex and the joint begins to make its rounds with the exception of Christine
The car starts to fill with smoke
The name's Christine, not stella
And there's no need to be such pigs just cause  prefer Donna Summer or and the Sunshine Boys or the Village People over
(with disdain) The Village People
They're fags
You're a fag hag
Come on, Hawk
can take care of myself, but thanks anyway, germ
Jam
Whatever
(to Hawk) Okay, Joe Burnout, let's get one thing straight here
As far as 'm concerned good tunes is good tunes, be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you, regardless of the category
True, if  had to choose, 'd pick the category labelled disco because  happen to enjoy dancing
Disco is just easier to dance to
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing
wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me
Disco blows dogs for quarters
Christine processes this remark
Now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony
Trip looks confused, then smiles thinking she paid him a compliment
Hey, if you don't like that one, maybe you'll think it's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car
Yeah, why don't you put your money where your mouth is
Why don't you kiss my hairy crack
Why don't you bend over, you're looking right at it
All, Christine included, pause to think about what that comment was supposed to mean
Lex takes a hit off the joint
(holding in smoke) That last remark fell about 30 yards away from making any sense whatsoever
Hawk and Trip immediately bust into the giggles and it doesn't take long for Lex and Jam to follow suit
(realization) Hey, you're right
"Bend over you're looking right at it
" (starts to laugh) What's that supposed to mean anyway
Christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic and the whole car gets a great laugh for a while
They finally calm down again and wipe tears from their eyes
Lex still has the joint now as Christine looks at it
Man, this is some kickass shit
(beat) Gimme a hit off that jay will ya
Lex smiles despite himself and holds the weed out to her as we
: ,
The Volvo passing a big sign that says: "Welcome to Michigan, the Great Lakes State
" The Volvo racing toward the Detroit skyline
Detroit landmarks: The General Motors Building, the Ford Building, Motown Records, and finally
, where thousands of fans in  tees gather, waiting for its doors to open
Unbelievable traffic stretches to an intersection at which stand four key landmarks
a cathedral, a convenience store, a parking lot, and a male strip joint
They face one another, each on its own corner
gigantic sign on the auditorium's facade flashes the commandment, "        " over and over again
- The sun hangs low on this day as the Volvo sits in traffic, passing Cobo Hall
Movement is nearly impossible
cram every square foot of open macadam, pushing through the jammed cars
hawk  souvenirs from tee-shirts to pennants
Some are in stands along the sidewalk
Others come right up to car windows
- Christine is fast asleep between Jam and Lex
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass
She's sleeping like a baby stella
(whispers lustfully) Let's lift up her shirt
(pointing out windshield) There it is
All look ahead
Hall
forms around the building accompanied by a
(in reverence) We made it
Curly driving, Hawk
We still got two hours to spare
Ample time to grab our tickets at the station
See, up ahead
One block on the left is the
tower
Hey, Look at the front entrance car's pulling out
The parking space from heaven
God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes
Kind of funny,  thought He'd be pissed as hell at me
The opening to the Carpenters' "   " begins
- "   " continues, playing through the speaker of the ascending elevator inside which Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam stand
They watch the numbers climb, smiling
What was that
's name again
Oh, 'll remember it till the day die
His name was
Simpleton the Simian
No, Samson Samoan
No, simply, similar
'  - Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam poke their heads around the corner of an office doorway totem pole-style
Simple Simon
strikes a pose before a full-length mirror in a glittery-back Gene Simmons tee-shirt, silver pants, and very high heel boots
He has a huge Afro and bushy moustache
He turns when he hears Hawk
The one and only
But can you kids hurry this up
'm due at Coco Hall in half an hour for the warm-up
They all enter and stand at Simple Simon's desk
We're right behind you, Simo
Just wanted to thank you in advance for handing over those burly-ass tix me and my buds won this morning
The boys do a Three Stooges handshake and say "Curly
" Simple Simon on the other hand suddenly appears nonplussed Your name isn't Trip is it
'  - Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam sit in the tiny producer's booth with Simon who fast forwards a reel-to-reel tape through some very loud, high-speed conversation and bits of music
Looking at the footage counter on the tape player, he slows down at a certain point and lets the boys listen to this: The  of a phone being answered
' Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller
' Hello
Is this me
'm Trip
Am  on the air
' should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk
What are the names of the four members of
' Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter
Criscula
Yeah, that's it
Pause
' Is that your final answer
' (with trepidation) Yeah
' (building to crescendo) Trip
You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to live at Cobo Hall tonight
Pause
' did
' Yeah, you did
' Yeeeehaaawww
This is totally fuckin' curly, man
Thank you God
-
' Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver
" Now listen up cause this next part is crucial
Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and
' Trip
Trip
Oh, man, you didn't hang up on me did you
Trip
(beat) What kind of total moron would hang
Simple Simon stops the tape and looks at the boys who look like they've just been served a life sentence behind bars
Well, there you have it
We had no choice but to give the tickets to the next caller
'm sorry
Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam stare at the floor in silence
We got sodas in the fridge if that helps any
- Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam ride back down the elevator sipping NeHi sodas, watching the floor numbers get lower and lower
Terry Jack's immortal hit "   " plays over the elevator speaker
Well, here we are, dudes
One hour and thirty minutes away from the concert of the century
ticketless
All thanks to Wile
Coyote, Super- Fucking Genius over here
Trip looks away from the rest, ashamed
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change
Fuck you, Lex
This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us
just made an honest mistake
Oh, 'm sorry, Trip
What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit
No offense
Guys,
Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine
was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake
It's my fault and apologize
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here
Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you
Jam looks at his feet
Sometimes  think  don't deserve friends as good as you guys
Hawk, Trip, and Lex cringe
have one question
How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf
Yeah, it's like you're possessed by The Flying Nun, or something
The doors to the elevator open and the boys step out
- Hall looms up ahead
Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam enter the sidewalk
thickening of  fans continually meander by
On their way to the car, they suddenly hear a ' bellowing through a megaphone from somewhere down the street
After a moment they see the voice's source
has congregated about forty feet ahead and their , her back toward the boys, yells to the group through her bullhorn
Flying above them all is a large banner reading: ", Mothers Against The Music Of
" Welcome to the first open meeting of , Mothers Against The Music Of " The group cheers as the   milling around them pretty much ignore the whole  spectacle
Lex looks away from the  and into the street
We can't see what he sees, but we can tell he's alarmed
Uh
dudes
(ignoring Lex) Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood
They all look at Lex
(eyes focused ahead) Where's the Volvo
Hawk, Trip, and Jam look at their parking spot to see a beat- up Dodge Dart sitting there instead of the Volvo
It's gone
can see that, bright boy
What happened to it
It was stolen
(incredulous) Christine stole it
Asleep, my ass
The stella booted with your mom's wheels
But we took the keys
Damn, she musta hot wired it
We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John
Okay, 'm just a little mad now
Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place
'm sorry, guys
thought it was a nice thing to do
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth
Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half
We're totally committed
It's time to brainstorm
Here's a suggestion
Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation
Wake up, Lex
This is Detroit
The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car
Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet
Lex is developing a look of resolve
This is Detroit
Now listen up
Here's the game plan
(on a roll) mean, my mom's got insurance
What's the worst thing she could do
Ground me for the entire year
can handle that
Cool, bro, now listen up
Holy shit
am in absolute trouble
never should have let you drive, man
Absolute fuckin' trouble
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex
Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper
got
(takes out  money clip) twenty-five
Twenty-five more'n  got
All  got is five
The rest is in the Volvo
got
Uh-uh
Don't tell us, Jam
Just show us
Jam holds up a ten keeping his mouth shut
So maybe we got enough for one ticket
Fuck
Waitaminit, dudes
got it
We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets
What do you think
(sarcastic) Brilliance, Trip
Sheer brilliance
Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize
Trip smiles proudly
think we should try sneaking in
Four dudes sneaking in
We'd get busted fer sure
Bad plan
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto
Voila
Still too risky for my money
(looking at watch) We're running out of time here
This is
victory for one is a victory for the team
'm sure  can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it
We'll reconvene at that intersection
Hawk points to the intersection where the church, the male strip joint, the parking lot, and the Smiley Mart are located
at twenty-thirty hours
One more time in English
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself
Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30
we'll meet over there
(inspired) Wait
know how we can get in
Jam, shut-up
You're not allowed to speak, remember
Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four
don't wanna hear it
(sadly) But
my plan involves all four of us acting together
See you at 8:30, Jam
Later
(to Lex and Trip) Dudes
Later
Hawk, Trip, and Lex split up, leaving Jam alone
He starts walking in the opposite direction, passing
The leader is still on a roll, yelling through the megaphone
Look around you tonight, mothers
Look at all the young faces
They smile and laugh but their eyes have lost all hope
Not one among them appears to possess the love and fear of God
This satanic group has stolen their souls
The leader's gaze finally falls upon Jam
He lets out a
Yes, the leader is Mrs
Bruce
So this was her church meeting
She freezes when she sees her son; her jaw slackens
Meanwhile Jam looks stunned beyond comprehension
Oh
dear
Lord
Mrs
Bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another member, who picks up where Mrs
Bruce left off
Jam looks around for someplace to run and hide, but it's too late
Mrs
Bruce slices through the crowd of  fans and grabs Jam by the ear
He yelps
don't know how you got here tonight and  don't want to know either
All know is you're going to pay dearly for this one, young man
, '  - Mrs
Bruce tugs Jam toward the intersection we saw before
They cross the street toward the corner where the Cathedral sits
Jam looks up at the cross on the steeple and  with trepidation
Mom, what're we
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah
They climb the steps to the cathedral passing a bulletin board reading: Thank God It's Friday Mass, 6PM-7PM
exit the beautiful church, shaking hands with a as they leave
What a wonderful mass, Father/So inspirational, Father/Thank you
Thank you/Come again next week
Mrs
Bruce pulls Jam up to the priest
Next mass is tomorrow morning, sister
Can we talk, Father
'm desperate
My son was about to defy God by going to that blasphemous  concert
In that case, come right in
Meanwhile, across the street
- Parked in front of the busy fast-food establishment we recognize the two-toned Chevy Impala with luggage tied on top
In the window we see Beth and her parents sitting at one of the booths
Out the window Beth looks across the street just as Jam, Mrs
Bruce, and the priest enter the cathedral
Her face drops
Oh my God
That's Jeremiah
Who
Jeremiah Bruce from school
He and his mom just went into that church
He must be in Detroit for the concert
Can  go say good-bye to him
Beth,  am not letting you wander the streets of Detroit after dark
'm not going to wander
'm just gonna go over there
Beth points to St
Sebastian's
He's with his mom
Fine, as long as we know where you are
But don't be long
We need to be getting back on the road
Beth is already out the door and halfway across the street
Dad pats mom's shoulder
She's probably got a little crush on that boy
'  - Beth runs up to the cathedral and sneaks in
'     - Hawk walks down the sidewalk badgering everyone passing by for a ticket, getting the same stock answer: "Suffer, dude
" He stops and sits on a curb, lighting a cigarette
Behind him stands the marquee for '  , the male strip joint
comes from inside
Just when it looks like Hawk's given up, a  is heard above
Hey, chief
Need a ticket
Hawk can't believe his ears
He looks up at a greasy-looking hybrid, part porn star, part used car salesman, the
Second row center, seventy-five clams
Trying to act confident, Hawk takes out his money clip showing the scalper twenty-five dollars
Dude, this is all  got
Sorry, man, no can do
But 'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy
Where the hell am  gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour
The easy way
The scalper points over his shoulder and Hawk turns to see three   exiting the strip joint
None are under forty
sign below the bar's logo reads: Amateur Night Giveaway
Guys Over 18 Only
Bare It All And Win 75 Bucks
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot
can't just walk in and take my clothes off
It's embarrasskin
Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth
And in Detroit no less
Well, take care, chief
The scalper turns and Hawk grabs his arm
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, 'd give it my best shot
'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time
But this
tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow
Hey,  invented fake
s, alright
That's not the problem
They're playing disco music in there, man
Chief, here's a little secret
Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do
Now shit or get off the pot
Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see only on their album covers
Hawk gets a look of resolve on his face
You sure you'll have a ticket for me
You have my solemn oath as a public servant
Hawk turns and walks up to the door, hesitating before opening it
Rummaging through his pockets, he pulls out a handful of expired driver's licenses
Choosing the one he thinks best suits himself, he walks in with trepidation
The scalper sees someone else coming up
Hey, chief, you need a ticket
Second row center, seventy-five clams
It's Trip
No thanks, dude
'm beating my ticket out of some poor, defenseless chump
Trip exits
What's happening to kids today
'     - Hawk enters your average, everyday, male strip joint
crowd of   cheer on a    '
He dances on a lighted, tile stage under a spinning, mirror ball
Hawk shows the     his fake license and the man nods him in
He approaches the bar in the early stages of being very intimidated
The , a man dressed only in tight, black, tuxedo pants, shirt cuffs, and a tie, comes up to Hawk
(voice cracking) Like to sign up for the contest
The bartender gives Hawk the once over
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs
Name
Hawk
Pick a song, Hawk
Got any
You kidding
This is Detroit
Drink
Yeah, a man's drink
Hawk squints at a name tag on the bartender's tie
Dickey
Dickey goes to the bottle rack on the other side of the bar
(to himself) 'm gonna need all the help  can get tonight
Dickey returns with the drink and Hawk pulls out his money clip
(looking at the drink) What's that
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before
Hawk looks at the unfamiliar drink again trying to play it cool
Sure,  have
But not one with ice in it, that's all
(seeing money clip) Save your money, stud muffin
The lady at the end of the bar sends her love
Dickey points to a  sitting at the end of the bar
Mature and sexy
She's a knock-out
Every teenage boy's fantasy
Hawk's eyes pop at this "Mrs
Robinson" before him
Whoa
she is a killer
Amanda Finch
Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit
Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt
She like 'em young
(leaning in) And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice
Hard to get
Think it, act it, know it, be it
Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games
Dicky pats Hawk's shoulder and leaves
Hawk looks away from Amanda and scans the room
He glances back at Amanda
She's still gazing at him the way queens of yore must have eyed particularly cute knights
She winks and toasts Hawk
Hawk raises his glass smiling nervously
They both sip at their drinks
She licks her lips suggestively at him
And, Hawk proceeds to  up his mouthful of Jack Daniels, it all over the bar
/ - Your typical 70's convenient store
Out front two in Star Wars tee-shirts play tug-o-war with a Stretch Armstrong doll
Trip stomps over grabbing them by their mini shirts
When he tries to act tough, it's pathetic
Even six year olds aren't afraid
Hey, you little twerps, gimme your tickets or 'll pop your fuckin' faces in
#1 We don't have any  tickets
#2 Yeah,  sucks
oughta kick your asses for sayin' that
He grabs the Stretch Armstrong and stuffs it in his pocket
But 'm in a hurry so 'll just take this instead
Now scram
The kids run away
- The store is crawling with  , some reading the comic books, others playing pinball against a far wall, still others looking at the poster section
Trip enters on a mission
He looks around catching the eye of a pretty
She's a rocker, wearing a Who tee-shirt, a mood ring, and just a little too much make-up
She smiles at him
Trip returns the smile with a feeble wave
Her mood ring turns from blue to pink
Concentrating on the layout of the store, Trip peers all the way to the back to a darkened corner
where he spies a wearing a  tee-shirt playing a  pinball machine
Trip smiles
The eagle has spotted a fuzzy, little bunny
He moves in for the kill, walking past a crowd of kids at the magazine rack, past the Hostess aisle, past the dairy cooler and into the darkened corner
He stands behind the little kid, relishing this moment
The kid is actually pretty good
We also see now the little kid has his face painted like Ace Frehley
Hey, little kid
Suddenly distracted, the kid loses the ball
Shit
You just skunked my last ball, you
Trip clamps a hand over the little kid's mouth
Okay, booger, your  ticket or your life
The little kid says something but Trip's hand muffles his words
Hunh
The kid says what he said before, but it is utterly incomprehensible, once again thanks to Trip's hand
(looking at his hand) Oh
Okay
But scream and you'll never live to see puberty
'll pop your fuckin' face in
Trip pulls his hand away
Please sir, don't beat me up
do have a  ticket, but not on me
likely story
Hand it over, kid
(bottom lip quivering) No really
My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping
Please, let me get him for you
The kid turns and yells into the store before Trip can stop him
Hey, Chongo
titanic guy at the comic book rack looks up from his issue of "Thing" when he hears his name
has a very low forehead and the expression of an angry bull plastered onto his face
(getting scared) Hey, kid, that's okay
don't wanna see  that ba
Don't try to run, maggot
Chongo's an all-state track star in every event
What do you want
(gleefully) tag on your toe
Nobody threatens me and lives
Look, you can have my wallet
It's not nearly enough, punk
Chongo is getting ever-closer with his tree trunk legs, his barrel chest and hydraulic biceps
He is joined by
Besides,  was gonna take your wallet anyway
After Chongo and his friends crush your ribcage like a pack of Luckys
Chongo arrives eyeing Trip with distaste
Trip goes white
This fairy givin' you shit, bro
He was gonna mug me for my ticket
Me
Mug
That's nuts
said, do you know where  can take a piss
Chongo and his two buds laugh
Then, without a second of warning, Chongo belts Trip in the gut
Trip doubles over and falls breathlessly to his knees
Okay, pimple dick, you've got the option of walking outside with us or gettin' dragged out
Either way you're comin' with us
Trip catches his breath
Please, sir, don't kick my ass
'll do anything to get out of a beating
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the  concert our weasly friend won't be attending
Chongo scratches his head
How much cash do you figure
Take five for a minute, Chongo
Let me do the math
The little kid taps his finger on his chin and the theme from "" begins
While the kid thinks, Trip looks nervously up at Chongo and his buds
Chongo reaches into his denim vest pocket and we hear a
He comes back up with two walnuts, putting them between his bicep and forearm
Trip watches in horror as Chongo makes a muscle and the walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron-hard flesh
Chongo eats the walnuts, shells and all
- The full-to-capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of Lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot and looks at the back side of Cobo Hall just beyond the chain link fence that surrounds the lot
He crouches down and walks between two cars parked against the fence, looking both ways
Seeing a guard's flashlight beam, he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past, then eased
(whispering to self) can't believe 'm actually entertaining the notion of sneaking in
oughta have my cranium examined
Lex finds a vertical break in the chain link
He lays on his back, slides through, then stands on the other side of the fence
He's at the edge of a weedy, littery field that also happens to be poorly lit
Whoa
Danger Will Robinson
Spooked, he lays down again intending to slide back through when a flashlight beam hits his eyes
' Hey you
Get back in here
Lex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the other side of the fence
Panicking, he bolts deeper into the field
' You're not getting far, kid
Lex double-times it as we hear the guard yelling into his walkie-talkie
' We got one just ran into the field from the north lot
The field gets darker as Lex closes in on Cobo Hall's well- lit loading dock, where  empty the remaining bits of 's monstrous set from an 18-wheeler
Other huge trucks are parked nearby
There's a bustle of last minute activity
- Lex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to huge trunks, keeping well hidden
He dodges roadies and avoids being seen by
He slithers along side the 18-wheeler and nears the loading bay
Up ahead some auxiliary speakers, drum kits, and scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building
' There he is
Lex spins
The security guard, flanked by two others, barrel right for him
Shit
He dives rolls under the 18-wheeler
The three security guards leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him
The three guards scramble to their feet and grab a They spin him around roughly
Alright, wiseguy, you are so outta here
They suddenly realize they've got the wrong man
It's a roadie
Hey, what the fuck
The roadie holds up his all-access laminate angrily
Keep your paws to yourself, ya dumb fuckin' apes
The security guards look around frantically for Lex as other roadies join in to defend their comrade
Where'd he go
You see him
No one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the guards and up the loading dock ramp
They don't notice Lex crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master
Praying he won't be spotted, Lex holds his breath as he's carried into the building and disappears
/ '  - Jam sits in the front pew, head buried in his hands as Mrs
Bruce and the priest talk on the alter
Beth moves quietly in the back, unseen and unheard
She looks overwhelmed by the architecture, the detail on the stained glass windows, the icons carved into the columns that support the extravagantly decorated ceiling
The priest catches a glimpse of Beth meandering in the back
Uh, next mass isn't until tomorrow morning, young lady
Run along now
Beth smiles nervously and heads back toward the front door passing a confessional booth
She throws a glance back at the priest and Mrs
Bruce who have returned to conferring, their backs to her
She stealthily ducks into the booth
Now it's been a while since my boy had holy confession
Could you
(smiling) Consider it done
Mrs
Bruce looks down at Jam and sees his drumsticks poking out of his socks
She immediately takes them out and stuffs them into her jacket
Jam doesn't even move
It's about time you gave up on that stupid dream once and for all
No son of mine is going to be a career musician
Jam is stung
Mrs
Bruce and the priest head back down the center aisle exiting through the gigantic front doors
She eyes Jam
Thank you, Father
'll be back for him before you know it; after  take care of some unfinished business
Just knock loudly, sister
He lets her out and locks the door, leaving the keys in the lock, and walks over to Jam
Come along, son
Get into the booth
He helps the despondent Jam up
They walk to the booth and Jam reluctantly gets inside
- Jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him, Beth sits on a bench shrouded in darkness
Her posture is that of someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap
We hear the  noise of the priest getting into his own compartment next door
moment later the small, eye- level door  open
The priest's face is barely visible on the other side of the thick screen, but he's there
Forgive me, Father, for  have sinned
This is my first confession in
well
a really long time
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance
How many sins have you committed since your last confession
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy
Beth leans forward slightly and listens to Jam's confession
'     - Hawk's at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from a rocks glass
Four more empty rocks glasses sit in front of him
He stares at the sexy woman who smiles back, blowing him kisses from the other side of the bar
The  enters the stage
(into microphone) Okay, ladies, hang onto your hormones
Here comes our next amateur
Let's have a big hand for Hawk
The beginning of a rockin'  tune comes over the
and Dicky approaches Hawk
You're up, Hawk
Hawk wakes up fast
There's nothing more sobering than having to undress in public
Oh, Dicky,  c-c-can't
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you
We've got your song playing and everything
- c-can't
(leans in close) Look, people undress in public because, , they're exhibitionists, , they're nutcases, or , they need the money
can tell you're not , and  hope to hell you're not
So my suggestion is, think about why you're a  and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more
Hawk thinks about it, then downs the rest of his drink
He grimaces at it's taste, then opens his eyes with new resolve
You're right, Dicky
gotta do it for
Gotta put a bag over its head and (hiccup) Do it for
Hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off, forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor
He proceeds to fall flat on his face
Dicky looks down concerned, but Hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage
The crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks him out as he walks by
They seem to like what they see
Hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his package first, his ass after
What the hell is he doing
Hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start to the song
He faces them and starts gyrating his drunken hips at them, feeling no confidence whatsoever, until
The  start to  and the pulsing lights begin to hurt his eyes
Hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster than the disco ball above his head
He stops gyrating and clutches his stomach
Uh-oh
Hawk spots an almost-empty beer pitcher one of the - -- women holds above her head
He runs up to the edge of the stage, grabs the pitcher, and
The cheering and music come to a grinding halt
You can hear a pin drop as Hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher
It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, then finally stops
Hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at him
He wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his face
Wow
feel a hundred times better
He hands the vomit-filled pitcher back to the shocked woman
Thanks lady
He looks over at the emcee, who gazes at Hawk from the booth
Maestro
As you were
The emcee stands perfectly still, jaw agape
Come on, dude, we got a bunch of frisky felines waiting for some entertainment
The show must go on
Hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off
The emcee shrugs, re-cuing the song
It starts again as Hawk faces the crowd, dancing with new-found bravado
The women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly start  again
Hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head Roger Daltry style
Then he pulls it back down and tosses it into the crowd
The women actually fight over it
Encouraged, Hawk then peels off his  Army tee-shirt and hurls it at the women, who  with delight
Sure, he may be scrawny, but they don't mind
This lad's got personality
Adrenaline pumping, confidence building, Hawk starts playing the crowd of very responsive ladies
He unbuttons his jeans first
Then, leaving them on, he does an "air guitar" medley: Chuck Berry,  Top, Angus Young from /, and Elvis Costello in six easy steps
Hawk finishes off with a Pete Townshend windmill, shaking his ass at his audience in mid-strum, then licks his finger and touches one of his cheeks: "hot stuff" (he does this in a manly way of course)
Then Hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear bunching up in his crack
The women -
He segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the ladies go ga-ga
He makes the sign of the horns with each hand and wiggles a protruding tongue like Gene Simmons
The gals scream in orgastic joy
Then, Hawk goes for the gold
Yes, he does the Fonzie dance
The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust
Hawk's whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat
Amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw suggestively
At long last Hawk figures he has to give them what they want
He puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips
His Brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs sticking down from some  boxer shorts
The ladies go batty
Unfortunately Hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing
Never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off first
He tries to kick off his shoes
The left one goes flying across the bar and , beans a - in the face
She flies backwards over a chair
Trying to kick the other shoe off, Hawk loses his balance and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the bar
/ - Trip looks at the little kid, Chongo, and the two buds in fear
Two hundred bucks
You heard me, nad breath
My time's precious and  think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life
Look,  want to live, but  don't know where the fuck 'm gonna find two hundred bucks
The little kid shakes his head in disgust
Chongo
Take him outside and tear his ass out through his mouth
Chongo advances, muscles flexing
Hold on
know how  can get the money
just figured it out
Only you might wanna wait outside
The little kid and Chongo look at each other
don't trust him
think he's on the level
He's too stupid to try anything sneaky anyway
Look at him, he's a moron
They look back at Trip
You got fifteen minutes and not a second longer
We have a concert to go to
See you outside
Trip nods sullenly as the kid, Chongo, and the two buds exit
Then he checks to make sure Stretch Armstrong is still with him
- Lex is twisted like a pretzel as he's carted into the bowels of Cobo Hall
He tries to keep calm, but it's not in his nature
(under his breath) Keep it together, Lex
Anything worth fighting for is worth dying for
/  - and  run in all directions as last minute preparations are being attended to
Two roadies carry the base drum down a long ramp unaware that Lex is hidden inside
#2 Boy, this one's heavy
Suddenly, Roadie #2 snags his foot on a mess of cable and loses his balance, dropping the oversized drum
In an instant the drum goes rolling down the ramp quickly gaining speed
#2 Shit
The roadies bolt after the runaway drum
Other workers scurry out of the way to avoid being hit by the speeding instrument
- Lex spins like in a dryer on speed
/  - More techies jump out of the way as the wayward drum heads right for a closed set of double doors
The roadies are just about to grab it before impact, when
The door unexpectedly swings open
The   on the other side scream at the sight of the careening drum heading straight for them
#2 Close that door
Too late
The groupies jump away as the drum flies through the open door and down a flight of stairs
- The drum bounces down the zigzag stairway violently
Lex's of pain can be heard from inside
The big drum hits the landing hard, tips over, then spins like a quarter getting faster before it stops
They barrel down the stairs two at a time
Finally reaching the bottom, they grab the drum
#2 Peter's gonna kill us
As they carry the drum back up the stairs, we see it is now empty
Once the roadies are gone,    to the ceiling
There's Lex clutching exposed pipes for dear life, hanging upside down, praying the coast is clear
'  / - Jam is at the end of his confession
The priest is still listening on the other side of the screen
Beth sits in the shadows behind Jam
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that concert right now
together
That's it
Yeah
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son
And not exactly the most interesting one 've ever heard either
You sure you don't want to talk about
oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe
or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed
No
Well then,  suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing  tickets
realize this is Detroit, but  personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom
'll return in a little while
The priest  the door shut again
Jam is all but shrouded in darkness, but can make out the time on his watch
It's getting late
He resignedly sits on the bench behind him
right on Beth's lap
Jam yells, but Beth throws her hand over his mouth
His eyes bulge
He can't believe what he's seeing
He climbs off Beth and sits next to her
(whispering) Beth
can't believe it
Believe it
Jam thinks for a beat
Something still isn't quite clicking
Are you waiting for confession thought you were Jewish
can hardly speak
She gulps thinking of what to say
have a confession
Here it is
Beth gives him the biggest, wettest, sloppiest kiss in recorded history
She pulls away finally wiping her mouth
didn't mean for that to be so
intense
Forgive me
don't care
wanna hear more
She lunges at him again, kissing him for dear life
Her lips leave his and begin to explore his chin, neck, ear
've loved you ever since  first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah
've just always been too scared to show it
Beth,  can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how 've always felt about you
Call me Jam
It's my band name
You don't know how long 've been waiting to hear that
Jam
He kisses her neck
Unable to stop, they start undressing each other, both breathing heavy
We've got to take this slow
Right, slow
Oh, screw it
She tears his tee-shirt open with her teeth
'     - really buff  dressed as a construction worker is on stage with about ten others who stand in the background
The emcee's hand hovers above the stripper's head
Okay, ladies, it's down to
Troy the Human Jackhammer
The women  as we
the emcee's hand to Hawk who holds an ice pack on the side of his head
and Mr
Massive Head Wound Accompanied by an Upset Stomach-Hawk
The women  but not quite as loud
No contest
The grand prize of seventy- five dollars goes to Troy the Human Jackhammer
The women cheer and a   starts as Troy does a reprise of his act
Hawk walks away from the stage with the rest of the rejected strippers, looking the way he feels: pretty damn stupid
He puts on his pants, trying to walk at the same time and falls to his knees
helpful hand grabs him under the arm and helps him up
It's Amanda looking lustier than ever
Thanks, miss
You're too kind
'm Amanda
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore
Don't be so glum, Hawk
The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities
Huh
'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me
Hawk
- Jam and Beth lay buck naked, tightly wrapped around each other in the heat of passion on the confessional booth floor
They kiss, sweat, and  heavily
Suddenly, the sliding door to the priest's booth opens
Jam and Beth freeze
' Where are you, son
Uhh, tying my shoe
' Oh
So, have you thought of a colorful confession yet
Actually, yes
Last year  walked out of a candy store with a Reggie Bar  hadn't paid for, but went back and apologized the next day
' Boooring
Think, boy, think
We hear the door  shut again as Beth and Jam pick up where they left off
- Trip leafs through a  comic, not really paying attention to it
Directly behind him is the register and the
He starts hearing voices in his head
We see  of his friends' faces hovering around him
' can't believe you're even thinking of committing a robbery, Trip
You don't pass go and collect 200 dollars for pulling stuff like this
' No shit, dude, is this really worth it
Sure you get your ass kicked nine ways to Sunday by that fucking gorilla, but it's still a hundred times better than getting it porked for the next three to five
Trip sends brief, agitated glances around the store meeting the cashier's eyes again
She smiles at him coyly as she plays with her mood ring
He gives her the eye, then returns to his comic
' And what about that girl, Trip
She'll never forget this night
Even if you get away with it, she'll be scarred for life
When are you gonna realize sometimes being tough means being tender
(to the other voices) Alright, everybody,
Trip snaps out of it
All the shoppers and cashier are starring at him
He  loudly, clearing his throat to cover his outburst
The shoppers go back to shopping
enters the store, looks around, then takes a spot alongside Trip and opens a Mad Magazine
(whispering to himself) Okay, bro
You gonna have to do this sometime
Might as well be now
Trip puts a hand in his pocket and takes one last look at Stretch Armstrong before stuffing the action figure back in so it looks like he's got a gun
He takes three deep breaths and discreetly pulls his knit cap down over his eyes, revealing it actually as a semi-ski mask that covers the top half of his face
Just then, the man with the coat puts the magazine back and pulls something over his own head
Trip whirls around pointing Stretch-in-his-pocket at the cashier
Just as the man in the coat, now masked with a stocking, pulls the biggest shotgun ever made from under his coat, pointing it at the cashier as well
The cashier shrieks
So does Trip
Evening, honey
'know what  am, what this is, and what you have to do, so do it quick
(to shoppers, Trip included) The rest of you kindly introduce yourselves to the floor and kiss it hello
His thunder now stolen, Trip drops to the floor along with everyone else
The air is very tense
The cashier starts , keeping her hands in the air
(to cashier) Do or die, bitch
Next time  let the barrels do the talking
-p-please, mister, 'm just a high school kid
Man with the coat  the chamber and the cashier immediately opens the register drawer and starts emptying it
Fuck school, that's what  say just went through the motions till was old enough to drop out and 'm leaving here with at least two fifty the easy way
Look where all that studying's gonna get you tonight
Robbed at gunpoint and possibly shot in the fucking head
for minimum wage
The man with the coat's laughter  in Trip's head till he just can't take it anymore
She suddenly shoots a surprise glance over the man with the coat's shoulder
Seeing this, the man spins around
There's Trip behind him
Alright, drop it or 'll kick your ass
Astounded by Trip's audacity, the man with the coat turns his shotgun point-blank at Trip
Oh, yeah
You and what army
(gulps) The  Army
/ - Your wildest fantasy of a rock show's backstage area come true
The place is packed with "beautiful" people
Scantily- clad  everywhere
Slick,  -
Lots of food
Lots of booze
Lots of fun
It's backstage at a  concert, come on
above the partying hordes to find Lex shimming along an exposed duct amid the pipes, sprinklers, and vents
Looking straight down on everybody, Lex is in awe and disbelief
This is real
This is not a dream
This is real
've pierced the inner circle
He takes the opportunity to peer down some   ' cleavage
Then his eye spots something else
He door
On it a star
Written on the star, the word,
Oh, God, they're in there
big-haired  in mirrored sunglasses  on the dressing room door
It opens, but Lex can't see inside
The hipster stands in the doorway talking to whoever is there
Lex cranes his neck to see around the door jamb
Desperate for a glimpse of his idols, he leans out too far
Suddenly, the entire duct collapses
Breaking loose of the ceiling, Lex hurls to the floor clutching the duct
Backstage goers leap for cover as
he hits the ground in a shower of plaster and dust
The hipster protectively pulls the dressing room door shut as two   jump in front of it
Instantly, huge, burly hands come down on Lex's shoulders
Before he can react, a slew of  have him off his feet and carry him away, a stunned expression frozen to his face
- Lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff of his neck
The security officers laugh and pat themselves on the back as they hurry back in
Lex peeks out the lid
The alley is dark and spooky
He jumps out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest that has ever lived
Its teeth are bared and its black, wolf-like body is coiled, ready to spring
Lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster walks out from the shadows and joins the Shepherd
(petrified) Dogs
Why did it have to be dogs
Then, a   with a spiked collar emerges from the darkness on the other side of the alley, its solid, muscular form making the brick building nearby look like jello
Lex starts  himself on the face
Wake up, Lex
Wake up, man
This part's gotta be a nightmare
No luck
He stops, when several other  emerge from the shadows and gather behind the first three
These new mutts immediately join in the  chorale
The Shepherd snaps at Lex
(to the heavens) God, if you ever get me outta this, swear  will never masturbate again
The pack  even louder
(to heaven again) - Beth lays in Jam's arms on the floor
They might as well be the only two people on the face of the earth
They whisper
So
Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one
'know, to make it so long
dunno
think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther
'm not too up on Gene trivia
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man
If  paid a hundred bucks for a show and all  saw was his solo, 'd consider it
money
Hey, how'd you know that
have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam
Here
She opens her backpack and pulls out a package addressed to Jam
The return address reads: Beth Bumsteen, Somewhere in Ann Arbor
Ann Arbor
My dad's company is relocating him
We're moving
That's why  was acting so freaky in school today
thought it was the last time 'd ever see you
Anyway, open the box
would have given it to you this morning, except
like  said,  was freaking out
Jam opens the box and his jaw drops
It's a black tee-shirt with the "Mystery" logo printed in white on the chest
Jam holds it up
It's gigantic
pass by this really cool tee-shirt shop on my way to school every day and  know you wear those black tee- shirts all the time
You look like a size thirty-five, but all the sizes were in Roman numerals
So  got you an
That's thirty-five, isn't it
Touched, Jam kisses her for a long time
He starts putting on the shirt when suddenly they hear the  of the priest entering his booth
Jam grabs his clothes and sits back on the bench
Beth starts getting dressed at his feet
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son
My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute
(pulling up his pants) Alright, Father, here it is
About two weeks ago  went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if  wanted to take a bath
No
Beth is tying her shoes
Jam slips on his socks
was insulted, so  asked her if was wreaking some wicked b
o
, right
Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me
Oh, this is terrible
Please go on
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father
Built like you wouldn't believe
So  gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour
Jam pauses
Well
Continue
Continue
Okay
when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath
Was it a teddy
Fully dressed, Beth crawls out of the confessional
No
Much bet
mean, much more sinful than that
bustier
Tell you what
You keep guessing and 'll say something when you get it
Splendid
love a good game of Name That Nightie
Jam quietly sneaks out
'  - We can hear the priest's voice as Jam hurries to Beth
They dash out the door
' Satin underwear
Crotchless panties
Leopard skin bra
Fishnet leotard
Leather -string
- Still trapped by the ,  pack of dogs, Lex searches nervously through the garbage behind him
Okay, okay, you're pissed off
can see this
So
Maybe what we need
ah-ha
Lex holds up a worn-out, old frisbee
Play some frisbee, poochies
The pack just glares and
He tosses the frisbee over the packs' heads, but the dogs don't even acknowledge it
They just keep  and
Meanwhile, an unnoticed dog at the rear of the pack, a mangy Basset Hound, turns its flat head to see the frisbee land on the ground behind him
His tail starts to wag
(exasperated) Alright
give up
hearby and forthwith defer my destiny to you mutts
may be an intelligent, upright, walking, homo-fucking sapien, but you fleabags are a force of nature
So, 'm just gonna sit here and wait for you to decide
If you let me live,  thank you
If you bite my head off, 'll die knowing did all  could
It's up to you
Lex waits before the ,  canines
Suddenly, the Basset Hound runs up in front of the pack and drops the frisbee at Lex's feet
Lex looks down at the floppy, wrinkly dog, who wags its tail and  furiously
Well, how do you like that
Lex starts to pet the hound, and one-by-one the rest of the dogs shut-up
Shocked, Lex picks the frisbee up again and throws it
This time the entire pack bolts after the Whammo product
Lex smiles, watching them fight for it in the air
in as the theme from "  " begins
The black Shepherd finally grabs the frisbee in its mouth and runs back toward Lex
It's soon joined by the rest of the pack
That's right about when Lex realizes they aren't going to stop
Whoa
Whoa
The dogs plow into Lex full-force knocking him into the garbage
They surround him licking his face
Lex bursts into unstoppable laughter
Pulling himself up, he pets the dogs as they jump around him wagging their tails and
(baby talk) You sonsofbitches could tickle a guy to death, y'know that
Sure you do
Sure you do
Lex stops
He hears  coming from inside the windowless, brick building on the other side of the alley
He steps in front of the pack and puts his fingers to his lips
They obey, quieting instantly
He then tiptoes to a thin crack in the brick wall
The dogs quietly follow
Lex puts his eye to the crack and peers in
- ' His mom's Volvo and a  are on adjacent hydraulic lifts inside a makeshift auto-mechanic shop
Two   with blow torches stand next to the cars
One has a bandage on his head and seems to be in pain
#1 So,  jump into the car, hot-wire it in thirty seconds and start driving
Then, suddenly  hear this scream
The disco queen was asleep in the back seat
Beefy jerk #2 laughs
#1 You think it's funny
How would you like to have a stiletto heel smacking you in the temple when you're tryin' to work
Beefy jerk #2 laughs more
Beefy jerk #1 checks the time
#1 You about done splittin' a gut there
We gotta get these parts to Toledo by nine
Then a familiar voice is heard coming from the back of the shop
Then maybe you guys'll let me go, huh
Lex follows the voice and sees Christine handcuffed to a radiator near the rear of the shop
Come on, whadaya say
You scratch my back,  scratch yours
You let me go, and in return,  keep my big mouth shut about your little operation here
Mum, know what  mean
#2 You're lucky you're still alive, wench
If you was a guy, we woulda thought nothin' of sawing your head off with a butter knife
#1 What are we gonna do with her anyway
Beefy jerk #2 bares what's left of his yellow, crusty teeth #2 dunno, but she sure looks fun
Beefy jerk #1 touches the bandage on his head
#1 Yeah, and payback's a bitch
Christine  at the thought
Lex's eyeball bulges with terror
'     - the front end of a Jaguar , Michigan vanity plate reading:
its windshield, through which we see Hawk and Amanda kissing in the front seat, clad only in their underwear
Something like "
" plays on the radio
When they separate, Amanda takes out a flask and offers it to Hawk
Thanks
He gulps some down and pulls the flask away
What the hell is that
Gin
Whoa
Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me
'm a brewski man myself
Better ease up then, Hawk
Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we
Who's Whiskey Dick
Amanda plants a stocking foot on Hawk's crotch and rubs
Well
Obviously no one you have to worry about
Woody
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw
Hawk's eyes cross as he lets out a ,
holy shit
Amanda looks down at his crotch
But you do know Premature Peter, don't you
Shame,  just bought these stockings
Hawk has never been more embarrassed
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night
So far you've seen me and my dick throw up
(to the heavens) What's next
Projectile diarrhea
(beat, to Amanda) Man
What a stud, huh
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband
the champion of lousy lovemaking
The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best
The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor
The man for whom faking it was invented
Christ, if hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, would have never known  even had sex with the prick
She takes a healthy swig of gin, relishing its bitterness
You love him
just told you, he's a big, hairy
No,  mean
you love your son
More than anything in the world
And he loves you back, doesn't he
He's a little spoiled, but  know he does
Well, shame on him if he doesn't
She pats his shoulder
You're sweet
Hawk stares out the windshield
My mom died of a heart attack while she was having me
Man,  wish  had known her for even one day
If they ever invent a time machine, that's what 'm doing
Going back in time to meet my mom
'm gonna say, "Mrs
Pitchford
or Miss Williams, depending on when  show up
You don't know me, but 'm your kid from the future
Just wanted to thank you for the blue eyes, pug nose and for tying the knot with a guy who didn't mind diaper detail
Oh, and, uh
cut down on the red meat, will ya
" Amanda caresses Hawk's cheek
He turns with her hand and kisses it
He takes her arm and begins kissing his way up to her neck, her cheek, her mouth
- It's a stand-off
Prone customers look up at Trip and the man with the long coat circling each other like sharks
The helpless cashier lets out fearful sobs
Gimme your gun, boy
No, you gimme your gun, boy
Don't tempt me, 'll shoot
Not if  shoot first
don't even think you have a gun
Neither do
The man with the coat puts his shotgun against Trip's head
Now, for the last time, take the piece out and lay back down or your mom's gonna need the White Tornado to get the brains outta your ski cap
Trip
The jig's up
He slowly pulls out Stretch Armstrong, and the man with the coat glances down and starts to laugh very loud
So loud, he throws his head back
When he recovers, Trip's got Stretch aimed at his head and pulled back to maximum tension
Smile, you sonofa
Trip lets go
The man gets it right in the face and falls backward onto the Hostess display, toppling a whole bunch of Ho-Ho's, Ding-Dong's, Twinkies, and Suzy-'s to the ground
Trip runs up and grabs the shotgun away as the man with the coat lifts his head briefly, then passes out
Trip turns around and the cashier  into him, nearly knocking him over
She throws her arms around him letting out relieved
Behind her all the customers rise from the floor
Trip did it
He saved the fucking store
The cashier looks into Trip's masked eyes
Thank you
Thank you
Who are you
(with confidence) Call me
Dr
Love
She plants a thousand mega-watt kiss on his lips and we on her mood ring changing color from gray to fire engine red
Trip's eyes widen just before
The shotgun he's holding goes off, blowing a hole in the ceiling
The recoil from the blast jolts Trip and the cashier apart
We now see Trip's face is smeared with bright, red lipstick
huge chunk of ceiling falls onto his head but he doesn't move
The kiss hit him harder
' - Christine and the beefy jerks watch the brown, '78 Volvo, Ohio plates: -, ascend on a hydraulic lift
Behind them sits the  skeleton
These boys work fast
You guys better kill me before you do what you're thinking of doing
Cause when 'm mad enough,  can bite down very hard
The beefy jerks laughs
#1 Sweet Polly Purebred's got some spunk, huh
#2 'll give her some spunk alright
They put their blow torches down and turn to her
#1 We stripped that Beemer in fifteen minutes
Bet we can strip her in fifteen seconds
They giggle maniacally and lumber toward Christine
Their shadows growing larger and larger across her
(mile a minute) Now wait a minute, guys
Two against one ain't fair
Lemme go back and get my friend Barbara
You'd love her
Tits the size of your head
You'll feel like a little baby sucking on 'em
swear, 'll bring her right back
It'll be a four-way
You guys like disco
teach disco dancing at my church
You guys look like you got rhythm in your blood
Come on, free lessons if you let me go
#1 know a dance we can do
The horizontal hustle
They both laugh
Just as they're about to grab her
Suddenly, the garage door behind them   revealing darkness
Christine and the beefy jerks look out anxiously
#1 Who's there
Silence except for
Then
from out of the darkness emerges a figure
Lex
Christine's eyes brighten like a bulb
'm here for the girl and the car
You can try to stop me, but  must warn you, it may be hazardous to your health
The beefy jerks laugh at this little punk
They start toward him, one with a tire iron, the other a big monkey wrench
#1 Too bad
He was such a young idiot
#2 Ehhh
He was a stupid boy
He deserved to die
Lex lets out a quick -
The pack of dogs led by the Shepherd, the Pit Bull, the Doberman, and the Basset Hound, step from the darkness and flank Lex, and  at the beefy jerks
Listen to them
Children of the night
What music they make
Hounds of hell
Say hello to dinner
The beefy jerks drop their tools on their feet and yelp in pain
The pack takes this as a threat and charge the beefy jerks, who bolt for a glass-partitioned office
The dogs and  at the window ferociously
Lex smiles at Christine
She smiles back
He presses the "down" button on the lift and the Volvo descends
Lex yells to the beefy jerks through the glass
One foot out of that office and your asses are Alpo
Lex unlocks Christine
She leaps into his arms
Wow
Thank you
You're cooler than the Fonz
She gives him a lingering kiss
Lex leans back, gives the double thumbs-up, and says
Aaaayyyyy
Lex takes her hand and they walk over to the Volvo
Lex lets her in then rounds the car to the driver's side
#1 Hey, what about the dogs
You got a phone in there
They nod
Lex drips a dry smile onto them
Call the cops
The beefy jerks watch in disbelief as the Volvo out of the chop shop
2 , - Beth's parents wait in the running car as Jam and Beth share a heartfelt good-bye outside the back door
Ann Arbor isn't
that far from Cleveland, right
Nah
Once  get my own wheels, could come up all the time
That'd be great
Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there
It's a college town, you know
Jam takes her hands
feel like such an idiot
Why didn't just say something a year and a half ago
Man, think of how much time we wasted
Let's not think about the past
Let's just think about from today on
'll never forget you, Jam
Tell me about it
Church will never be the same again
They stare at each other for a really long time
Then, kiss
Dad looks back out the window and (flustered) Coming dad
(to Jam) 'll call you
Soon as we get a phone
Bye
Bye
She gets in the car
They both wave as the Impala turns a corner out of sight
Jam is left alone still waving long after she's gone
'  - Amanda and Hawk are half-dressed post-coitus
She looks in her purse
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound,  can't take any money for
'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know
It would only cheapen the whole deal for me
'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk
just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer
She forces the money into his palm
Thanks
They kiss
You're a good man, Hawk
Thank you
- The cashier, shoppers, and a gathering  watch two cops load the dazed man with the coat into a cruiser
#1 (to cashier) You wouldn't happen to know where we could find this
Dr
Love, would you
It's company policy to hand over a cash reward of a hundred and fifty dollars to anyone who stops a robbery
gave him the money and he took off
The cops shrug and get into the cruiser
#2 Okay, well, thanks anyway
And let us know if you happen to see him again
We'd like to ask him some questions
The cruiser takes off and the cashier stares at her mood ring
It throbs red like a beating heart
(sighing to herself) If  see Dr
Love any time soon, you're gonna have to wait till 'm done with him first
- We find Trip counting his money out to the little kid, Chongo, and their two buds
hundred forty, hundred fifty
That's all  got
The little kid puts the money in his pocket
Tsk
Tsk
Tsk
really wanted things to work out for you, my weasly, dim- witted friend
You got spunk
(to Chongo) Chongo, give him a fifty dollar wallop
Chongo reels back and
Oh, no
Please, look
Right in Trip's face
Trip flies off his feet into the Smiley Mart brick wall with a
bag of weed drops from his jacket, then some uppers, a few sheets of acid, and finally a can of beer rolls out
Hey, the jerkoff's got drugs
Consider it a bonus, Chongo
Chongo laughs like an ejaculating gorilla as he and his two buds scoop it all up
The little kid, Chongo, and the buds leave Trip lying in a puddle of his own nose blood
He pulls out Stretch Armstrong and looks at him fondly
(misty eyed) At least  still got you, Stretch
Trip looks up
The six year olds who he stole it from stand close by having watched the whole humiliating exchange
Licked, Trip tosses the doll to them
They both dash away with it, giggling
- Christine sits in an idling taxi taking money from Lex, who stands outside the window
This oughta be enough to get you to Disco Inferno, Christine
Come with
It's not too late for you to catch the fever
No can do
But  made a promise to get you to that disco, and we maniacs are men of our word
Besides
you're pretty cool
for a stella,  mean
Christine takes his hand and writes something on his palm in lipstick
Here's my number
Tell me how cool am over the phone sometime
Okay
She gives Lex a kiss then pushes him away
(to ) Disco Inferno, on the double
The taxi  away as Lex smiles and gets back into the Volvo
- Jam approaches the stadium, passing the , walking straight up to Mrs
Bruce
Her back is to him
He taps her on the shoulder
She turns
Her jaw drops
It escaped again
And what an ugly tee-shirt
'm gonna ask you nicely first
Mom, can  have my drumsticks back
Taken aback by his confidence, Mrs
Bruce grabs his ear and tries to pull him away
He won't budge
Again, can  have my drumsticks
walk by with big transistor radios
One of them holds a Mr
Microphone and heckles the
Hey, 'm on the radio
Hi, good- lookin'
We'll be back to pick you up later
Mrs
Bruce yells at Jam through her bullhorn
Drumsticks are the least of your worries, young man
You are in a world of
Jam yanks the Mr
Microphone from the lead idiot and screams at his mother, his voice amplified on the transistors
Everyone stares
know, mom, 've been in trouble for about twelve hours now
Hellooooo
The other  turn to look as Jam climbs onto a trash receptacle and shouts down at his mother, his face slowly turning purple
'm gonna be spending the next two years of my life at St
Bernard's Boarding School, remember
'm gonna be outta your hair till 'm a legal adult, remember
That way, all you have to do is go to church, light a candle, pray to a little statue for me, and voila
All is forgiven and forgotten, right mom
Then, you can spend your days in guilt-free pursuit of more constructive activities like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are
That way you no longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on some normal level with your own child
And that way you don't even have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up, and it's a good thing too
Cause if you did, you'd realize what a , , - ,
The crowd of  fans  Jam's rant
Mrs
Bruce is utterly winded from the assault
(timidly) Jeremiah
what's gotten into you
(into Mr
Microphone) just lost my virginity in a confessional booth
Lord have mercy
The crowd cheers
Jam jumps down and hands the Mr
Microphone back to the lead idiot
He turns to his mom
For the last time, mom
Let me have my fucking drumsticks
Please
Mrs
Bruce reaches into the trash, finds the drumsticks and hands them to him
He spins them like pistols, then stuffs them into his socks and walks away
'     - Hawk runs to the scalper across the street who's selling a ticket to another  fan
Whoa
Whoa
That better not be the last ticket
hope you have another one for me
The scalper sees Hawk and bolts down the street disappearing around a corner
Hawk stops
He's lost him
Hawk sulks to the now-familiar intersection where all four landmarks meet
He takes one more look up the block at Cobo Hall
Nearly all the  fans are inside
The streets are almost deserted
Fuck me
He sees someone out of the corner of his eye across the street
It's Jam
Lex approaches the other corner
Trip comes up to the forth corner
They all stop when they see each other
Each standing on his own corner
They're all pissed
They meet in the middle of the street as last minute hurry by
Any luck
Plenty, but it was all bad
found the Volvo
Tickets
They all shake no
Well, dudes, the only way we're gonna see  this tour is by some fuckin' miracle
Suddenly, a commotion up the street
yanks four 12    dressed like  by the scruffs of their necks
She's furious, they're
How dare you sneak out of the house like that
You had me worried to death
Don't you know this is Detroit
And for a degenerate band like
They're sick, sick, sick and oughta be in jail with their vile antics
She throws a wad of paper to the pavement as they pass our four heroes
The dudes watch her pull the brats away
Just wait until your father gets ahold of you
Jam, Hawk, Lex, and Trip turn and look at the crumpled wad at their feet
It's an envelope
An highlights it
No
You don't think
Nah
Couldn't be
They all shake their heads in unison resolved that it isn't
Then, unable to control themselves, they dive for the envelope
Jam tears it open
His trembling hand reaches in
All their eyes focus like lasers on what's inside
Jam pulls out four  tickets
Their jaws drop
Their eyes bug
It's a miracle
miracle
The boys are practically moved to tears
It's Divine Intervention at its finest
Suddenly, a greasy hand juts out of nowhere and grabs the tickets
The boys look up shocked
They can't believe it
Yes, Elvis
Fire in his eyes
Mania on his mind
And tickets in his hand
(laughing hysterically) Whose laughing now
Whose laughing now, ya little shits
told ya
Over my dead body
Ha--
(arms outstretched) Take it easy, Elvis
Don't do anything crazy
Just give me the tickets before someone gets hurt
Hey, wait a minute
This ain't school property
He's not the boss of us here
(crazed) That's right
This ain't school
It's not about school anymore
Now it's personal
Come on, Elvis
We was only kiddin'
It's all in good fun
We run, you chase
Cat and mouse
You know
Boys, this time
win
Elvis stuffs all four tickets in his mouth and chews crazily
In seconds,
Elvis explodes into unhinged laughter as he runs away zigzagged down the street
Our boys are left dumbstruck and speechless
After a really long pause
Well
still got my idea if anybody will let me speak
(beaten) Go ahead, Jam
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen
They gotta let us in then
They stand and think for a moment
Hawk's mouth curls into a devilish grin
Then, he lets out a gigantic "
and slugs Jam
The four boys brutally pummel one another in the middle of the intersection
Punching
Kicking
Headbutting
- Two   are letting the last  fans in
They're about to close the doors when our four bloodied and bruised heroes come running up
Dude, you gotta let us in
Four muggers just stole our tickets
(sceptical) You expect us to believe that
Look at us
Trip points into the crowd of fans inside the auditorium foyer
It was those assholes
They even stole my wallet
The ticket takers turn to see the little kid, Chongo, and their two buds just going in
The ticket takers signal two security guards who proceed to stop the four stunned kids and confiscate their tickets
They find all the stolen dope and Trip's wallet
Inside that you'll find my  Army picture
and a hundred fifty bucks cash
The security guards see he's right and break out the cuffs
(to little kid) Tsk
Tsk
Tsk
was really hoping things would work out for you, my weasly, midget friend
You got spunk
The little kid for once is speechless
Then the ticket taker extends his arm in   into Hall as if to say "Entrez Vous
" The four friends pause
This is it
They take a few slow steps almost as if they don't believe it, then run like the wind into the auditorium
- The lights are out
The lighters have been lit
The ' is deafening
Jam, Hawk, Trip, and Lex plow their way through the throngs and head straight for the front row just as Simple Simon takes the stage
You wanted the best
And you got the best
The hottest band in the world
Simple Simon runs from the stage just as the opening chords to
On the beat, ,  shoot from the floor alighting the place
takes the stage descending on hydraulic elevators
, , , They're seeing God
The show is spectacular
The costumes
The make-up
The blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics
The flashing  sign
Ace's smoking guitar
Gene's spewing fire
Paul's rockin' vocals
Peter's kick-ass beat
Then, something really weird happens
The crowd behind the boys heaves forward
Jam is pushed like a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front of him
Purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene
Just before Peter's drum solo is about to start
Gene, Paul, and Ace silence their instruments
Peter throws his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it comes down
But the sight of Jam landing on the stage distracts him
All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick
It hits the outside edge of one of the drums
Thinking fast, Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his sock and tosses it to Peter
It tumbles through the air in with a , ,
We see the word "Mystery" clearly as it twirls
Instantly, it's caught in Peter Criss's hand and he brings it down on his drum not missing a beat
The song resumes with all its fury as Peter's drum kit ascends on a hydraulic platform
Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience barely missing the claws of some security guards
The four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage exuberance
Will it ever get any better than this
