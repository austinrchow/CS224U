Written by Joss Whedon "And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat
On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the foes no single superhero could withstand
Through the years, their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory has never been denied
Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers Assemble
" smoky cube shape emerges -
Filling the screen with
: , Kneeling behind a , a ,   known as , bows
(
) The Tesseract has awakened
It is on a little world
human world
They would wield its power,
: faces a
Loki is handed the , a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem encircled with silver blades
(
) But our ally knows its workings as they never will
He is ready to lead
And our force, our Chitauri, will follow
:    of  stand ready in a seething mass of neat rows and columns
the ground simply (
) The world will be his
The universe yours
And the humans, what can they do but burn
: Out in the   desert, a remote research facility is in a state of panic
It's an evacuation
helicopter flies in
Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to leave' fashion
Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating the hell out of there
bellows from hidden loudspeakers
Standing a few yards from the landing pad,  Fed in a suit with badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands
This is Walking out of the helicopter is    , , Following her, climbs out
Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson
How bad is it
That's the problem, sir
We don't know
Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section of the facility
Hundreds of technicians and other staff run around, taking only the essentials
Dr
Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago
didn't authorize Selvig to test phase
He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room
Spontaneous advancement
It just turned itself on
What are the energy levels now
Climbing
When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac
How long to get everyone out
Campus should be clear in the next half hour
Do better
Sir, evacuation may be futile
We should tell them to go back to sleep
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance
need you to make sure that  2 prototypes are shipped out
Sir, is that really a priority right now
Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on
Clear out the tech below
Every piece of  2 on a truck and gone
Yes, sir
(to standing agents) With me
, Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held by a
Talk to me, doctor
emerges from behind the  machine, concerned
The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings shoot out at random
Director
Is there anything we know for certain
Tesseract is misbehaving
Is that supposed to be funny
No, it's not funny at all
The Tesseract is not only active, she's
misbehaving
How soon until you pull the plug
She's an energy source
If we turn off the power, she turns it back on
If she reaches peak level
We've prepared for this, doctor
Harnessing energy from space
We don't have the harness
Our calculations are far from complete
Now she's throwing off interference, radiation
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation
That can be harmful
Where's Barton
The Hawk
Up in his nest, as usual
We see  , dressed in black tactical gear, is up on the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his earpiece
Agent Barton, report
rappels down from the catwalk
Walks up to Fury
They both walk around the facility in a discreet manner
gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things
Well,  see better from a distance
Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off
( ) Doctor, it's spiking again
No one's come or gone
It's oven is clean
No contacts, no
's
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end
At this end
Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right
The doors open from both sides
clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the monitoring his worst nightmares
Suddenly- the Tesseract and  the entire facility
Big enough where both Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends of the facility
The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and louder, like a boiling pot of water
The Tesseract's energy builds up into a  much like the Bifrost Bridge, which at the end of a platform that is wired to the  device
The great maelstrom beam  the  energy
The beam then forms a , which then opens up a
From the portal, the blackness of , beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars appears and a  of    fill the room, blinding everyone
The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling
It's abnormally quiet
Then
is heard from the platform
slowly approach, weapons in hands
figure is kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it
It's
Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head
The smile dies down
He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and Selvig
He stands up, holing the scepter
Sir, please put down the spear
Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and Fury and they both barely miss Loki's fired shot
Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the bullets bounce off him like a boss
Loki jumps high from the platform and  those firing at him
In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his and   from the scepter
He stops and waits to see who will attack him next
Honestly, the whole lab has almost gone to shit
Barton tries to stand up
Loki quickly walks towards him
Barton raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand
You have heart
Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head
Barton's eyes suddenly glow
The ability to control Barton's mind is now in Loki's hand
Barton puts his piece away and stands straight
As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several
personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract, placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab
Then
Please don't
still need that
() This doesn't have to get any messier
Of course it does
've come too far for anything else
am Loki of Asgard, and  am burdened with glorious purpose
Loki
Brother of Thor
We have no quarrel with your people
An ant has no quarrel with a boot
You planning to step on us
come with glad tidings, of a world made free
Free from what
Freedom
Freedom is life's great lie
Once you accept that, in your heart
Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart
Selvig's eyes glow
You will know peace
Yeah, you say peace,  kind of think you mean the other thing
From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud builds into what may be an implosion
Sir, Director Fury is stalling
This place is about to blow
Drop a hundred feet of rock on us
He means to bury us
Like The Pharaohs of Odin
He's right
The portal is collapsing in on itself
You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical
Well, then
Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other personnel Loki is controlling
, Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other
personnel are in the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain weapons
Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki
(pointing to the Loki team) Need these vehicles
Who's that
He didn't tell me
Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck and turns to leave, as she's walking away
(through the walkie talkie) Hill, do you copy
Loki and Barton  look at Agent Hill
Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily
Barton is
Suddenly, Hill turns to   , but Barton is already at her and starts , he moves the driver's seat of the truck and   as Hill keeps shooting
Fury is holding his side, running
He's got the Tesseract
Track it down
The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling
/ Agent Hill  into a  and follows after Barton's truck
Loki's trucks  across the tunnel
Several trucks pull up to them
drive-by shooting ensues
Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his scepter and  energy blasts, flipping over  trucks
They get in, the cars roar out after them
Agent Hill puts herself at a distance
Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes
The entire facility is now in a full earthquake
, Agent Coulson and several  agents fall down the steps, dropping   of information
They attempt to grab them, but
No
Leave it
They run out of there like a bat from hell
Agent Hill's   out of a side of Barton's truck and pulls up alongside them on the left
She goes way ahead and pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and driving in reverse
Barton's  reach out the open window and
Agent Hill figures `fuck it' and  her windshield   on Barton
Agent Coulson jumps into a
On his walkie: You're clear, sir
You need to go
Fury  out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter
The surface of the pad gives way,  the helicopter through the surface
But Fury's chopper  makes it out
Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's  to  out and put her back behind
, The Tesseract's energy cloud now  into a Then
Fury watches from below, a  build-up into what may be an implosion
Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van feels a  of the Tesseract's --  ,
The  of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it
Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto Agent Hill's , leaving her  trapped under this blanket of rock
On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the desert landscape
Fury's helicopter  over Barton's truck
Loki looks up
From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there, holding a gun,  at Barton's, giving an honoring image of Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of , points his scepter The chopper  on fire, in a
Fury, like the boss he is,   and touches down onto the desert floor
The chopper  along the ground
Fury, coming back to his senses,  at Loki, but they're toofar and too late
Loki looks back, smiling
Fury stands there,
Then
( ) Director
Director Fury, do you copy
The Tesseract is with the hostile force
have men down
Hill
Agent Hill climbs out her , which is sandwiched in, but luckily, not her
lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors
Sound the general call
want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case
( ) Roger that
Coulson, get back to base
This is a As of right now, we are at war
beat
( ) What do we do
Fury stands there
Thinking
He looks up
On his face is sign of hope
,  , 3RD Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction building is being occupied by  , a , along with his
is in the middle of a brutal beating on , a , ,
He ' face
She feels the pain, but does not breakdown
, smiling, walks up to her
Dialogue is in
This is not how  wanted the evening to go
know how you wanted this evening to go
Believe me, this is better
'd like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items
rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an open floor
Natasha is now scared
thought General Soholob was in charge of the export business
Soholob
Your reputation is quite a progression
Nothing but a pretty face
You really think 'm pretty
slowly walks over to a table filled with tools
He picks up a pair of pliers
opens up her mouth wide open
We do not need the Lermontov to transfer the tanks
Tell him, well,
( ) You may have to write it down
Suddenly,  ' cell rings
Confused, he answers
Ya
(looks at ) It's for you
takes the phone, pissed
Who the hell is
You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor
We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out
Put the woman on the phone or  will blow up the block before you can make the lobby
places the cell phone against Natasha's ear seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her back
We need you to come in
Are you kidding
'm working
This takes precedence
'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything
don't give everything
Natasha gives him a look
Look, you can't pull me out of this right now
Natasha
Barton's been compromised
beat
Let me put you on hold
She nods to
As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her, Natasha  him with her leg and  him
Like a spider, she stands up elegantly and starts    by him in the face
Still tied, she  over   after she trips him
She then  on   foot with peg of the chair, then Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line
She then  over and  down hard on  , She sees   stand
Giving her momentum, she runs at him   him, and  right back up and She grabs , wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and drops him down the open floor, dangling
She picks up the phone and her heels, like a boss
Where's Barton now
We don't know
But he's alive
We think so
'll brief you on everything when you get back
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me
No, 've got Stark
You get the big guy
Bozhe moi
runs through the crowd, trying to force a way through
tiny shack
The   runs up the steps, only to be stopped by an attending woman
Then, the   spots him
, their  doctor
What are doing here
Get out
You shouldn't be here
have to see the doctor
It's my father
Calm down
What's wrong
My father
Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few people, lying down, looking very sick
Is he like them
The   holds out all the money she has in the world
Please
Banner and the   hastily run nearly to the edge of town
The   gets ahead of herself
Banner spots local government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him
/
' Banner quickly follows the   inside her house
As he walks in, the
Banner is left standing there like a dumbass
Should have got paid up front, Banner
Natasha then appears from behind the curtains
Banner turns around, quietly
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle
Avoiding stress isn't the secret
Then, what is it
Yoga
You brought me to the edge of the city, smart
uh
assume the whole place is surrounded
Just you and me
And your actress buddy, is she a spy too
Do they start that young
did
Who are you
Natasha Romanoff
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff
Because that's not gonna work out for everyone
No
No
Of course not
'm here on behalf of
How did they find me
We never lost you, doctor
We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent
Why
Nick Fury seems to trust you
But now need you to come in
What if  said no
'll persuade you
And what if the
other guy says no
You've been more than a year without an incident
don't think you wanna break that streak
don't always get what  want
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe
Well, those  actively try to avoid
This is the Tesseract
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet
She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone
Banner takes a closer look
What does Fury want me to do
Swallow it
Well, he wants you to find it
It's been taken
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do
If there was, that's where 'd be
So Fury isn't after the monster
Not that he's told me
And he tells you everything
Talk to Fury, he needs you on this
He needs me in a cage
No one's gonna put you in a
The   in is voice makes Natasha  grab her gun and point it at him, but something is now  in the atmosphere
Banner stands straight up, smiling
'm sorry, that was mean
just wanted to see what you'd do
Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess
Okay
Natasha
Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun
She lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece
Stand down
We're good here
' Amazingly,     are surrounding the shack outside
' Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her
Just you and me
Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down
Fury is facing several   as he as a conference with members of the
#1 This is out of line, Director
You're dealing with forces you can't control
You ever been in a war, Councilman
In a firefight
Did you feel an overabundance of control
#1 You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet
Not Asgard
Loki
#2 He can't be working alone
What about the other one
His brother
Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile
But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help
It's up to us
#1 Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly
2 isn't ready, our enemy is
We need a response team
#1 The Avengers Initiative was shut down
This isn't about The Avengers
#1 We're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks
'm not leaving anything to anyone
We need a response team
These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need
#2 You believe
#1 War isn't won by sentiment, Director
No, it's won by soldiers
Somewhere in an old, almost -esque boxing gym,  , a man out of time,   , '   is a punching bag
With every swing, it's like a memory he's trying to fight off and repress
() Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars, gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms
(
) There's not enough time
gotta put her in the water
Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag
It gets harder
,  '    () Steve places his  with an image of
The time is here for him to crash the plane
Steve closes his eyes
Goes at the bag harder
(
) You won't be alone
,  '    () The   picks up the
Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last memory kicks in
don't think he can physically stop
(
) Oh my god
,    () half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab
Two run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals are up
And it seems
This guy is still alive
Steve  tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out the sand
He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of over repressed feeling
After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching bag, which is laying next another
He hooks the bag up and starts punching again
Fury walks in
Trouble sleeping
slept for seventy years, sir
think 've had my fill
Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world
Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands
He sits down
went under, the world was at war, wake up, they say we won
They didn't say what we lost
We've made some mistakes along the way
Some very recently
You here with a mission, sir
am
Trying to get me back in the world
Trying to save it
Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on ' projects
Hydra's secret weapon
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you
He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy
That's something the world sorely needs
Who took it from you
He's called Loki
He's not from around here
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in
The world has gotten even stranger than you already know
At this point,  doubt anything would surprise me
Ten bucks says you're wrong
There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment
Steve turns and picks up a punching bag
Starts walking out of the gym
Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now
You should have left it in the ocean
Out in the Atlantic Ocean,  , in his   suit, is cutting a   with a laser cutter coming from his hand
He then places a
It lights up rockets out of the water and flies towards
You're good on this end
The rest is up to you
(on the other line) You disconnected the transition lines
Are we off the grid
--
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy
Wow
So maybe our reactor takes over and it actually works
assume
Light her up
As   flies to the   , the power is switched on and the  sign
How does it look
Like Christmas, but with more
me
Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign
You need to do some press can do some more tomorrow
'm working on the zoning for the next billboards
Pepper, you're killing me
Remember
Enjoy the moment
Then get in here and  will
arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process of taking off his   suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of gadgets
Sir, Agent Coulson of  is on the line
'm not in
'm actually out
Sir, 'm afraid he's insisting
Close the line Jarvis
got a date
' stares up at the monitors of the reactor device
Levels are holding steady
think
Of course they are,  was directly involved
Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius
Well, ha,  really wouldn't know now, would
What do you mean
All this came from you
No
All this came from that
Points to the energy in his chest plate
Give yourself some credit, please
Stark Tower is your baby
Give yourself
twelve percent of the credit
Twelve percent
An argument can be made for fifteen
Twelve percent
For my baby
Well,  did do all the heavy lifting
Literally,  lifted the heavy things
And sorry, but the security snafu
That was on you
Oooooh
My private elevator
You mean  elevator
was teeming with sweaty workmen
'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't
Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne
Not gonna be that subtle
'll tell you what
Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower
On the lease
Call your mom, can you bunk over
Sir, the telephone
'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten
Stark, we need to talk
Tony picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson
You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message
This is urgent
Then leave it urgently
At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears
Security breach
( ) That's on you
Mr
Stark
Phil
Come in
Phil
Uh, his first name is Agent
Come on in, we're celebrating
Which is why he can't stay
We need you to look this over
(he holds out a file towards ) Soon as possible
don't like being handed things
That's alright, `cause  love to be handed things
So, let's trade
She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and passes the file over to Stark
Thank you
Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday
This isn't a consultation
Is this about The Avengers
Which know nothing about
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, thought
And  didn't even qualify
didn't know that either
Yeah, apparently 'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others
That  did know
This isn't about personality profiles anymore
Whatever
Miss Potts, got a minute
Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases
You know,  thought we were having a moment
was having twelve percent of a moment
This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken
How did you notice
Why is he Phil
What is all of this
This is, uh
Tony  his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper
This
Screens appear of    , the , and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which Stark and Pepper look on in awe
'm going to take the jet to
tonight
Tomorrow
You've got homework
You've got a lot of homework
Well, what if  didn't
If you didn't
Yeah
You mean if you finished
(Stark nods his head) Well, um
then
She whispers something in his ear
Tony
Coulson looks away in embarrassment
Square deal
It's the last date
Pepper kisses him
Work hard
As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried
Inside the , Steve is sitting down, holding a , watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver University
We're about forty minutes out from base, sir
Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve
So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me
lot of people were
You were the world's first superhero
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula
The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart
Didn't really go his way, did it
Not so much
When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking
Steve looks confused
He's like a smart person
gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially
Steve smiles at Coulson
sort of met you,  mean,  watched you while you were sleeping
Steve looks down
He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to the side with Coulson following
mean,  was
was present while you were unconscious from the ice
You know, it's really, it's just a
just a huge honor to have you on board
Well,  hope 'm the man for the job
Oh, you are
Absolutely
Uh
we've made some modifications to the uniform
had a little design input
The uniform
Aren't the stars and stripes a little
old fashioned
With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned
Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment
Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned
Loki sits down, watching Selvig work with a  device
Loki meditates, until
the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of , fully armed in his horned helmet and armor appears from the steps
The Chitauri grow restless
Let them go at themselves
will lead them into glorious battle
Battle
Against the meager might of Earth
Glorious, not lengthy
If your force is as formidable as you claim
You question us
You question
He, who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated
was a king
The rightful king of Asgard
Betrayed
Your ambition is little, born of childish need
We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil
You don't have the Tesseract yet
runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter
don't threaten, but until  open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words
You will have your war, Asgardian
If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you
You think you know pain
He will make you long for something as sweet as pain
places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back to Earth
Loki looks around, menacing
The  lands down a   known as the It has two runways
One with direct access to a hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel
Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with Natasha
Agent Romanoff
Captain Rogers
Ma'am
Hi
( ) They need you on the bridge
Face time
See you there
Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking towards the railing of the ship
There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice
thought Coulson was gonna swoon
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet
Trading cards
They're vintage, he's very proud
Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he isnervous as hell
He moves around as people keep walking in hisway
Dr
Banner
Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands
Oh, yeah
Hi
They told me you'd be coming
Word is you can find the cube
Is that the only word on me
Only word  care about
(takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this
Well, this is actually kind of familiar
Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute
It's gonna get a little hard to breath
Suddenly the  starts  as it prepares to fly "sail
" Is this is a submarine
Really
They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container
They both move closer to the edge of the Steve watches in  as Banner smiles
,
The doors part and we enter       a flurry of activity  dozens of agents sit in front of their
Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave
Turns to  , who is at the command chair
We're at lock, sir
Good
Let's vanish
The  rises high into the heavens
Suddenly, the entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then camouflages in the sky
Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge, taking his position at the
Gentlemen
Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again
Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand
Banner, reluctantly shakes it
Doctor, thank you for coming
Thanks for asking nicely
So, uh
how long am  staying
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear
Where are you with that
Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet
Cellphones, laptops
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us
That's still not gonna find them in time
You have to narrow the field
How many spectrometers do you have access to
How many are there
Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays
'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition
At least we could rule out a few places
Do you have somewhere for me to work
Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr
Banner to his laboratory, please
Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall
You're gonna love it, Doc
We got all the toys
, Selvig and several scientists work around the  device
Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet
Put it over there
( ) Where did you find all these people
has not shortage of enemies, Doctor
He holds up a screen showing information on
Is this the stuff you need
Yeah, iridium
It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons
It's very hard to get hold of
Especially if  knows you need it
Well,  didn't know
(sees Loki coming) Hey
The Tesseract is showing me so much
It's more than just knowledge, it's
truth
know
What did it show you, Agent Barton
My next target
Tell me what you need
'll need a distraction
(grabs his bow) And an eyeball
As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting
mean, if it's not too much trouble
No, no
It's fine
It's a vintage set
It took me a couple of years to collect them all
Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but
We got a hit
Sixty-seven percent match
Weight, cross match, seventy- nine percent
Location
Stuttgart, Germany
28, Konigstrasse
He's not exactly hiding
Captain, you're up
Steve nods
Leaves
Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to the entrance of the gala
Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is interrupted as the   walks up to the mic
, ' Steve walks into his own locker room
As he approaches to the steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated , along with the famous
He stands in silence
Outside the museum,   stand in their positions
One of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping
He then hears a He looks down
One of his guards is shot with an
He raises his gun
He is shot dead by an arrow
Falls down
Barton and his  arrive at the doors of the locked science building
Barton looks at the retinal scanner
He pulls out a  eye scanner instrument
Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the is
As he makes it down and near the stage, he his cane the other end
The guard there notices him, pulls out his gun, but Loki  his head in
Guests begin to leave the museum
Loki grabs the doctor and flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures Loki pulls out an
He down the doctor's eye
The doctor  in pain
Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen
The doors to the facility open
Barton walks in and finds in a cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium
As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes in his gold armor and helmet
The  arrive and with no hesitation, he  the cars,  them over and over
Kneel before me
The crowd ignores him
Another  appears, blocking the crowd
Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their spears, encircling the crowd
said
Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him
Loki embracing his arms out, smiling
Is not this simpler
Is this not your natural state
It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity
You were made to be ruled
In the end, you will always kneel
As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an refuses to kneel and stands, heroic
Not to men like you
There are no men like me
There are always men like you
Look to your elder, people
Let him be an example
Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light blue
Just as the   shoots out, arrives
He dives in just in time and  the blast with his , knocking down Loki on his ass
You know, the last time  was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing
( ) The soldier
man out of time
'm not the one who's out of time
From above Cap, the  arrives
machine gun is pointed towards Loki
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down
Like greased lighting, Loki sends a  of blue at the Natasha  it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki
They both begin to
Loki  Cap to the ground
Cap then throws his shield, but Loki  it way
Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is down by Loki
Standing over him, he points the scepter's tip on his helmet
Kneel
Not today
Cap  and  him out with his leg
Loki grabs him and him over
The guy's all over the place
Suddenly, /'s "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the ' speakers
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me
Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky
Tony flies over in his suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground touches down
He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has
Make your move, Reindeer Games
Loki puts up his hands and surrenders
His armor materializes away
Good move
Mr
Stark
Captain
Natasha watches the skies
Coming out of nowhere
Fury speaks over her headset
(
) Said anything
Not a word
(
) Just get him here
We're low on time
With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering
don't like it
What
Rock of Ages giving up so easily
don't remember it being ever that easy
This guy packs a wallop
Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow
What's your thing
Pilates
What
It's like calisthenics
You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle
Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you
and  nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently
Where's this coming from
Thunder  overhead
Loki stares out the window intently
What's the matter
Scared of a little lightning
'm not overly fond of what follows
What the fuck
hits the jet
Not a light
King
Thor  the ramp and grabs Loki by the throat and flies out
Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck
Tony puts the   helmet on
Now there's that guy
Another Asgardian
Think the guy's a friendly
Doesn't matter
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost
Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor
Stark, we need a plan of attack
have a plan
Attack
jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor
Cap grabs a parachute to follow
'd sit this one out, Cap
don't see how  can
These guys come from legends, they're basically gods
There's only one God, ma'am
And 'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that
Cap   of the jet
Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into the side of the mountain
He raises the mighty hammer,
He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is angry to see him alive in this fashion
Where is the Tesseract
() missed you too
Do  look to be in a gaming mood
Oh, you should thank me
With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here
Your precious Earth
Thor drops , causing the mountain to quake
He picks up Loki
His brother
Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god
thought you dead
Did you mourn
We all did
Our father
Your father
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not
Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them
We were raised together, we played together, we fought together
Do you remember none of that
( ) remember a shadow
Living in the shade of your greatness
remember you tossing me into an abyss
was and should be king
So you take the world  love as recompense for your imagined slights
No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki
() And you're doing a marvelous job with that
The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat mean to rule them
And why should not
You think yourself above them
Well, yes
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother
Throne would suit you ill
Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side
He walks back up to the ledge
Turns around
've seen worlds you've never known about
have grown, Odinson, in my exile
have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when  wield it
Who showed you this power
Who controls the would-be-king
am a king
Not here
You give up the Tesseract
You give up this poisonous dream
You come home
don't have it
You need the cube to bring me home, but 've sent it off know not where
Mjolnir flies back to his grasp
You listen well, brother
-
'm listening
and    into the forest
Thor rolls himself up
is still standing, but keeps his distance
The helmet opens up
Do not touch me again
Then don't take my stuff
You have no idea what you're dealing with
Shakespeare in the park
Doth mother know you weareth her drapes
This is beyond you, metal man
Loki will face Asgardian justice
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours
Until then, stay out of my way
tourist
The   helmet clamps up and he walks away
In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, throws it, and    clear across into a tree
Okay
From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement
Thor raises his hand
Mjolnir flies back to his hand
Thor  the hammer, summoning a ray of energy
stands up and from his  , a  of the   on his ass
flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree
Right back at you, bitch
Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjolnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in  and
Thor points the hammer at   and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity
falls back
Power at 400% capacity
How about that
, pushing Thor to his knees
Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up
The two battle
grasps , elbowing him and him into the side of a mountain
off the mountain and takes   with him
and   crash right back down, smashing down every tree possible
Thor right up
Thor grabs both and begins to  them
Tony quickly  as much energy as he can and   in Thor's face
Thor  back, losing his stance
Thor, with his gold-titanium alloy helmet
Thor
him with his fuckin' head and actually sends   across the forest
boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the arm and cape and  him into another tree
Thor looks up, ready
Thor runs with all his patience out the window and , giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift him and  him down hard
Thor summons back Mjolnir to his hand
Just as he's about to put the hammer down,   uses his   to  across the ground and trip Thor over
Standing up, Thor looks for him, but from behind him,    into his back
Thor stands facing
Ready to pounce
' shield  off both Thor and  , stopping them
They look up and see   standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand
Hey
That's enough
(comes down; looks at Thor) Now,  don't know what you plan on doing here
've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes
Then prove it
Put the hammer down
Um, yeah, no
Bad call
He loves his hammer
Thor, losing all tolerance with this   , raises the hammer
( ) You want me to put the hammer down
,
and brings that hammer down onto the shield and a reacts to the vibranium shield creating a stands up, looking around like `holy shit
' Lying right next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor
Thor looks at both men
Are we done here
,
of   escort Loki, who is in handcuffs, smiling
As they pass the  , Banner stops working on the   and looks up
Loki eyes him as he walks, nodding and smiling
rubs his head
Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a held by
Fury walks up the control panel of the cell
In case it's unclear
You try to escape
You so much as scratch that glass
Fury presses a button which   a  underneath Loki's cell
Loki peers as much as he can from the glass
Without seeing, the sounds of   would make man shit his pants
Not a god, though
Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap
You get how that works
Fury closes the hatch
Points at Loki
Ant
Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap
Boot
() It's an impressive cage
Not built, think, for me
Built for something a lot stronger than you
Oh, 've heard
Loki looks into the camera
The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated
Banner looks at the monitor, intently
The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man
How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you
How desperate am
You threaten my world with war
You steal a force you can't hope to control
() (') You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun
You have made me very desperate
You might not be glad that you did
Ooh
It burns you to come so close
To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power
And for what
warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is
() Well, you let me know if Real Power wants a magazine or something
Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell
Loki looks back at the camera, smirking
Steve watches until the monitor goes black
Thor, who didn't even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart
They all just stand there in stunned
Finally -- He really grows on you, doesn't he
Loki's gonna drag this out
So, Thor, what's his play
( ) He has an army called the Chitauri
They're not of Asgard or any world known
He means to lead them against your people
They will win him the earth
In return,  suspect, for the Tesseract
() An army
From outer space
So he's building another portal
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for
Selvig
He's an astrophysicist
He's a friend
Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours
wanna know why Loki let us take him
He's not leading an army from here
don't think we should be focusing on Loki
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him
Have care how you speak
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother
He killed eighty people in two days
He's adopted
Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for
It's a stabilizing agent
(walks in with Coulson; to ) 'll fly you there
Keep the love alive
Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at
(') ( ) No hard feelings, Point Break
You've got a mean swing
(referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants
( ) Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails
That man is playing
Thought we wouldn't notice
But we did
(covering his eye, looks ) How does Fury do this
He turns
Tony looks around the monitors and places a under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing
Well, that sounds exhausting
The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily
Only major component he still needs is a power source
high energy density, something to kick start the cube
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics
Last night
The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers
Am  the only one who did the reading
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source
He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect
Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet
Finally, someone who speaks English
Is that what just happened
Tony and Banner shake hands
glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows
It's good to meet you, Dr
Banner
You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled
And 'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster
( ) Thanks
( ) Dr
Banner is only here to track the cube
was hoping you might join him
Let's start with that stick of his
It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a  weapon
don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube
And 'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men  know into his personal flying monkeys
Monkeys
do not understand
do
understood that reference
Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself
Shall we play, doctor
Let's play some
As Banner and Tony walk out, the   turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing
'  -  () Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on the scepter for radiation
Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many algorithms and equations
The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract
But it's gonna take weeks to process
If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops
All  packed was a tooth brush
() You know, you should come by sometime
Top ten floors, all &
You'd love it, it's candy land
Thanks, but the last time  was in New York  kind of broke
Harlem
Well,  promise a stress free environment
No tension
No surprises
Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a
Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony
Tony looks at Banner closely
Nothing
( ) Hey
Are you nuts
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you
What's your secret
Mellow jazz
Bongo drums
Huge bag of weed
Is everything a joke to you
Funny things are
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny
No offense, doctor
No, it's alright
wouldn't have come aboard if  couldn't handle pointy things
You're tiptoeing, big man
You need to strut
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr
Stark
You think 'm not
Why did Fury call us and why now
Why not before
What isn't he telling us
can't do the equation unless  have all the variables
You think Fury's hiding something
He's a spy
Captain, he's the spy
His secrets have secrets
(points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it
(bobbling the words) Uh
just wanna finish my work here and
Doctor
beat
' warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube
heard it
(pointing at Tony) Well,  think that was meant for you
Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news
The Stark Tower
That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) building in New York
It's powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source
That building will run itself for what, a year
That's just the prototype
'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now
(referring to Tony) So, why didn't  bring him in on the Tesseract project
mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place
should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of 's secure files
(taken by that) 'm sorry, did you say
Jarvis has been running it since  hit the bridge
In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret  has ever tried to hide
(holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence
Historically, not possible
think Loki's trying to wind us up
This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed
We have orders, we should follow them
Following is not really my style
() And you're all about style, aren't you
(a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is;
wearing a spangly outfit, and
not of use
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you
Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off
Just find the cube
Steve walks out of the lab
Still torn apart by the possibility, he walks away, towards the  of the ship
That's the guy my dad never shut up about
Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice
The guy's not wrong about Loki
He does have the jump on us
What he's got is an  dynamite kit
(') It's gonna blow up in his face, and 'm gonna be there when it does
And 'll read all about it
Uh-huh
Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us
Ah, see
don't get a suit of armor
'm exposed, like a nerve
It's a nightmare
You know, 've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart
(points at the - in his chest) This stops it
This little circle of light
It's part of me now, not just armor
It's a
terrible privilege
But you can control it
Because  learned how
It's different
Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face
Hey, 've read all about your accident
That much gamma exposure should have killed you
So you're saying that the Hulk
the other guy
saved my life
() (') That's nice
It's a nice sentiment
Saved it for what
( ) guess we'll find out
Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers
You might not like that
You just might
,   10- Steve, with all his , slides the   door and walks in
10- is a large warehouse, filled with   stacked
Steve looks up, seeing another level
He  up high and holds onto the catwalk railing
Steve continues to move forward
Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other  are driving inside a long tunnel
With the  device inside, Selvig carefully picks up the small cylinder shape  with metal prongs and lightly places it a  within the Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling
On a  monitor is a photo and record of
Thor looks at her, remembering
With him is Agent Coulson
As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster
We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote
She'll be safe
Thank you
It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig
dread what he plans for him once he's done
Erik is a good man
He talks about you a lot
You changed his life
You changed everything around here
They were better as they were
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we
we come here battling like
Like what
You know; huge, scaly, big antlers
You don't have those
Don't think so
They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path
Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come
When  first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price
And now again
In my youth courted war
(
) War hasn't started yet
( ) You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is
do not know
Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me
There's no pain that would prize his need from him
lot of guys think that, until the pain stops
What are you asking me to do
'm asking
What are you prepared to do
Loki is a prisoner
Then why do  feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here
Thor doesn't answer
Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell
Suddenly, he stops
There's not many people that can sneak up on me
(turns to see ) But you figured 'd come
After
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm
And  would cooperate
wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton
'd say 've expanded his mind
And once you've won
Once you're king of the mountain
What happens to his mind
Is this love, Agent Romanoff
Love is for children
owe him a debt
( ) Tell me
(she pulls up a chair as ) Before  worked for , uh
well,  made a name for myself have a very specific skillset
didn't care who  used it for, or on
got on 's radar in a bad way
Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call
And what will you do if  vow to spare him
Not let you out
() Ah, no
But  like this
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man
Regimes fall every day
tend not to weep over that, 'm Russian
or was
What is it you want
It's really not that complicated
've got red in my ledger, 'd like to wipe it out
Can you
Can you wipe out that much red
' daughter Barton told me everything
Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything
(; ) This is the basest sentimentality
This is a child at prayer
- Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors
(
) You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers
- Agent Hill checks every  in the bridge
Fury oversees
(
) You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors
But they are a part of you, and they will never go away
- Steve opens a  crate
Angry, he looks behind him and looks back into the crate Loki  his cell, making Natasha
won't touch Barton
Not until  make him kill you
Slowly
Intimately
In every way he knows you fear
And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, 'll split his skull
This is my bargain, you mewling quim
turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted
(; ) You're a monster
() No, you brought the monster
(turns back around; poised) So, Banner
that's your play
() What
( ) Loki means to unleash the Hulk
Keep Banner in the lab, 'm on my way
Send Thor as well
( ) Thank you for your cooperation
Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen
' Fury walks in  to see Tony and Banner stop working on the scepter
() What are you doing, Mr
Stark
Uh
kind of been wondering the same thing about you
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract
We are
The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now
When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile
And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss
(suddenly his monitor show a collection of  ) What is  2
Suddenly, Steve drops a    on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around
Cap looks pissed
2 is  uses the cube to make weapons
( ) Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow
(trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract
This does not mean that we're
'm sorry, Nick
Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of What were you lying
was wrong, director
The world hasn't changed a bit
At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab
Natasha keeps her eyes right on Banner
Banner looks at her,
Did you know about this
You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor
was in Calcutta,  was pretty well removed
Loki's manipulating you
And you've been doing what exactly
You didn't come here because  bat my eyelashes at you
Yes, and 'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy
'd like to know why  is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction
Because of him
(pointing at Thor) () Me
Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town
We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned
My people want nothing but peace with your planet
But you're not the only people out there, are you
And, you're not the only threat
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled
Like you controlled the cube
You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies
It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war
higher form
You forced our hand
We had to come up with something
Nuclear deterrent
`Cause that always calms everything right down
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark
'm sure if he still made Wait
Wait
Hold on
How is weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me
deep
'm sorry, isn't everything
thought humans were more evolved than this
Excuse me, did  come to  planet and blow stuff up
Did you always give your champions such mistrust
Are you all really that Captain America is on naive
monitors potential threat potential threats
watch list
(to Steve)  swear to God, Stark, one You're on that list
Are you more crack
above or below angry bees
Threatening
feel threatened
As the "team" argues, they don't realize the   on Loki's scepter is glowing brightly
Outside the , a lone carrier slowly hovers over the ship
661 Bravo, please relay your pass code
What is your hull, over
Arms to ammunition, over
Inside,  and his crew suit up and arm themselves
Barton pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows
' Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan
You speak of control, yet you court chaos
It's his
, isn't it
mean, what are we, a team
No, no, no
We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos
We're
we're a time-bomb
You need to step away
(puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam
(pushes Tony off) You know damn well why
Back off
(comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, 'm starting to want you to make me
Big man in a suit of armor
Take that off, what are you
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist
know guys with none of that worth ten of you
Yeah, 've seen the footage
() (') The only thing you really fight for is yourself
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you
think  would just cut the wire
() Always a way out
You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero
(that did it) hero
Like you
You're a lab rat, Rogers
Everything special about you came out of a bottle
The ramp of the carrier opens
The carrier maneuvers next to one of the large turbine engines
Barton stands at the base, holding out his bow
He pulls out a
He points right at the engine
Then
Barton moves his  and points the arrow about a hundred feet from the engine
He releases
The arrow flies out,but then heads for the engine
The arrow is punctured onto the engine
It has a visible timer which is
' Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just stands there, unmoving
Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds
Thor laughs at them
You people are so petty
and tiny
Tony rubs his head
Moves away from Cap
Yeah, this is a tee
Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr
Banner back to his
Where
You rented my room
The cell was just in case
In case you needed to kill me, but you can't
know
tried
( ) got low
didn't see an end, so put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out
So  moved on focused on helping other people
was good, until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk
Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets unnerved
You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff
You wanna know how  stay calm
and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns
Doctor Banner
put down the scepter
'  ' The computer beeps
They all turn to it
Got it
Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer
Sorry, kids
You don't get to see my little party trick after all
Located the Tesseract
can get there faster
Look, all of us
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it
Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him
You're not going alone
You gonna stop me
Put on the suit, let's find out
'm not afraid to hit an old man
Put on the suit
At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices something about the Tesseract
Oh, my God
Barton
The arrow then ' Everyone is thrown in every direction
Steve, Fury, Thor and Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the lower equipment room
Steve looks up at Tony
Put on the suit
Yep
Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab
Fury sits up, clutching his ribs
He puts on his
Hill
Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning scramble for their positions and armaments
Agent Hill keeps the bridge as calm as possible
Turn up that engine
Number 3 engine is down
Can we get a run in
(runs over to  ) Talk to me
(points to monitor) Turbine's loose
Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air
We lose one more engine, we won't be
Somebody's got to get inside and patch that engine
' Stark
You copy that
(
) 'm on it
Coulson
Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory
Move out
Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge
, Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having landed hard
He is gripping the grated floor to maintain control, but his eyes are green, his face intense
(') (quietly, to herself) 'm okay
We're okay, right
Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship
They rappel down into a corridor
Get that engine down
Detention
Get him through the dark
Come with me
Two of his men follow him
They head towards the bridge
, Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall
Find engine three
'll meet you there
Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room
Inside, Tony's suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory
, '  in the dim light as he struggles to suppress the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly
Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner
Doctor
Bruce, you gotta fight it
This is just what Loki wants
We're gonna be okay
Listen to me
Two approaching  soldiers arrive to check on her
She furiously  them away
They bolt out of there
We're gonna be okay
Right
swear on my life  will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never
Your life
His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat
Another explosion rocks the carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the lights go out
() Bruce
Banner suddenly starts transforming into the  and gives Natasha one last knowing look
Natasha   of the rubble
She stops
The , sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a disturb monster
Natasha  up the stairs with the chasing after her
Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should
She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of pipes
The  pulls them out from above the catwalk
Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and stealthily escapes
The  lets out a    unlike anything
Not human
Loki looks up, smiling mischievously
Fury  in and sees the chaos has increased even more than before
The  is in complete disarray
Bring the carrier inwards and head south
Take us to the water
Why water
Navigations recalibrated after the engine failure
Is the sun coming up
Yes, sir
Then put it on the left
Get us over water
One more turbine goes down and we drop
, pushing with all his strength the door to portside, sees  tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do anything
Engine 3 is totally dead
of the port side in Stark, 'm here
Good
See what we got
Tony flies in his   suit and gets close to the damaged engine
Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and its layouts
gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before  can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris
begins  on the stuck rotors
Looks over atSteve
need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position
flies into giant cooling conductors over to the other side of the broken railing gets himself to the control panel and opens it up
For a man who grew up as a , what the fuck is this
What's it look like in there
It seems to run on some form of electricity
Well, you're not wrong
, Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk
She stops
Then
The room vibrates
Rhythmically
Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk and spins
and then a
Natasha  a shot into a liquid nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face
The Natasha begins to run through the maze of corridors
The sound the monster is coming
Finally, she reaches and a long corridor
As she runs, behind her, the   up the hallway, coming at her
Natasha turns to see, but the   her into the wall, The  marks his territory
Natasha looks up
fear she has never felt begins to seep out
The  raises his hand and the next room
Both Thor and  roll across the floor
Every person runs the hell out
Thor looks up at this magnificent beast
The stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move
The  makes his move
Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks off his feet
keeps swinging and missing, pissing him off
Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and wraps around it
We are not your enemies, Banner
Try to think
lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he '
continuously  broken debris off the turbine engine
It's bad, but still fixable
(
) The relays are intact
What's our next move
Even if  clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump
'm gonna have to get in there and push
Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded
Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag
Speak English
See that red lever
It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out
Stand by it, wait for my word
looks over at the other side where he was
He sees the red lever and  towards it
Thor  into another stack of crates
As he raises his head, he feels something on his lips
As he swipes it off, the  of the  is not too far
Thor extends his hand out
The  gets  and
Thor focuses
His hand strains toward mid-air
His eyes tight in concentration
The  runs right at him
At the last second,  flies into his hand and Thor  ,
stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just happened
' He  it off and  rips off the  of the jet, Thor  and  under the tail
Jumping up, he throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the  head over heels
falls down, hammer in hand
tries to lift it, but can't
Mjolnir rests atop his hand
Struggle as he may,  wraps his hand around the hammer
The hammer doesn't move
To no avail -- he strains with all his might,  from the effort,
Thor jumps up again,   in the face
Thor grabs his hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his Hulk tries to pull him off
Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors
We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay
Agent Hill nods
She leaves to exit out, but a appears
The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps
Fury  a shot at the open entrance
He moves over behind the side of the entrance
handful of Barton's men enter
Watchful, ready, waiting
Fury steps out, his  drawn
and -- ensues, but Fury is unable to stop one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill, who looks hot and sexy holding her gun
Agent Coulson walks up the armory door
He places his head into a
Walks into the room
(
) We got perimeter breach
Hostiles are in  gear
Hold on to every junction
from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass grabs him by the neck

He then on it, relieving the rotors
On the other side, ' men enter the port side looks down, pondering if they are help
Evidently not as they begin  at him and throwing grenades
jumps to the other railing and down with Barton's men
He begins to   , even goes as far as throwing one off
few more enter,
grabs a    (big word for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing down at them
The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming
They are not getting through here, so what the hell
Suddenly, Barton  an arrow down to the bridge and critical spots
Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a Fury  at Barton, but is already gone
The arrow then self- activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every single monitor and main frame
The hacking causes Engine 1 to shut off
Suddenly, the  begins to to one side
(
) Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1
It's Barton
He took out our systems
He's headed for the detention level
Does anybody copy
, - Still shaken by the  ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking back and forth, after crying for a while
Summoning back all her coolness, she touches her
This is Agent Romanoff
copy
Natasha  up and runs for Barton
begins to push the rotor using  from his boots
(
) Stark, we're losing altitude
Yeah
Noticed
The rotors start propelling faster and faster as  ' get more and more bright
On the other side,   continuously shoots at Barton's men
Blinking at the wrong moment, loses the upper hand and  off the railing, but grabs onto a
Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki, escaping
Thor  at his brother
Loki walks up to him and down to attack
The false Loki dissipates into nothingness
comes out from behind the cell door, which closes on , locking him up
Loki smiles
Are you ever not going to fall for that
, Barton walks alone down the catwalk
In a lightning fast move, Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at
hand-to-hand fight ensues
Natasha  her way around Barton, making Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a  on her
Thor, in a fit of anger,   onto the glass cell
To his surprise, the cell door only , but violently the ship
Loki stands there in caution, as does his (smiles; walks over to the ) The humans think us immortal
Should we test that
Suddenly,   falls down like a tree stands there, holding  2
Move away, please
Loki moves away from the switch
You like this
We started working on the prototype after you sent Even  don't know what it does
Do you wanna find out
Nooo
Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall
Agent Coulson slumps down, breathing fast
Loki makes his way to the control switch
He gives his brother one last look
Thor looks at him, hopeful
Loki opens the
Thor still hopes , Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other
Natasha Barton's face
Feeling that, Barton takes a  at her, but she grabs his arm,  it
Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to at Natasha
She dodges every move, but finds herself in a with him
As he forces the knife down, she  his wrist
Barton lets go of the knife
Natasha  her legs around his neck,  him over and arm him
She  his head into a pipes rail
Barton goes down, hard
He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses
Natasha
Natasha  him
Barton is out
Thor, trapped in the glass cage,  off the  cell pod
As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass, but misses
Land draws closer
In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto the glass door and  just as the cage is about to hit the ground
The cell  into the shore as Thor crashes out into the meadow
Loki has no remorse as he looks down
He closes the hatch and proceeds to leave
You're gonna lose
() Am
It's in your nature
Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky
where is my disadvantage
You lack conviction
don't think
2  , So that's what it does
Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his  that the hatch has been open
Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to
continuously  Engine 3, giving it all he has The itself
Cap,  need the lever
(
) need a minute here
Lever
Now
Tony lets go of the rotors
They spin by themselves
Tony is then caught in one
He is now fucked
slips into the rotors, getting chewed up
up the loose cable and reaches the railing
'  opens fire once more
pulls himself up and finally  the lever
opens up from Engine 3
falls out, but the suit heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up
heads for Cap
'  turns his  to  , who  him into the wall
rolls over, tired
Cap lets out a sigh of relief
The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking Loki and his scepter
The carrier flies into the distance
Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely
Sorry, boss
They got rabbited
Just stay awake
No
'm clocked out here
Not an option
It's okay, boss
This was never going to work
if they didn't have something
to
Agent Coulson looks away
Sighs his last breath
Nick Fury looks on grimly at Coulson
The medical team arrives
(
) Agent Coulson is down
Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up
(
) Paramedics are on their way
(
) They're here
Steve and Tony listen in as well
(
) They called it
Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone there has a look as if in a daze
look of numb shock is shown on their devastated faces
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket
Guess he never did get you to sign them
Fury throws Coulson's     on the table towards Steve
Steve picks them up,
We're dead in the air up here
Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor
got nothing for you
Lost my one good eye
Maybe  had that coming
( ) Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract
never put all my chips on that number though, because was playing something even riskier
There was an idea, Stark knows this, called
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more
See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes
Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore
Well, it's an old fashioned notion
Thor walks out far into the meadow
He looks down
Banner wakes up, in human form
He looks around and sees he is and looks up at the stands there, amazed
You fell out of the sky
( ) Did  hurt anybody
There's nobody around here to get hurt
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though
Lucky
Or just good aim
You were awake when you fell
You saw
The whole thing, right through the ceiling
Big and green and buck ass nude
Here
He throws Banner a pair of big pants
Banner pulls on his pants
didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella
Thank you
beat
Are you an alien
What
From outer space, an alien
No
Well then, son, you've got a condition
Barton is strapped down
Natasha watches over him as Barton tries to shake off Loki's mind control
Clint, you're gonna be alright
You know that
Is that what you know got
gotta go in though
gotta flush him out
We don't have that long, it's gonna take time
don't understand
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play
Pull you out and send something else in
Do you know what it's like to be unmade
You know that  do
Why am  back
How did you get him out
Cognitive recalibration
hit you really hard in the head
Thanks
(Natasha unfastens the ) Tasha, how many agents
Don't
Don't do that to yourself, Clint
This is Loki
This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for
Loki, he got away
Yeah
don't suppose you know where
didn't need to know
didn't ask
He's gonna make his play soon though
Today
We gotta stop him
Yeah
Who's we
don't know
Whoever's left
Well, if  put an arrow in Loki's eyesocket, 'd sleep better  suppose
Now you sound like you
Natasha sits next to her partner and friend
But you don't
You're a spy, not a soldier
Now you want to wade into a war
Why
What did Loki do to you
He didn't,  just
( ) Natasha
've been compromised
got red in my ledger
'd like to wipe it out
Tony look at the empty cell container
He stands not saying a word
Steve walks in
Was he married
No
There was a uh
cellist,  think
'm sorry
He seemed like a good man
He was an idiot
Why
For believing
For taking on Loki alone
He was doing his job
He was out of his league
He should have waited
He should have
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony
( ) Right
How did that work for him
Is this the first time you've lost a soldier
(turns around sharply) am not marching to Fury's fife
Neither am
He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does
Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done
Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list
(looking at the blood stained ) He made it personal
That's not the point
That is the point
That's Loki's point
He hit us all right where we live
Why
To tear us apart
He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right
That's what he wants
He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it
He wants an audience
Right,  caught his act at Stuttengard
Yeah
That's just a preview, this is opening night
Loki's a full-tilt diva
He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered
() Sonofabitch
Selvig works around the  device that has already been set- upon the rooftop of Tony's tower
Steve walks in full uniform
Natasha looks at him, unprepared
Time to go
Go where
'll tell you on the way
Can you fly one of those jets
Barton walks out of the restroom
Looks at Cap
can
Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's on their side
You got a suit
Yeah
Then suit up

blinding    strikes down from above, colliding on
The explosion is massive -   pulls on his  and

Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating
Agent Hill walks up to him, knowing
Sir
Agent Hill
Those cards, they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket
They needed the push

They found it
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do want eyes on everything
Yes, sir

We're on the clock

looks up at him, smiling
They proceed to walk into the penthouse
Loki walks in, holding the scepter
Tony casually walks down the steps, towards the bar
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity
Uh
actually, 'm planning to threaten you
You should have left your armor on for that
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage
You've got the blue stick of destiny
Would you like a drink
Stalling me won't change anything
No, no, no
Threatening
No drink
You sure
'm having one
The  are coming, nothing will change that
What have  to fear
(Loki looks at him, confused) It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team
`'  ' type of thing
Yes, 've met them
() Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, 'll give you that one
(') But, let's do a head count here
Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them
That was the plan
Not a great plan
When they come, and they will, they'll come for you
From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on , a honing device
have an army
We have a
thought the beast had wandered off
You're missing the point
There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you
Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it
(slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you
Loki  Tony on the chest with his scepter
Nothing
Confused, Loki tires again
It should work
Well, performance issues
You know
In anger, Loki  Tony by the throat and  him across the room

We gotta deal with these guys
How do we do this
As a team
have unfinished business with Loki
Yeah, get in line
Save it
Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need
Without him these things could run wild
We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us
Just then,
Getting off, he looks around the city
So, this all seems horrible

Sorry
No
We could use a little worse

Selvig, slumped down, weakened, looks at her desperately
The Tesseract's energy is firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the sky
Doctor
Loki's scepter, the energy

You can't protect against yourself
It's not your fault

The missile speeds on
grabs it from behind, gripping it tightly
With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course
Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight up into sky, towards the portal

) Stark, you know that's a one-way trip
( ) Save the rest for return,
Sir
Shall  call Miss Potts
You might as well
, along with her crew, watches on
, in horror, the destruction in
On the table, her cell is , with Tony's picture on it
Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as they too watch   fly up into the portal
climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed, suddenly flings himself through the portal
Communications die
The suit begins to freeze
Tony looks in horror
Every single agent
Fury smiles
He tries to communicate with Tony
We then see Tony's horror
The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster
Most of them hang still in the air
Some move swimmingly about
lets go of the missile
It whistles off into the blackness as    falls back down the portal's opening
The missile reaches the
The   , causing the entire  to burst into a supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display
Suddenly, all of the   and and begin to , then stop
They all fall over look up at their , not sure if he'll make it through
Still holding the scepter in hand,   shifts around, waiting
Come on, Stark

And falling
He's not slowing down
Thor swings Mjolnir around
Just as Thor flies up, , throws   off him
Thor and Cap run over to him
Thor off Tony's helmet
He appears to be dead
They stand around not sure
Then What the hell
What just happened
Please tell me nobody kissed me
( ) We won
Alright
Hey
Alright
Good job, guys
Let's just not come in tomorrow
Let's just take a day
Have you ever tried shawarma
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here
don't know what it is, but  wanna try it
(looking up at Stark Tower) We're not finished yet
beat
And then shawarma after
Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag doll
He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him
He turns       ,
If it's all the same to you
'll have that drink
In  news montage about  , we see various reports of what happened
Some people agree that the avengers did good, protecting the city
Others believe it was their cause
( ) Superheroes
In New York
Give me a break
These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city
This was their fight
Where are they now
What
That this was somehow their fault
Captain America saved my life
Wherever he is, wherever any of them are,  just wanna say thank you
The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled, to a blocked area
Thor shakes hands with his team and gives Selvig a hug
Tony opens the Tesseract's case
Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by Thor
Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it
The Asgardians leap into the energy beam
Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into different directions
Banner climbs in with Tony in his sportscar
Steve rides away in his Harley
Natasha and Clint climb back into  cars
They all part
For now
Fury is facing once more members of the
#3 Where are the Avengers
'm not currently tracking their whereabouts
'd say they've earned a leave of absence
#2 And the Tesseract
The Tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach
#1 That's not your call
didn't make it
just didn't argue with the god that did
#1 So you let him take it and the war criminal, Loki, who should be answering for his crimes
Oh,  think he will be
#1 don't think you understand what you've started
Letting the Avengers loose on this world
They're dangerous
They surely are
And the whole world knows it
Every world knows it
#1 Was that the point of all this statement
promise
Fury walks out, towards the bridge
Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out into the world
Sir, how does it work now
They've gone their separate ways, some pretty extremely far
We get into a situation like this again, what happens then
They'll come back
You really sure about that
am
Why
Because we'll need them to
Agent Hill turns around
Fury looks out, smiling
