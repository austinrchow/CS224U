href <b>// --> </b> Screenplay by David Koepp based on the novel by Michael Crichton - 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a tropical lagoon
The beach is a stunning crescent of white sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted
87 miles southeast of Nublar Two  , dressed in white uniforms, have set up a picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal decanters with red and white wine
, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side, reading
, painfully thin, with the perpetually surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than once, supervises the settings of the table
She looks up and sees a little girl, , seven or eight years old, wandering off down the beach
Cathy
Don't wander off
Cathy keeps wandering
(cont'd) Cathy, come back
You can look for shells right here
Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear
(eyes still in his book) Leave her alone
What about snakes
There's no snakes on a beach
Let her have fun, for once
, Cathy keeps wandering away,  to herself as her parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance
Please be quiet, please be quiet please be quiet
Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view behind her
sound draws her attention, and she turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the sand
large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches swaying and shaking
Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush, which abruptly stops moving
small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes along its back, steps out from the bush
Only about a foot tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail
It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken
Well, hello there
The animal (a ) just stares at her
Cathy squats down on her haunches
(cont'd) What are you
little bird or something
She opens her hand
She's got a handful of goldfish crackers
(cont'd) Are you hungry
You want a goldfish
The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously
(cont'd) Come on
won't hurt you
The compy draws closer
Cathy holds the cracker in the palm of her hand
The compy gets closer still -- -- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm
Her arm dips a bit under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up easily
It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats it
Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her hand, calling back over her shoulder
(cont'd) Mom
Dad
You gotta come see this
found something
She turns back
Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand
They're standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few feet away
Cathy's smile fades
She turns her head slowly to the right have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing and  as they surround her
(cont'd) (terrified) What do you guys want
, the table is set
Mrs
Bowman calls out
Cathy, sweetheart
Lunch is ready
From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill  suddenly pierce the air
She takes off, running down the beach, Mr
Bowman leaps out of his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them
, Mrs
Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend in the beach
We don't see what she sees, but we hear the frenzied  of the strange compys
Mr
Bowman and the Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs
Bowman lets loose a horrified, slack-jawed , her mouth a perfect oval
: - Mrs
Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the face of a bored  , sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a monied corporation
All are in expensive suits, most are over sixty
There are rows of  too, whispering in their lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their ears
Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table hint that everyone's been here a long time
familiar  resounds through the boardroom as we move down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members
(
) The hurricane seemed like a disaster at the time, but now  think it was a blessing, nature's way of freeing those animals from their human confines
Of giving them another chance to survive, but this time as they were meant to, without man's interference
The source of the voice is  , the founder of InGen and creator of Jurassic Park
But he's not in the room
His image is on a closed circuit  screen, which has been wheeled up to the end of the table
And he doesn't look good
He's terribly infirmed, propped up in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment around him
(cont'd) There are some corporate issues that are not about the bottom line
We have so much still to learn about those creatures
whole world of intricate, interlocking behaviors, vanished everywhere -- except for Site
Please
Let's not do what is good for more men at the expense at what is best for all mankind
The , seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television
Thank you, John
Mr
Ludlow
He turns to  , late thirties, a man with the anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk
Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white eight by tens, and tosses them on the table
(an accent similar to Hammond's) These pictures were taken in a hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight hours ago, after an American family on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site The little girl will be fine, but her parents are wealthy, angry, and very fond of lawsuits
But that's hardly new to us, is it
(takes a paper from the file) Wrongful death settlements, partial list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36
5 million dollars; family of Robert Muldoon, 12
6 million
Damaged or destroyed equipment, 17
3 million
Demolition, de-construction, and disposal of Isla Nublar facilities, organic and inorganic, one hundred and twenty-six million dollars
The list goes on, gentlemen -- research funding, media payoffs
Silence is expensive
He's warming up
Not a bad performer
(cont'd) This corporation has been bleeding from the throat for four years
You, our board of directors, have set patiently and listened to ecology lectures while Mr
Hammond signed your checks and spent your money
You have watched your stock drop from seventy-eight and a quarter to nineteen flat with no good and in sight
And all along, we have held a significant product asset that we could have safely harvested and displayed for profit
Enormous profit
He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove, sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of them
It's a mini-mall version of a zoo
Cages hold tiny replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops and Tourists look on in wonder
(cont'd) Enough money to wipe out four years of lawsuits and damage control and unpleasant infighting, enough to not only send our stock back to where it was but to double it
And the one thing, the only thing standing between us and this asset is a born-again naturalist who happens to be our own
Well,  don't work for Mother Nature
work for you
Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack
Ludlow takes one and reads from it
(cont'd) "Whereas the Chief Executive Officer has engaged in wasteful and negligent business practices to further his own personal environmental beliefs -- Whereas these practices have affected the financial performance of the company by incurring significant losses -- Whereas the shareholders have been materially harmed by these losses -- Thereby, be it resolved that John Parker Hammond should be resolved from the office of Chief Executive Officer, affective immediately
"  Mr
Chairman,  move the resolution be put to an immediate vote
Do  have a second
second the motion,  Mr
Chairman, Please poll the members by a show of hands
The  signs heavily, feeling like a traitor
He can't bear to look at Hammond on the  monitor
All those in favor of InGen Corporate Resolution 213C, please signify your approval by raising your right hand
It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes up
Ludlow sits back, victorious
Hammond, furious, raises his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at the  screen
It goes blank
: '  - Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle of a welder's yard
Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere
Somewhere inside the shed, a phone
The  of the arc welder shuts off
, a big barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette dangling from his lips
Yeah
He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end
He smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke
: - Smoke turns into steam as a subway  into a station underneath Manhattan
The door  open, spit out some and suck up a few more
tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving as fast as he can
The subway doors begin to close, but just before they meet -- -- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them
The man is  , fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe
There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he doesn't care
- finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down
He looks awful
Tired
Weathered
He notices a across from his is staring at his
Malcolm looks away
The Curious Man still stares
Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and approaches
(under his breath) Shit
The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning
You're him, aren't you
Excuse me
The guy
The scientist
saw you on
(conspiratorially) believed you
No response from Malcolm
The guy leans in even closer
(cont'd) Roooooarr
(a withering look) was misquoted
was merely speculating on the evolutionary scenario of a Lost World
never said  was in any such place
He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the Curious Man
As he sits down, he notices two other across from him are staring at him
He looks at them
They looks away
He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him
Nowhere to hide
'  - has a question: Whom shall  tell Mr
Hammond is calling
stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park Avenue apartment
Ian Malcolm door opens and a little dog comes  out of the back
It bounds straight at Malcolm, , jaws
It lunges -- -- and Malcolm  it away with one swift swing of his cane
The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away,
The Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly
Not an animal lover
Not really
'  - enters a darkened bedroom
lies in the bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room; Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle
Ian
Don't linger in the doorway like an ingenue, come in, come in
Malcolm steps further into the room
(cont'd) It's good to see you
It really is
How's the leg
Resentful
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember
It's the people who challenged you
It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning never told you how sorry  was about what happened after we returned
Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it hard to sustain anger
didn't know you -- weren't well
It's the lawyers
The lawyers are finally killing me
They do have motives
Why did you want to see me
Your message said it was urgent
You were right -- and  was wrong
There
Did you ever think you'd hear me say that
Spectacularly wrong
Instead of observing those animals, tried to control them
squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives
Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild
Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist
could have had it, but  let it slip away
(pause) Thank God for Site
Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment
What
(a spark in his eye) Well
Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you
What are you talking about
The hatchery, in particular
You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth
Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory showed you
don't believe you
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site was the factory floor
We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar
No, no, no, no, no, no
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site
We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves
And they did
For four years 've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now  want you to go there and document them
Are you out of your mind
still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think need more of that
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen
So what
Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near to him and open it on his lap
Inside, there are memos, charts, maps and photographs
've been putting this together for over a year
() have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people
They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them
Just use my checkbook to get them there
'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately
If we hesitate, all will be lost
John
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials
believe you already know Sarah Harding
She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this
If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup
When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously
Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly
Your documentation, you should use forensic photographic methods, Hasselbladt still cameras, high definition video
When the trick photography analysts take your evidence apart, make it impossible for them to say there was enhancement or computer graphic imaging
Oh, this is very important -- avoid the island interior at all costs
Stick to the outer rim
Everything you need to know can be found there
Vindication lies on the outer rim
Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond
'm not going, John
(fatigue returning) Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world
can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it
will not  be known only for my failures
And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic
You're too smart
You'e too proud
Dr
Malcolm
Please
This is a chance at redemption
For both of us
There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before -- He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder
Malcom turns
, still in his overcoat, is standing in the doorway to the bedroom
He looks back and forth from Hammond to Malcolm suspiciously
Hello, Uncle John
Dr
Malcolm
Malcolm doesn't answer
He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes him
(cont'd) Did  interrupt something
Malcolm turns back to Hammond
Find someone else
: ' / - In the foyer,  hands  his coat, just a trifle rudely, and shepherds him to the door
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you
Do me a favor
Don't pretend for a second that you and  don't know the truth
You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but  was there
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw
You violated that agreement
You cost me my livelihood
That on which  relied to support my children
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy,  hardly see how  am to-- didn't tell anything,  told the truth
You version of it
There are no versions of the truth
This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries
It was a payoff and an insult
InGen never-- InGen is my livelihood, Dr
Malcolm, and  will jealously defend its interests
People will know what want them to know when  want them to know it
Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard
It sails across the foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with one hand
It's his cane
(cont'd) Don't forget that
Malcolm stares at him for a long moment
Finally, he turns and walks away
But he does not out of the apartment
Instead, he walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with a determined
'  - looks up, hopeful, as  comes back into the room and walks over to his bed
He reaches down -- -- and picks up the file folder
Do you have a satellite phone
: - , late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an African cafe/bar in Mombassa
It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals, but there are a few obnoxious  too, Americans on safari who somehow found the local handout
They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book, eyeglasses hanging low on his nose
Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow
He looks up
He  the air once, then smiles and calls out a person's name
Ajay
He turns around
(-jay) , a wiry East Indian in his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to sneak up
(delighted) How did you know
(taps his nose) That cheap aftershave  send you every Christmas, you actually wear it
'm touched
Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa
You
Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone
Last time  plugged it in,  suppose
Why
Behind them, the group of , all men, laughs loudly
One of them, the   , berates the

If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition
And very well-funded
Well, 'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch
You go
The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress
His buddies
Roland throws a glance, annoyed
But alone
We always had great success together, you and
Just a little bit too much, think
How do you mean
true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins
If it escapes
But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay
've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death
Maybe  just feel too close to it my-- The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass
Roland is out of his chair in a second
(cont'd) (to Ajay) Excuse me
Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind him
He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist
(cont'd) You, sir -- are no gentleman
Is that supposed to be an insult
can think of none greater
The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs
Buzz off, you silly old bastard
What do  have to do to pick a fight with you, bring your mother into it
Are you kidding
could take you with one arm tied down
Really
, the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the back of his pants with a napkin
He pulls the knot tight and the man turns around
It's Roland, with his arm tied down
The Tourist stands across from him
mean my arm
Roland punches him square in the jaw
The Tourist reels, stunned
Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with both arms
Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist to turn around, and  him thrice in the face
The Tourist spins and goes down to the floor, face first
cloud of sawdust and a loud  from the locals rise up in the bar
, Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with Ajay
In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly carry their fallen cohort out of the bar
Sorry
We were saying
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom
Tell the truth, Roland
Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry
Ajay
Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me
Ajay just smiles
: - The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green, seen through night-vision goggles
An   comes from the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it
The world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of long grass
The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move stealthily through it
One animal head pops up above the grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between its eyes
pulls the goggles away from her face
Hyenas
Ace Face is the striped snout
Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the outdoors
She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead of the hyenas to their prey
It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet
Sarah turns to , her African assistant
(cont'd) They'll try to take down a calf
Come on
Closer
Sarah scurries up and over a rock face
Makena follows
Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running through it, trying to break it up
(cont'd) You know, we could see everything from up on the edge of that cliff
No way
But the view would -- No cliffs
(into a pocket recorder) F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking, twenty yards
F3 center
F6 circling wide east
Can't see F7
While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action
Makena follows, with growing unease
Sarah
F8 circling north
F1 straight through, disrupting
Herd moving, stamping
There's F7
Straight through
F8 angling through from the north
She's practically on top of the animals now
Dr
Harding
Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah, wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer
Suddenly there is a tremendous  and the grass right in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf
They yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody
The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come forward, squealing to get at the kill
Sarah's eyes shine with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the tape recorder
Brooding behavior in evidence at the kill site, pups are ushered forward and adults help them eat, pulling flesh away from the carcass and-- telephone rings
Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she thought she heard
It rings again, the unmistakable of a cellular phone
Sarah and Makena both move at once, pawing at a backpack
(cont'd) (a frantic whisper) thought you turned it off
Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone
Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation
(cont'd) Yes
Someone speaks on the other end
Sarah rolls her eyes
(cont'd) Ian
This better be important
Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as the voice on the other end talks
And talks
(cont'd) When
: - Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the end of a bench
Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while talking on a satellite phone
We leave in twenty-four hours
Five member team
Behind them, the  of a acetylene torch fly as make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green Mercedes Benz  (all-activity vehicle)
The hood of the is up and the -6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller engine is lowered in its place
To one side are two long trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other
Eddie Carr's handling all our equipment and he'll be there to maintain it
He's designing special field trailers now, top of the line mobile research units

Sorry, Eddie
Specs say it can't deform at 12,000 , we had to test it Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular, constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars
Malcolm hangs up the phone and walks up, joining him
Any damage
Minimal
"Minimal" is too much
It has to be light, it has to be strong -- Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible
God save me from academics
You are an academic
Former academic
Now  actually make things
don't just talk
You think 'm all talk, Eddie
(doesn't look at him) It doesn't matter what  think
Is there anything we've forgotten
Anything at all
Behind them, someone
Eddie and Malcolm turn around
, an African-American girl around twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a duffel bag slung over one shoulder
She looks at Malcolm and breaks into a wide grin
Hi, Dad
Kelly
What are you doing here
She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him in a warm embrace
He responds stiffly
Vacation
'm all yours
You didn't forget, did you
She pulls back and looks at him
(cont'd) Did you
: '  - is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the construction floor
Outside the glass windows work on the vehicles continues unabated
hangs up the phone
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour
You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there
don't even know this woman
Well,  do, and she's fantastic
She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right
You're going to have a fantastic time
Stop saying fantastic
Where are you going
can't tell you
But 'll be back within a week
My vacation is over in a week
'll make it up to you this summer
promise
'm your daughter all the time, you know
Not just when it's convenient
Very hurtful
Your mother tell you to say that
No, Dad

From the construction floor,  calls out

s
) Dr
Malcolm
Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace
Quickly
Is that kid still bothering you
Which one
You know, at the bus stop
With the hair
That was about a year ago
Well, is he
No
Richard talked to his parents
That Richard
(o
s
) Ian, come here a minute
(to Malcolm) could come with you
Out of the question
You'd miss the gymnastics trials
You've been training for that for a year
don't care about the trials, want to be with you
could be your research assistant, like  was in Austin
This is nothing like Austin
Forget about it
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you
He looks at her, hurt
Eddie calls out a third time, impatient now
Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and heads for the door
He pauses guiltily
'm not like you wan me to be
've what  can be
He leaves
- While  and  argue over something in the background,  circles around the trailers and looks up at the windows
They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire mesh inside it
She looks around, to see if anybody's watching
They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front trailer
- Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design
It's divided into sections, for different laboratory functions
The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays, dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video monitors
Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of processors, and a communications section
All the lab equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that slides into the walls
Everything is bolted down
She notices a large map on the wall
Off the coat of Costa Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black ink
Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the Pacific Ocean
Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five
Matanceros
Muerte
Tacano
Pena
And Sorna
Underneath the whole island chain, there is a bold legend
"The Five Deaths," it says
Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters of those three ominous words
: - The map dissolves slowly away as the barge  through five foot ocean swells in the open sea
The barge is crammed with equipment, the , trailers, a jeep, and the members of Malcolm's team

Next to him,

Do a lot of work for Greenpeace
That must be interesting
What drew you there
Women
'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace
Very noble of you
(of the noisy Game Boy) You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you
Nick grins and shuts it off
Hey,  wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths
You think this is all a joke
Oh, please
How am  supposed to keep a straight face when -- (gestures to the black-clad Malcolm) -- Johnny Cash here tells me 'm going to Skull Island

He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink

But her face says even she has her doubts
Come on, there's only one reason any of us are here
His check cleared
She looks at him
Drop the cynical pose
You can't pull it off while playing Donkey Kong
The boat's , a Costa Rican, points ahead and  to them
There it is

The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide
(cont'd) -- safe
: - The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the island
The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley shimmers in midday heat
connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and flicks it on
The cable turns slowly in the sunlight
Moving along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage color
As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts begins to move, slowly rising into the air
The emerging structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into the air
The light house at the top (the cage that was tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it from view
lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the ground
Malcolm notices
Listen
know you all have probably concluded that 'm out of my mind
Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just sway slightly
(cont'd) That's all right, for now
But just humor me and be careful
No, it's not our imagination, there they go again
Whole trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back again
(cont'd) Even if you think 'm harmless and deluded,  promise -- Now the trees  and  as they sway
Everyone has seen it, and now Malcolm turns around too
(cont'd) -- this place is for real
: - It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command post/living quarters
The books are lined up neatly on the shelves
The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data input
All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one storage bin all the way on top, there's a
plastic student  card pops out in the cracks under the bin's door
photograph in the lower right hand corner of the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old daughter
The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft , the door pops open
herself tumbles out, wrapped in several blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish liquid
We can guess
She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can
She races through a narrow door and  it shut
sign on the door says "
"  Inside, a  of relief is heard
: - Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver
loads a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and chews anxiously on a piece of gum
and
are beside him as the group nervously follows the  forest trees to their right
At the rear,  and  walk side by side
Eddie is carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging beneath the barrel
He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and urgent
Lindstradt air rifle
Fires a subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart
He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic containers filled with straw-colored liquid
Each is tipped with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning tag -- "
" (cont'd) loaded the enhanced venom of Conus purpurascens, the South Sea cone shell
Most powerful neurotoxin in the world
Acts within a two-thousandth of a second
Faster than the nerve-conduction velocity
The animal's down before it feels the prick of the dart
From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now
By walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right along with the animals as they move in the foliage
(to Eddie) Is there an antidote
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot
Wouldn't matter
You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger
Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet
But around them, the  sounds get louder and closer, the swaying trees shiver right beside them
Eddie raises the rifle in defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway and part
Above the foliage, they see the sudden movement -- -- of a row of  fins
The spade-shaped fins run along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about three feet tall each
The group freezes, amazed, and as the stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a break in the foliage
It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a huge lumbering body
double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it
The gum drops out of Nick's mouth,  onto his shirt, and sticks there
Oh -- -- my -- -- God
It's beautiful
second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult
While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet
Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed
Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures
Her shutter is muted, so that a muffled  is all that's audible
Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into it breathlessly
Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae, infraorder Stegosauria, suborder Thyreophora
Length, adult male, estimate twenty-five to thirty feet
His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all things, as he can't contain his astonishment
Eddie covers his mouth, trying to keep him quiet
(to Juttsn) That was a pair bond
family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound
want to see the nesting ground
Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile, wordless, boy-was--wrong-on-this-one gesture
Malcolm smiles, leans over, and  softly on Nick's video camera
Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group continues on into the bush after the animals
, the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near where Sarah crouches in the bushes
Sarah raises her camera again and silently  a picture
She  to Juttson, who is beside her
Lone nest -- not colonial
don't see an egg clutch
She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field glasses
(whispering back) The empty shells are crushed and trampled
The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive
Not without a shot of the nest
She sees an opportunity
As the baby heads back to its parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it, using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the other two
Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm
Nick reaches out to stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the clearing
, Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back, toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south
She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd, ever better as she gets closer
, the others can only watch her, aghast
She's gutty
She's nuts
, Sarah keeps moving closer
The baby passes a small grouping of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them
She's now in a perfect position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture after picture from this ideal vantage point
She shoots the last picture on the roll -- -- and the camera's autowinder  to life
Sarah looks down in horror as the camera's motor  loudly in her hands
Th noise startles the animals
The male turns toward her the plates on its back bristling
Sarah gets to her feet and starts to move away, slowly
The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes extended
It  through the air, right at her, but Sarah leaps back at the last second -- -- and the tail's spikes  into the dirt where she was
Sarah  to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly for animals their size
The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her back, against a massive tree trunk
But the tree trunk lifts right up off the ground
It's no tree, it's a ' , a massive one, six feet across, God knows how many feet high
The Group gasps and looks up as a , an enormous saurupod over a hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them
The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and furtively, its long neck stretched out above them
Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first
The first mamenchiasaur  around in a semi-circle, getting into position behind the second
Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating
The mighty tails swing and  around them as the two animals come together, and trees start snapping and falling, to the jungle floor
The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath the animals
Amid  and , the swinging tails continue to deforest the jungle around them
The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the and  of the fascinated and terrified group
There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest
, the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving with wild, frightened laughter
Sarah goes to Malcolm and throws her arms around him, exhilarated
Ian, you're not insane
'm so glad
(out of breath) Dr
Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology
: - Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more seriously
They march quickly back to base camp, their energy and excitement palpable
strikes a match and raises it to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but  leans in and blows it out
No more smoking
We leave no scent of any kind
No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags
We will observe and document, but we will not interact
That's a scientific impossibility, you know
Heisenberg uncertainty principle
Whatever you study, you also change
Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a sharpie, to label it
What should  call this
"Jurassic Pork
" Eddie, next to him, laughs
(still to Malcolm) And let's forget about the high hide
We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible
'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did
Why wouldn't they
Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds -- That doesn't say a thing about -rex, they could have been rogues
Robert Burke certainly thinks they were
We've got to see one to find out
Is there any -- No way
Oh, my God
-- way we could safely -- Oh, no
He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail, toward base camp
They look ahead, in the direction Nick is running
plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees
Fire
: - bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume of smoke
In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly built a campfire surrounded by stones
Flames burn in the middle
Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the  emerge from the trees behind him
campfire
Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in
No
Water mixes the smoke billow, use dirt
They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their hands and feet
Eddie and Dr
Juttson jump in and help out
Who the hell started a campfire
(o
s
) It was just to make lunch
Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice
stands in the doorway of the trailer, sheepish
(cont'd) wanted it ready when you got back
The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm himself
Oh
man
: - Later, and base camp is a blur of activity
, , , and  are hard at work, burying the remains of the fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera equipment, packing up specimen containers and other information-gathering equipment
, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in
You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island
(loading a backpack) What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity
Where do you think she gets it
(to Nick) Do you have chromium tapes
The others fog in high- -humidity,  know
(waving a tape) Highest lead density on the market
(to Malcolm) We've got a lot of heavy marching ahead of us
'm not carrying anybody
can keep up
You're going home
'm sending a radio call for the boats
We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal
'm her father
Sure, now
Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm and Kelly
Do you see any family resemblance here
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it
It's too dangerous
If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring any of us
You're wrong, Dad
do know what's going on on this island
How could you possibly
Because you said so
Maybe nobody else believed you, but  always did
He looks at her, touched
Nick mutters to Eddie again
The kid scores with cheap sentiment
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day
That'll have to go in any paper write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated
You know the academic world as well as  do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead
Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic
That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it- low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes over the jungle around them, a  racket that shakes the very ground beneath them
Suddenly, three -130 military cargo planes  overhead and  toward the island interior, flying very low
The planes are enormous, fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open
, the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a specific spot
Eddie raises a pair of field glasses
, huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the cargo bays
They  off trees like matchsticks,  flat anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land
Now  pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude parachutes billowing open behind them
, Nick looks at Sarah
You were saying something about antiseptic
: '  - Metal container doors  to the ground, jeep engines to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser barriers  and  through foliage as this group of establishes a perimeter around their new camp
, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the surroundings
He turns to
, a ragged, pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses
Welcome to your dream come true, Dr
Burke
Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that he spreads out on the hood of a jeep
believe the large herbivores forage in open plains, like bison, which would explain the great variety of heat dots we're reading in the flatlands around this waterhole
Right -- here
Then that's where we're going
Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all times
Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds underneath
As each vehicle  out of the equipment container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the dashboard
(calling them off) Hadrosaurus
Carinthosaurus
Maiasaurus
As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to  , the man we saw welding earlier
This is as good a place as any for base camp
First priority is the laser barriers,  want them all up and running in thirty minutes
Half an hour, understand
Dieter nods and turns to some of the , who number about twenty in all, that are working nearby
But someone steps in front of Dieter, cutting him off
It's  , the hunter from the bar in Mombassa
Cancel that, Dieter
What
Why
Roland points to a stream running nearby
Carnivores hunt near stream beds
Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar
(thinks) You heard his, Dieter
Find a new spot
And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks
Dieter  and goes to work
Roland puts an arm around Ludlow and pulls him aside
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions
First -- 'm in charge, and when 'm not around, Dieter is
Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day
Second condition -- my fee
You can keep it
All  want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs
male
Buck only
Why and how are my business
If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own
Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all  care
But 've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas
Okay
(what else can he say
) Okay
Good lad
: The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the Hunters' convoy  into the hart of the jungle stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the "speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver () at the wheel beside him
is in the back seat of the speedbird next to
and , his tracker, are in the second jeep
They look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well
In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in front of it
Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated
He walks around the front of the car and sees -- -- four  eating grass in the middle of the jungle trail
They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing, a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their heads
Dieter doesn't seem impressed
He looks back at Ludlow, who look at Dr
Burke
Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face
Pachycephalosaurus
Carnivore
(enchanted) Huh
No
No, herbivore, late Cretaceous
Very unusual plant eater, see that distinctive domed skull
That's nine inches of solid bone
(who cares
) Just get them out of the way, Dieter
,
The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows chewing their cuds
As unimpressive with him as he is with them, they go back to their grass
(cont'd) Oh, for God's -- He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the closest animal
Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the second jeep
Dieter
This is a round-up, not a war
Use your powers of persuasion
Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does, slowly, toward the animals
The pachys look up, alert, but do not move
Dieter walks toward them
Come on, come on, don't have all day
(going on to no one in particular) See, the pachy's neck attaches at the bottom of its skull instead of the back of its head, as with reptiles
The speedbird draws closer
The first pachy stares at it intently
The lead vehicle gets closer, closer -- -- and  into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out of the way
(cont'd) So when it lowers its head, its neck lines up directly with its backbone -- , Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet
He takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back toward Roland
Roland
, the pachys turn and hop away
Dieter turns and heads back to the speedbird
As he reaches for the door, a  calls "look out
" from behind him
Dieter spins around, just in time to see -- -- the first pachy in full charge
It  headfirst into the speedbird,  the headlights and denting the grill
(concluding his lecture) Which is perfect for absorbing impact
Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car
The pachy has backed up  for another run and is now Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to protect himself
The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying against the car, knocking the wind out of him
In the other jeeps, the rest of the  stand up or lean out the window for a better look, laughing
The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter
It bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the speedbird
But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again
He's forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the speedbird, just as the animal  into the rear of the vehicle
Now the other three animals join the jun
Ludlow and the Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the car again and again,  the steel-meshed windows and the quarter panels
The rest of the group watches, vastly amused
, Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an animal footprint, three-toed, enormous
It matches the pictures
It certainly does
Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird
Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing -- -- his gun
It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled 600 Nitro Express
Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth, bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach
The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory bead foresight at the business end
Roland scoops up the gun, breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his shirt pocket
Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter, these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made
He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush
Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals trashing the speedbird for the first time
The pachys all freeze, staring at him
Roland waves one hand, sharply between his teeth -- -- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle
Takes care of that problem
Roland turns and heads back into the jungle, calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow
(cont'd) Don't worry about us
We'll catch up
Where do you think you're going
To collect my fee
And with that he disappears into the foliage
The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the battered car  forward
As it moves ahead, it reveals , lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body
, Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks lead
Ajay
Ajay turns
Roland points in the direction in which the footprints lead
(cont'd) 'm no tracker, but even  can read this spoor
Do you wish to go where the animal has been, or where the animal is
Roland smiles
Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland follows
: - Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to plow through the jungle
But how the hunters themselves are being tracked, followed by the
They scurry along as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving vehicle below
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian
Because  didn't know
don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here
(angry) Ruining everything, that's what they're doing
You could choke on the diesel smoke already
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army
Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as they move below
"InGen
"  What's InGen
Where does it say that
On the side of that one truck
Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it
(to Malcolm) Is that who we're really working for
Gene splicers
No
We're an independently funded expedition
Funded by whom
John Hammond
But he's the head of InGen
You gotta be kidding
(to Malcolm) You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge
You couldn't get anybody else
Yeah, what have you done, Dad
We'd better keep moving, or we'll lose them
The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring through the binoculars
What are you doing to me, John
: - and  make their way through the foliage and come into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into the rock
Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the far left
Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the breeze
It floats back between his legs
That's good
He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him
They can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a black interior
Roland pauses, looking down
On the ground to his right he sees the partially eastern leg of a creature
It's old, crawling with white maggots and flies
Roland continues on
Closer to the cave, he now passes the skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin still adhering to the bone
It, too, is covered with flies
Still he continues on
short rise leads into the cave, and they edge up it
From inside the cave, they can hear an odd sound, very high-pitched
Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular rampart of dried mud, and peer into -- -- the tyrannosaur nest
It's flattered inside, about ten feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls
, about four and a half feet long, is in the center of the nest
It has a large head, very large eyes, and its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a scraggly appearance
It  repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp teeth
The cave itself is a foul boneyard
litter the edges, flies  in the captive air
Roland raises a bandana to his nose to cover the stench
He  turns to Ajay and It's the rex nest
Ajay nods
The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks up, cocking its head in curiosity
Make a blind here
Wait for the buck to return
(shakes his head no) If the nest is upwind, so are we
When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance
The truck -- In the nest below, the baby  angrily at the intruders
(cont'd) -- is to get him to come where we want him
The baby  again, indignant
Roland turns and looks down at it
Thinking
: - As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon,  raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista below the ridge
In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed herd of midsized herbivores -- , , and  -- racing across the plain below
, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge beside him
is several feet behind them, her back pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the ridge
' We see a shaky point of view of the herd running
The binoculars whip to the right -- -- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in fact, but a whole
There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a wrangler's pickup truck
Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's almost eerily silent
, Nick lowers the binoculars, angry
When he raises them again, the sun  off the lens -- - -- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in the middle of the roundup
Engines , wheels spin and dig in the dirt, men  and radios  as the hunter vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed
The   and  with glee, incredulous and thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing
2 ' , , ' One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the others
stands in the passenger seat, holding a long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it
He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and  to the driver
The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining on the herd
Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle -- -- but the motorcycle  in from the right side, cutting them off, herding them back out into the open
, stands in a "conning tower," a command post in the heaviest pursuit vehicle
He  into a walkie-talkie
Alive, Dieter, and uninjured
, the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints thrown by the herd ahead of him
Dieter  and throws the lasso pole into the back of the jeep
Ludlow's voice continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep
(o
s
) Those are very expensive animals
Can you hear me
(to the Driver) Turn that off
The Driver  off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled rifle from the back of the vehicle
guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the plain
From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous necks rise up in alarm
Two  are startled from the bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain
The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running, scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their massive legs
One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of the apotosaurs
The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the juvenile
Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal
High in the back of the truck, a  mans a tranquilizer cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down
He  and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the neck
Its pace slows and another  from the truck tosses a lasso around its neck
They crank a winch, reeling in the animal
As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of the truck
As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a hydraulic , trapping the animal between its airbags
Now a pick-up rig  up and drops its back gate
The scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in this dino-contaiment vehicle
Two  throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig
The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig and it takes off, back into the hunt
, Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat, whips a harness over himself and  it into place
He jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard
Immediately, a motor underneath the seat  to life and the seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to Dieter raises the gun, picks a , a red-crested herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim
The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in its left hindquarter
, there is utter quiet
Nick and the others stare wordlessly at the spectacle below
, the snagger  to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge cloud of dust and dirt
The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its  pushing his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face
The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which heavily to the ground
carrying wire noose poles and chains race down the ramp and out of the truck
Dieter jumps off the snagger
He puts down his tranquilizer gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly
Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet
The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers
Easy -- easy -- not too close
Full extension
The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten foot tall animal
(cont'd) Now
Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the stunned animal's neck
It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it
, Nick turns away
He can't watch
, a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs
The animal to the dirt with a  of a defeat
Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at the helpless animal
Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes glowing
The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily
Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck
blue arc of electricity  and dances over the carinthosaur's body
The animal convulses in pain, a horrible, high-pitched  rips the air
, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a syringe
He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and injects it into the animal's thigh
, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint and quickly tags the animal with an  number in day-glo orange
Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the dashboard of the jeep and marks a black  over the drawing of the animal
Next case
: - Night has fallen over the island
The hunters have established base camp in an area they have trampled and cleared just below the ridge
Blue laser fences encircle the perimeter
Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a central campfire
The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents
At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they have already rounded up
, , and  stand at the edge of the ridge above, looking down at the scene
Sarah stands a bit further back from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge
waft up to them, raucous, , some even
has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on the cages
Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus -- triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus -- or small scavengers only
Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing something below
' , he sees  , standing in the middle of the camp, pointing, giving orders
, Malcolm drops the binoculars
Ludlow
That's why Hammond was in such a hurry for me to get here
He knew they were coming
He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly
(cont'd) You okay
(irritated) Heights,  can't help it
Put your arm here, will you
She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is close to the cliff edge
What do they want
They want their money back
To InGen, this island is nothing more than a bed investment
We should get back to base camp
Eddie's waiting for us
can't believe Peter Ludlow's running all this
He isn't
Check out the guy walking past the fire
She hands the binoculars to Malcolm
, Malcolm sees , who's walking with , weapons and equipment slung over their shoulders
(o
s
) 've seen him before
In Brazil
He and that guy with him were spearhunting jaguars
Said it was immoral to go after them any other way
He's not just a hunter, he's a philosopher
Kind of guy who beats you up with your own argument
, (cont'd) He's the one in charge
Well, if that's true -- the man in charge just left camp
Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps forward
Then this is our chance
Our chance to do what
don't know these guys, but  know 'em
've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic
They're all the same
They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy
He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools hunting knife
bolt cutter
(cont'd) Nobody has to come with me
've done this before
Why, Nick
You are a tree-hugger
He looks at her, hurt
There' no reason for name calling
Dr
Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away
Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so
What are you guys gonna do
(signs) Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do
: - '  - In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition
reaches in and pulls a bottle out
- In the jungle,  approaches a small clearing
is bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to it
As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what protest
Roland looks up
Offering a little incentive
Ludlow laughs and shakes his head
He takes a drink and offers Roland one
Roland accepts
Ludlow notices Roland's gun leaning against a tree
What kind of gun is that
My father's
600 Nitro Express
Made in 1904
Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant
8700 foot pound striking force
How close do you have to be
Forty yards
Less, maybe
assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill
Roland just looks at him
Or a laser beam from a satellite
Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it while it thrashes on its chain
Its mouth has been bound shut with a leather strap
You rally think this'll draw the parent
once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep
All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves
saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill
Killing lessons
Heartwarming
Rex won't be any different
It'll come
You're kidding yourself
An adult -rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly
It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it
If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would -- He stops, an idea on his face
(cont'd) Wait
Why not
Sedatives
growth inhibitors
What
hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but  only thought of adults, it never occurred to me -- (close to the animal) You are a billion dollar idea, my little f- The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut, lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the bridge of the nose
Ludlow staggers back,  in pain, clutching his bleeding face
Roland laughs
Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's leg
The bone breaks with a dry  and the animal  in pain
Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage is done
What the hell you do that for
As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts to cover
Had to
To keep him still for the trip
You've broken its leg
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles
Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member
He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp, trying to salvage his dignity
Roland watches him go
: '  - At the edge of the hunters' camp, , , and scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser barriers
There are three beams, each about two feet apart, the tallest almost six feet off the ground
Nick reaches the edge and crouches
Sarah, helped by Malcolm, steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then left alone on the other side
He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then springs off his good leg -- -- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top
He lands with a , to the silent admiration of the other two
, the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel barrels
They lean around the edge for a look
They're directly behind the row of vehicle
They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and the jeeps
Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles under the first one
Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout
, Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket
He squirms along until he finds the jeep's fuel line -- -- and he snips it
He ducks out of the way just as the stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt
move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second
They hear another , then keep moving, to cover him as he moves to the third
From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint, high-pitched
He turns and looks to that direction
- It's the baby -rex, still
Up in a nearby tree, and  have spread some broken branches crosswise to form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground
They wait
Roland raises his binoculars
The light of the camp spills all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle
He scans it, searching for any sign of movement
'  - Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is parked some distance away, undergoing repairs
The motor pool area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline
The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the drunken revelry
They pass several tents, the shadows of the partiers visible as they move inside
They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side -- -- to face the caged animals
The carinthosaur that was tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and glassy, still under the effects
They pass a stegosaur, its row of fine bristling
And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his trusty bolt cutters
He looks at them, a glint in his eye
Hang on
We may encounter some turbulence
'  - In one of the hunter tents,   leans over the satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next day's assault with  and
, their paleontologist
There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the photos, indicating where certain species can be found
If you're really interested in infants, we'll have better luck at the seaside, because the sands offer a cushioning surface where the egg clutches can -- can -- He trails off
low  sound can be heard outside, and the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board
They look at each other
The  gets louder
Outside, someone ; on the board, the little dinosaurs start hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the  outside turn to , they turn and look at the back of the tent -- -- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas
- go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns tearing through the canvas,  across the camp
Men in alarm, the triceratops  in anger and confusion, chaos reigns
In the crush of  running every which way,  and are swept off in one direction while  is buffeted in another
They , but cannot be heard over the frey
The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right through the fire in the middle of the camp Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting ablaze anything that gets in its way
Its considerable hindquarters  into a parked jeep, sending it rolling across the camp
The jeep flattens the largest tent and  down on its side
Its broken gas line  gas over the ground, the gas hits one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas
The jeep explodes
, Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a fireball rises up from the camp in the distance
What in God's --
, the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the camp
The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing animals
, Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other
The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates in a series of smaller
Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the series of concessive blasts
He drags himself up onto all fours, charred and bruised
burning tire rolls slowly past him, spinning to a stop -- -- at 's feet
Dieter looks up at him
Last time  leave you in charge
, Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where Ajay and Roland had their blind
He sees the baby tyrannosaur chained to the stake
Sick bastards
He goes to the animal, which now  in pain, its broken leg hanging at an odd angle
With one strong tug, Nick pulls the stake out of the ground
, Roland surveys the destruction
The fire has spread and several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air, the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are scattered and terrified
, breathless, face smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland
What in Christ's name is going on
Isn't it obvious
He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages
(cont'd) We're not alone on this island
: - and  race back up onto the ridge trail, where the green  is parked
bursts around from the other side of the car
Nick, thank God, we didn't know if -- Malcolm opens the rear door
Wait, don't --- With a piercing , the  , now in the back of the , flings itself at the open doorway, jaws just short of Malcolm's nose
He  the door
' , Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up
Do we have anyone up there
, Malcolm is confronting Nick
It has a broken leg
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery
No
Get in the car before they hear us
He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat
Sarah slips into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice but the rear
: - The   through the jungle foliage
From inside the car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur  in anger
- The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has flattened himself against the door, as far away from the animal as possible
Ian, close the window, it's going to wake every predator in the jungle
Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its window
The tyrannosaur  with one of its powerful hind legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm
He  in pain
Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by
- Up in the high hide, ,
, and  are standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their returning comrades
Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face as he spots the , pulling up to the base camp a couple hundred yards away
There they are
They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching them pull the wounded animal from the back seat
What is that they have with them
- and  carry the  baby tyrannosaur in their arms, headed for the trailer
, holding his bleeding arm, isn't far behind
- and  bring the  infant to the metal dining table and hold it down
is right behind them
This is exceedingly unwise
Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a small syringe
Her shirt is streaked with blood from the baby's injured leg
Too late to worry about that
Hold him together, Nick
Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections
Just do whatever you have to do and get it out of here as quickly as possible
Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over the animal's leg
green and white skeletal image appears on a monitor next to the table
Okay, there's the metatarsals -- tibia, fibula -- there it is
See it
That's a fracture, just above the epiphysis
They peer closely at the monitor
That little black line
That little black line means death for this infant
The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet
The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk
It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old
Can you set up
(thinking) It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows
Think fast, Sarah
The tyrannosaur, still in pain,  again
- Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the trailer carefully
Even inside, the animal's  are clearly audible
Kelly is getting scared
What are they doing
Why don't they hurry
Give me the radio
From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive -- One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare into the night jungle
- holds the animal while  fits an aluminum foil cuff around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin
, at the window, stares out anxiously
The animal thrashes again
Give it more morphine
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest
'm almost done
Damn it,  need another adhesive, something pliable can -- Her eyes fall on Nick
She holds out her hand, urgently
(cont'd) Spit
He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand
The baby rex   again
- From the swaying jungle, there is another answering
And this one's closer
In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling
In the distance, a flock of birds  and takes flight as the tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly coming alive, as if brushed by wind
But it's not the wind
They hear noises,  in the jungle
And then another section of forest trembles
Closer
Another flock of birds bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide
What is it
Dr
Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling her closer to him
Eddie  urgently into the walkie-talkie
Sarah, come in
It's moving
Fast
- There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer
The speaker  urgently with Eddie's
(o
s
) Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me
On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum into place on the makeshift splint
But the baby rex, regaining its strength, is thrashing again
Hold it down, Nick
'm trying
(o
s
) (from the radio) Is anybody there
Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah  to him
Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a syringe
Quick injection of antibiotics and  can get it out of here
Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and comes up with what she wants
Working fast, he draws twenty cc's of the pink liquid
(o
s
) (still from the radio, now desperate) ,
They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the injection
(o
s
) ,
- Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio desperately
-- - Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible piece of information
Oh, Christ
He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button
(cont'd) Let me talk to Kelly, is she-- deafening  sound from just outside the trailer, followed immediately by a  sound
They whirl and look to the window, just in time to see -- --  the  tumbling by, rolling on its side
There is another , and the baby, on the table,  in response
Outside the window, the head of a full-grown lowers and peers inside
Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror
The rex outside , making material cooing noises
The baby rex, calm for the first time,  back
But across the trailer, in the opposite window,  - This one , deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles anything in the trailer that isn't tied down
What do they want
What do you think they want
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used earlier
He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others,  a fresh cassette in, and flicks the "" switch
Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the trailer, carrying the baby rex
Outside, the two adult rexes stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them through the window
- Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex
The adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly as long
They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over, watching their infant
- At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby
Ready
Malcolm reaches for the door handle
Wait
He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video camera up at the door, getting the best shot
Malcolm takes a breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door
Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring, surprised
Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing
(softly) Born free, as free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows -- Are you insane
swear to God, it works with lions sometimes
There we are -- your baby is free -- The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the ground outside
Not wasting a second, Malcolm  the door shut
The three of them freeze, not daring to breath
Outside, they can hear the  and  of the animals as they inspect their young -- -- and then the soft  of their footsteps, growing fainter as they move away
From the wall, '  comes over the radio, relieved
They're going back into the jungle
: - , , and  sag back against the railings of the high hide
Thank God
Thank God
'  comes over the radio
(o
s
) Kelly
Are you all right
She takes the radio, her voice shaky
Uh huh
: - is at the radio
Wait there
'll come up in a minute
Don't move, understand
(o
s
) understand
Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer
and sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall, completely drained
Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and speaks shakily into it
Note to Dr
Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus rex does nurture its young
They laugh weakly
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone
You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on
Whether or not you feel lucky
One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed
(pause) Well
Do we go on
Immediately: No
No
No way
They all laugh
All right
'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now
feel vindicated
John Hammond will too
(to Sarah) Do you have enough to publish
They will come after me
But  can collect some stool samples, for with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back
(getting up) Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back
'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now
This expedition is over
He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite phone that's resting in a battery pack
The front panel lights up, a brilliant green
But from the wall speaker, the radio  and ' breaks through, soft and empty
(o
s
) Oh, God
am so sorry
Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box
What the hell is he sorry f- low  sneaks into the trailer
Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around
The gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates, everything in it starts to  against the walls -- -- and something huge  into the side of the trailer
They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an earsplitting  of electricity, the entire trailer rocks and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black
The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and against the wall
It lands on the floor, its number pad still glowing green
Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows
Outside, the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window, revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the trailer
They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on for dear life
The charging rex  into the side of the trailer, which rocks up on one side,  back  down, and is quickly  again by the furious animal
This time the entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down
Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds and drop onto the ceiling
The tables, chairs, lab equipment, everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them; everything that isn't
But the rexes aren't done
The trailer   , sliding forwards
, the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in front of it
, They're pushing us
Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside
He looks down and sees a -rex footprint in the earth outside as they move past it
He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which they are being pushed
His eyes widen at something he sees outside the window
Oh, God
What
They're pushing us over the cliff
Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black
The three of them look at each other for a moment -- -- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the trailer
The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward
They reach the accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it
, which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at it, pushing the front end of the trailer
, Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill
The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to freefall, right past her, some  her in the head
Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold
Sarah, starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator, getting a g rip on the handle
The door, held by a safety latch, doesn't open
Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer
Through the  glass, we can see the surf,  five hundred feet below
The refrigerator bolts suddenly  free of the wall
The box strains on its power cord
Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts to come loose, swaying above her
The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a shower of food  off of her as gravity empties the contents
Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical trailer
She , covers her head, and  into the rear window
The glass spiderwebs, but does not break
, an enormous wave  the rocky shore
Above, Sarah is a tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the breaking window
, Nick  to her
'
Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her senses
She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below
For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag
As she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her
She blanches; the world spins around her
please
Her breath fogs the cracked glass
Slowly, she tries to get up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees
But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass  even more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers
The whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the trailer
, Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still glowing green
Nick is closest to it
Nick
Grab the phone
looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the wall of the trailer
She shifts her weight, leaning on one hand to reach for the grating with the other
reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches from his outstretched fingers
leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass
The splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge of the frame -- -- and her hand  right through the glass
She  and pulls her hand out, but now she knees  through the glass
has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls
lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the heavy phone whizzes past her head and  into the glass, opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window
, glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone fall out the broken window and  on the rocks far below
, the trailers are split, like an , the rear trailer hanging straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the cliff
Satisfied with their work, the -rexes turn and lumber back into the jungle
, Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating
Above her, Nick lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her
, we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows out from the muddy cliff
But now those branches
, Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers, stretch as the lower trailer  and dips lower
, Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen, inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for purchase
, the tree branch  and the trailer jerks, stretching down again
The bellows expands to its full length, stretching like a Slinky
, Nick knows he has to hurry
He climbs down, bouncing off the built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah
But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet
She gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face
- is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through the jungle as fast as he can
Hang on -- hang on -- The foliage  the windshield, then clears suddenly, revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of him
The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the rex and  to a halt
- Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls,  into the frame of the half-broken rear window again
, Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer
He in through the broken front window
, The three look up from their precarious positions
'
, Eddie turns and run back to the jeep
He grabs a coil of rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the trailer
, Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out into the extended connector
He peers over the edge, down into the second trailer, and tosses the rope
Catch
The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end dangling all the way out the smashed rear window
But the trailer , starting to move again
We're sliding
Climbs up if you can
, Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff
He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the front grill
Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff
Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable behind him
He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for its towing hook, the cable goes taut -- -- and he falls short
Just by six inches, but he's out of cable
Damn it
, Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them
Malcolm is further up, also clinging to the rope
, dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the edge of the cliff
Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable
He turns and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook securely into the trailer's towing hook
The trailer lurches toward the edge of the cliff and stops
But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure
, Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks them back, and their hands slide down the line
, they slide through the trailer and their feet  through the remains of the rear window
Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer, dangling over the rocky shore below
, Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to get a grip
The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front trailer back to earth
But the tires spin, fighting to hold it there
Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate
Eddie  the shifter into four wheel drive and  the engine
As the motor , the sound is topped by another , in the distance
And this one's not a machine
But Eddie doesn't hear it
He the engine again
There is another  from the jungle
Eddie hears this one
He darts a look at the side view mirror
In it, he sees one of the  bolt out of the jungle behind him
He  and looks at the other side view
In it, he sees the racing toward him
The tyrannosaurs  forward to confront the  jeep
The first rex bends over,  down on the rear tire, and lifts the car to its teeth
But the spinning tire  in the rex's mouth, burning it
Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and the jeep  back down onto the ground
Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get away
The gas pedal pops up -- -- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff
But the rex  down on the jeep to prevent its escape
The trailers stop
Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie, who still covers under the steering wheel
The first rex at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully exposed
He  and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its teeth and tossing him out of the car
Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he disappears between their teeth
Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the trailers drop over the edge of the cliff
, Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as the trailers fall around them
The windows flash by as the trailers plummet, equipment  and  them, but they hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life
, the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three, who pop out the space where the front windshield was
Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which is now rolling to the edge of the cliff
It falls, past them, and the whole mess  on the rocks below
Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the surf
- It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen
At the cliff, a hand appears from over the edge
Then another
pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes , then both of them reach over and help  up over the edge
They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted
(softly) Eddie
He looks at the other two
They glance around, then drop their heads
Sarah hears a  in the distance
Oh, God
Now what
From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams moves toward them
But rather than the three or four that would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of them
The ,   is in the lead,  and with him
is there too, shepherding  and
along in front of him
Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race together
Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly as he possibly can
Are you all right
Anything broken
'm fine, 'm fine,  was scared, thought you, are you okay
'm fine
'm fine
Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp
(mostly to himself) That's what you think
: - In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a heated argument
sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms, just looking down at the ground and shaking his head
There's something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous than any of the hot tempers that are flaring
rants to while  looms menacingly over
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals
has encountered
What are you doing here, Burke
There's no  cameras, what's the point
Dr
Juttson, you exist outside the classroom
am amazed
Dieter continues to get in Nick's face
Are you looking for a problem
(an urgent whisper) Everyone, keep your voices down
Back off, Dieter
Listen to me, by moving the baby rex into our camp, we changed the adults' perceived territory
Their what
(she understands) Oh, God
That's why they persisted in destroying the trailers, they now feel they have to defend this entire area
We're not safe here
(of Sarah and Nick) Thanks to you people
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place
It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take
None of that matters
Our communications equipment's been destroyed
If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and 'm guessing by the look on his face -- He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in stunned silence
Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly
The grimness of their situation sinks in
(cont'd) We are stuck here, ladies and gentlemen
And we're stuck together
: '  - Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two groups combine their diminished supplies
They have half a dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins, a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or shoulders of the  team, the charred and scraggly remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and a cartoon of Marlboros
supervises the assembling of the resources, which are displayed in front of him
, , , , and , who is still holding  close to him, are with him
They hold their discussion in quiet tones
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight
Move where
Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send -- Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible
There's a communication center, here, in the old worker village
Hammond put in some kind of renewable power source replenishing
It may still work
If we could get there, we could send a radio call for the airlift
How far is the village
said if we could get there
Well, how far is it
day's walk, maybe more
That's not the problem
What is
The velociraptors
Malcolm looks up sharply
(cont'd) Our infrareds show their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior
That's why we planned on keeping to the outer rim
Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters something to her quietly in the background
What are velociraptors
Carnivores
Pack hunters
About six feet long, three or four hundred pounds, and very, very fast
Dieter brandishes his weapon
think we can handle ourselves against them
Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone
He keeps his voice low
No
'm quite certain you can't
Look, we have two choices
We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help
We'd never make it past the raptors
Trust me,  have some experience in this matter
Roland looks at him
That may be
But you weren't with me at the time
Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to Kelly
Roland turns to the others
(cont'd) Load up
Let's get this moveable feast underway
: - The  set forth, marching through the jungle in a column
Two  strap on small shoulder-mounted servo-flashlights
Wires run from the lights end in sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks
Thus attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in
screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily
He looks down at , who is marching alongside him
His face shows the deepest of regret
He shakes his head, cursing himself
Damn it
He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp
You all right
Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering
(cont'd) Wrong question
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin
What's that
statistical phenomenon
Says everything in the world goes in streaks
It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets
Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad
Bad things cluster
They go to hell together
Feeling a bit blue, are we
Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace and is a few steps ahead of them now
Just -- flawed
Very deeply flawed
Why did you come here
So that others would know about this place
Why should they
Because it exists
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it
Yes
And people will live in the absence of truth
So the truth is more important to you than your life
(lowers is voice) don't care about my life
But if 'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger -- Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten yards ahead now
She yours
, Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear
They are not as far away as they think they are
(o
s
) 'm afraid so
don't know what the hell 'm doing with kids
never should have had her
Kelly's face shows she heard that part
, Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland
(cont'd) Why are you here
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived
And the second greatest predator must take him down
But why
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago,  forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead
And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die
"  And he said " didn't went up there to live
" (nods) It's called self-testing
But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction
uniquely human characteristic
In fact, human beings destroy things so well that sometimes think that's our function
Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase
Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that- Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words
Roland grabs Malcolm by the shirt collar and pulls him close,  in his ear
Tell you what
You can see whatever you want to, to me, but you will not spew any more nihilist rants at anyone else in the group
'm fighting panic, and you push the wrong buttons
Understand
Malcolm just blinks
This guy's in charge
: - As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the stagger on, exhausted
Some are starting to tire, and there are spaces in the column
's limp seems to be getting worse
reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm swats his hand away
, still ahead of him, falls into step with
don't think -- my dad doesn't think we're going to make it
Sarah looks at her
Your dad is wrong
About a lot more than he knows
She puts an arm around her
Kelly looks up at her, grateful
The long march continues
, catches up to
think you should call a break
Another half hour
Some of them won't make another half hour
We didn't come this far to start dropping in the middle of the jungle
If you don't call it, will
Roland looks at him, steely, then  to the group
Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely drained
, and  are bickering
can't believe you're still angry about that
You know, it's very easy to criticize the first person who studies something
No, it's easy to criticize sloppy research and hasty conclusions
, checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're still dry and undamaged
Sarah comes up, watching him
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax
Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy
Maybe
Maybe not
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals
The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a -rex in the middle of times Square
He doesn't look at her
She sits down beside her
(cont'd) There's something more important that you should be thinking about instead
, Dr
Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits down on a rock
does a double take, noticing something behind the rock
He leans over and picks it up
It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled exterior
dinosaur egg
Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder
, pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him -- , his driver, who has his back turned
Wait here for me, would ya Carter
He steps off the path, into the jungle
But as we come around the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the headphone  tinnily in his ears
And he didn't hear a word
- Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured
claws forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself
He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his hand to his belt buckle
He freezes, hearing something we didn't
He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger
Nothing there
Just a few distant  -- -- and s  around to his left
Dieter snaps his head in that direction
At first, he sees nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him, he sees a small dinosaur, a , the same chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago
It's not polite to -- He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches it to the compy's back
The blue bolt of electricity and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain
(cont'd) -- sneak up on people
The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle, whimpering
Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out into -- -- more jungle
He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back or forward
He looks behind him
He pauses, recalculating the path he took coming into the jungle,  to himself, gesturing with his hands, retracing his steps
He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in that direction
But after five or six hard-fought steps, he stops again
Still nothing but jungle
, , Dieter's cries are faint, but audible
The only Marchers hear enough to hear him is , but the Walkman is blaring in his ears
(o
s
) Carter
me
, Dieter hears that  sound again, this time from his right
He adjusts his angle again and  through the foliage, moving faster and faster
Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on his face
He looks up
The  sound comes again, this time ten times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him
Dieter  as something rushes in at him
He whirls to his right
Whatever it is rushes in from that side as well
And the left
And behind him
Dieter scrambles up into a sitting position -- -- and laughs
He is surrounded by at least forty compys now, the same as the one he wounded
For a long moment, they just stare at him
Slowly, he brings his gun around, to point it at them
Easy -- wait -- one more sec- As one, the compys  and hurl themselves forward, covering Dieter's body
Their teeth and claws  as they each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely
Dieter  and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly
Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off, into trees or the ground
But dozens of others hang on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on the ground
Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, , shaking, swatting the compys loose
He spins, and that tactic seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and drop off of him
But he also loses his grip on his weapon, which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six feet from him
Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse, stopping ten yards away from him
But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up and down,  and
Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun
But the compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his lost weapon
Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun
He turns to face the pursuing compys
They stop
Dieter charges them, , waving his arms
The compys turn and run
Dieter stops
The compys stop
They stare back at him
There is a moment of quiet, then they start to hop again,  and Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away
The compys follow
- From the front of the convoy,   out
Break's over, move on
The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and start to march again
At the rear of the group, someone taps Carter, who is still listening to his music
Carter gets up, hoists his backpack, and marches away
Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle trail
- stumbles along, exhausted
He reaches the edge of a stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the stones
He falls, into the rocky stream
Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he just crested
They disappear for a moment, down an incline -- -- And then swarm over his body
In a frenzy of splashing, Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream
He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as Dieter drops out of sight
The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too, throwing up their own splashes of water
, , and the sound of  flesh mixes with Dieter's Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view are pink
And then they're a deep, deep red
: - The group has stopped again
Near the rear, , , , , and  are in a tense conversation with How long ago was this
Seven, eight minutes
Roland looks at them, thinking
Finally: Then he's dead
Nobody tells the little girl
Last thing we need is screaming hysterics
He turns and heads back to the front of the column
We have to send someone to look for him
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you
They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to move
Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on, one by one
: - The column of  has finally reached the island ridge, where they are silhouetted against the setting sun
They're taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground
sits next to , who's sitting on a log
You okay
She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to sit over next to
Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm
, steps up to the very edge and peers into the island interior
From his vantage point, he's able to see all the way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff, miles away
Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but gently undulating jungle
He refers to one of the satellite recon photos
Looks like the worker village is down in there, about a mile and a half northeast from the base of these cliffs
is next to him
There must be a game trail, some kind of path that goes down there
Roland looks around at the exhausted
They'll have to rest before we look for it
Eat
Sleep
Two hours
Then we hit it
: - The group has made camp in the jungle
The mood is somber, most of the  asleep already
Three or four tents have been put up
, sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up to his chest
comes in
There you are
Your dad's looking for you
doubt that
Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry the broad red smear across its front
Oh, come on
Go talk to him
Why
He likes to be alone
can stay with you
, all is still
The nocturnal jungle  and  around the sleeping marchers
In his tent,  abruptly sits up
As if he heard something
He looks out the open flap
In the middle of the campsite, he sees  stop in his tracks, head cocked
Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of the camp
You hear something
No
feel something
Roland looks at him
This isn't so good
He looks out at the shifting jungle
He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp
Oh, no
' , Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying to get a few minutes' rest
Sarah's shirt hangs over them, swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap
As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side, we notice the broad red smear across the front
Oh, that's right -- it's blood
The baby -rex's blood
, the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire that's been lit by
He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan
Roland and Ajay run up behind him
(hisses) Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire
Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze
What was that
' , Sarah and Kelly sit up
They felt it too
, Get my weapon
Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold, staring down at the ground
recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric circles spreading to the outer edges
' , Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food into Ziploc bags
Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves, and draw the zipper up, all the way around
Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent
Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last few inches, but -- -- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent
It sniffs,  the air in and out
It looks around the tent
It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with the blood of the baby tyrannosaur
The adult tyrannosaur again,  and cocking its head curiously
In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely visible, wide in panic
The rex sniffs and nudges the bag, trying to figure out what this thing is
It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and then rises, straights up -- -- taking the whole tent with it
The stakes pop out of the ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground beneath it
, the   now steps out of the jungle, joining the first
Panic hits the camp as the sleeping  wake up
Many of them start to run
Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon lying near the open flap
As he draws close, an enormous -rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep into the mud
Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked Hunters flee in all directions
' , '
But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed prey that pours across the campsite
Some toss random and ill-aimed  back at the rexes
, bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm
He rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into the jungle
, , blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the rest of the panicking crowd
Frantically, he scans the group
But he can't see her
, the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a narrow ravine
, Roland scrambles up a steep rock face
No way in hell he's going down  that ravine
He sees Malcolm, still in the middle of the camp, start to head for the ravine
Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face, scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders
Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the camp toward him
(cont'd) Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the rock face -- -- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs -- -- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp
The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear his teeth  together, closing around nothing but air
It turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off after them
Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a
Roland unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap
, Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick, hears her father screaming her name and looks up
Malcolm and Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace
(shouting) ,
But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine now, and drawing closer to the group
Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the ravine is deepening, there's no way out
One rex grabs hold of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face
The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck
The Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into -- -- , Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls
The rest of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the bottom of it -- -- and when the animal takes its next step it  him into the earth
, Malcolm is frantic
gotta get down there
, it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick knows it
He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots something off to his left
It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock face
But there's something about the way the water is falling that tells him something
He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight at the waterfall
Apparently, he intends to jump right into the rock, and he's dragging them along with him
- The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear the water
, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as they vanish
, there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for
It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water
Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside
Shhhh
shhhh
With an enormous , something bursts through the cascading water and crashes into them
Dr
Burke
Get out of the way
He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the water as he can
Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain
Tyrannosaur head
Burke gave away the hiding spot
The four  as the rex's jaws  left and right, searching for them, falling just inches short
They squeeze as far back against the wall as they can get
The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the opening -- -- so it uses its tongue
long, dark blue shape slithers out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around them, to pull them out of the cave
Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the cave, which pushes Kelly further out
' But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for himself
His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck
Burke  and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing water
And that's all the leverage the rex needs
It curls its tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its teeth
hideously, he is dragged out, through the waterfall, and disappears
Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of water turn pink
, Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested
Malcolm is nearly hysterical
She's okay
They'll stay in there, she's okay
, routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he jungle
Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by long "elephant" grass
, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of the grass,  to the others
'
Not in the frenzy, they ignore him
Behind Ajay, the enormous shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding up at the edge of the jungle
Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after the other Hunters, waving his arms
, Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view of the plain below
Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails as they plow through the grass
Elephant grass
, the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass
One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees
They gave up
They're not chasing us
There are ,   relief
In the distance, ' can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back
Up on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his arms madly
But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind
They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get further away from the tyrannosaurs
, the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by the full moon
In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter party
The heads descend, back into the grass
, they continue forward, oblivious
Now behind them, four more heads rise up in the grass
As then descend
On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes
And these torpedoes are on target
One Hunter is suddenly dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall grass
In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal drops its head to make the kill
Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more animal tails rise up in their place
Hunter ahead hears the and turns
His face turns white as, behind him -- -- a  springs out of the grass
Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs, the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes on attack
Like now
This raptor  and  into the body of the Hunter, taking him down
feeding frenzy ensues
The Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish into the twitching long grass
Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air, past the full moon,  into the chest of more human prey, and takes him down, into the grass
Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated
He looks around, realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long grass
Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him
Ajay simply closes his eyes
, Roland turns away from the carnage, pained
: - , , , , ,
, and stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks decimated, spirits shattered
Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was
He has pulled his
800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads
Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it doesn't look as if she'll ever let go
Malcolm, who is on his knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay
" Roland appears, standing over the group
He looks at Malcolm, who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact
How many rounds did you find for that weapon
Four, counting the one in the chamber
Don't let it out of your hands again
(to Sara, but looking at Kelly) Can the kid walk
Ask her
Can the kid walk
can
can walk
While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow your gaze
We're going to find a path down into the interior of the island
Load up whatever you think you need, and mean need
If you can't carry it indefinitely, don't bring it
We'll hit the worker village in a couple hours and be out of here before dawn
, Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the rex
Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up, slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders
Roland bends over and  the footprint
It's filled with a liquid of some kind
He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling it
Ludlow hovers over his shoulder
What is that
Piss
Ludlow doesn't ask
, Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led to such disaster
He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it in his pants pocket
: - and  (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and come out in a flattened area
Ludlow , looking ahead in wonderment
breaks through the hillside's foliage a moment later
He too stares in amazement
and  come next, then , then
One by one, they all stop and stare
God help us
They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at the sides
The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to side and as far as they can see ahead
But that's not what amazes them so
Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons
Some are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip
Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds
The more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs of pale bone
but just as many have been ripped apart, bits of carcass tossed in every direction
do not feel lucky
Keep moving
They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous skeletons by the light of the full moon
Roland notices one carcass in particular, a recent kill
It's an enormous with fresh bites taken out of it
He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for footprints
, Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing
He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones
But they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade objects -- twisted, rotting machinery
We made it
They hurry over a small rise -- - -- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla Sorna's worker village
The size of a football field, the town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station
All the way at the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building
But the town is a mess
The hurricane that hit here must have been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken, upended
And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing up, around, and over everything
Huge root systems snake through the street, making it almost impassable
The jungle
It's always ready to return
Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow
Where's the power and radio setup
Operations building
Far end of the street
light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully, silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready
They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower
An empty gas station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless
The only sound is the low mechanical  of the servo-lights as they follow the group's gazes obediently
Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps that lies in random places in the middle of the street
Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them
It's a rock-hard
Nick looks over his shoulder
Lava
No
What are they
don't know
Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of the town
The radio rig is inside
It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem
Good
He pulls out his canteen
Ludlow watches as he screws the top off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the contents on the outside of it
The rest of the group just stares at him
What's he got in there
Piss
What
Don't ask me
The guy's completely out to lunch
What in God's name would he want with- Roland rejoins them
Tyrannosaur urine
don't want anything to do with it, and neither does any other animal on this island
This building is now demarcated as the rex's territory
As long as you stay in that building, you'll all be safe until the helicopter comes
He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks the load
Dr
Juttson looks fearful
Where are you going
After the rex
saw a fresh kill back in the valley with tyrannosaur tracks all around it
If 'm not back in time, don't wait for me
You've got to be kidding
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it
Possible
Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick
You know how to work a radio, don't you
You're going too
lost everything  came after on this trip, but one -rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11
He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it to Nick
(cont'd) This is the broadcast frequency yourself as "Harvest Leader
"  You know what to tell 'em
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now
Now's the perfect time
The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food
Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry
Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle -- No
-- and  it back into the belly of the gun
(cont'd) Only humans do
: - The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly, all green, red, and yellow
tunes the dial to a specific frequency
The radio  and  tuning in
(into microphone) ,
This is InGen Operation Harvest Leader to Harvest Base
Come in, please
The remaining , minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the communications room
On the wall a row of chrome letters says "We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle of vines
Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet
On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic Park would have looked like
Big hotels, Ford Explorers with tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds at the fences around the animal exhibits
But none of it came true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered
There is a pause, filed only with radio static
Sarah looks at Nick tensely, waiting
Finally, a  comes over the radio, clean as can be
(o
s
) Go ahead, Harvest Leader
They all breath a sign of relief
: - With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the group inside the operations building, main street stands deserted and silent
Nearly deserted, anyway
Moonlight shadows lengthen at one end of the street -- -- and
: - are back in the valley of death, standing amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals
Roland bends down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed  he saw earlier
set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the carcass, down the stream bed
Roland follows them
Ludlow follows Roland
As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the surface of the water
pattern of ripples moves toward them, washing over their ankles
Roland follows the ripples with his eyes
From up head, around the bend, he can hear the sound of an animal eating and drinking
very large animal
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases that on the wind
They float there for a second, suspended, then blow back at him
We're downwind
Good
Roland darts a contemptuous look at him
He puts a finger to his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the shore
Ludlow follows
They creep forward, toward the sounds
They round the bend and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise
Over the rise, he sees the , about a hundred yards ahead
It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking
Like a bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up, to let the water fall down its throat
dozen  are at the water as well, drinking
Roland gently  the safety on his gun to "off
" Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch
As he puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the middle of a small stick, which  in half
Roland turns, eyes blazing
Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as well, staring in the direction of the sound
But since Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's reaction
Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow
Roland turns his head back
The tyrannosaur is gone
, the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly
Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him
Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track
To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock
short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive, green, pebbled boulder ten feet high
Roland frowns and in Ludlow's ear again
We took to the rock
Why
In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night breeze
Roland's eyes widen
He pulls out another pinch of campfire ash and releases it on the wind
This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him
Wind shift
They freeze, terrified
Behind them, the enormous green pebbled boulder -- -- opens an eye
That's no boulder, that's the  , standing rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the surrounding foliage perfectly
Very slowly and almost silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away
Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex, unaware of its presence
Until it exhales
The soft  of its breath isn't quite audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks ever so slightly
Their hearts drop into their stomachs
Ludlow speaks, his voice a queasy
It's
behind
us
(the very softest whisper) It's just fed
It won't attack unless it's threatened
Don't move
As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from these intruders, it breathes again
few strands of Ludlow's hair flap in the exhalation
He closes his eyes, near tears
He can't take it
His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon he holds in his hands
Unfortunately, it's extended in front of him, away from the rex
He risks another
If  don't move,  can't shoot it
Let it go, Peter
The animal won
Behind them, the rex appears satisfied
It starts to swing its massive head around, back toward the jungle
It lifts one great leg and takes a step into the trees
Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved
But Ludlow seizes the opportunity
He whips his weapon around and drops to one knee
(cont'd) The rex is infinitely quicker
Ludlow just has time to squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and
Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down, jaws wide
They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so it is firmly around his midsection
The whole combination of movements takes but half a second
By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still and writhing in its mouth
Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but through the shivering trees, he can only see that the tyrannosaur is gone
: - , , , and
wait nervously in the communications room
An empty can of Dr
Pepper sitting on one of the countertops begins to
They look over at it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can  on the formica counter
Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too
Glass jars against one another, books start to drop off the shelves, a stool shudders across the floor
What's going on
Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into the night
They look up, a deafening  fills the room -- -- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in
As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their heads
- Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles
The roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber, impossible to land open
Below, the  see the  through the torn roof of the building
They wave frantically, their flashlight beams piercing the night sky
There they are
The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with overturned cars and fallen trees
- No  in the street, too much debris
Check the other buildings
The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of the village
At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story building
The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up
- , , ,  and finally
run out the front of the operations building
At the end of the street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over the building, to land on its roof
There it is
Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for the chopper
Again, those strange rock formations are everywhere
Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if they once dripped there and then turned to stone
This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side of a car like solidified lava
Her face falls as a thought occurs to her
Ian
It's guano
What
These formations
They're dried -- Birdshit
jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them
They don't see it
Who cares
Let's go
Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot toward the helicopter
Behind them, the raptor crouches and , but the sound is lost under the  of the helicopter's engines
It springs, covering the distance between them quickly
The animal  into , the last person in the group, and takes him down
Juttson is thrown forward, into the others, who fall like dominoes
Juttson , his voice an unnatural, high-pitched , as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him
Sarah looks up, panicked
Her eyes widen at the sight of a , this one running straight at hr at top speed
She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her hands -- -- and the raptor's foot  into the ground between her legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the first raptor in the kill
Panicked, the group scatters in all directions
Kelly jumps up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the road
Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's gone now
He looks around frantically
Kelly
Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building nearest her
Behind her, a   gives chase, bounding after her with horrifying speed
Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly
The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah, and as she leaps across a leather seat and  a door behind her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an abandoned car
But the car door is thin protection against the charging raptor, which  into the window, head first
The window spinderwebs, but does not yield
The raptor crumples to the ground
Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the web
The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it
Sarah  and the animal forces its entire head through the hole,  its jaws just short of her face
She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso will not fit through the window opening
It pulls away
In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news
There's no windshield
The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws  on the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening -- -- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door
While the raptor struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the nearest building, ducks inside, and  the heavy wooden door
: - races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas station building, closing the door behind him
moment later, a raptor bounds after him,  into the door
Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass window next to the door, and pounces at that
The window and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside, its tail hanging out
Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back out, keeping the place of wall between them
He pulls the Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim -- -- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside, through the door again
Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the window again
- Balancing on the window frame, the raptor  and crouches, ready to spring at Malcolm
Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open between them
He raises the rifle
Th raptor springs into the door,  it off its hinges, knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him
But the door  up against the wall, covering the window, preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way
For the moment
- Malcolm flies through the window and  to the ground
He   in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun
reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to his feet
It's
He drags Malcolm away, but in the commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes
Malcolm scoops them up
Come on
Where's Kelly
She's with Sarah
They race off, down the street
: - High above , we see she is standing alone in a three story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery and other construction projects
Catwalks lined with heavy chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in circles, wondering what to do now
From outside the kiln house, she hears , digging sounds
From the other side of the door comes an animal , and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through the crack along the ground
, the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to tunnel underneath
, Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the ganging tools always and  as it tears at the earth below it
Sarah digs faster
So does the raptor
With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as hard as she can
It snaps off with a loud
At the door, the raptor stops digging
It's silent for a moment
Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now
She starts to lower her body into it -- --    ' Sarah falls back, , leaps to her feet, and jumps up, grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above
She starts to climb, up, anywhere up, as the  now squirms and thrashes its way inside, coming in through her hole
Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to another
The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her
- window in the slanted roof of the kiln house  in a shower of glass as  kicks through it and climbs outside
: - Nick drags a badly limping  down the main street
They can see helicopter at the far end, engine  and searchlight playing over them as they draw closer
They approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the street -- -- and a  leaps on top of it
Its claws  on the roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch
They don't stick around to negotiate
Nick hauls Malcolm off into the nearest building
- and  hurry inside and  the door behind them
They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind, probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to spend the night
The room and staircase wind around a large, open-aired central area four stories tall
They  at each other, frantic
We can't stay in here
We're sure as hell not going back out there" This is single-wall construction
It's just a shack
It'll hold
For sixty seconds, maybe
Look at this
( on the door with his knuckles) You could- With a , the wood  around the lock and the door swings open violently
Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard on the floor
stands  in the doorway
Nick throws his weight against the door
it hard against the raptor
Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back
The raptor charges the door again, this time it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it
The raptor turns and  at Malcolm
Malcolm swings the gun around -- -- the raptor lunges at him -- -- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger -- -- and the raptor lands on top of him
The weight of the animal  him into the floor, but the gun barrel now stands between them
The raptor  down hard on the barrel, its teeth  on the metal, and its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands
Malcolm pulls the trigger
The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart  into the back of its throat
It makes a  sound, then convulses violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his hands as it falls and dies
Nick scrambles out from under the door
Malcolm tries to wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't budge
(helping him out) Head for the roof
have to find Kelly
think she's with Sarah
,
: - remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with fear
She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only two feet from where she's hiding -- -- a '  pick their way past her, down the middle of the street
Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream
: - and  burst onto the roof of the now-burning hotel and  the door behind them
The helicopter is now only three rooftops away
They turn and head for it, Nick in the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings
It's too wide
Nick looks around, desperate
fallen power pole leans against the building they're standing on, its lines gone slack
Help me push this
Malcolm understands
He and Nick throw a shoulder into the pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other direction
One good hard shove and it falls to the far building,  against it solidly
Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to the next
Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across the gap, hand over hand
Behind them, the door of the building  and open as a raptor throws all its weight into it
Malcolm leaps onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling himself across
But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side hesitates
It  and backs away, refusing to come out onto the roof
, Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop
They look back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto the roof, , and backs into the doorway again
It's afraid to come onto the roof
Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop
Strange bits of scrap and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd, concentric pattern
Something's wrong
Look
Sarah
He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance
Malcolm turns, and sees  crawling across the tile
His face turns white
'
: - has problems
Still on top of the kilm house, she reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof of the next building
She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of sloping roof
As she pulls herself up -- -- a  appears on the rooftop behind her
In full stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof ahead of her
Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope, away from the raptor
Suddenly the roof board under her and  under her weight
The whole section pulls up and starts to slide off the roof
Sarah, clinging to it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor
She looks over her shoulder, down -- -- and sees  , waiting for her on the roof of the building below
Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which keeps sliding, falling
The raptor below jumps up, just in time to get  in the head by the falling roof section
Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface
She slides all the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another
The raptor above works its way down
The one below leaps up, at her dangling legs
She has left them in time with its jumps, to avoid losing her feet
This can't go on for long
Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof and hurls it at the raptor below
It hits the animal in the head, for all the good that does
But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles
She edges to the right, toward a fresh supply
The raptor above edges even closer, claws  on the slick roof
Something interesting is happening
As Sarah pulls the loose tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place
Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the way as fast as she can
Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates
The animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid the tumbling tiles
Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building, hugging it as closely as she can
The raptor falls off the roof, right past her -- -- and  into the raptor below
Both animals  and attack one another
Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next to the enraged animals
They fight and roll,
She  and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out of their way -- -- and plunges through a hole in the roof
- Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent light fixture
One end of the fixture's support , it drops at a 45 degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and through a window
- Sarah lands in the mud in the street below
: - With a ,  lands in the mud between two other building, one of which he has just climbed off of
Panicked, he leaps to his feet and starts to
Kelly
: - sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward the building on which sits the helicopter
Above her, she can see  has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her
Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the helicopter building, and starts to climb it
, is still covering underneath the fallen shed
In the distance, she can see the helicopter
But she is trembling with fear, unable to move
The whole shed suddenly  as something heavy hits it outside
Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror is so complex that no sound comes out
She raises her hands in self-defense, whatever's outside  with effort, the entire shed is suddenly  right up off of her, and she looks up -- -- into her father's eyes
Dad
Come on
He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street
, Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms
Where's Kelly
Where's Ian
Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the street below, where they see  and , racing at top speed down the middle of the street -- --
, Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal
They're pretty fast, but it's faster
Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof, and urging them on
They push it, faster
They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed
Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles, pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the next one
Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's much harder
Below them, the raptor springs and  into the struts, shaking the whole structure
It pulls itself up
Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles
She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs on a slight incline up to the roof
She scampers across it, running the balance beam
She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and looks back
Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained, breathing hard
,
Below him, the raptor closes in
Malcolm sets out across the beam, his legs shaking
He places his feet carefully, he doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did
The raptor draws closer
(cont'd) Malcolm slips
One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing, trying to regain his tenuous balance
But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from under him
He falls, the bar  him hard in the chest, knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below
He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor,  to a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably cracking a rib
Kelly  from above him
(cont'd) She stares down in horror at her father
Wrenched in among the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six feet above him now, with an open attack route
The animal  and goes into its pre-attack crouch
Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars
The raptor springs
Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very peak of her trajectory, she lets go
The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it hurtling into space
She lands hard and awkwardly,  into the spidery scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor  to the ground below
But Kelly manages to hold on
She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet
, Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline
The from inside
'  '  '
Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter
But at the opposite side of the roof, a  claws its way over the edge as well
Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the animal is far faster
It's only ten feet away, then five, they're surely done for this time, when -- -- -
There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard, and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across the roof, dead
They look up, to the source of the gunshot
It's , standing at the edge of the roof, holding his smoking
600 Nitro Express
But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the helicopter's left skid  right through the surface of the roof
'
The skid dips even further, ripping right through the thatch-and-wood construction
Kelly, who had one foot in the helicopter, loses her balance -- -- as the roof caves in beneath her
She falls,  , through the hole and down, into the building below
, Kelly lands with a  on the floor immediately below the roof, about nine feet down
But her landing is cushioned by an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been arranged there
She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous substance drips off of it
It's yolk
She looks around, noticing half a dozen large, oblong shapes
Eggs
Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through the wreckage of the , crumbling roof
Kelly
'm coming
Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape is moving
Rising
Unfolding, in a way
'
Yep, flying dinosaur
The enormous animal raises its head, a brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long, saber-like beak
It  at Kelly in fury
She can only stare, spellbound
Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls its massive twenty-two foot wingspread
, the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris
Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and starts kicking at it, making it larger
Give me a ladder
, Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a now appears from the depths of the building, in fury at these invaders who have landed in the middle of their clutch of eggs
An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof
Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other and they start to climb out of the nest
, Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break through the surface of the roof around them
The pteranodons are emerging
The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an abrupt stop
The engines , the chopper just hovers there
We're snagged on something
They loos down
have come out through the hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the helicopter
They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest -- -- and let go
Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly
, the  gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to the helicopter
Hang on
If  tip it hard,  can cut 'em with the rotors
Don't
They're not attacking
They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the chopper gains altitude
(cont'd) They're protecting their nest
That's all
That's all they're doing
Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm, each of whom has a protective arm around her
She sags against her father's chest, nothing left
He holds her tight and  in her ear
Thank you
Kelly, thank God
Thank God for you
, over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude hundred feet
Three hundred
thousand
As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the pteranodons now peel off, their job done
One of them banks sharply, right in front of the moon
The moonlight silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings, lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton
Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of the wine-dark sea
: - Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story , still alive, drops through the air and  to the muddy ground
Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him, he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud
From behind him, he hears a  sound
He turns
He's in the tyrannosaur nest
The   faces him, still with a strange aluminum-foil cast on its leg
The baby  with excitement as it toddles toward him
Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do
Both stand outside the nest, staring down at him
The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away
But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking Ludlow to the ground
Then it raises its head again
Watching
Waiting
Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex strikes, knocking him over again
Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours
The male bends down and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it tightly
Ludlow  -- -- and the rex bits down decisively
The bone breaks with a dry
Ludlow  in pain, unable to move, and the baby toddles forward eagerly
Ludlow can only stare as it leaps up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide

Malcolm's face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white winter setting around him
At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her shoulder
About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair and an honest, open face
She notices Malcolm, recognizes him
She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old
The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming
As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him
Hello, Lex

stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek

My daughter
They nod their hellos

That's real
land gently on the nest
Ever so carefully, it positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting position, and folds its giant wings around its body
(

The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and approvingly up at the heavens
