by Todd Robinson Revised First Draft October 31, 1994 : :     -    1994 Wind on the water
Soaring gulls and sand pipers glide over the pilings and sagging bulkheads
(
) Though  hadn't seen or spoken to Sheldrake in over thirty years, it seemed impossible that his heart was the thing that had finally failed him
- , 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind the wheel
He pulls down a narrow cobble stone street that leads to the wharf
(
) never got close to him, nobody did
But by the time we made Tampa, was sure  knew who he was, that understood what he saw, what nourished his soul and tested his faith
- Chuck stares out across the harbor
In the distance, the echoes of singing masts
Shrouds and canvas softly ping
The small boats of Mystic tug restlessly at their moorings
(
) He had taken us to worship, where, what was for him, the holiest of holies
And, for us too by the end
- Chuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of people
They surround a small building, a neighborhood clinic
worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates the structure
""
, '   ' -  2, 1961 Next to the stone a funeral urn
gropes for meaning
didn't know Richard Sheldrake personally, but his many friends who knew and worked with him, wanted to make sure that he was returned home, here, to be remembered with his beloved wife
Chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice fading away
The afternoon wind is coming up with the tide
He quietly heads towards the water
Drifting, drawn, lost
(
) Though he had moved on with his life, now even for the years, to hear him eulogized by strangers, seemed strange
He had been a hewner of stones, a pilot by the silent stars
Like me, alone among many
But most of all for us, the crew of the brigantine Albatross, he was always and would forever be
our Skipper
'  turns him around
Ding ding
Ding ding beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips into port
picture out of another time, another place
It takes him away
: -   - towering monolith, surrounded by tall oaks and sycamores
The tower is immense
single ladder runs up to the top
Just above the tree tops, the view is spectacular , 16, sits thin and unsteady
Chuck's gaze is drawn upward -- to the building spring cumulus clouds
Chuck's older brother , 18, stout, self assured, pulls himself to the top
You gonna jump
Or are you just having a last look
was just thinking that  never had a new pair of shoes till  was twelve
It's no my fault  was born first
Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff
It's not a vacation, it's private school
thought this was your dream come true
That's not why he's sending me
Why then
Because it looks good
Chuck looks out, yearning
Will considers him, troubled
'm just not like you
Ya know
'm never going to go to Yale
'm never going to be "William"
Nobody says you have to be like me
He does
You don't give him enough credit Chas
Chuck takes a last look at the building clouds
The sky rumbles
Distant thunder
We better go
- Maple street, , tree lined and quaint
The Gieg home is a modest two story house with a covered porch
The family station wagon is poised for departure
, 45, a generally serious man broods as , their mother, 40, soft and thoughtful, exits the house
Chuck and Will appear from the woods
(ticked) You plan on making this plane or not
Don't take any wooden nickels Kemosabe
won't
Will shoves out a hand at Chuck
And lighten up will ya
Chuck hugs him anyway and walks to the passenger side
Charles tosses him the keys, like he's doing him a big favor
- Chuck sits in the drivers seat
Middy is in the back
Charles slams the trunk and gets in
Before Chuck turns the ignition
Now just take it easy
We're not going to a fire
Chuck reacts
Will watches as the car pulls away
- The Giegs drive in silence
Middy reads from a brochure
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War
No,  didn't
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine
think square rigs look so much more romantic
Me too
Appearances aren't everything
Keep your mind on the road
Chuck pulls over to the side of the road
What are you doing
Chuck hands him the keys
don't feel like driving
Okay
Charles regards him oddly
- The National Airlines Boeing 707 is bigger than anything Chuck has ever seen
Passengers begin boarding
Charles stands away, detached
Do you have your ticket
Yes
Passport
Look,  just better go
Middy hugs her son
Goodbye Mom
'll be okay
know you will
Chuck faces his dad
Make us proud
Yes sir
Charles extends his hand
They shake
Then Chuck hurries away into the crowd
Charles and Middy watch until he is out of sight
- Chuck settles into his seat next to the window
He watches as the world slips away beneath the wings of the 707
-  - Another world
Chuck stands in line at the customs booth
He cranes his neck to see the brilliant blue water and coral reefs beyond the runway
Three other boys are ahead of him in line
The go through every piece of luggage
, 16, thin and blonde, is in a heated argument with one of the agents about his spear gun
, 17, wise-cracking and confident, shakes his head, smiling
He spots Chuck, moves through the line and shoves out a hand
Albatross
Yeah
Rick March
Who the hell are you
Gieg, Chuck
Look, meet us out front when you're through
If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat
Whatever
One of the agent starts pulling things out of Rick's duffel bag
He finds a dive knife
Hey, hey
That's my stuff
-  - The car whizzes through the narrow streets of Bermuda
sings from the radio
The streets are lined with small coral houses and exotic palms
- The boys are jammed inside with their things
In addition to Chuck, Rick and Tod, is  , also sixteen
Well Ricky boy, spear gun or no, it's sweet to be back in the world of rum and honey
gotta admit  never thought you'd be back after the great "Bowsprit Affair"
Me and Skipper had a meeting of the minds
How's that
begged
(warming a little) What the "Bowsprit Affair"
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit
Not just any 'local' girl
The 'local' mayor's 'local' daughter
Tod smiles, reminiscing
Thing is, the net in the basket isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o wraps them up in the jib
After the deed was done
He says they did the deed
Trust me, we did the deed
After the "alleged" deed was done, they fell asleep
Big Daddy Lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears Casanova sawing logs
Believe me,  needed the rest
He gets the whole crew on deck, gets us on the halyard, and orders the old "heave ho
"
Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o and the mayor's daughter, naked as pilot whales
(to Tod) don't know who was more surprised, you or Big Daddy
To tell you the truth,  think it was her father
At the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view
Well gentlemen, there she is
The cab stops
Besides many colorful fishing boats, is the
At ninety-two feet, she dwarfs everything in the harbor
Her white hull glows like ivory and her twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck
Breathtaking
Home sweet hell on the water
- The boys pile out of the taxi
What seemed like a pristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up close
The white paint is streaked and barnacles cover the hull
Looks of disappointment
What happened to it
voice from behind turns Chuck
She cleans up
We'll have her ship shape before we shove off
This is  , 15, removed, the youngest of the crew and
first mate
Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on the back and climbs aboard
He is greeted by a Viking giant of a man, , 37, and bearded, the ship's English professor
Puffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at Tod and the others
He speaks with the voice of Moses
"That this same child of honor and renown, This gallant Hotspur, this all praised knight, And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet
For every honor sitting on his helm, Would they were multitudes, and on my head
My shames redoubled
For the time will come
Chuck feels something and looks up where he meets the intense stare of a man standing between the deck cabins
Their eyes lock
That  shall make this northern youth exchange, his glorious deeds for my indignities
" Then, the man is gone
Haunting
Only Chuck has seen him
Tod smiles back at Lawford impishly
Would you be addressing me, sir
would
What's that supposed to mean
(beat) Henry the  part  Act  Scene ii
suggest you read it
Lawford sneers and walks away
It's all a show
It means Shakespeare
-o-r-i-n-g
It means if he catches anybody basket-napping on watch this passage, he's gonna use their lizard for 'cuda' bait
(lightly) Well that's a hell of a how-do-you- do
Drop your gear, go below and pick yourself some bunks
Chuck and the others climb aboard
- Chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main cabin
Other crew members are already unpacking
The sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of bunks on each side of the cabin
In the middle of the room is a gimbaled table
This is where the crew will eat and study
Listen up
This is Chuck Gieg
Among the crew -- feature  , 16, a cherub with soft puffy cheeks and  , 17, skinny and rodent-like
Robin approaches with a hand extended
He carries a 8x10 photo of a young man in a football uniform
'm Robin
Chuck regards the photo
(flat) That's my brother
He's dead
Apprehensively Chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk
Robin tacks up the picture above his bunk
Terry unpacks in front of one of the lower berths
loud "
" turns everyone around
duffel bag lies at the bottom of the companionway
large imposing figure climbs into the cabin
This is  , 17, over six feet, big and broad
His hair is slicked back "Dean" style and wears a full day's growth of bread on his face
Compared to the others, he looks all man
Everybody clears from his path
He stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk) and drops his bag
'll take this one
You probably didn't notice, but this bunk has been taken
John just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's things onto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it into the remaining upper berth
Terry watches, intimidated
Anybody gotta problem with that
(beat) Absolutely not
John climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes
Bill enters, followed by several adults
, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is ship's surgeon and Skipper's wife
Lawford appears with , 30's from Brazil, dark, and fit
Alright, listen up
This is Dr
Alice Sheldrake
The guys stumble over only half listening
'm ship's surgeon
'm in charge of aches, pains, biology, math and science
George Pascal here is ship's cook
If you want to keep all your fingers, stay the hell out of my galley unless you're invited
Some of you already know Mr
Lawford
have been charged with the dubious task of insuring your literary education
Lawford puts a hand on Bill's shoulder
Bill Butler is your first mate
But don't let his size fool you
Bill gives a half reluctant wave
So when the hell do we get to meet El Capitan
Snickering
(aside) Maybe he's getting his wooden leg waxed
Laughter
sound stops the laughter
Almost on cue, the sound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above them
Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking the light
Ominous
They all notice and look up
(mysterious) You'll meet him
Soon enough
- Dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin
The only sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber
Suddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway
(
) Arise, Arise, Arise
Chuck wakes, disoriented
Terry bolts upright and hits his head on the low ceiling
Ouch
Tod, Rick and Charlie are up instantly
Lawford's voice echoes through the ship
(
) Exultation is the going/ Of an inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/ Past the headlands/ Into deep Eternity/ Bred as we, among the mountains/ Can the sailor understand/ the divine intoxication/ of the first league out from land
(pause) But  suppose we'll answer that question soon enough gentlemen
Soon enough
What question
Chuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words
Robin swings his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look
John rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head
(foggy) What the hell is going on
Maybe it's an air raid
In crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler steps through the aft bulkhead
He raises a bowswain's  whistle and blows
Chuck and Robin grab their ears
It's a nightmare
Terry jumps and hits his head again
Roll out sailors
All hands on deck
Sixty seconds
Sixty seconds
He blows the whistle again
This time it brings even John to his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage
Bill looks up and casually notices him
You gotta problem Goodall
You blow that thing again 'll shove it so far up your ass, you're gonna need dental floss to get it out
Just get on deck
Bill turns and disappears topside
- The sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crew staggers onto the deck, shirtless and shivering
Line up
Single file
Single file
The crew lines up
John is the last one through the hatch and he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed
Everybody swims
The boys are aghast
Don't think people, just go
Go, Go, Go, Go, Go
Swim you win, stay you pay
Rick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by Tod and Charlie
They howl and scream as they hit the water
The rest follow like lemmings
But John stands defiantly with his arms folded
Now what's the problem, Goodall
Everybody swims
The crew are piling back on deck
George stands in the open galley door
The smell of fresh bacon is intoxicating
don't
You will if you wanna eat
Right George
George nods, wielding a butchers knife
The crew stand shivering, waiting on John
(to Bill) You gonna swim for your breakfast
Bill gives John a long look then strips to his shorts, swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard arm
He looks down at the water some twenty-five feet below
It's a long way
Robin turns away
Lawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor
"Down, down beneath the deep, That oft in triumph bore him, He sleeps a sound and peaceful sleep, With the salt waves dashing over him
" -- Lord Byron gentlemen
With that Bill leaps and hits the water with a huge He swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself up and gets in John's face
Everybody swims
Now, 've been in twice
So  guess 'll be eating your breakfast too
John considers him, then strips off his shirt
But instead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into the ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down
He manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of ratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard arm -- the topgallant
It's a pissing contest and everybody knows it
got five bucks says he doesn't
got five that says he doesn't live
'll take a dollar of that
This is crazy
Robin refuses to watch
The others share a look
John makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the end of the yard
He tosses a look towards Bill but with no way to back down, he launches into the air
Everyone gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive
Falling, falling, falling
Jesus
can't watch this
John hits the water like a bullet
The crew run to the side waiting for him to come up
Nothing
Finally, he breaks the surface
Easy
He climbs up waiting, somehow, to claim victory
Suddenly, they all feel it
presence
He has appeared silently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to see him
, (), ageless and windswept, casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and glides to the deck
He is powerfully built and bronzed from the sea and sun
He carriers the burden of command like a cross
Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be reckoned with
The crew know they are in the presence of someone larger than life
Skipper on deck
The crew line up clumsily
Skipper has a gaze that blazes right through them
He looks out to sea
Searching, ominous
He waits until the silence is filled with everyone's attention
You know what's out there
Wind and wave and rain
Endless glassy pools that'll hold a sailing ship for weeks and then spit her out into the eye of the kind of hurricane blow that could knock the bridge off a battleship
Reefs and rocks and sandbars that'll tear the belly from her and enough fog and night to hide it all
He spits into the water
The crew sheepishly throw glances to the horizon
So look out there
and explain to me why any man in possession of any sense at all, would take on the sea with sail
Skipper turns his gaze back to the boys
There is a fire in his eyes
Nobody dare answers
Because there's something else out there
It beckons in the wind and sings in the shrouds
Voices
Whispering
His ear to the wind
They're voices of men
Calling
Men you don't even know
Men you can't even imagine
It's a seed, a wish, that part of you and  that aches to be alive, that was banished by everything we've ever been taught or told
It's a part of us that can only be found on mountain tops and deserts, in the deepest caverns, smoking battle fields and
across oceans
He turns back to the sea, dark
Out there, is where it all waits
(
) He was everything  had expected, part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh
He spoke in whispers and answered all queries with efficiency and directness
He had gone to sea for the first time at fifteen, the same age as Bill Butler
And as he looked upon us that first day it must have been as though he were staring into a mirror
Skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the chart house
He pats a small brass sign that is welded to the main mast and reads the inscription
(reading) "Where we go one, we go all
" With that, he disappears below
Nobody moves
This is exactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits the fan
This -- is gonna be a long eight months
- The boys devour a hearty breakfast
Tod is the 'galley slave' and fills glasses with orange juice
Chow down boys
The milk and eggs are the first things to go once we put out
John enters balancing two plates heaped with food
You know we gotta dumbwaiter for that
John looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall
Not that one
Tod-o here
The guys groan
Har, har, har
John approaches the full table, glaring down at Terry who doesn't notice him
Finally he looks up, startled
'm done
'm finished
He scrambles to get up and clear his plate
John sits down without a word
The others notice the two plates of food
Hungry, Goodall
He just grunts and starts eating
Robin watches him
What's your problem
Why'd you jump
Because  felt like it
(sharp) What do you care
(aside) couldn't do it
Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know
Robin bristles
Screw you
He's right
It was a stupid stunt
Excuse me
You heard me
John grabs Charlie by his private parts and hoists him into the air
Charlie gasps, the air sucked from his lungs
Don't ever call me stupid
Come on, he didn't mean anything
John shoves Robin to the floor with his free arm
Let me tell you girls something do what  wanna do
When  wanna do it
And  don't give a shit what old Ahab up there thinks either
Any questions
John releases Charlie who crumples to the floor
John resumes eating
Bill enters and reads the duty roster
Okay, here's the duty
Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint
Corry and Stricklin have the brass
Robinson, you're the Galley slave
March you're on chain gang with Barnes
Johnston, solo on bilge detail
Butler, what'd  ever do to you
You came back, Tod
You came back
John continues to eat
When he realizes his name hasn't been called, he looks up to meet Bill's eyes
Pissed, John tries to figure out the head
Pumps going in, pumps going out
(
) We were all thirteen individuals
We'd arrived the sum total of our limited experiences and the result of our parents' best, if not narrow, expectations
John pulls back on the lever, belching "water de le toilet" all over him
- Chuck sits in a bowswain's chair over the side, with a paint roller in his hand
The rust-streaked hull is being transformed
(
) Some of us were there for discipline, some for escape
But could see a small piece of myself in all of them and though  fought the notion, for me,  knew now, this would be home
crackles in the b
g
"President Eisenhower today acknowledged that a secret American spy plane was in fact shot down over the Soviet Union
The pilot has been confirmed as Francis Gary Powers
" Robin, Terry and Mike, are on the deck within earshot of Chuck with chisels and wire brushes chipping away at the rust
Why couldn't it have been a wooden boat
Steel boats don't leak
Mike lights up a cigarette
Robin notices
Marlboro's
Hey, can  have one
Mike sizes up Robin for a moment then tosses him the pack
Thanks daddy-o
Robin lights up, grimacing with the first drag
Well, don't brush too hard
Looks to me like the only thing holding this bucket together is the rust
voice booms up from the dock
(
) Ahoy there
They turn
Standing on the dock is  , self important and overbearing, with his son, , who looks as if this whole ordeal is some kind of punishment
Skipper appears
Good afternoon
Francis boards without being invited
Philip follows in his shadow
He scrutinizes the condition of the boat
Albatross
Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen
It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on
It's very bad luck if you kill one
And dolphins too
The boys chuckle
'm Francis Boutillier
This is my son, Philip
know
Francis looks the Skipper over, reading him, smiling
You're a day late
We keep a schedule aboard ship
Lives depend on it
(to Philip) Hello, Philip
Sir
Skipper's directness bugs Francis
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October
As you can see, there's a lot to do
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind
This is a working ship
Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her
Had we been ready,  can assure you we would have sailed
Something in this exchange turns the tone of conversation
And  would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here
Happily, it all worked out
This time
(to Bill) Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk
Phil follows Bill down the companionway
'll be frank with you
This was his mother's idea
romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me
It will be more than that,  can promise you
(cool) Take good care of my son
There is threat in his tone
We'll do our best
You're welcome to say goodbye
He's a big boy
Francis leaves the boat
Skipper and the crew watch as he climbs into his waiting embassy limousine and drives off
Well, that was neighborly
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly
Lawford shakes his head
Bill comes up through the companionway
Everyone aboard young Bill
Yes, Sir
Good
(beat) Let's go sailing
-   - The Albatross is under full power
There is a sense of excitement and anticipation
Charlie, Rick, Robin, and Lawford are on the halyard for the mainsail
Skipper is at the helm with Alice and Bill nearby
Skipper calls over to Chuck who stands alone at the rail
Come over here and take the wheel
Chuck's eyes light up as he walks over and takes the wheel
Hold her steady into the wind
Southwest by west
Yes sir
(to all) Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out
want to know that you've heard and understand
(quietly to Bill) Raise the mainsail
(calling out) Raise the main
Lawford and his group bellow out
Raise the main
Lawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top the chart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy furled canvas to the main boom
He guides another to the midships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the huge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin
He loosens the halyard and hands it to Robin
Take a turn under the pin and lead it out to the others
You guys in the rear take up the slack
Heave together now
In a beautiful tenor voice, Bill begins to croon a sea chanty, an old whaling song with an Irish lilt
(singing) "When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup
" The more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the beat
"When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup
" Come on the rest of you, sing
Belt it out like men
The newer guys like Chuck, John, Robin and Terry look at each other like this is the queerest thing they have ever heard of
(singing) "Not one of us was a sober
" The boys return the verse half heartedly
Lawford ties off his line and stares them down
Skipper notices that the work has stopped
What's wrong Mr
Lawford
It seems we're short on singers
Skipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew
Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer gentlemen
It lets everyone know you're in sync
It shows unity, that all thoughts are one
crew that sings together stays together
Besides,  like it
So, pipe up and be sailors
(in a whisper) Everybody swims, everybody sings
What's next
Tap dancing
Lawford and Rick leap up onto the line pulling it down with their body weight
They sing out the chorus
The crew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great mainsail starts to rise
Tie it off
(to Bill) Outer
Outer Jib
(confused) Outta what
Coached by Tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoist the jib
(to Bill) We'll bear off to port and run down wind
Mr
Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet
Rick, get on the jib sheet
George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse
George will show you what to do
Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines
Forecourse first
work upward
The newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect
George, John and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto the footropes
It's unsteady work and there's confusion everywhere
But through it all, they continue to sing
Lawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the others move into their positions
When Bill sees the yardarm crew is in place
Unstop the squares
Unstop the squares
(to Chuck) Fall off to port
Ease her around to a heading of northeast
Sing out when you're there
As the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into a scalloped pattern
As the bow falls off the wind the snapping main and jib billow
Stiffening to the wind, the ship heels and surges forward
Before her awakening power, everyone changes their stance and grabs for a handhold
Lawford slowly pays out the mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines releasing the stops on the other squaresails
(in a whisper) Ah
Northeast
sir
(barking) Speak up boy
Chuck jumps, startled
He self-consciously calls out
Northeast sir
Unfurl the squares
Tod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending a shudder through the rig
The bow's wake sizzles with the added surge
As each of the squares fall, Alice and Lawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's position
Chuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty of the canvas that the Albatross carries
Raise the inner jib
Raise the forestaysail
Watch the tell-tales Chuck
If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water
Yes, sir
All stop on the engine
All stop on the engine
Bill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and moves it to the stop position
Behold gentlemen
The power of the wind
As the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed
Everyone stops and looks up
The vessel heels and with a powerful surge, launches into the waves
White foam splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through the water
Chuck's face is full of wonder
It is a magical moment
Then the crew begins to cheer
Did we lose anybody
Not yet
The Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful image of another time
And yet, here she is
Each of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment
Music builds
Chart us a course for the windward side
Alice considers his request
That low passed through last night
May be a little bumpy out there
It's time these boys saw some real blue water
- The bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a fifteen foot swell
The sky is clear but the wind is fierce
In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and sailing well
The crew has never seen mountains of water like this
Disaster seems imminent
Bill has assembled them in front of the wheel house
They are all holding on for dear life
Even John seems shaken
Skipper magically stands effortlessly before them on the rolling deck
He remains perfectly dry
Well
now that  have your undivided attention
'd like to take this opportunity to make a few points
(aside) This guy is certifiable
Suicidal
The first thing is  don't like people talking when 'm talking so the two of you, shut up
Caught, Terry and Phil button up
Second, the next one of you who doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr
Butler gives an order is gonna spend the rest of this trip scrubbing bilges
He's a better sailor today than any ten of you will be when this is all over
Skipper directs the next comment directly at John
And if  catch anybody, ever, jumping off a yard arm again  will personally break what bones are left and send you home in a wheel chair
wave explodes over the bow
wall of water crashes over the deck knocking down several of the boys
Terry can't take it anymore and explodes
We're gonna die
We're all gonna die
He lunges at Skipper but Lawford one arms him
Excellent point
As you might have noticed, being out here pretty much puts you in the moment
If you panic, if you lose your head, you die
Maybe you take your mates with you
How'd you like to have to bet on Terry here getting us home today
Each one of you is responsible for the rest
"Where we go one, we go all"
If your buddy is asleep at the switch we're all fish food
He's making his point which is lost on no one
The ship beneath you is not a toy and sailing is not a game
The Albatross will take us far gentlemen, but she demands constant attention
Respect her, and we'll do fine
Oh, and one more thing
There is nothing that goes on, on this boat that  don't know about
She speaks to me in the night
So don't test me
Not even a little
Skipper walks over and puts an arm around Terry who is fighting sobs
Nothing like experience to put things in perspective
Huh son
(to Bill) Alright
Let's go home
- Lawford addresses some of the crew
Chuck, Robin and John are among them
John glares at Lawford
The guys giggle
That's not a satisfactory answer
Look, save it for somebody else will ya
This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me
Lawford pauses for a moment and then explodes theatrically
Shit
He slams a text book into John's hands
Read for me please the words of Mr
Keats at the bottom of the page
John stares back, simmering
Robin interrupts the potential confrontation and reaches for the book
'll read it
mean  don't mind
Shut up donut
John pushes Robin's hands away and studies the page for a moment
He begins reading but struggles with the cadence
(reading) Much have  traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have  been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had  been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne
You know what he is talking about here
Blank faces
(ranting) Awe
Humility
He's telling you that he has traveled the seas as Homer did
As Ulysses had before him as he tried to find his way home to Ithaca after the Trojan Wars
"That deep browed Homer"
He points to his head
Brilliant, seasoned, wise, of the mind; "
ruled as his demesne
" He commands the voyage of the imagination, like a god
(pause) That is what one of the greatest literary minds of modern times, Mr
Boutillier, has to say about Homer
He snatches the book back
You think the Odyssey is dull
'll tell you something, it's about each one of you -- right now
Doubt and expectation
Friendship, community, self sacrifice and accountability
He holds up the text
This isn't just a story
It's history made allegory
It is a philosophical handbook for life
It holds the secret of this very voyage
What is it
the secret
Lawford breaks into a huge belly laugh
(confused) What
If it were only that simple, my young friend
Read on, gentlemen
Read on
-  - Aerial shot
The Albatross is under full sail leaving Bermuda for the last time
(
) And so it was the Albatross that took to the open sea with the wind in her snapping canvas and a bone of white foam in her teeth
In each of us were feelings of anticipation and hesitation for the man at the wheel and of the unfamiliar world he was leading us into
She crashes through the surf -- driving, majestic music, building
- The crew hauls in the line, raising the mainsail
Chuck struggles to coil the rope as fast as it is coming in
The crew take turns racing up the ratlines into the rigging
The crew pull down the jib trying to furl it
Most of the sail ends up dragging in the water
The squaresails are dropped simultaneously
White foam boils from the bow of the Albatross as she crashes through the waves
Alice smiles and puts her arms around Skipper's waist
It's coming together
- Skipper stands at the rail, looking out
The seas are up and the masts are pitching widely from side to side
Chuck is high above the deck in the footropes, wrestling with one of the squaresails
The pitching mast catches him by surprise and he slips
He tumbles down, tangled in the lines
rope wraps around his neck, choking him
Robin looks up and sees him hanging helplessly
Bill
Skipper
Robin freezes
Skipper leaps into the rigging like a spider and, in a few seconds, wrestles Chuck free and carries him down to the deck
Chuck coughs, catching his breath
The color is gone from Skipper's face
This was a close call
You all right
It was my fault
slipped
Alice examines Chuck, making sure he's okay
Skipper turns to Robin, who is shaken
He never raises his voice
Why didn't you go up there
Robin stands silently
Speak up
Still nothing from Robin
He's afraid to climb
What
(to Robin) Is that true
Robin looks away
Why wasn't  made aware of this Bill
didn't know sir
It's your job to know
If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not
Skipper returns his gaze to Robin, measuring him
Finally
Swing up, son
(trembling) What
Up you go
Right now
Robin reluctantly pulls himself up onto the first rung, then the second
He stops and steals a peek up
The mast is swaying
He freezes, his lip starts to tremble
All eyes are on him
Phil chuckles
Do you have something to say
(smug) No
Then keep your mouth shut
Phil backs off, stunned
Robin can't move
(to Robin) What's it going to be
'm sorry
Sorry won't cut it
Robin holds on frozen
Skipper turns to the crew
Survival means discipline and assimilation
There are no special cases here
(to Robin) Now, get going
Get up there
Humiliated, a tear slips down his face
Excruciating
What are you blubbering about
don't know
Skipper jumps onto the backside of the ratlines
His face is but inches from Robin's
One hand in front of the other son
We'll do it together
Robin reaches for the next rung
He looks down
Skipper growls at him
Don't look down
Look in my eyes
Climb
We'll do it together
(sobbing) can't
You climb damn it, or so help me 'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there
Aaauuuhhh
Skipper gets right in his face and snarls
Are you hating this
Are you
hate you, you son of a bitch
No
Hate the fear inside of you
Climb like a man mister
Hate it
Hate it away
Hate your way up one more rung
Do it right now
With every ounce of strength, Robin reaches for one more rung screaming as he reaches
Skipper climbs and screams with him
Auuuggghhh
Robin clutches the rung with a death grip
Then, he looks down
His bladder releases
Hot urine runs down his legs and splashes, steaming, onto the deck
The crew is horrified
Robin weeps
Oh, god
Skipper backs off
Don't hate yourself
Hate your weakness
All right
Get down
Robin climbs to the deck and falls in with the others, mortified
'm only gonna say this one time
'm not here to wipe noses and asses
'm not your mother
Trust funds and blue blazers don't get you a thing out here
You wanna act like babies, then get off my boat
Stunned, the crew is speechless
Chuck instinctively goes to help Robin
Skipper snaps like a turtle
(to Chuck) He can take care of himself
(to others) Any other 'phobias'  need to know about
Skipper fires a look towards Phil
No, sir
Excellent
Bill, find Mr
Weathers a position to suit his condition
Skipper turns and then stops
Remember something, sooner or later
we all have to face it
(aside) Face what
The question hangs in the air like a cloud
- The chart house is the communication and navigation center for the boat
It also serves as the officers dining room
Skipper, Alice, Lawford, George, and Bill Butler sit around the small table sipping coffee
We're awfully quiet tonight
The group remains silent
Lawford and George exchange a glance
Skipper catches it
Something on your mind, George
George looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin
think you were too hard on Weathers
You do
Yes
do
Skipper nods
need to know what 'm working with; what their boundaries are
Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours
We've got to bring them together
Make them a crew
We're as strong as our weakest link and  don't want to find that out the hard way
So, will challenge them and they will come together
(sarcastic) Yes sir
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing
It's all my responsibility
So 'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and 'll stay out of your galley
We'll get along that way
Everyone's quiet, but clear
Skipper and Alice exit
Fucking bastard
Lawford lets out a belly laugh
've seen him snatch the tail of the tempest and stuff it, screaming, into a bottle
The bilges are full of them
What do you mean
He's been beyond the reach
To the edge of the abyss and back
He'll do well by us all George
He's a real salt
There's no malice in him and there's nothing more dear to him than his boys
So sleep well my friend
Lawford seductively produces a pair of Havana cigars, passes one to George and winks
- Robin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watching through the cabin window, as the sun slips below the horizon
Chuck stands in the doorway with a plate of food
How ya doing
(without turning) Fine
Good
Look,  appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, can take care of myself
just brought you something to eat
Robin turns and notices the plate of food and nods
They stand silently
It's awkward
feel like  got you into this
Forget it
'm used to spending a lot of time alone
guess that's what thought it would be out here
But, it's not is it
(beat) 'm sorry  left you hanging up there
It doesn't matter
Really
'm just sorry you got chewed out
Robin nods
They both stare out at the rising moon
My brother and  used to climb to the top of this old beech tree in the back yard and watch the moon come up just like this
My parents would fight all the time so we'd sneak out there where we couldn't hear 'em and recite scenes from our favorite movies
Robin grows quiet
Would you believe  miss it
The middle of paradise and 'm homesick
Chuck smiles and puts a hand on his back
(ironic) Well,  wouldn't worry
It'll all be there when we get back
- The sky is dark and a storm is building and the boat rolls and pitches
Chuck sees Terry heaving over the side
John and Tod hear the sound and turn
(disgusted) Come on man
Show a little backbone
(to Tod) You believe that
Tod is fixated on Terry
Suddenly, without warning, he breaks for the rail and lets fly
Phil and Charlie are next
Chris climbs through the companionway but doesn't make it to the side
Spontaneous regurgitation
Bill and Lawford jump up onto the wheel housing to avoid being sprayed
Suddenly everyone is heaving
Sorry
(to Bill) We're gonna have nobody left up here to crew
Better let Skipper know
Bill nods and disappears
John joins Chuck watching the events around him
Well Gieg, 'm glad to see 'm not the only guy on this boat that can take a little rock'n roll
Bunch of wusses,  swear
Chuck watches each of his shipmates
Then, suddenly, out of nowhere -- Projectile vomit all over John
He looks at Chuck, horrified, then he too, cuts loose over the rail
Son of a bitch
Chuck looks at John, furious with himself, and begins to laugh
But after a moment he starts to laugh too
It's infectious, they crack each other up
Then, in the middle of belly laughing, they simultaneously retch again over the side
'  - Skipper sits at his desk with some charts spread out in front of him
There's a knock on the door
Come in
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side
Well, that's all part of it
We've got weather moving in from the west
Skipper looks up
That's part of it, too
- Skipper stands at the wheelhouse with Lawford, George and Bill, studying the horizon through binoculars
Dark clouds
Chuck watches Skipper
Everyone, looking for a cue
That a
storm, Skipper
Skipper stays glued to the binoculars
Uh, huh
Would you, um, say it's a big storm
Sometimes it gets exciting out here
What do you think
Barometer's dropping
The first blow'll come from the south
Might get interesting
Shouldn't we turn away
You can't run from the wind son
You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall
Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight
Close on hatches and skylights slamming closed and cinched tight
Bulkhead doors are closed and cranked down tightly
Pots and pans crash around
The cabin doors on the bookcase swing open and dump books on top of Alice
She turns and looks at the mess, annoyed
- Furl the squares, reef the main, and bend on the storm jib, but keep it furled
Drop everything but the inner jib
want everybody down before we get any lightning
Bill bolts forward with Lawford barking orders
Most of the crew are still ill, but climb into the rigging and begin dropping sail
Why's it always happen at night
Skipper regards George, annoyed
George
want hot food in everybody
Get to it
George returns to the galley
Alice joins Skipper at the wheelhouse handing him foul-weather gear
Looks like weather
Yep
He slips on a yellow slicker
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down  want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear
(to the others) Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch
Everyone else hit the racks
(impulsively) 'm not staying out here
Skipper fires off a look that frightens even Phil
No
That's for sure
Charlie, take his place
Phil goes below, a little ashamed
The crew scatters
Chuck, still at the wheel, pipes up
If it's all the same, 'd like to stay on deck
Skipper regards Chuck, who looks back with both fear and eagerness
Suddenly he sees something in this kid
Maybe himself
He almost smiles
Almost
Take the wheel
- Dark clouds blot out the sky and stars
Thunder rumbles far away
The seas have built but there's no wind
yet
With no steerage, the ship is tossed
Tod hangs high above the heaving deck continuing to furl
The mast swings from side to side, but the air has gone dead calm
Skipper looks up, anticipating
Everyone out of the rigging
Everybody down
(shouting) The crew in the rigging scamper down to the safety of the deck
Bill, on the wheel with Chuck
Bill joins Chuck and takes hold of the wheel
Then it hits
wall of torrential rain drums the deck amid a tympany of thunder and flashing lightning
The bow explodes through twelve foot swells
This is what the Albatross was born to do
- It's all the crew can do to stay in their bunks
Pots crash, books and personals go flying
The guys are scared
The main and jib sheets tighten
Skipper looks at Chuck and Bill
It all comes down to moments like these and he loves it
Suddenly, there is a loud
violent flapping noise
Skipper leaps to the port and looks forward
Tod comes running back
We blew the inner
'll go
Bring it down and run up the storm jib
We'll fix it later
Stay out of reach of the blocks
Tod and Alice disappear
(with a twinkle) Well, we're in it now
Chuck studies him, frightened, but reassured
- The shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind
The block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it
No one dares go near it
For a moment, it seems to hang there seductively
John, naive of its power, leaps for the rail and grabs it
Suddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling John high off the deck and over the side
He holds on for dear life, screaming
(to Chuck) Hold her steady
Skipper bolts forward
Alice uncleats the jib halyard, leaving one turn on the pin and shoves it into Tod's hands
Release this when  tell you
Skipper joins Tod as Alice scrambles along the deck and pulls herself into the bowsprit netting
When the block and jib swing inboard, she grabs for the leach of the sail yelling
As John is snapped inboard Alice leaps up, grabbing the sail, leaning out over the open water
Waves explode through the netting
As Tod releases the halyard, John falls to the deck, bruised, humbled, but alive
Lawford and Skipper pull Alice from the bowsprit
Skipper looks her over
Relieved
No broken bones
Good work
But then this is what he expects
He respects her and now, everyone can see why
He looks at John sprawled on the deck
Be careful will ya
What ever you say Cap
Let's get that storm jib up
Skipper gives Alice a private look, then returns to the stern where Chuck holds tightly onto the wheel
(
) The storm lasted sixteen hours and it set us all on equal footing
It was the first time that we shared an episode on an even plane
As we stood our watches we were equally out of control of our situation, regardless of our physical abilities or social backgrounds
And though our real feelings lay hidden beneath bravado and defiance, we were no longer strangers
- The crew is cleaning up
Alice supervises repairs to the jib while others stow line, scrub the deck and chip paint
Lawford paces
You know what they say in the Navy don't you
What's that, Big Daddy
The more experienced crew members have heard this all before
"If it moves, salute it
If it doesn't move, pick it up
If it's too big to pick up, paint it
" The boys mockingly salute Lawford as he walks by
John stands before a porthole combing his Brylcreem hair into a "
" Mike and Chris climb on deck with several large boxes
Ladies, gentlemen and hermaphrodites, Mr
Corry and  are happy to announce the grand opening of Trans-Border Enterprises
They start opening the boxes
One is a case of Coca Cola, another is full of cigarettes and candy
All of the creature comforts and vices you could possibly want, at home or abroad, available twenty- four hours a day
For a price, of course
If you've got "a broad" available 'll take her
Like you'd know what to do with one
The crew shakes their heads, mutter and check out the goods
You got Marlboro's
Absa-fuckin-lutely
Toss me a Cola
Fifty cents
What
Contraband's hard to come by out here son
John is still grooming at the window
Hey Goodall, you got a date or something
John continues to comb
Yeah
With your mom
Oooooooo
Phil slinks away
We also have a few rental items
Chris displays a Playboy magazine
Everybody clamors to get a look
There's a penalty for any material returned to the Trans-Border Library with sticky pages
John walks by, snatches the magazine and heads for his bunk flipping through the pages
Hey, you can't do that
(to Chris) He can't do that
John flops in a deck chair
Chris shakes his head and starts closing up the boxes
Sure he can
- Chuck sits alone, away from the others, reading
On cue, half of the crew descend, dragging him kicking and screaming into the bowswain's chair, and over the side
The guys cheer
Come on you guys, this isn't funny
The seat spins, twists and swings from behind the boat
Come on Chucky
Show us a little grit
They lower the chair so it glides just above the surface
When the boat noses into a swell Chuck gets quite a ride
Once he has the hang of it, fear turns to elation
Okay, who's next
You gotta be kidding
He's a human chum line
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you
Chuck's hauled back in and Terry pushes his way to the front of the line
'm next
Terry goes over the side
Once he gets the hang of it, he gets into it
He maneuvers the chair like a plane, forcing himself deep into the waves and then blasting back to the surface
Robin is trolling
The line takes a tremendous hit and Robin's reel screams
Tod is at the wheel and turns
There she blows
Two hundred feet out something large and pissed has taken the bait
The crew turn and look
Skipper looks out at Terry still in the bowswain's chair
Get him in
Bill waves at Terry to come on in
Come on in
Terry waves him off and disappears back under the waves
They can't pull him up while he's going under the water
Do it now Bill
Terry pops up, pissed that they're reeling him back in
Suddenly the animal on the other end of Robin's line explodes out of the sea
It's a six foot Thresher shark
Terry sees it too and freaks, suddenly thrashing and screaming
Get me out
Get me out
Oh my god
It's a
(calmly) Shark
(to Robin) Don't lose it son
George grabs a gaffing hook while Robin fights the rod, trying to bring in the big fish
Keep it coming
Robin battles the fish
George clumsily tries to help
The crew make their way to the rear to watch
Whoops
Charlie and Rick and the others heave to get Terry up
Finally he makes it
Sprawling onto the deck
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus Christ
The crew turn and cheer Robin on as he brings the shark alongside
He must be two hundred pounds
Bring him in close and try to hold him steady
George leans out over the rail, trying to get the hook into a gill
Several of the boys hold onto him as the fish flops around violently
Got him
Skipper comes down to inspect the catch
The shark is longer than Terry is tall and thrashes in the the water, snapping and twisting
Terry stands shaking, freaked
All of them are
Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister Mary Anne's butt
The guys laugh nervously
Terry just stares at the man eater, but it's infectious
After a moment he's laughing too
Skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile
Well, now you have something to write home about
More laughter
Suddenly, Tom, who is lookout on the foretop, cries out
Land ho
Land ho
Everyone turns around to look
The guys at the stern let go of George and he nearly tumbles overboard
In that instant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears back into the sea
Robin and George share a stunned look
Shit
There's more where that came from
Skipper returns to the wheelhouse with Alice
Together they scan the horizon
Clouds build over the land ahead
Cheated death again
He slips an arm around her
Yep
-  - group of islanders have assembled to watch the crew approach in the long boats
- Chuck gazes across the strange landscape
As the boats dock, the crew pile out and scatter
Local children follow them wherever they go
Chuck, Robin and John find themselves alone
Most of the buildings are primitive
They wander over to a shop
What do you say
Cokes
'm buying
& Sure
Chuck and Robin reappear, sipping cold Cokes
Mike and Chris walk by across the street
Robin speaks up loud enough for them to hear
You're right Chuck
There's nothing quite as refreshing as a cold ten cent Coke that only costs ten cents
The three clink their bottles
Mike and Chris slink away
- crumbling fort overlooks the harbor
Below, the Albatross floats like a pearl on the azure blue water
Large bronze muzzle-loading cannons still lie in their gunports, aimed at the sea, waiting for pirate ships that will never come
Each of the guys are sprawled on a cannon, taking in the Caribbean view
You think Skipper and Alice do it
Do what
Ya know
"It"
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it
Who wants to know
She isn't that old
What do you mean
mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty
How would you know
Trust me donut
know
What
Come on
On the dog watch, night after the storm,  look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down
No way
Come on man, what'd they look like
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair
've seen 'em
've seen 'em
They crack up
walked in on my parents one time
It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and  thought that was kinda weird so  just walked in
That's what they get for not locking the door
So 'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop
No breathing or snoring
Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath
So
What happened
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What
" John and Robin crack up
What'd you do
said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away
Did you shut the door at least
They bust up again
Chuck glares back
don't remember
Robin sits up on his cannon and looks out, suddenly melancholy
My parents don't do it anymore
How do you know
They might
'Cause they're getting a divorce
(beat) That's why they sent me here
My sister's at Tabor
They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business
They tell you that
figured it out
Yeah
My old man split along time ago
It doesn't mean anything
You just take care of number one that's all that matters
It matters to me
(kindly) Okay donut
Whatever you say
We better get back
Robin looks up to John
Did you really see 'em
-  - The boat moves off leaving the lights of Antigua behind
Chuck watches as the island disappears below the horizon
- The wind is up and the seas are high
The ship is under full sail driving at top speed
Foam sprays from the bow as it slices through the water -- what she was born to do
The crew line the starboard rail, thrilled to be part of the performance
Tod is at the wheel with Chris nearby
The sails tower above him like a mountain of silk
He wrestles the wheel, careful to hold his course against the powerful trade winds
Skipper, making his rounds inspects the heading on the compass and nods
It's a good sail boys
Tod and Chris beam
Compliments are rare from this man
Thank you, sir
Shall we trim the main Skipper
think we could get another knot or two
Skipper turns and looks at Tod, a twinkle in his eye
As you like
Gravy
The two gloat as they lighten the mainsheet tackle
Phil joins them
What do you say  have a crack at the wheel
'd say, fuck off junior
They laugh
Phil slinks behind the chart house, hurt, and angry
He spots a spear gun stowed against the chart house
As Tod and Chris pull in the main, it strains and stretches against the powerful wind
Phil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the chart house and silently fires
There is a wicked  as the spear punctures the sail, passing through it, followed by a loud shredding as the huge sail splits
Jesus Christ
Let it out
Let it out
The sound brings Skipper onto the deck like a shot
Hard to port
Hard to port
Calamity, as Tod cranks the ship into the wind
The canvas goes limp as the ship hauls to a dead stop
People dive everywhere to drop sail
Start the engine
All ahead full
Scallop the Square and drop the rest
He shoots a glare at Tod and Chris
(bewildered) don't know what happened Skipper
It just blew out
Skipper turns to the task at hand without a word
What had been praise is now reduced to embarrassment and confusion
Phil, still hidden behind the chart house returns the spear gun and smiles to himself at Tod's arrogance turned humility
-   - The Albatross has dropped anchor along a remote group of flat, lush atolls
Tall palm trees grow almost to the waters edge
The crew have the mainsail down and Alice supervises the repair of the sail
Phil sits above it all sunning himself in the bowswain's chair
Where are you from any way
Depths of hell
Ohio
How 'bout you
Kennet Square,
'Mushroom capital of the world'
Sorry to here it
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know
Bein' here together an all
Phil reels himself down
Christ, 'm gonna choke on 'feel good'
Robin looks up, taken back
Why are you such a penis Phil
Do you do it on purpose or can't you help it
Tug my chain Johnstone
Skipper comes on deck
Robin and Chuck flip Phil and Terry the finger
After midterms we'll finish our run down to Curacao
The crew reacts, grumbling
have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there
(to Terry) Joy, rapture
Each one of you will be responsible for one student
'll expect you to be courteous
You represent this school and your country
We'll sail in the morning
George appears from the galley and rings the ships bell
That's chow
The crew drop what they're doing and stampede down into the cabin
- Robin thrashes in his bunk calling out
Sweat glistens on his face
Chuck stumbles out to his bunk with Rick and some of the others
Hey man, wake up
Wake up
They shake him
Robin wakes, disoriented, eyes filled with tears
was falling
Phil grumbles from his bunk
Hey, shut up will ya
It was a bad dream
It was so real
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up
You'll be out of it
You'll wake up
Phil rolls over in his bunk trying to go back to sleep
Who told you that
My dad
It works
Swear to God
Only good advice he ever gave me
Now, go back to sleep
He pats Robin on the leg
The guys return to their bunks
Favor Phil, listening
(lingering) You okay now
Robin stares at the photo of his brother
That's how he died you know
Who
My brother
He fell out of the old beech tree
Broke his neck
was on a camp out
They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down
(beat) They didn't find him 'till the next morning
They didn't even know why he was up there
Jesus, you never told them
couldn't
Phil stares at the ceiling, affected by what he has overheard
Someone creeps down the companionway and whispers
(hushed) Hey you guys, come on
Shuffling in the darkness
Phil suddenly realizes, he's alone
- The dory hangs from her gallows
Some of the guys slowly lower her to the water
- George is asleep with a book in his lap
Mike and Chris slip inside
The door squeaks, George stirs
Mike opens a cabinet and removes a fifth of rum
Silently, Mike passes the bottle to Chris who passes it to Tod who passes it to Charlie who drops it down to Robin who stands in the lowered dory with Chuck
(
) What do you think you're doing
Startled, Mike and Rick share a look
Busted
Phil turns and runs into John, wearing a broad smile, who shakes his head
No way
Forget it
Count me out
The crew descend and drag Phil, struggling, into the dory
They raise a crude sailing rig and silently move off
figure stands on top of the chart house, back lit by the moon
It's Skipper
Watching it all
Letting it unfold
- Skipper hovers over George, sawing logs
He tosses a pot on the floor
(bolting up) What
What's happening
You're officer of the watch, George
'm sorry, Skip
It's this damned book
Lawford gave it to me
The book is "Kafka"
Skipper motions to the empty cabinet
Son-of-a-bitch
We're short one long boat too
Come on
- The boys sit in a circle around a small fire passing the bottle
Rick strums his guitar and sings while the rest join in
Oh  was walkin' down Lime street one day
Hey
Weigh
Blow the man down
pretty young maiden she happened my way
Give me some time to blow the man down
Skipper and George crawl to the top of a sand dune and watch the boys
George starts to stand but Skipper puts a hand on his shoulder
guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be
What's that
padlock
On the boys
Phil is drunkest of them all and does a wild jig as the rest of them sing
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale
Weight
Hey
Blow the man down
She said "None the better, you all go to hell
" Give me some time to Blow the man down
They all crack up
only have one question
What's that, Canuck
If we're not on the boat, how come the ground is moving
You think George'll miss the bottle
We'll blame it on Big Daddy
He's a lush
All  know is if that Viking son of a bitch puts me on smegma duty one more time 'm gonna have to run him through
(mimicking) The "Old Man" likes a tight ship
"If it moves, shoot it
" The rest join in
"If it doesn't move, throw it overboard
If it's too big to throw overboard, screw it
" More laughing
You think Old Thunder Nuts will figure out that we're
Bill drunkenly imitates the Skipper
"There is nothing that goes on, on this boat that  don't know about
She speaks to me in the night
So don't test me
Not even a little
" The boys laugh
On the dune, George shakes his head
Immortality
Spirits have a way of bringing that out
And being sixteen
They're in a hurry to grow up
They don't know about consequences or responsibility
That's being sixteen too
(beat) promise you one thing
What's that
They'll know about it in the morning
Skipper smiles
- The drunken crew stumble out of the woods onto the beach
As they ready the boat for the trip back Robin looks out to sea
(alarmed) Jesus
Christ
Tod looks up
What now pork chop
Look
The guys turn their gaze to the ocean
The Albatross
is gone
Holy shit
Where'd she go
The crew is suddenly stone sober
Stunned
What the hell is going on
She's gone
The boat's gone
Phil breaks into sort of a blind panic
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Man  knew we shouldn't have gone
tried to tell you
tried to tell you
You guys made me come
You made me come
Will you shut up
You sound like my fucking sister
Alright
Everybody just stay cool
We'll figure this out
Who the hell checked the mooring
did
Why
Maybe she pulled free
What if they don't know
If she's adrift, if they're asleep, she could run aground
She could break up on the reef
(to Robin) Maybe you didn't check it good enough
(defensive, frightened) did
swear
Oddly, it's Phil who stands up for Robin
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't
That's enough
How the hell are we gonna get outta here
We'll think of something
Oh, praise the lord
(announcing) Relax everybody
Everything is under control
The jug head's going to think of something
Without warning
John lunges at Phil
Phil screams, trying to defend himself
The guys all dive in
Suddenly it's an all out brawl
John out of control pounding Phil's head against the seat of the boat
Suddenly, from behind, comes a blistering "
" as Chuck breaks an oar over the back of John's head
Stunned, John lets go of Phil and turns, blood dripping from the back of his head
Nobody calls me an idiot
He weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand
The guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover
God damn it man
think he broke my nose
Shut up, Phil
Chuck tosses the broken oar handle, kneels over and vomits
Well that's just great
Now what are we supposed to do
Chuck and Robin hoist John up and drag him under a palm tree, propping him up
The others huddle to stay warm
- The crew's asleep in the tropical heat of day
Bloodied and sun burned
fly buzzes around Rick's face, waking him
He sits up sunburned and sore trying to focus
He gazes across the water, stupefied
Oh-my-god
The others stir and follow his gaze
The Albatross sits in exactly the spot where they left her
'm not sure if this is really good or really bad
- The sound of a rod and reel spinning wildly
George tries to maintain control as the rod nearly jumps out of his hands
got a live one
Skipper, Alice and Bill watch the shoreline as the boys launch the long boat into the surf
George is struggling
beautiful tarpon leaps out of the water, but Skipper never takes his eyes off of his boys
The thing about fishing George, is you need to let 'em run some
Give 'em just enough slack so they don't break the line
But at the same time you've gotta keep enough tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em in slowly so they don't really know they're hooked
Suddenly George's line goes slack
He nearly falls over backwards
'll try and remember that
- Hound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boys stand before Skipper and the others
Skipper looks dark and angry
You know what a loose cannon is
'Bout the worst thing that could happen to a wooden ship
All it took was one, crashing around the deck in a storm
It'd smash everything in its way, maybe take out a mast or punch a hole right through the hull
Think about it, just one cannon not tied down, not anchored, could take a whole 'Man of War' straight to the bottom
(aside) But we don't have any cannons
Chris jabs him in the ribs
(hushed) Shut up
Skipper turns and faces them
Now, if the Skipper were smart, if he could see a storm building, why he'd cut loose every gun on his boat
Even though it would leave him at a disadvantage in battle, he'd push 'em into the sea
Better chance running for port than risk the entire ship, his crew
He takes a pause making sure he has their attention for this part
People are like that sometimes
They cut loose and before you know it, they're knocking holes in everything
So you gotta ask yourself if it might not be better to just put 'em off before they sink the whole thing
mean after all, you can always get new cannons
He walks back to his place at the rail
(beat) want a tight ship, everybody shaved and in clean clothes when we make Curacao
If it goes well, if your mid terms are acceptable,  may reconsider my decision about the rest of the trip
That's all
Dejected, the crew goes below
- Under sail
Skipper stands at the wheel overseeing the crew taking exams
Each writes furiously as Alice scribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from the chart house door
As the boys scratch out the problems, John seems paralyzed
He looks over at Phil and copies down his answer
He checks crib notes hidden in his shorts
Chuck and Robin both see this and exchange looks
- John makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the head
Robin follows
Chuck drops down the aft companionway, intercepting John
Where you going
To take a piss
Really
John turns around, surprised, sandwiched
Yeah, that's right
You wanna come in and shake it for me
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right
You've gotta be kidding
Get the fuck outta my way
Chuck throws open the Engine Room door and they shove John inside
What the hell
Chuck manages to pin John
Robin checks his pockets and comes up with the crib notes
Chuck lets go
John snatches them, ashamed
Takin' a piss
John turns away
Why, man
don't have to listen to this
Yes you do, stupid
Because if you don't, 'm gonna go right up there and have a heart to heart with Skipper and you'll be on the first plane back to idiotville
John lunges at Chuck, sending them both sprawling
Robin leaps on top of John
Cut it out man
Stop it
What's the matter with you
If Phil had caught you he'd have ratted you out in a second
You get caught cheating, you'll get kicked off the boat
John explodes, tears flowing
cheated to get on the boat
All right
What
He lets go of Chuck and stands up trying to hide his emotions
doctored my grades so 'd make the cut
'm a moron, okay
You satisfied
You're not a moron
Wanna bet
Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and  still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about
You know why it takes me so long to write papers
because  can't spell
While everybody else is sleeping, 'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary
John chokes back a sob
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause  couldn't read a slide rule
can show you how to use a slide rule
The three turn around, startled
How long you been standing there
Long enough
John looks down, resigned
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year
stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades
Shit, who am  kidding
'll never pass the boards
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades
We'll start a private study group
Nobody knows
You'll ace that test
'm in
They turn and look to Phil, who still shows the tell-tail signs of their fight
Me, too
Why would you do that
Because we believe in you
(beat) Because we're your friends
-  - As a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea, the Albatross rounds a point and heads towards the docks several hundred yards away
On the dock, the students of the school wait
As soon as the ship is in view, they start to cheer
Chuck squints
What are they doing
can't make it out
Robin calls up to Phil, who is at the wheelhouse
Hey, Phil
Swing up the 'binocs' and tell us what you see
Phil picks up the binoculars and focuses
(puzzled) They're waving
handkerchiefs or something
What
Maybe they're surrendering
Wait a second
Phil lowers the binoculars and turns to Skipper
They're girls
They're all girls
Skipper shares a knowing look with Alice
Gimme those
Tod snatches the binoculars
Everyone on board rushes to the port side
Every single person on the dock is a young girl waving a white handkerchief
Spontaneous cheers from the boys
As the 'Big ' pulls to the dock, John and Tod run for the gunnel door and swing it open
The girls flood the deck
Good morning, ladies
They chatter in Dutch and hurry aboard
Like wall flowers, Robin, Phil and Chuck stand on top of the chart house watching utopia unfold before them
What are we supposed to talk about
You've gotta be kidding
But, they don't speak English
There are some things that everybody does in the same language
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move
Like this
Phil reaches up for a free line
With a running start he swings out over the water
Yeeee Haaaaa
He careens back onto the deck and lands in front of two startled, but impressed girls
Robin and Chuck applaud
Phil takes a bow
All hell is breaking loose
Skipper and Alice welcome aboard the headmaster,
, 50's, dumpy but tough
very enthusiastic welcome
We don't often have guests
Our girls have been looking forward to your visit for some time
Welcome to Curacao
Thank you
You're all ready to sail then
should think so
'm sure they won't be disappointed
man's voice bellows up from the dock
(
) Ahoy there
Everyone stops and freezes
Phil turns, disbelieving
It's his parents, Francis and  , standing next to a limousine dressed in brightly colored tourist garb
Surprise
Well, well
What do we have here
floating brothel
(cool) Hardly
Francis comes aboard uninvited as usual
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece
(pointed) And, of course, we are
Well, you never can tell these days, can you
Skipper shoots a look over at Phil who is staring a hole in the deck
What is it we can do for you today
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony
It's not monotonous
Francis flushes red
Never the less
He turns and joins Peggy on the dock
Phil is suddenly full of rage
This is an invasion of his privacy
Everyone feels it
Hop to boy
We haven't got all day
Phil's anger turns to resigned humiliation
He stops, staring down at his parents
Skipper puts a hand on his shoulder
didn't know, Phil
Phil nods, head down and walks down the ramp
All watch him go, feeling for him
- The sails begin to rise but unlike earlier, the guys out like the Vienna Boys Choir and it's having the desired impressive effect on the women
When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup/ and not one of us was sober/ Kerry thought she saw a picture, but it really was the sun/ then we knew the party was over
The weather was perfect, brisk and steady under the trade wind swells
The voices trail away as the ship moves off
(
) Curacao seemed out of a dream, somehow make-believe
But, as Ohio drew further and further away, it was home that began to seem unreal, drifting somewhere in the foggy reaches of our memories
And  knew that each of us was falling in love
But not only with these wonderful women or the swaying palms and porcelain beaches
We were falling in love with the experience we were sharing, and with who we were becoming
- The crew is getting ready for a farewell party
Each member is primping
Bregitta
Do you believe it
Believe what
Her name
(savoring the sound) Bregitta
It's poetry
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta"
Don't mind him, Chucky
You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline
Screw you, Valentino
haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody
Tod smiles as he slowly pulls something from his pocket
It's a pair of girls' cotton underwear
That's because 'm discrete, moron
The guys try to wrestle the underwear away from him
Just then Skipper descends the companionway
Alright, gentlemen, we sail with the tide
Twenty-three hundred
Sharp
'm not waiting
Have a good time tonight but be back on time
The crew cheer
This means the trip goes on
-  - Decorated with colored paper lanterns and streamers, a softly plays in the b
g
The crew slow- dance with their girls, dressed in cotton that seems to glow against their dark skin
Ms
Boyde is scrutinizing the body contact between Chuck and
Their lips appear pasted together and she doesn't like it
Lawford sees what is about to happen and hands his slimy cigar to George who reacts
Hold this, will ya
Lawford intercepts Ms
Boyde
Madam,  would consider it a privilege if you would allow me to take you on a tour of the dance floor
Ms
Boyde is so flattered, it is all she can do to extend her hand
Lawford leads her away and glares at Rick
You're very light on your feet Ms
Boyde
Was it you who taught all of these young ladies the art of the dance
Ms
Boyde giggles like a school girl
- Phil and his parents sit outside at a ritzy restaurant
Phil stares towards the harbor
What's wrong, you don't like steak
should be eating with the crew
Humor me
Eat it anyway
Why are you here
We missed you
We wanted to check on you
don't need you spying on me
Spying
can take care of myself
(sarcastic) Oh, really
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place
didn't want to come but  did
Why do you have to embarrass me
Why can't you just leave me alone
Francis slaps Phil across the face nearly knocking him out of his chair
Everyone and everything
It's humiliating
Francis
She cradles Phil's red face
He fights the tears
Listen to me, you thankless little prick
We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully
What the hell is it, this captain
Because 'll see him in a rowboat
It has nothing to do with him
Well, what does it have to do with
Us
No
Look, it's me okay
Can't it just be about me
For once
Phil pulls free and exits
He can feel eyes all over him
-  - Alice watches, swept up in the nostalgic romance of it all
Skipper joins her
He would have loved this
Your father
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands
You miss him
Skipper manages a sad smile
Every hour
Every minute
(pause) wish he was here
wish he could have sailed our girl
Seen these boys
She smiles warmly
'd have liked to have said goodbye
He knows
You sound so sure
am about this
Skipper turns and stares at her deeply
What
He never would have believed a woman like you existed
Alice smiles and turns back to the dancers
Do you remember the last time you and  danced under the stars
Guilty
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you
We weren't much older than they are
The music changes to a calypso waltz
Skipper takes Alice by the hand
Would you allow me
She's sixteen again
There's something about him that still makes her blush
Skipper leads her to the dance floor
He hesitates, looking deeply into her eyes
As they begin to dance, the boys notice and exchange looks
Lawford and George sit across the quad, sipping punch and smoking cigars
If  didn't know better 'd say the old man was acting almost halfway human
He is halfway human
One by one the couples clear for the Skipper and his bride
They glide, lost in each others arms
They dance a dance for the ages
As if it might be for the last time
The music swells
- Chuck and Bregitta, are at the end of the pier, a full moon hangs above the horizon
Bregitta doesn't understand what Chuck is saying, but it's clear she's enjoying him
can't remember feeling like this about myself, a place, someone like you
We've come such a long way, seen so much
But nothing like this
Bregitta smiles and takes Chuck's hand
He's nervous
'm not the best at expressing myself
Maybe the only reason  can now is because  know you don't understand me
(beat) like you so much
Too much
But how could
mean, if we can't even communicate, how could  know you
It's confusing
We sail in an hour and 'll never see you again
Bregitta takes Chuck's face gently and kisses him tenderly
Then, in perfect English
like you, too
Chuck's eyes widen, astonished
Bregitta smiles, takes Chuck by the hand, and leads him to a small covered boat moored to the pier
Come on
We don't have much time
Blushing deeply, Chuck follows her into the boat
- Robin walks down the street hand in hand with one of the girls
long string of colored lights illuminate the length of the street
Robin clumsily tries to kiss the girl
She laughs
(defensive) What
Suddenly there's a flash and the sound of breaking glass
Robin looks up to see Phil staggering, down the street, smashing each of the colored light bulbs with a stick
He showers himself with broken glass and sparks
(to girl) Wait for me okay
'll be right back
swear
She smiles sadly and nods
Robin sprints down the pier and catches up with Phil
His feet are bleeding
He is completely smashed
Phil
What are you doing
Fandango, Junior
(he holds up his stick) 'm gonna do some limbo baby
No way Phil
Not like this
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe
He scores another bulb
Robin jumps out of the way
It's outta here
Come on man
Let's just talk about it
The music drifts from the gardens ahead
Phil bolts
Robin chases after him
Phil
Wait man
Come on
-  - John shares a joke with Lawford and George
The calypso is cranking, but only John hears Phil and Robin crash into the refreshment table
Robin struggles to stop Phil
(to Lawford) Be right back
Lawford nods, oblivious
John tries to help Robin with Phil
Jesus
What the hell happened to him
Lemme go
Lemme go
don't know
We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this
Son of a bitch
Phil kicks and struggles
Phil, if you don't calm down, 'm gonna hurt you
Got it
They drag him into the darkness
From near the bandstand however, Skipper has seen it all
- The crew lean along the rail waving goodbye to the girls who wave back with their white handkerchiefs
- Chuck and John hold Phil still as Robin picks shards of glass out of his feet
Phil clenches his jaw, but his eyes are dry
- The ship is under full-sail driving before a brisk following wind
It takes two on the helm to keep her safely on course
Those not on watch are sprawled about the boat, scraping and 'red-leading' or reading
Chuck and Robin sit forward with John, studying
Lawford paces the deck, chiding the crew
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr
Lawford
Read on, young John
Read on
College boards are coming
John looks down, dejected
Suddenly Tod cries from the foretop
There they blow
There they blow
Dolphins off the bow
Everyone rushes to see
Dolphins leaping out of the water
It's a magnificent game they play with ships
The crew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea, close enough to touch
Isolated, Phil watches
Angry, cut off
Chuck eyes him, worried
Bill and Charlie rig the bowswain's chair and lower Rick into the water
Suddenly, the dolphins are everywhere
Rick pets them as they swim back and forth
Shear joy
Phil reaches for the spear gun
Nobody notices as he loads and takes aim
Suddenly
with a crack, everyone spins around
large female dolphin leaps out of the water, bloody foam spraying from her blow hole
She lets out an agonizing scream
Phil holds her fast
Jesus Christ
The crew can only watch, stunned
Phil is suddenly, defensive as if waking from a dream
Fuck off man
It's just a fish
No, Phil
It's a mammal
Skipper steps on deck, sees the dolphin and Phil with the spear gun
(quietly) Bill, lower a long boat
We'll bring her up with the davit
dory is lowered with John and Bill inside
Once near the water they maneuver the struggling dolphin into a canvas harness
The crew hoist her with the davit tackle, swing her inboard, and gently lower her to the deck
They gather around the gasping animal
Alice checks the wound
Skipper kneels beside her
What do you think
Alice shakes her head and gently strokes the dolphin
It's through her lung
Skipper turns to Phil
(to Phil) Nice shot
Phil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away
Chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last to look away
Skipper grimly walks over to one of the deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds it out to Phil
Finish it
Phil looks at the mallet, horrified
(stammering) 'm not gonna kill it
You already have
Now go on
Do it
Phil backs away
Skipper stares at him for a moment, then walks over to the dolphin
Robin looks away
The sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the animal seems to silence the world
There are one of two thumps of her tail and, it's over
Skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and approaches Phil, his face flushed with anger
He grabs the spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the pieces into the sea
What the hell is wrong with you
Phil begins to shake with rage
Come on
You got so much fight in you; you wanna kill something
Take your best shot
The first one's free
Robin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away
For a brief moment Phil looks as if he might take Skipper up on the challenge
Then the impulse passes
That's what  thought
(beat) You're done
You're going home
Skipper turns
The humiliation is more than Phil can take
He lunges after Skipper
Lawford grabs him
Phil swings wildly
You mean-assed bastard
You son of a bitch
You can't do this
You can't do this
God damn you
God damn you
Lawford leads Phil, struggling, below
The crew surround the dead dolphin, stunned
-  - The Albatross is at anchor in the center of the harbor
- Phil comes on deck from below with his duffel bag
Everyone feels bad but no one knows what to say
Phil turns to get a second load
Why'd you do it
(regretting it) What's the difference
You only hurt yourself you know
Like you really care
Like any of you give a shit what happens to me
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil
It hurts too much to care
About yourself
About anything
Phil turns and disappears down the companionway
We shouldn't be putting him off the boat
The guy's out of control
Everybody's been outta control on this trip
(beat) Are we a crew or not
mean, isn't that what this is supposed to be all about
You're the last person who should be whining about being a "crew"
How do you figure that
Well, 'd sure like to go into the subject of vertigo and all, but wouldn't want you to piss yourself
Robin flushes bright red
John fires a look at Mike
You're a regular prick you know that
Tell it to the dolphin, Goodall
Everybody deserves a second chance, ya know
We'd do the same for you Mike
It's about family isn't it
mean are we together on this or not
There is a long pause
Mike and Chris cave
Hell, do what ever you want
It won't change anything anyway
Robin exchanges a glance with Chuck and together, they climb up the companionway
- Chuck and Robin stand before the door
can't go in there
What are you talking about
Robin turns away, ashamed
The guys were right
It'll mean nothing coming from me
He'll listen to you Chuck
Everybody does
- Skipper and Alice have paperwork spread out in front of them
knock
Come
Chuck enters, awkward
What's on your mind
'm here on behalf of the crew, sir
Skipper looks up
Well, spit it out
The fact is
We'd like you to give Phil another chance
Alice raises her eyebrows, surprised
Can't do it
Sir
Close the door
Sit down
Chuck does as he is told
Why do you think 'm sending him home
He killed the dolphin
Skipper looks at Chuck for a moment
The Dolphin was a symptom
Of what
Of a fight he can't win out here
It's his father sir
He's suffocating him
We've all seen it
Suddenly it's as if Chuck is talking about his own life
mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is
What right did then have to show up here
They have every right Chuck
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same
Skipper sits up and studies Chuck for a moment
Let me tell you something about Phil's father, and your's too
How do you think you got here
You think this is all free, that they owe you something
You think they enjoy riding subways and commuter trains, driving buses or pulling lobster traps
Work fifty weeks a year to keep you in tennis shoes and private school
Look around at how the rest of the world lives Chuck
We're the luckiest people alive, every one of us
They gave it up for you and Phil, and me too my friend
Chuck chews on it
There are ground rules in families just like on this boat
If you and Phil don't like it, 'm sorry
Someday you'll understand that, and if you're lucky, you'll come home and find your best friend has been there all along waiting for you to forgive him for being a father
It'll be the way it used to be, when you were ten and your dad was a giant
Now it's Skipper who is talking about himself
Does Phil know how you guys feel
don't know
You should tell him
That's something he can take with him
Chuck nods and leaves
- As Chuck exits he meets Robin's eyes
He shakes his head
- Skipper returns to his paperwork but can feel Alice watching him
He senses it
'm all ears
Alice smiles
You may not like what you hear
can take it
They've become what you wanted
They're a crew
That's why he came
Skipper puts a loving hand on Alice's shoulder
Why did we begin this
We were idealists
Because we believed we could make an impact out here
Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing
haven't forgotten
Phil, he's not looking inside
He's just striking out at the world
He has a lot of hurt inside him
Well, he better learn to own it
Actions have consequences
(beat) It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them
Alice runs her hands across his face
You're still an idealist
Skipper turns and slips into her arms
Oh hell
- Phil is in the long boat with Skipper, ready to shove off
Tension is high
It's as though they're all waiting for Skipper to give Phil a reprieve
But, it's not coming
They mumble goodbyes
Terry and Rick pass down Phil's bags
Good luck
Phil nods and turns to Skipper
'm ready
Skipper starts to pull the oars to make the crossing to the dock as the crew watches them go
Robin turns, staring at the ships bell
- Skipper ties off the boat and Phil hands up his bags black limousine waits, brooding
Phil climbs up with Skipper and stands, stares at it
The back door opens, but nobody gets out
- The crew stand, watching
His ol' man's gonna eat him for lunch
know what that's like
Yeah
Then, suddenly
My god
All stares aloft
In the rigging, climbing up the mast, is Robin
With the ships bell in his teeth, he is sweating every rung
Perspiration glistens on his brow
The crew watches, transfixed as he fights his way towards the foretop
- Phil turns to Skipper
Working up some courage to say something, anything
But all that comes out is
'm sorry
pause between them
know, Phil
Skipper extends a hand and they shake
Phil is about to turn, when a familiar sound draws their attention
- Robin, holding on for dear life at the top of the mast, rings the ships bell triumphantly over his head, waving to Phil
Victorious
Ding ding
Ding ding
Ding ding
The crew begin to cheer
- Phil stares back, fighting his emotions
Slowly he raises his hand in a single wave of acknowledgement
The ringing stops as his eyes meet Robin's
Waves back
Skipper turns
They never gave up on you, you know
Phil chews on it
Then
Tell 'em  said
thanks
(beat) Goodbye Skipper
' Robin watches as the limo pulls away
He rings the bell wildly
The crew below wave in a show of silent protest
(
) As Robin rang him out, we waved in silent protest against Skipper's decision
And in the days that followed the low morale was matched only by a sense of arrogance that perhaps the master should step down and let his students take over
Robin, the Albatross and the drama unfolding below spin slowly away as we climb, turning, higher and higher
-  - Foam sprays from her bow as the Albatross slices through the swells
- Tod exits the head with a worried look on his face
He grabs Chuck by the arm and pulls him aside
Morale is extremely low
Listen man,  think  have a problem
We all have problems
'm pissin' fire man
Chuck reacts
'  - Tight on Alice
Pull back to reveal Tod standing in front of her with his shorts down around his ankles
Mortified
Have a nice time in Curacao, did you Tod
Alice gets up and moves to her medicine chest
Tod starts to pull up his shorts
Not so fast
She pulls out a menacingly large looking hypodermic needle
Tod's embarrassment turns to alarm
- The crew stand in line, pissed
Lawford and George man the deck with Skipper and exchange amused looks
The door opens and Chris exits, red faced, rubbing his backside
He glares at Tod who sits on the paint locker
Way-ta-go Valentino
never even copped a feel in Curacao
Yeah well, your sexual orientation is not my problem
Man, is there a social disease you haven't had
So much for vestal virgins
Lawford swings up a pair of binoculars
vessel under power is coming up fast behind them
He holds the binocs out to Skipper
What do you make of that
Skipper turns and looks
don't know
The ship pulls along the port side, keeping a couple hundred yards between them
The boys move to the rail
George sees them first
Jesus
She's got guns
She's Cuban
Everyone becomes alarmed
Even Alice looks concerned
Suddenly a puff of smoke discharges from the gun boat
(shouting) The entire crew hit the deck as a shell rockets across the bow exploding in the water
Jesus, we're Americans
We're Americans
Skipper grabs the American flag and starts waving it
Jesus, they're gonna sink us
Bill drop everything
Do it now
The crew scrambles for the rigging, frantically dropping sail
(hitting each word) Who the hell do they think they are
As the sail comes down, the Albatross slows to a stop
The Cubans inch closer and begin speaking over a loud speaker in Spanish
The seas are high and the two ships rise and fall with the large swells between them
They want us to identify ourselves
Chuck returns with a bull horn
Tell them we're the American School Ship, Albatross
George replies in Spanish over the bull horn
The Cubans answer
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees
(beat) Skipper, they mean to board us
Not a chance
Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war
Another exchange between George and the Cubans
The crew lay flat on the deck, terrified
They say they are acting on the direct authority of Fidel Castro
Skipper defiantly swings up onto the gunnel rail
The Cuban Captain gives an order and one of his sailors jumps into the turret of the anti aircraft guns and swivels around pointing both barrels at the Albatross
Skipper stands firm, between the shrouds
Silence
standoff
Tell 'em to come aboard
George sends the return message
There is a pause, then the murmurs of the relieved crew
Skipper swings down but never takes his eyes off the gunboat
(to crew) We've come a long way gentlemen
But this is no time for heroes know you're much more, but  need you to be boys right now
That's an order
Now scatter and find your passports
- Laundry, books and mementos go flying as each boy scrambles to dig up his passport
Terry sits among his things, dazed
Bill notices
What's wrong
- small launch filled with Cuban soldiers approaches the Albatross
The crew climb on deck and line up along the Chart House with their passports
Lawford walks up to Skipper
We've got a problem
What's that
Terry left his passport in Curacao
We could hide him
No
Bring him on deck with the others
The Cubans cast their lines up and climb aboard carrying side arms
Terry reluctantly joins his crew mates
The faces Skipper as his men go down the line checking the passports
Others search the ship
Chicken is a fool's game captain
So is violating international law
But you invited is aboard
Your cannons made a compelling argument
One of the Cubans pulls Terry out of line and brings him forward
He alerts the Commander in Spanish
Stow away
He left his passport in Curacao
It's being mailed to Panama
That is unfortunate
We'll have to take him with us
Terry is petrified
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere
Skipper stares him down
The Commander signals to one of his men who disappears into the Chart House
Perhaps in appreciation for our country's pursuit of peace, you might offer us some, token of gratitude
Skipper doesn't really have a choice
What do you want
The Cuban returns from the Chart House with the Ships sextant and hands it to the Commander
This
And
Pointing to the ships compass
and that
You've got to be kidding
(cold) Take it
Without hesitation the Cubans pull the large brass compass from its base
Now, get the hell off my ship
As they leave the ship, they pause
The Commander looks back at the Skipper, then deliberately drops both sextant and compass into the sea
You'll really have something to teach your students now
Skipper stands towering above them
The Cuban captain smiles up at him
Amazingly, Skipper addresses him in perfect Spanish
Las estrellas es lo unico, que un marinero verdadero se mesesita para encontrarse
Verdade Patron
The Cubans stare back, frowning, amazed as they motor away
The crew are stunned by what they have just witnessed
Skipper turns and meets the eyes of admiration, humility and complete respect
He joins Alice at the helm
They linger for a moment
What'd he say
George smiles, impressed as well
He told them real sailors need only the stars
With a new attitude, they turn to Skipper
Alright then, let's get outta here
The crew bolt to there positions
(
) With staff and string he showed us how to build a sextant
As we rode the trades, he shared the ancient secrets of how to read the waves and follow stars
And some mornings later, bathed in the orange glow of a sunrise, Panama rose from the sea like a phoenix
-   - Panama appears on the horizon
The Albatross is dwarfed by the huge freighters moored around her, as she moves through the locks
The crew stand on deck in quiet reverence
- The sounds of slumber fill the cabin
All seems well with the world
Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness
huge bearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a trident in his hand
Chuck wakes with a start
He bolts upright to see the horrible figure of  himself (Lawford) towering before him
He tries to scream, but hands cover his mouth
He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway
- The Albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship
Where the sails once were, only shredded fabric
All of the crew have been brought on deck
Powdered faces glow, surreal
John's head has been shaved into a mohawk
Robin, Rick and Chris have been reduced to crew cuts
The shears start over Chuck's head
Neptune and his sidekick, (George) and two  (Bill and Alice) emerge with the rest of the crew
Hold fast that polliwog and make him presentable
Chuck struggles as his hair is shaved away and face powdered
Let it be known that on this day in the year nineteen hundred and sixty- one there appeared within the limits of my royal kingdom, the sailing ship brigantine Albatross, bound for Galapagos
All vessels that sail my domain shall be subject to the scrutiny of the underworld
Terry is brought topside kicking and screaming
Silence
Terry shuts up and succumbs to the same fate as the rest
Tonight you shall all enter the Order of the Shellbacks
Only when you have been duly initiated shall you enjoy the mysteries and protection of the trident
So, let the festivities begin
- Neptune and his court sit smoking Havana cigars as each member of the crew present themselves
Robin dressed like a pig and crawls around snorting
John's an Indian brave, whooping and hollering as he does a rain dance
Chuck, with flippers on his hands and feet, hops around like a frog
Rick is in 'drag' as Neptune's girlfriend and must sing everything he says
Charlie is dressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck
Frenetic chaos
- Neptune and his court lead a procession around the perimeter of the deck
The crew follows
They stamp their feet and chant
Hell is to drift, heaven to steer
Hell is to drift, heaven to steer
Hell is to drift, heaven to steer
They move faster and faster around the boat
They shout louder and louder, faster and faster until they have all worked themselves into a frenzy
- Davey Jones, holds a large turtle shell over the crews heads
As each one passes before him he pours blood from the turtle shell onto their heads
It runs down, streaking their floured faces and necks
As the ritual progresses, Neptune speaks
By virtue of the power inherited by me,  do hereby command all of my subjects, such as mermaids, sea serpents, dolphins, whales, sharks and turtles, from eating, playing with, or otherwise molesting this vessel or her crew
Let it be remembered that on this, my Equatorial Domain on Longitude 88' 20' 13" on this 532nd in the year of the dolphin, you entered the Order of the Shellbacks
The crew cheer and embrace
Skipper calls from the wheel
Land ho
- The crew stop their celebrating and gather at the port bow
Ahead, glowing orange with the dawn, the islands of Galapagos
It's desolate landscape of silent volcanoes and ancient lava flows that spill into the sea
The faces of the boys, still streaked with the indignities of the night's ordeal, stand silently before their final destination
(
) We had journeyed over six thousand miles to the very edge of the earth
Like Darwin before us, we would witness the bliss of nature in the absence of man
And it was as if the Albatross had forded time, leaving it behind
In the heat of those equatorial days, on the virgin onyx beaches and shifting coral dunes, one could expect to find sunning iguanas, nesting frigates and perchance
the footprints of God
-   - The Albatross rests at anchor
On the beach, the crew watch a huge group of penguins dive and frolic from the ancient guano cliffs
So unaccustomed are these creatures to man, that they have no fear
- Chuck, John and Rick snorkel among the playful
They dart and swim like otters among their new human friends
- Terry, Chris, Chuck and Mike stand taking notes on exotic birds
Frigates, hawks, flamingos, pelicans, boobies, and of course
albatrosses
- The crew are sprawled across the deck taking final exams
Alice walks among them
Chuck throws an anxious look towards John who is buried in his test
- Boobies nest in the grass
Thousands of them and amazingly, the crew can walk among them without them batting an eye
Chuck and Robin watch as the iguanas sneak into unattended nests and steal eggs
- Chuck is alone gazing over the shoreline
huge flock of finches darken the sky, circling the black sand beach
Pure magic
- Beyond, the anchored Albatross rocks and bounces in a blue-sky gale
Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod stand by a dory watching the sea build
They wear only tattered shorts, their hair sun bleached and their skin dark
We're here for the night
Yeah
- Tight
The eyes of predators
Sharp, cunning, hungry
- lone wild goat grazes on the beach
It looks up, sensing something, unfamiliar, then, returns to it's grazing
Tight
Thundering bare feet on the black sand
The goat looks up again, this time it sees five Homosapiens bearing down on him
They come naked, swinging their shredded clothing above their heads like lassos
Shouting, whooping, primal
The goat bolts for its life
Pounding through the waterline like the wild horses of Sable, the hunters charge after the hunted, closing
The goat's eyes are full of a terror it has never known
The beach is broad and long with no cover
The hunters are gaining on the goat
Splashing feet pound closer
Suddenly they are upon the goat
But, instead of attacking it, they just run through it, passing it
The goat pulls up and stops, breathless, watching the naked humans run
Close on the faces of brothers, matching each other, step for step
The music builds as we
- Wild eyes behind the charcoal painted masks of primal man
The rhythmic beat of sticks clacking and voices chanting
The heaping of driftwood into piles
Taught and powerful, the glistening bodies of young men
Blue sparks leap from striking flint against stone flame is born
Voices howl in guttural triumph
As the flames leap and singe the darkness, silhouettes of men pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance
The goat watches from the shadows, bemused, as the dance builds to a frenzy
The night sky is filled with the building sound of raging fire, pounding surf and chanting voices
- The wind carries the sounds of ceremony across the water
The flames from the beach reflect off of the water turning the white hull of the ship, a deep flickering orange
The word -------- has been spelled in huge flaming letters
Alice joins Skipper at his place by the rail watching
What are they doing
Claiming their place in the world
- The white surf hisses as it washes among the cinders of the evenings ritual
The Galapagos have been returned, for now, to the frigates and the iguanas
Across the water against the rising sun, the Albatross, under full sail, is bound for home
- The crew stand at their posts
The yards and foretop are trimmed with sailors, their faces taught and their bodies hard
No one looks back
-   - Alice steps onto the deck from the chart house with papers in her hands
Well gentlemen,  have the results of your college board scores think most of you will be pleased
The crew members collect their exams
Chuck notices John at the bow, alone, lost
You okay
Yeah
How'd you do
Chuck looks down at his exam apprehensively
Ninety-six
Congratulations
What about you
John slowly passes his test to Chuck
It's a ninety-one
It's an ''
know
(excited) You know
Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard
just can't believe it
This is your moment, don't you see
The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again
When you stand up and are counted
John tries to choke back his emotions
couldn't have done it without you
Yes you could
You did
(holding up the exam) This is all you
Nobody else
John looks out
Thank you
Chuck smiles and joins John's gaze over the water
Feels different doesn't it
What
That we're going back
don't want it to end
don't want to be what was when  left
What was that
Anonymous
Chuck looks at his test grimacing
've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life
It's what they expect
After all this,  still haven't figured it out
Figured what out
Who  am, outside of this boat
What the hell 'm doing here
'll tell you who you are
You're the glue
You're the thing that holds everybody around you together
You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't
It's a gift
It's Chuck's turn to fight emotion
You know,  never had friends like this
Me either
feel like
we can do anything
John smiles, clutching his exam
We can
(
) In the fading hours of that Pacific dusk, with nothing left to confess, for the first time we felt safe, capable, sure of who we were and where we were going
- The crew sleep in their bunks
Lawford's voice rumbles down the companionway
wet sheet and a flowing sea/ wind that follows fast, And fills the white and rushing sail, And bends the gallant mast/ Arise, arise you salty dogs
The watch is on
Chuck, Tom, John, Terry and Tod roll out
The dumb waiter clatters down from the galley with the morning's breakfast
Skipper and some of the crew are already eating
- The Albatross is under full sail trying to take advantage of what little wind there is
The skies are gray and dank
Tod and Terry are at the helm
Chuck and John are amid ship
John relieves Bill on the forward watch
Looks like we're gonna get wet
Well, we need it
want to take a nice long bath and catch some water for my laundry
Save some for me will you
You got it
'm going below
Suddenly, a huge lightning bolt explodes out of the sky and strikes the water a hundred feet off of the starboard beam
Everyone jumps
Jesus
Skipper bolts onto the deck
Everybody okay
The crew nod sheepishly
very close call
All hands keep out of the rigging and stay clear of the masts
The clouds grow dark but no more lighting
Tod laughs nervously
Everybody joins in
It's contagious
Even Skipper manages a smile
All right gentlemen
Thor's had his fun
Let's keep a keen eye
Skipper starts back into the chart house when suddenly, a powerful gust of wind drives the ship hard to a 45 degree list to the starboard
Skipper stops and turns
Instinctively, John and Chuck spring for the rigging to drop sail
(sharply) No
Stay down
Skipper stares at the sky with the intensity of a cobra
Waiting
The wind eases
It becomes eerily still
The ship slows and the sails go slack
Silence
Skipper maintains his vigil
Foam and spray appear off of the tops of the swells like the invisible footprint of a locomotive
John sees it first
(shouting) Everybody turns and looks
Skipper's eyes suddenly widen as he realizes
(in a whisper) White Squall
The charging wall of wind slams into the topsails so hard it send a shudder throughout the ship
The wheel is nearly ripped out of Tod's hands
Instinctively, he tries to turn the ship into the wind
Hard to starboard
Hard to starboard
Confused, panicked, Tod keeps turning to the left, into the wind
Skipper struggles to get to the wheel but when the ship heals so badly he slides sideways across the deck
No, hard to port
Finally, Tod does as he is told
But as soon as the ship starts to come about, the vicious wind drives her further onto her side
As the deck becomes vertical Chuck half slips, half tumbles down to the starboard gunnel
- Robin, Chris, Bill, Mike and Rick are seated at the table finishing breakfast as the ship starts to go
They all share growing alarm as they watch the table reach it's maximum angle
Dishes start sliding off
Get out
Everybody out
- Skipper manages to grab the ax mounted on the chart house and cuts the mainsheet with a single blow
But it's too late
The tall masts plunge into the ocean and the sails scoop tons of sea water, pinning the Albatross on her side
'  - Alice struggles towards the door
The book case tears out of the wall and strikes her
She drops to her knees
The door swings open in front of her
She reels for a moment and then loses consciousness
- Lawford, Charlie and George are all hurled out of their bunks
The world is suddenly sideways
Lawford leaps up, pushing the others towards the companionway ladder
, ,
Come on Charlie
George, get them out
George disappears into the main cabin
Lawford manages to get Charlie out
As Lawford reaches the top of the ladder sea water explodes through the hatch and drives him back into the bowels of the ship
- Robin is through the companionway in the chart house with Mike right behind him
But instead of exiting, he holds the door open against the sea so that Mike can escape
Mike gets through the door before the rushing sea slams it closed, pinning Robin's arm
He struggles to push through
- John slashes at the lines securing the starboard lifeboat with his knife and manages to free it before it is dragged to the bottom
He scrambles through the collapsed rigging tangled above him for the port lifeboat
The Albatross is going down
Fast
Chuck and Tod stand on the after skylight
Chuck catches glimpses of the struggle going on below
My God, they're drowning
Skipper catches a glimpse of Alice through the skylight
Water washes over her but she doesn't move
Oh please, no
Not this woman
'  - Skipper's face is pressed hard against the skylight
His muffled voice penetrates the cabin
Alice stirs
She looks around, delirious
Alice, get up
Come on girl
He pounds uselessly on the teak deck then tears at the planks, fingers bleeding
Alice looks up confused but calm and finds Skipper's eyes
Panicked for the first time in his life Slipper swings the ax wildly at the perpendicular deck sending a shower of splinters into the water
Get out
Get out
Jesus Christ, please God, Alice get out
But after only two swings, the Albatross and Alice, slip beneath the sea
- Water thunders in from every possible exit
Chris and Rick push Bill towards the dumbwaiter
Bill, you go
We'll be right behind you
Before he can say no, Rick and Chris jam Bill into the tiny shaft
Suddenly, from below, a tremendous geyser smashes him to the top, knocking him unconscious
But the pressure is so great that the water sweeps him through the galley and out onto the deck
- Skipper struggles to reach John and the second life boat but sees that it is tangled in the rigging
Johnny, it's not good
John defies him and keeps cutting
The ship is almost completely submerged
can get it
Suddenly one of the deck lockers breaks free and plunges into the water taking lines and rope with it
John becomes tangled and is dragged into the water
Only his superior strength allows him to hold onto the lifeboat and keep cutting
The Albatross slips beneath the surface
Instead of trying to free himself John keeps slashing at the lifeboat lines as he disappears, swallowed by the sea
- Eerie silence
Lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket
Debris float around
He begins to panic as the water around him rises
My God
Oh God 'm dying
He takes a deep breath and the water consumes him
Then suddenly, the ceiling above him explodes from the pressure within
Lawford is catapulted from the grip of death, to the surface
- Chuck continues to frantically dive on the chart house door as the ship takes the 'Deep Six'
Suddenly the ship rolls 180 degrees, her screws exposed and keel jutting up like a huge dorsal fin
- Chuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still finds Robin's arm
They clasp tightly, but Chuck just can't budge the door
Then, strangely, Robin releases Chuck's arm and pulls it back through the door
Chuck looks up, startled
The small round window in the door is illuminated from the cabin lights on the inside
Through the glass, Chuck meets Robin's frightened eyes
He fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket
Robin takes a last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him
He meets Chuck's eyes again but this time with a strange acceptance
They both know what's happening
But Robin has refused to take his friend to the bottom with him
He presses his hand to the glass
Chuck does the same
Then with a smile, Robin pushes himself away from the door, disappearing into the darkness and eternity
- Chuck breaks the surface, gasping for air
He looks around, frantic
He sees nothing but the sea swells and debris
All that remains is the sound of the wind and rain on the water
Suddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion of foam
Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water like shattered lances as the ship rights herself underwater
She holds herself steady for a moment as if in a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross begins to rise
Faster and faster, until her entire length explodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave
Like Ahab before him, John appears, lashed in a web of tangled line still slashing to free the remaining long boat
And for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, as if this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea
Some of the boys begin to cheer prematurely
But Skipper knows better
She's filled to the gills with sea water
She shutters
Then, like a stone, she just drops, sucked to the center of the earth, John's hands still slashing, as she finally goes
Survivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the watery tempest
Strangely, the wind subsides
The sea becomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the water
His scream echoes, for the grief of all
There is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slips beneath the waves like a stone
The stunned crew can only watch
Then, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to the surface
Skipper fights off his emotions
He knows what it means
John died cutting it free
Terry and Bill hang onto a life ring
Blood runs from Bill's head
Charlie, Mike and several others hold onto the side of the other freed life boat which has been swamped
Lawford floats on his back, unconscious, but alive
Several of the boys help pull him towards the boat
Skipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking for those not accounted for
But, they are gone
Among the wreckage, the roof of the chart house
The only sound left is the ominous tolling of the ship's bell, Robin's bell, still secure in it's fitting
- The boats have been floated and tied together
Skipper is in one, Lawford in the other
One of the two boats has been rigged with sail
Skipper stands in the bow staring into the ink blue water
Raise your sail, Bill
North, north- east
Keep a sharp look out for Florida
Bill studies him for a moment, then
Maybe we could wait around a little longer, sir
There is a long pause before Skipper answers
(quietly) She's gone
She's gone
There is something remarkably touching about this young man trying to take care of him
He puts a hand on Skipper's shoulder
It almost makes him crack
He pats Bill's hand gently
Carry on
Yes sir
North, north-east
(beat) And Dick, please make a note of our final position
Lawford nods sullenly
Chuck looks out at the floating wreckage around them, silent, lost
Suddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat
The survivors share a confused look
Then it comes again
Chuck looks out at the surface of the water
It's suddenly alive
With sharks
Hands and feet inside the boats
They come by the dozens
Ramming the boats and rummaging through the debris
They swarm around the boats until it seems as if the water is boiling
Chuck picks up an oar and starts beating wildly at the sharks
The others take up the cause and in a moment they are all screaming and cursing the sharks
It's a frenzy of grief and anger
(
) We slashed at the sharks as if striking out at the finger of God
And we all begged silently for the ability to understand what had happened
But, if there was a God that day, his answer came only in the moaning wind and our questions were left to drift unanswered, in the titanic ocean of our deepest grief
Exhausted, Chuck stops slashing and stares out
lost
(hushed) Wake up
Wake up
1-2-3 wake up
Like Robin's nightmare of his brother, this is all too real
- The tramp freighter   steams toward the life boats
The crew stand silently, watching as the ship approaches
- Chuck stands on the deck of the Gran Rio as the last of the crew scramble up cargo netting hung over the side
Chuck stares out numbly watching as the two deserted long boats drift away
-   - Chuck, now dressed, stands in the same spot at the rail, staring out
muffled sound pulls Chuck into the present
He walks slowly down the after deck to a cabin door where sobbing escapes from the other side
Chuck turns the handle and cracks the door
- Curled up on the floor next to his bunk is Skipper look of shock comes over Chuck's face
Skipper has come completely unglued, sobbing deeply
(tentative) Skipper
Skipper turns slowly, looking up
His eyes are red and his face streaked with tears
He looks at Chuck almost as if he doesn't know who he is
Lost
'm sorry
'm so sorry
Chuck reels
It sounds more like a confession than an outpouring of sadness
Chuck closes the door
-   - Skipper, back in control, and the crew, stand along the port rail of the Gran Rio
small flotilla of pleasure boats surround the ship and hundreds of people line the pier
It's an intimidating sight
Pensive, worried, angry faces of parents and families
Chaos
Coast Guard Officials try to hold back the mob
What about the manifest
What about my son
How many made it
Nobody will tell us anything
We don't have a list of survivors yet
Please stand back
Don't push
Angry shouts drown him out
The  of the Gran Rio comes down from the bridge with some of his officers and stand with Skipper and the others
Several    join them on the deck
Skipper turns to the Captain and extends his hand
Thank you
The Captain nods
Skipper turns to his crew, looking over them
smile of deep pride passes his lips
They all see it
Then, between the Coast Guard Officers, he walks down the ramp
Lawford and the crew fall in behind
- shouting mob waits for them
Reporters and spectators shout and call out questions
It reaches a fever pitch as the crew descend
Skipper reaches the bottom of the ramp, his eyes meet a cool, familiar face
Francis Boutillier
Phil stands next to him, staring at the ground
(above the shouting) Welcome home
Skipper is shoved forward by the crowd pushing and shoving
The crew follow but are swept away
Charlie stops in front of Phil
Phil
Flash bulbs explode
Charlie and the others are descended upon as reporters bark out questions
#1 (shouting) What the hell happened out there captain
#2 How many boys did you lose
And how come you didn't go down with your ship
Parents begin to realize who has been lost
Agonizing cries mix with jubilation
It's emotional chaos
The crew members are driven apart, they call to each other, suddenly aware of what's happening
(panicked) Charlie
Bill
Terry suddenly finds himself smothered in the arms of his He strains to see what is happening to his shipmates
' Oh, sweetheart
Look at you
Skipper
Reporters corner them blocking his view
More reporters clamor after Skipper, who doesn't reply
#3 Captain, is it true that the ship was hit by a "White Squall"
#2 Is it true the first mate is only fifteen
Bill steps in between them
It wasn't his fault mister
#4 The National Weather Service says "White Squalls" are a meteorological phenomenon of the imagination
Would you care to comment of that
Don't you have anything to say to these parents
The reporter pops a flash picture in Skipper's face
Skipper flies around and knocks the camera to the ground
The reporter jumps back, startled
Yes  do
And it's private
Very private
Skipper is swept away towards the   by Skipper surrenders the manifest and it is stapled to the outside of the door
- Skipper is whisked inside
The Coast Guard Officers lock the doors behind them
Sit down Captain
We'll have a car here in a few minutes
Can  get you a cup of coffee
No, thank you
Skipper sits
The wails of family members can be heard as they see the list outside
Flash bulbs and faces press against the windows shouting questions
He just stares at the floor
From above we can see the group swarm around the the booth like angry hornets
The crew are fractured and pulled apart from each other
Charles, fights his way through the crowd
Chuck
Chuck
Chuck tries to get to him
Dad
They embrace
Flash bulbs explode all around them
Where's Mom
couldn't bring her down here until knew you were safe
Stands, staring at the empty ramp
Lost
man comes up behind her and leads her away
reporter shoves a microphone in Chuck's face
#5 Was it the Skipper's fault
And is it true drinking was permitted on board
Why did the ship really go down
Charles grabs the guy and shoves him back into the crowd
Chuck strains to see his crew mates but they have been swept away
Come on
Charles puts his arm around Chuck, still barefoot, and together, they walk away
Photographers trail after them, popping off a few last photos
Chuck turns and looks back
-  - ride reminiscent of the one Chuck and his father took before the journey began
There is a gulf of silence between them
Charles breaks it
thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch
That sound good
Yeah, sure
Chuck stares out the window at the traffic and congestion
car in front of them runs a red light
Charles slams on the brakes
Chuck is shaken up
Charles notices
'm sorry, son
Are you okay
Chuck manages a nod
- Lavish and conspicuous by Chuck's recent standards, the store is crowded and jammed with merchandise
Claustrophobic
Cash registers ring and  drifts in from above
Chuck follows as Charles pulls things off of hangers and piles them into Chuck's arms
Why don't you go and try some of that on
Okay
- Charles peruses the racks
He calls to Chuck
How're you doing in there
Chuck calls from a dressing room
(
) Fine
All right
'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes
- Chuck is curled up in the floor of the tiny booth
Still dressed in the clothes from the Gran Rio, perspiration beads on his skin
(calling out) Okay
Tears stream down his face
He looks up and sees himself in the mirror
The eyes that look back are eyes of the ages
Involuntary sobs
He begins to shake
The tiny booth suddenly like a crypt
Tight, with no air
Chuck lets out a gasp
Oh God
Someone pulls open the curtain
, from the next booth, fat and middle aged stands before Chuck in a pair of pants still sporting the price tags
He looks down
You okay, kid
Chuck is suddenly in the throws of a full-on anxiety attack
He leaps up and pushes past the man
- Chuck explodes out of the dressing room
Running, almost blind, he crashes into a rack of clothes
Charles looks up as he scrambles to his feet and bolts for the doors
Chuck
- Charles bursts through the doors, looking up and down the street, but Chuck is
gone
- The setting sun paints Chuck's face with golden light
He stares out across the water
Charles walks up behind him
When we were growing up  always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay
(beat) But you can't make this okay, can you
No,  can't
Charles puts his arm around his son
Together they turn and walk back towards the boardwalk, and the world
- Skipper sits across from a Coast Guard Officer, , 60
Tyler pulls out a file and lays it on the table
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross
have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking
understand
May  ask you something
Skipper nods
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier
It wasn't hard
used to helm a school ship long time ago
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'
She never lost a race while you were Skipper
Tyler is taken aback by Skipper's knowledge
That's right, we didn't
miss it sometimes
But, there are other things a Skipper can do
Tyler removes his glasses and studies Skipper
The families
want your ticket
Turn it in, we forget the whole thing
Everybody goes home
Absolutely not
The papers are going to eat you alive
Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission
(beat) They want someone to be accountable
am accountable
- Standard fare
Two beds and a
Chuck's lacing a new pair of sneakers
Charles is in the shower
There is a knock at the door
Chuck cracks the door
It's Charlie
We gotta talk
- The crew stand by the bulkhead
Bill tosses down a newspaper
The headline reads: We're all going to have to testify
They're going to try to take his license
Why
They need it to be simple
They need a reason
Who
All of them
Everybody waiting on that dock
So what are we supposed to do
Just tell 'em what we know and be done with it
That's what he'd want
Easy for you to say
What's that supposed to mean
Everybody knows why she went over Tod
You jibed the boat
was trying to get her up wind
That's what you do when you're hit a-beam
Or maybe you're too stupid to know that
That's not what Skipper thought
He was trying to spill air from the main
It was coming four points off the bow, Terry
He never could have gotten her around
Were you on deck
was standing right there and all  know is, he
(indicates Tod) disobeyed an order, twice, and the boat went over
It didn't go over 'til  turned her starboard
It was an act of God for Christ's sake
It was an act of stupidity
Tod lunges at Terry
Bill and Charlie pull them apart
(screaming) Was it my fault we were running all that sail
Was it my fault she wasn't dogged down couldn't help that the ballast shifted
You son of a bitch
It wasn't my fault
it wasn't
Tod breaks down, sodding on his knees
It's okay, Tod
Terry drags on a cigarette, then grinds out the butt
Then whose
Tod looks up along with Bill and Charlie, all confused
After the lightning strike, we tried to go aloft to drop sail
We'd done it a thousand times
We didn't have to wait for an order
But Skipper called us down
If the foremast had taken a strike, everyone in the rigging would've been fried
What would you have done
We would have scalloped the squares from the deck
Right Bill
Bill turns and stares into the water, troubled
That's right, that's right
Bleed the sails from the deck and she could've taken a hurricane
It's a strong argument
Even Charlie is troubled by the implication
There is a long moment of silence between them
This is crazy
Nothing could have prevented what happened
You guys are missing the point
This is all because of Phil
Phil and his dear old dad
What
How do you think they got this together so fast
He's been laying for Skipper since the first day
Come on
Like he's got a vendetta or some such shit
You got it
(to Chuck) told you he was a turn coat the day we kicked him off the boat
Chuck frowns, troubled
No
You're wrong
'm telling you, the only way to change this is to get Phil to call off his old man
And that ain't gonna happen
So the way  see it, it's Skipper or us
The guys react
It's a no win situation
- Chuck knocks quietly on the door
Phil answers the door
Can we talk
guess
(
) Who is it Philip
It's okay
'll be in, in a minute
(to Chuck) Look, what do you want
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father
Because of you
Well that's just typical isn't it
Is it true Phil
gotta go
You weren't there, you don't know what happened
(defensive) know enough
Chuck puts a hand out to stop him
Phil, please
It won't change anything
Tell him to call it off
(
) Who are you talking to out there Philip
Come back in here
Phil meets Chuck's eyes, then looks away
'm sorry
He turns again and reaches for the door
Wait
Chuck hands him something
Phil looks down, disbelieving
It's the ship's bell
Robin's bell
Their symbol of unity, of putting loyalty above fear
We figured he'd have wanted you to have it
(beat) You do what you've gotta do Phil
He leaves Phil standing alone on the porch, full of emotion, trying to grasp it all
- small courtroom
The room is filled with the crew members and their families, including the parents of the victims, as well as the media
Phil sits with his father and dodges Chuck's eyes
Coast Guard Officers Tyler, and  head the proceedings
The United States Coast Guard has been asked to conduct this maritime hearing to consider the revocation of Captain Richard Sheldrake's
Master Seaman's Certificate
- Bill sits at the table with his parents as questions are leveled at him
Chief petty officers Sanders and Downing ask most of the questions as Tyler oversees the proceedings
Why didn't you drop any sail
Skipper called us out of the rigging
But your instinct was to lose sail
My instinct was to not get electrocuted
How old are you, son
(hesitating) Fifteen
Thank you
Phil is at the table with Francis
Sanders asks the questions
Philip, why were you discharged from the Albatross
Phil doesn't look up and speaks in whispers
Skipper thought  was a challenge to authority
Were you
don't know
Captain Sheldrake exhibited an arrogant, controlling attitude in my presence on more than one occasion
believe he had a personality conflict with my son from the start
Well, if you don't mind my asking, sir, why did you let your son stay
Francis is stumped for a moment but recovers quickly
It was his dream to go
could hardly stand in the way of that, could
Phil rubs his temples as if he is going to explode
- It is Skipper's turn at the table
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic
He climbed when he was ready
Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall
Chuck and the others look up astonished
Mike shoots a look towards Phil
He did it man
He sang like a bird
Skipper hesitates
Yes,  was
Whispers fill the room
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew
Yes,  was
And you didn't do anything about it
(beat) No
didn't
Again the crew members are struck
Charlie turns to Chuck
They're twisting it all around
Why doesn't he say something
Had you ever seen a "White Squall" before this incident
No
What makes you so sure it was one
can't be sure
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable
Except, a "White Squall"
(beat) With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys
They are much more than that, sir
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier
(cutting him off) For killing a dolphin
and that you invited him to strike you
To fight it out on the deck of your ship
Skipper looks over at Francis
Phil stares at the floor
Skipper manages an ironic smile
Yes, that's true
Do you think this is funny
Some kind of joke
You lost six people out there
(white hot) don't think one second of this is funny, sir
Skipper stares down Sanders
He turns to Tyler
have no more questions at this time
He turns to sit down, then stops
Oh, one last thing
Isn't true that your father was a sea Captain
Skipper bristles
Yes
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket
Lost everyone on board
In fair weather no less
Skipper's silence is suddenly filled with rage
Tyler sees it and tries to intercept
What does this have to do with anything Mr
Sanders
(smug) Oh, nothing
was just curious
My father, was more seaman, more of a man, than you might ever hope to be
Sanders returns to his seat, rattled
Tyler pounds his gavel
We'll take a brief recess
- The crew huddle in the parking lot
Fractured, confused
Chuck, Tod, Charlie and Bill, stand off by themselves
There's still a way
What do you mean
It's me, don't you see
Terry's right, 'm the escape hatch disobeyed order
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything
They don't know that
(beat) We were the only one's on deck
Look, there's nothing they can do to me right
'm a kid
But that's not the point
That is the point
And Skipper'll slip off the hook
Tod is on the stand
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit
thought we'd have a better chance if  headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails
Tyler removes his glasses
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard
Twice
Is that what you were trained to do
No
Then what do you think he was trying to do
Let the blow drive the boat down wind
Neutralize our canvas
Skipper is becoming uneasy
He sees what is coming
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake
No
Then why son, why didn't you follow his order
Tod meets Skipper's eyes
Because --  panicked
The room is suddenly buzzing
Tod's Father stands up
' That's not true Tod
(to Mike) What the hell
What is he doing
Son of a gun
He just sent Skipper a life boat
Tyler turns to Skipper
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared
don't know that anything could have prevented what happened
Then what are you trying to say then
Skipper stands
Maybe you can't see what's happening here, but it's clear to me
(to Tod) appreciate what you're trying to do Tod
Maybe you could live with it, but  couldn't
(to tribunal) If you think 'm going to let a sixteen year old take responsibility, then you underestimate me
The Albatross was my ship
The Ocean Academy was my school
Her loss is mine and mine alone
(to others) can't bring your sons back
If you want my ticket, if that will ease your loss, it's the least can do
This
Skipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license
This is easy
Living with it, that'll be hard
Skipper turns and lays his license down in front of Tyler
Then he turns and begins walking towards the back of the room
The room erupts
Crew members and their families hurl accusations and blame
Cameras flash
Tyler tries to regain control
Suddenly Chuck stands, tall
No
Don't you walk away
Not now
Not after all of this
Skipper keeps walking
His head slumps
Tyler pounds his gavel
That enough son
Order
Please
Tears begin to stream down Chuck's face
His father, Charles, slowly stands meeting his sons eyes
Go for it
Tell me Skipper, was it all just a lie
"Where we go one, we go all"
We listened to you
We believed it
And we're still here
Skipper keeps moving
Shame on you then Skipper
Shame on you
Skipper reaches for the door
Suddenly a sound stops him cold in his tracks
Phil slowly rises
Tears streaming down his face
Tightly in his hands he grips the ships bell
Ding ding
Ding ding
Ding ding
It is the ringing of the truth
The tolling of their unity
Sit down
Phil ignores him
Skipper slowly walks over, his eyes never leaving Phil's
He stops, facing him
He gently takes his hands and silences the bell
Then he smiles and puts a hand on the back of Phil's head fighting his own emotions
He turns to Chuck
Tell them the truth
Make them understand
The room grows silent
(smiling) You tell them Chuck
Chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room
It's simple
Bad things happen sometimes
It wasn't Skipper or Tod
It was all of us
Everyone in this room
Because we all knew the risks
(to parents) You sent us
You paid our tuition, you allowed us to go
So to invent a reason for why this happened, to pin it on one person, well that won't change anything
It'll just make our experience meaningless
He turns to the tribunal
If you want to judge this man, judge him by his crew
Judge him by Alice and George
Chris and John and Robin
In one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us
This may sound crazy but the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or even a school
It was something that we made, that's inside us
That's who Skipper is
That's what he taught us
guess what it really was about was
the privilege of sacrifice
Chuck turns to Skipper
Isn't that right
Skipper nods
That's right
The room is silent
Then, a voice
golden tenor singing like the wind
Everyone turns
It's Bill
When the sun came up, there was whisky in the cup, and not a one of us was sober
One by one the crew members stand and begin to sing
Chuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand with him
Words or not
Jenny thought she saw a picture when it really was the sun, then we knew the party was over
They all stand facing Skipper and sing
The voices build, sweeping over everyone like a wave
Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you today, but  know we'll meet again, when the moon is in the valley and the leafs are on the trees, We will come to clearly in the glen
Skipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates
Only now is his job finished
He beams back
The music swells like an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small wooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in the calm waters beyond
The crew come together around Skipper one last time
They embrace
-  - Older Chuck has returned to the small building where the funeral services were held earlier
The people have gone but the funeral urn remains
- Chuck walks to the dock
He has the funeral urn in his hands
He steps aboard a small sailboat and begins untying her
The   notices and steps out of his office
What do you think you're doing
He walks over to the dock
All right friend, out of the boat
He tries to board the boat but Chuck greets him with the sharp end of a gaffing hook
(softly) Stand away
He looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he means business
He backs off
Chucks pushes away and raises the sail
The harbor master watches, perplexed as the small boat moves off for open water
- Bathed in the orange glow of the sun, Chuck stands naked against the ivory sail
(
) They didn't take his ticket that day
But why he never returned to the sea, 'd never know
Perhaps he hadn't been able to free himself from the anchor of grief that had driven him to his knees aboard the Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared for the solitude and isolation of command without his Alice
Or maybe it was just that the waves that had spoken to him for so long, had grown silent
Whatever it was, that thing, it had always troubled me
Because, fate offers up no reasons
And maybe that's what  have traveled these thirty four years to say
Maybe that is all  really know
And, that one man cared
Chuck turns to the sea and speaks
Rest easy old salt
For together again, we'll sail
With a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains at the sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune
: - The same sunset, but from another time
Four young men walk along a deserted beach
small boat has beached and rocks gently in the shallows
The boys run up and look at it
On the stern are painted the words: to reveal endless white sand, blue water, the young men and the boat
(
) Some time later we learned that one of our long boats had been recovered
Several young men found it washed up on a nameless beach somewhere on the island of Hispaniola
No one seemed to know who they were or where they came from, but they seemed to know of the Albatross
(pause) Sometimes in my dreams those faceless young men reveal themselves as my lost companions, and on the twilight coral sands of forever, between my slumber and conscious state, we race naked again, so open and in love with those precious moments, running, ever laughing, ever young, ever free
: - Young again, their hair sun bleached and skins brown, Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod, pound through the surf in a grinning footrace
Brothers all
Music builds
