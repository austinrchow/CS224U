by Emily Fox revisions by Mark Steilen February 27, 2003 : - the anxious, sweating, frightened face of MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life
Think Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after her but
She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer, her  becoming more labored
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten the leaves
Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her racing  and quickening
'  - and safety loom half a block down
She pours on the effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the door, rips it open, bolts inside and  it shut
where, with the    , a , unable to leap the hedge, and disappears
MacLEOD  -  - Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window in the front door and sees
' The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to extricate itself
--  picks it up, hugs it close: -- Where are you going, Jelly Bean
: 2
MacLEOD  - '  - (with a  in his belly) which suddenly begins   , From under piles of clothes and sheets,  MacLEOD, 17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts  the shrieking
With a , she throws her feet  over the edge of the bed
Her room is a train wreck
Grabbing a MatchBox 20 -shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff
Good enough
Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit concerned down at her navel
recent belly-button piercing looks a little red
She touches it
Ouch
When a  is heard, she begins tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the source
She pulls her  from under the covers: 786:
Parker snickers, types her return from
: 786:
:
786:   '  ' 3:00
This makes her smile
:
: MacLEOD  -  - Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection
In a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer
which is hyper-organized, everything in a little labeled nook
She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath where it says, "tweezers
" She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray eyebrow hair, plucks it
Pulling back, she raises her other eyebrow
Huh
Now they're not even
() 3
: She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow
Uh-oh
This is like when your mom cuts your hair and keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved
She reaches for the other side
but suddenly catches herself and stops
Deep breath
Let's not get too psychotic
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces them
Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit
Grabbing her she begins cleaning her teeth
(
) Morning
Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water pick
Parker's  from her side
Drew shuts off the water pick, dries her face
Why the young executive look
have my interview at  today
Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new belly ring
No way Mom knows about that
Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt down
And she never will
At least until after 'm married
Didn't it hurt
Like hell
Drew shivers
Piercings are so
unhygienic
little   from her preset   goes off
() 4
: Breakfast
Drew turns on her heel and
When Parker sets her Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of
which resembles a post- apocalyptic toiletry    landscape
There's a very clear line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized zone separating the    Koreas
Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but notices another message on her Blackberry: 786:
:
786:
:
786:  '   , '
'    , ' Accompanying the text, a  Warren has sent finishes downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein model-type
(suddenly wide-awake) Hellooo, Warren
Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces off the counter and  into the toilet
-- there it is, slowly sinking
Parker is stone-faced
She looks to her sister's side of the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered holder
She's considering
she's reaching
then
nah
Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth, brushes with a finger and spits
MacLEOD  -  - Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying her open
() 5
: MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and her husband,   MacLEOD, who  still in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head
As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper
Morning, Dad
Morning, baby
How's the book coming
(sigh) Well, sweety, my writing process is a lot like a giant hydroelectric dam
For a long time  just let the great ideas build up and build up until the sheer weight of them spills over and the words just come pouring out
Still stuck, huh
Not a word
Parker  with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her pop, then takes a sat
Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block
Both pour milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula
Both hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar
Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat toast that she slices in half first
Like Mom, like Drew
Drew spots the   of Warren before Parker can turn it over
Another one for the trophy room, huh
() 6
: Boys can be fun
You should try one some time
(to Drew) You ready for your interview
(funny you should ask) 've prepared a color-coded itinerary based on dividing the day into fifteen minute increments alternating blue/red, double- checked the train schedule, confirmed with the Weather Channel and rehearsed a couple of alternate scenarios last night, you know, just to account for all the possible glitches
We'll take that as a yes
'm proud of you for sticking to your plan all these years, sweety
still don't understand why you want to finish college in two years
What's the big hurry
want to hit the ground running
All those football games and the partying and the whole dating scene
It just seems like a lot of wasted time that could be spent more productively
The Accelerated program would look great on your med school application
Football games  get
But partying
waste of time
Parker looks to her dad
He shrugs
() 7
: To each her own
Well, Drew
have a surprise
Everybody stops what they're doing for a
took the day off
(excitedly) 'm going into the City with you
(panicked) What --
Drew  on her granola and a little milk trickles out her nose
Isn't that great
We can do some shopping, have lunch, real girl stuff
Won't that be fun
If you want to have fun, 'm the one who should go, not Mother Teresa over there
Drew is still choking -- pretty badly
Let me know if you want me to do the Heimlich
It'd be cool to have you owe me your life
The granola goes down and she sucks air
You okay
(still clearing) No
mean, it's
impossible
've got every minute accounted for right up to the interview
Blue and red
It won't work
just thought
you know
've been working and we haven't had a chance to spend much time together
() 8
: Quinn, the normally thick-skinned
, is tearing up
and both my babies are going away to college next Fall
She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder
Don't be sad, Mom
Just think, when Drew leaves for school, you won't be losing a daughter, you'll be losing an anal-retentive social misfit who will be voted most likely to die a virgin
Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder
'm sorry, Mom
It's really sweet of you
But don't worry
Parker will be living here with you forever since no college on earth will ever take her
Stop it, you two
Mom blows her nose
It's not fair you guys get to go into the City and  don't
Don't you have a chem test, young lady
Chemistry
Please
Name one time you ever used chemistry in your life
(beat) Good point
(adamant) use chemistry every day
() 9
: You're a    doctor, Mom
'm not going to    be a doctor
can't even say    the word 'orifice,' let alone put    a finger up one
The   of Drew's alarm  signals time to go
Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the news that her mother's going to accompany her
(worried) Time to go
'  - Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite
Almost trembling with tension, she  and immediately sits down at her desk with her , turning to the present : ,      - 2:07 --   , , , ,  101
(
) Come on, honey
Let's tear up Manhattan
With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself and tries some self-reassurance
You're smart
You're resourceful
You'll find a way to make it work
She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but something in the smile suggests '
Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag
- MacLEOD  - Quinn hops in her Saab
the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in
10
'  - Quinn's   goes off
Quinn looks annoyed, checks the incoming number
Drew closes her eyes and prays
(to phone) Doctor MacLeod
(beat; winking at Drew) 'm sorry, but my itinerary is booked solid today
Call Dr
Wessels
He's covering for me
(beat) He did
(beat) Are you sure it's the baby's head
(beat) All right
'm coming
Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound disappointment, turns to Drew
'm sorry, hon
It's a Blue Light special in Maternity
Every bed's full and some poor woman is about to give birth in the gift shop have to go in
Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom
Ah, darn it, Mom
That's a shame
It's like fate is conspiring against us
know
You absolutely, positively have to promise me we'll do it another time
promise
better hurry
Have Parker drop you at the train station on her way to school, will you
Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss
() 11
: Kill 'em in that interview
(beat) Mom, you know,  might not get in
Are you kidding me
You're Drew MacLeod
Nobody's smarter, nobody works harder and nobody, and mean nobody, is ever more prepared
Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street
With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you
" This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in her Honda Accord
Drew signals her to stop, so of course her sister   and jets into the street
Hey
Stop
Drew takes off running after the car
- Commuters all jump from their cars and into the station
'  - Parker pulls up to the curb at the station
Drew collects her bag
Good luck with your interview
Drew pauses, holding the door open
You know, Parker
Chemistry is important
When you think about it, everything's made of chemicals
() 12
: Oh, 'm interested in chemistry
Just not the kind with all the numbers and stinky test tubes
Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train station
Parker , looks to the  on the seat next to her
Ah, chemistry
- Drew finds a seat
She neatly folds her jacket and sets it next to her
She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind her -- just right
Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap
pen goes in the little holder
Coffee from her Thermos
After laying out her interview materials, she turns to her reflection in the window
(low; rehearsing) Professor Spaulding
Good afternoon
'm Drew MacLeod
An  takes the aisle seat next to her, and after a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away
is quietly reading the paper or staring off into their own world, wondering why their life has lead them to this sad moment when
they're all distracted by an , singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun
" It's Parker, wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full train car
Drew stares at her, dumbfounded
What do you think you're doing
(too loud; with headphones on) Looking for a seat
() 13
: This can't be happening
Wait, know
This is one of those Ground Hog Day dreams, isn't it
Drew pinches herself too hard
Ow
(to Parker) 'm awake now
You're supposed to disappear
(still too loud) You know,  just got this itch
Then scratch it and get back to school
couldn't concentrate anyway
'm too
distracted today
You're permanently distracted
It's called Attention Deficit Disorder
(spotting her Blackberry) Is this about that chat room guy
It is, isn't it
look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and she pulls them off
No
It's about spontaneity, which you obviously wouldn't know anything about
swear to God, Parker, you go through boyfriends like Junior Mints
It's pathetic
Pathetic
You want to talk about pathetic
At least  don't count getting accidentally felt up in dodge ball as my first date
() () 14
: (') You're going to be eighteen and you've never even  a boyfriend
The  furrows his brow at Drew -- never
Is this any of your business
He goes back to his paper
This is ridiculous
don't    have time for this today
Fine
Don't graduate from high school
Make a mess of your life over some complete stranger
don't     care
But leave me out
have something important  need    to accomplish today, so please    go away
(to Parker) Would you like this seat so you two can fight
/ No thank you
Drew's
have to mentally preview my day now
can't talk anymore
Parker turns to go, then remembers something
Uh, Drew
Do you have any money
don't have enough for a ticket
Drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her sister
The Executive peers over his spectacles at Parker with the old paternal reprimand look
Please
Like you never ditched school
: 15
- Parker's got her headphones back on and is  Uncle Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car
'You don't know how you met me
' But when she spots the   the front of the car, she abruptly stops, slips down in he seat and slides past the   next to her into the aisle
Excuse me
Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket- taking Conductor and out the back of the train car
- '  - Parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if the coast is clear
Sounds good
She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes, closes the door and '
He smiles
Ticket, please
Why don't  save the b
s
story and just ask you to cut me a break this one time because  know you've got a big heart and you remember what it was like when you were young and
and
(off the Conductor's look) randy
- Parker's on the platform
The Conductor climbs back on the train into the
(calling after) guess you were never young and randy
This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window, smiling and giving her a little victory wave
16
- The Conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take when he sees Drew
Very funny
Excuse me
Let's go
He takes her by the arm
What are you doing
Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little inflatable lap desk falling to the floor
tried to be nice about it, but if you want the police involved, this is the way to do it
Police
didn't do anything
No ticket, no train ride
(realizing) No
That's not me
That was my twin sister you threw off
Young lady, in thirty years  have heard every possible line but that's the lamest ever
(pointing) She's right there
No Parker
He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they   , -   /-/ /   -- they really do  , () 17
: He smiles: You okay
'm
ouch
She's fine, considering she should be in jail
As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and Dream Guy share a last look before she's
left on the platform just as the train's pulling out
Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her wits about her
This   can't be happening
have a
a
little paper thingy
What   are they called
Ticket have   a ticket
It's right
She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly
On her hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket in the mess
The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as it pulls away
He just waves, victorious
Parker    steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor spots    her
He looks from one sister to the other -- oops,    mistake
But it's too late
Sheepishly, he climbs inside    and the train is gone
(to the gods) Parker steps up from behind her
You get kicked off, too
Why didn't you just buy a ticket
Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away
() 18
: Don't
What happened to your head
Oh, just a minor concussion sustained while the Conductor was throwing me off the train because he thought  was you sneaking back on the train
Sorry
'll bet
Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the ticket counter
The  on her forehead is gonna be a doozey
(calling after) am
Where are you going
To see when the next train leaves
already -- But Drew's inside the stationhouse
-- did
They said something about a delay
Parker follows into the stationhouse
- Packed with frustrated
Drew's standing in a long line at the ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold shoulder on
Parker, who walks right through to the street side
19
-   - Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded
She scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded jostle for the few remaining
get into a shoving match
To the left, a couple of     -- standard car service rigs -- sit , each with a next to it, holding up his sign with his client's name scratched on it
An  (#2) passes her, finger in the air, signaling the   who holds a sign that read: "Wilcox
" #2 That's me
With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind
Parker raises an eyebrow
Hm
The second driver () with a head like a cinder block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and holding up a sign, "
" Parker shoots a finger into the air
This barely gets his attention but he nods, nonchalantly
Parker signals again -- one minute -- then turns back inside
Drew has reached the counter, where a bitter who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of angry commuters
That can't be
have to be there before two
Well, maybe if you flap your arms real fast you can fly there, because you won't get there on a train
(about to explode) What did you just say
() 20
: Parker arrives in the nick of time, pulling her by the arm
Come on
Hurry
got us a ride
Let go of my arm
But Parker drags her away
Drew shoots a look back at the Clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her
- Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car
What's this
car service
Car service
You couldn't have called for a
But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a thousand times
Morning, miss
Good morning
Thank you
My sister's coming, too
Drew        buy she's only got this instant to consider
She glances at the descending on a lone approaching , engulfing it
You want to make that interview, or not
Drew lets herself be pulled inside
Bennie shuts the door and waddles around to his side
- Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and afraid
Bennie checks his invoice
() 21
: So you're headed to the Teamster's Hall on Second Street
(chewing a lip) You know, Mister
She checks his Chauffeur's License up front:        Benjamin Loyola
Loyola
Bennie
Mr
Bennie
We have a slight change of itinerary
We need to go into Manhattan
57th and 5th will be fine
Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit
It's pre-paid
No skin off my nose
(whispering throughout) Pre-paid
What's 57th and 5th
(whispering throughout) Barneys
Not Barneys
We've got five hours
Relax
He   the  and off they go
Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's going on
She leans into her sister and
This was supposed to be someone else's car, wasn't it
() 22
: So
Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can read: 'Scarpelli'
We're supposed to be Italian
Northern Italian
This is so
wrong
What
You need to get to that interview
We now have a ride
We will pay for the ride
End of big deal
This is when Bennie's    and he answers it
Yeah
(beat) No
The city
(beat) What'a you talkin' about
Bennie glances into the  , smiling at the girls
already got 'em
but his smile      as he listens
The girls exchange doubtful looks
It gets worse
They're right here in the car
(to girls) 'Scuse me
Bennie     but doesn't realize he's left the intercom button on so they can still hear his half of the conversation
The girls are
() 23
: (low to Drew) Not good
(swallowing) What's happening
(to phone) Don't you think that's a little severe
mean, they didn't see nothin' yet
They can't hear nothin'
and they're now scared as hell
You're the boss
(beat) Take it easy
'll fix it
(beat) No,  don't have a shovel
Not today
It'll be a big mess
Besides,  just had this suit cleaned
The girls want
'll take 'em to the wharf, what difference does it make
Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it
(whispered terror) Parker,  think maybe we should get out
Parker sees the
agree
How about
Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her door open and pulls Drew into the street
An     its  as they dash for the sidewalk
(
) Hey
Where you goin'
24
- They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race around the first corner, looking back over their shoulder
He's stuck at the light
Here comes the Lincoln storming around the corner
He has no respect for traffic laws
They run into the first  and hunker down by a The Lincoln flies past
They dash back out, the same way they came
Bennie   the
They round the same corner going the opposite way and Parker pulls them into the first door
- - where they crouch down the magazine rack
Among the magazines is   with a picture of a Chinese Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: " " Parker peers over the top and out the window
'  -- slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street, Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them
Is he gone
can't believe this
What did you get us into
We lost him
Wow
That was a rush
rush
Are you out of your mind
(
) Hey
Give me a quarter, will ya
Spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly with a Slushee in his hand
They stand
Parker reaches in her pocket
() 25
: - Get outta here, Uncle Jerry
(to Homeless Guy) don't have any change, but here
Parker starts to find the Homeless Guy a dollar but Drew reaches over to stop her
Parker, you're only feeding the poor man's disease
Buy him a healthy snack
just as the Homeless Guy reaches for the dollar and the
We watch in       , , --
- ,
The Homeless Guy snags the dollar
gotta go
And he
Parker
Ew
That stinks
That's not just Slushee
The -  approaches them, shaking his head
- It's Mad Dog
Look at that mess
It's gonna smell up the store all day
Drew appears , unable to form words so Parker speaks for her
May we use your bathroom please
The cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down Drew's blank face
- Gas station at the end of the block
Have a nice day
26
'  ''  - , who has no teeth, hands over the restroom key to the girls
The key is attached to a full-sized Burt , wrinkling his nose
You know, it's not my place to say, but you young girls got your whole lives ahead of you
You shouldn't be drinkin' at this hour of the day
That's what  keep telling her
'Round the side
'  ''  - The girls practically have to drag the key around to the restroom on the side
Parker puts the key in and slowly
slowly
opens the -- , : : - Sitting side by side
sits in front of them with her --  who's standing on the seat facing the girls
Drew's  on her forehead is large and inflamed, her hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number four and glucose
She is in a   , only staring straight ahead
Parker's playing peek-a-boo with the baby and trying to lighten up her sister's mood
Everything's going to be fine
(to baby) Peek-a-boo
() () 27
: (') (to Drew) We're practically there
We'll get you cleaned up, you'll get into the program and
(to baby) Peek-a-boo
(to Drew) we'll both look back on this and laugh our butts off
The   all over Drew
She looks sideways at her sister
will never, ever, forgive you
- The bus pulls over then pulls away, leaving the girls on the sidewalk
See
New York
We made it
could be arrested for vagrancy looking like this
Listen
've got an idea
No
No ideas
'm going straight to that interview and wait, without moving or speaking, especially to you, for four hours
(ignoring her) Come on
We're going to the Plaza
We can be Eloise
We'll get a nice room, you can take a shower and 'll swap clothes with you
Simple as that
Do you have the slightest clue what that would cost
() 28
: So
You've got the emergency credit card Mom gave you, right
Drew's suddenly looking at her
What's wrong
(dawning realization) Oh
My
God
Where's your, uh, stuff
(near coma) left it in his car
Oh
He knows where  live
He's going to hunt me down and kill me
Come on, Drew
don't think even the Mafia kills people just for scamming a ride
Quit being paranoid
(beat) So, we don't do the Plaza
've got
Parker digs in her pockets
Six dollars and thirty-two cents
That won't get me hosed down at a car wash
What are we thinking
You've got your secret-safety twenty
(beat) My secret-safety twenty
Of course
But it's only for emergencies
() 29
: Parker looks her sister right in the eye
Yeah
Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls out a twenty, then realizes: Hey, how'd you know about my secret-safety twenty
That's not important now
But let's just say that it's a good thing for you  think those shoes are so ugly  never borrowed them
(pointing) Hey, how about there
Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads: --  ,
No
want to get clean, not contract hepatitis
(sotto voce) Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents
We touch nothing
Parker leads them inside
This looks like a good place to get your throat cut fighting over a dime's worth of crack
There's no real       lobby, just a small area to stand at the "desk" which is       behind iron bars
Behind the iron bars a rabbit-eared        with a busted-in tube houses a dead houseplant
An        old easy chair leaks stuffing
(swallowing) Hello
Anybody
() 30
: Above, a
Something
Then a to them
(
) Keep your pants on
What'dya want
The girls look behind them, nobody
Behind the bars
Still nobody
What the hell
(
) don't got all day
(uh
) We need a room
with a shower
Just for an hour
There's the sound of something  across the floor and then the    appears behind the counter
Now he's standing on a  and we don't know what he was doing behind the counter
Sixty bucks
(getting oriented) Hi
You want the room or not
Sixty dollars an hour for this -- (interrupting; covering) -- really nice place
How much for half an hour
Maybe if you two were in school you could figure out that half a sixty is thirty
We've only got twenty-five
() 31
: You think because 'm short you can just charm me into making some deal, is that it
No, not at all
It's all we have
Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents
Are you the one that stinks so bad
(insulted) had a little accident, okay
All right, all right, don't    get your underwear in a bunch
As a public service, just 'cause    you stink so bad, you can have    it for twenty-five
He retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach between the bars
Ten-dollar deposit on key
What part of 'That is all the money we have' didn't make sense to you
Sir,   that's every last cent we have   in the world
swear to you,   we aren't planning to steal your   key
give you some special deal, the next thing you know, you two are telling everybody, hey, this midget was a real sap
We gave him some sob story and the little guy just busted up into crocodile tears and handed over the key
() 32
: promise we won't tell anyone
Will we, Drew
Not a word
Girl Scout's honor
He grudgingly holds out the key for Parker, who takes it and hands it to Drew while she gets the money out
-- sensing something, she looks down at her feet where a   is licking the sweet stuff off her shoes
There's a rather   while this horror sinks in, then: Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out the door
Drew
Parker follows her
Come back with my key
The Desk Clerk jumps off his stool, opens his cage and follows them into the street
- Panicked, Drew sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and the Desk Clerk in tow
Laying the hammer down, the Desk Clerk blasts past Parker -- he's a midget, but he's got wheels
Drew
: - is giving birth
Her husband holds her hand
Quinn and a nurse are at her feet
() 33
: Mrs
Greenspan
You're going to have to help
need you to push
But they don't have her attention which is riveted on
"  " - , , Did you see that
Honey
The baby
Please
: " "  - " "   and  descend on the crowd
All right
Who's the wise guy
Parker pulls Drew out of the pile-up and grabs the key, tossing it away from them, sending the Desk Clerk scrambling after it
The two girls    around the corner
Winded, they stop
Man, that little guy could really motor
Why'd you bolt
There was a rat, Parker
rat the size of a Doberman eating my foot
That was all our money
Our money
Key down, you're going to have an attack
() 34
: Drew's sucking on her inhaler but is so irate she spits out the words
Parker, it was not 'our' money and this is not 'our' day in New York
What it is, is quite possibly the most important day of my life
've resigned myself to the fact that you don't give a crap about what you do with yours, but if you could find it in your heart, your tiny, cold steel heart, to respect what this means to me,  would appreciate it
But Parker's not listening
She's staring intently
where several   are parked, the  chatting next to a  /
Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee
Parker spots him and freezes
You're not even listening
That's typical
Look, we're splitting up
Give me back my secret safety money
(still looking past Drew) You know how  told you not to be paranoid
Paranoid
What  meant was, it isn't paranoia if someone really is chasing you
Parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that Drew should look across the street
What's wrong with your eyes
(whispering) It's him
() 35
: Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes
Quiet
Don't run
He'll see us
Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off quickly down the street
Bennie -- squinting across at them
Can he make them out in the crowd
He nods to  , tosses his coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel
The girls break into a run
How'd he find us
Maybe it's just coincidence
Or maybe She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th
Oops
Come on
Parker leads her into traffic,  , as they weave their way across
On the far side, a pulls away from the curb and at the last minute, Parker spots a fresh pile of
, which she manages to leap
Drew, however, '
She closes her eyes
Jump
Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow manages to get across it to the curb
For just a , we see her surprised face
Hm
did it
Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits in full stride, slips on, and   on his ass
This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch inside some revolving doors
36
- '  - , Bennie's getting up, brushing the crap off
When a   at him, he gives it an Italian salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb it's clear: He's lost the girls
don't want to do this anymore
want to be done
No more rats, no more mob hit men
Well, Cinderella, your wish has come true
(gesturing) Voila, La Plaza, mademoiselle
So
Hello
No dinero
Yeah
've got what 'd like to call a 'creative solution' to that
No
'm calling Mom
What good will that do
(beat) 'll have her
uh
Have her what
Hi, Mom
Could you leave that baby halfway outta there and drive into the city
Dad, then
Dad, hey
Drew
Complete loser
Couldn't get to an interview by myself, need full bail out
Yeah
'm the one who was going to change the world,  just couldn't get across town
() 37
: Damn it, Parker, my itinerary is shot to hell
Blue, red -- Her
don't even know what that means
'm running out of time
(noticing) Is that guy looking at me
Parker starts to look
Don't look
When you ask a question like that, the person is going to look
Drew drags her behind a palm
Sure enough, across the lobby, a guy dressed as ( ) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on them
think he was
Drew, we haven't done anything
Yeah, but 'm standing in the lobby of the Plaza looking like a deranged street person who might attack at any moment
In fact, might attack at any moment
The  behind them opens
Let's go
The girls slip into the elevator
When it closes, Morty's watching
-   - The girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end of the hall where Parker stops and peers back around the corner
() 38
: (whispering) What are we doing
And why am whispering
We're getting you a shower
Blake Greer pulled this at the Sheraton after the prom
Great
Now we're emulating Blake Greer, voted most likely to commit a felony before having to shave
We're not going to steal anything
We're just going to sneak in, use a little soap and water and get out
Oh, we're not going to steal anything
Super
Just a little 'breaking and entering
' We're not going to break anything
(beat) We are going to enter, however
No
No
No
Shhh
here comes somebody
a door swings open and , wealthy Bostonians,  their suite
-- at the opposite end of the hallway, Parker and Drew aren't the only ones watching
with one lazy eye, , pauses with his roller and carefully peeks around the corner
It's the New York Kennel Club, Emile, not the New York Knickerbockers
Please call the caterer and cancel the beer
() 39
: The         for them and they step in
Parker for       the door of their suite
it's just about to close when       she      , just getting a hand       on it
She lies there on the floor, holding the door and to Drew
Hurry up
No
(beat) didn't want to have to do this, but
look in the mirror behind you
-- bracing herself, she turns slowly
: '  - Practically sewn to Parker, Drew follows her into the suite, both nervous, tiptoeing
(tentatively) Housekeeping
: - At the end of the hallway, the  watches the suite door close
Hm
What are those girls doing
' It's lavish, yaddada yaddada
can't do this
Drew, you're not a criminal
You just smell like one
This way
() 40
: Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master bedroom and slowly  them
There, on the bed, is  , defending champion of the New York Kennel Club Dog Show with his little crown sticking straight up, he may be the most absurd-looking dog in history
He simply eyes them
He might even be smiling
Oh, no
Oh my god
a
(puzzled) What the hell is it
dog
'm itching already
See
Are my arms red
Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door
Key down
'll take him in the living room and keep a lookout
You just get in that shower
Parker approaches The Emperor
(baby talk) Hi, little guy
You don't look so tough, huh
You don't look much like a dog, actually
More like Woody Woodpecker
Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps into Parker's arms
You're cute, aren't you, in a freakazoidal kinda way
She takes him into the living room and moves to the door
Was your daddy a rat
Is that it
Well,  still like you
Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to keep a lookout
41
' The hallway's empty
But The Emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into the hallway, then turns  face her
Come on
Let's play
Come back here, little ratdog
Come to Mommy Parker
Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to spook him into running away from her, she steps into the hallway
- But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and dashes down the hallway
Bad ratdog
She chases him down the hallway     and then around the corner where they have to dodge     cans of paints, a ladder, until finally The Emperor slides     on some plastic sheeting, careens into a can of     mauve paint and is Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see the Painter () with the now-mauve Emperor in his arms
(breathless) Wow
Thank you
Thank you
Bye bye
No
He turns and  for the stairwell door marked Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after him: That's not your dog
Hey
42
as they open   and the    (Morty) steps out, looking both ways and spotting one thing awry
a shoe holding open the door to the Lo Bianchos' suite
: '  -   - Drew finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky clothes and gets        : (
) Hello
Mrs
Lo Biancho
House security
Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling it off its hanger and covering herself
'  -   - The   snoops toward the bedroom doors
Just as he reaches for the handle, the door swings open, , clocking him and dropping him
Wrapped in the shower curtain, Drew races across the living room
Just as she reaches the hallway, Parker's there, also at a dead run and they don't even break stride
- (panicked) There's a man in there
Somebody took the dog
They reach the end of the hallway and are
Only one out
Parker   the window to the fire escape and they climb out
/ - and scurry down the stairs only to find that '
() 43
: Parker hangs and then drops onto the top of a with one side of the lid still closed, then jumps to the alley
Hurry up
But '    and to complicate matters, she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around herself
'll, uh, go around
Are you out of your mind
It's only a little ways
- Rubbing his sore head, Morty the Security Guy lumbers down the hallway
Mr
and Mrs
Lo Biancho get out of the elevator: (peeved) When competing in a dog show, best to bring one's dog along, yes
thought you had him, dear
(holding up her hands) See
Empty
But now they both notice the  to their suite is wide open
Oh, dear God
The elderly couple do their version of a panicked run inside

Baby
He turns around and lopes back to the suite
Mrs
Lo Biancho

Please
Please help
Someone took your baby
The Emperor is missing
(somewhat relieved) The Emperor is a dog, right
Not 'a' dog, no '
Morty pulls his  as he backs out the door and heads down the hall
(to radio) This is Remote One to base, Remote One to base
Code 12,  repeat, Code 12

) You goin' to lunch already, Morty

Didn't you read your manual

: Just call the damn police and patch me through
The Emperor's been kidnapped

Political

) You want me to call  about a dog

Got it
Kill, fire
That order
: - Drew's still  on the fire escape
can't do it
Yes you can
where Roger appears with The Emperor
Surprised        to see the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,       but they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and       he quietly makes his way to his  (painted on the       back and sides: "Michelangelo's Painting:  Masterpiece         every time"
No  can't
Have fun in prison
Under 'Summer Internships' on your college application, you can write 'license plate manufacturing
' () 46
: Roger's   , drawing Parker's attention
She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears around the corner into traffic
Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the dumpster
(astonished) did it
Oops, the curtain starts to slip
When she reaches for it she loses her balance and suddenly --  -- nosedives into the dumpster
The curtain floats at Parker's feet
(
) Get out of there
(
) (beat) Give me
my
curtain
Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out
They hurry off down the alley
-- Morty appears
Stop
Bring back that dog

-- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker
He thinks we have the dog

: It's   from the train and for a confused they look into each other's familiar faces where we read recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then: You know, one of us is gonna get hurt if we keep doing this
signal that the police are now involved
Hey, complete stranger
Get off my sister
Parker yanks Drew from underneath Dream Guy
'm, uh, late for this place, thing, where 'm supposed to be
College
Interview
Where at
But Parker's got her by the arm and she can only call back over her shoulder
before disappearing into the  on the sidewalk
(too late) Me, too
comes Morty who, without time to react, trips headfirst over Bike Messenger Guy
- The girls weave through the  but spot a to a halt in front of them and quickly take a left into
- Where to now
Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door -- locked -- the next door   as if by divine providence and two    step past them out while the girls step inside
48
-  - Chaos
, , , " "  and the famous couture fashion designer, , are mid-show and friggin' frantic
(French accent) Where are they
No more breaks
Do you hear me
We have a show to do, you nitwits
Models
You have hollow gourds for heads
The kind they make those Mexican rattles out of
(always at his elbow) Maracas
Maracas
Maracas that take coffee breaks when  am paying them a Bobo spots the girls coming through the back door and physically grabs them both, pushing them at the Showrunner
Hair
Makeup
(Parker) Daywear
(Drew) Clubbing
Vite
This is when he gets a load of Drew's matted hair, running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take
Hm
Does he like it
(confess) Is that Helmut Lang
(recovering himself) Go
The Showrunner shoves Drew one way, Parker the other -- Drew looks at her -- what the hell
Parker :
and virtually surround them
the raises his brush and scissors, but
The rest of the team stops, watching him make his decision
He shrugs
() 49
: Perfection
He excuses himself and the others begin shoving her into couture
: - And   the   surrounding Parker parts, revealing her   in a very un-Parker-like, super-chic business suit
She   catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls her   eyes
Boring
The   parts and    we are stunned to see they've chosen to drape her in a    show-stopping couture that is some sort    of marriage between dominatrix and nun, complete with a    habit and black leather bikini
who spots Drew and is, for the first time in the movie, speechless
Why does this not surprise me
and the  grabs Drew
Excuse me, but 'm supposed to be going to my college interview
That's rich
model going to college
What next
Talking monkeys
and pushes her through the curtains and
- go a hundred
Blinded, Drew stumbles forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the catwalk
--
This is when Drew catches sight of herself on a at the end of the walk
() 50
: Her first instinct is to , but suddenly -- '
Drew recovers herself a bit
Wow
They're clapping for me
- Parker's watching through the curtains when she spots Morty leading two   (  ) through the back door
Uh-oh
The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker takes the initiative and
jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she was born to it
Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in her    when Parker approaches her and
throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy executive
and leans into her sister: (whispering) The hotel guy's here
The juxtaposition of the draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into for the inspiration of the artist and they call him out
Bobo
Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing kisses and heading for the girls
(louder) And the police
Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty peeking from backstage, and they  , leaping off the front of the stage into the audience like punks jumping into the mosh pit
() 51
: The   holds them up and they toward the rear of the room
Everybody washed their hands, right
Spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the catwalk
Realizing he'll never get through the crowd, he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but
and he does a complete guess that explains why he's a security guard
who bust out the back doors of the large room and unwittingly
-  - right back into The Plaza lobby
(realizing) Perfect
Is this what they call 'returning to the scene of the crime'
Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they have to pass by
the   and the other   , (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling Mrs
Lo Biancho
When  and the  come through the doors behind them, however, there's no choice
The girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible heading for the revolving doors but they overhear: () 52
: assure you, Mr
and Mrs
Lo Biancho, The Plaza will do everything in its power to see that The Emperor is safely returned and that the criminals are brought to justice
Justice
want them executed
Tortured first, slowly, and then beheaded
The Plaza's policy is of course to serve you in any capacity we can
Morty spots the girls across the lobby just as they reach the revolving doors
(calling) Bruce
10-80 at the wagon wheel
Bruce looks over to Morty like he's speaking Slavic, but Morty's furiously pointing and Bruce sees
break for the revolving doors
Parker gets there first, plunges in so fast that a   is tossed headlong into the lobby
Drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of the very high   catches, throwing her forward and sandwiching her in the revolving door
(no breath) Park
-- Parker sees Drew caught in the door as Bruce, Morty and the cops close in
Quickly, Parker pushes the door back, releasing Drew, who jumps in and swings out
- Then, Parker       , spinning it so fast the security guys and cops can't jump in
- The four men all stand there, watching the spinning door
() 53
: Damn it
Then, just    to their right, an   walks through the regular    door just adjacent the revolving doors
All four share    a sheepish look -- uh, maybe we should have thought of    that -- then  outside
- The police and security look left, right, across the street
Where'd they go
They couldn't have gone very far
We'll split up
(pointing) You go that way
You take Fifth
Come on, get on your horse
Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in separate directions
Neither Hogan nor his partner moves
Coffee
Sure
Williamson and Hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up next to a
(to hot dog vendor) Two black
Where do you think those two went
Beats me
They didn't have any stupid dog with them from what could see
Might have stashed it
() 54
: Maybe they ate it
The cops giggle at this
The rent-a-cop said the mutt's worth like 50 's
That makes it grand theft, my friend
Five to ten
where a   () smiles at the two policemen
(to blind cashier) Hey, Speedy
You didn't see a couple of blondes run past here, did you
Yep
Couldn't miss 'em
Real criminal types
Looked like they were headed to Mexico
That's where they all go
Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter right next to Speedy
See you around
Not if  see you first
The cops head back to The Plaza
say we put Abbott and Costello on the ransom watch
don't want to be stuck in the same room all day with Leona Helmsley's nasty stepsister
() 55
: With the Detectives gone, Speedy turns up his nose and waves the air, fanning away a bad smell
Whew
You know, it's not some old wives' tale about blind people having an acute sense of smell
Sorry
So
What did you do with that dog
We didn't steal it,  swear
painter did
You girls best give yourselves up and tell 'em the story
(torn) He's right, Parker
Of course he's right
We're going to march in there and give ourselves up right this minute
They will, of course, take us down to the precinct, call Mom and Dad, we'll give our statement, they'll grill us under hot lights for a few hours, force us to confess with some tricky good cop/bad cop routine and the next thing you know we're doing five to ten in Attica
Drew checks her watch
So we'll turn ourselves in right after the interview
May  make one suggestion
() 56
: Sure
Hit the showers before you do anything else
indicates Parker's  is receiving a message
We're facing felony charges, Parker
Maybe you can do your on- line flirting later
Better yet, he can see you during visitor's hours
Parker reads the incoming  from

Warren works in the city
Warren
So you lied, right to my face
No, Drew, this isn't about the chat room guy
Nah
But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on -- she has to lean around Speedy's legs
buying a newspaper peers down at the strange sight
(to guy) Take your daughters to work day
The guy pays for his paper, leaves
:
' Are you listening to me
Give me that stupid thing
Drew reaches for the Blackberry

: Knock it off, Drew
This guy might be able to help
He lives here
Parker, you have completely lost your mind if you can be thinking about boys at a time like this

You can't possibly know somebody who works at the United Nations
Maybe he meant United Sub Sandwiches

Parker pockets the Blackberry
So
We're going to the United Nations to use the restroom
How convenient
You arrange a little date while your sister's future hangs in the balance
Look, he said he'd help and it's only a couple blocks away
You got a better idea
Speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand

Thank you, Mr
Speedy
You're quite welcome
Good luck in that interview

You'll see
There's still plenty of time
You'll get cleaned up, we can trade clothes
this is a nice suit, huh
Right
(abrupt) Yes
You're going to get accepted, then we can explain the misunderstanding about the dog to the police and everything will be okay
Maybe after the police forgive us for sneaking into someone else's hotel room, we can ask them to please keep the mob hit man from whacking us and dropping us into the marina so he doesn't get his suit dirty
First things first
Parker,  know you're trying to cheer me up, but  have to be honest
This is all your fault

, geeky in a Clark Kent way and nice enough looking but definitely not a male model, leans into a petite  and her (conspiratorially) can't tell you how much 've looked forward to this
The Brunette looks at him like he's a serial killer
(in Russian) Momma
Her fierce-looking   gets in the Tour Guide's face
Sorry
My mistake
This is when Drew notices Williamson and Hogan and approaching a
, flashing their badges
Oh, shit
What now
(out loud) Warren
Does anyone know Warren Collier
() 66
: The Tour Guide,  , looks over at them
Parker
Warren moves back to Drew and Parker
Gee, Warren
Isn't that strange
didn't recognize you from your picture
Yeah, , uh
(urgently) We don't have time for this now
Do you have an office or someplace private we could go
just have to do this tour and
But Williamson and Hogan, led by the
Security Guy, the lobby
Drew grabs Warren by the arm and turns him
We'll get back to that
What's going on
Parker looks Warren right in the eye
This is a test
It's important
(beat) Okay
Let me get somebody to cover for me
Warren leads them into a small adjoining office
-   - where another   is taking a break
() 67
: Hey, Angie, take the 11:00 for me, will you
( ) No way
Judge Judy's on
Drew grabs Angie by the collar, lifts her up
Angie
Take the 11:00
(to Warren) You owe me, Warren
Angie heads out to take the tour
Parker turns on Warren
Are you a lying sack, or what
What was  supposed to do liked you
If 'd sent a real picture, would you have met me
That's not the point
That means no
At least this way got to see you before you blow me off
No one is blowing you off, Warren
As a matter of fact, we're very happy to see you, aren't we, Parker
guess
And we're grateful for your help
This is my sister, Drew
Not-a-twin, huh
() 68
: That's a joke
Yeah, well
guess everybody would like the world to see them a little bit differently than they are
(quickly interjecting) Super
Now that that's all settled, is there a restroom  can get to without going out there
What's wrong with going out there
Police, for one thing
Police
thought you guys were joking
It's the kind of joke that will be a lot funnier a few years from now
Well that door's the only way out
There's a restroom at the end of the main hall
Parker opens the office door, peeking out
They there
don't see 'em
who Parker can't see because her line of sight is blocked by the office door
They must be searching the building
() 69
: What'd you guys do, anyway
Mug a couple supermodels
Let's go
With Warren leading the way, they  the office
-   - The three make their way across the vast lobby, but before they reach the main hall
(
) (spotting them) Hey
You two
Stop
This way
Almost instinctively, they go   , Warren and Parker breaking left, Drew right
Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn, another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth
Even while running frantically, she tries to smile politely at everyone she passes until she spots a ' room and quickly ditches inside
- '  - She hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and puts her feet up
She tries to catch her breath
from the stall next to her
Somebody's in
Another - can't be ignored
(to person in stall) Are you okay
(near fatally nauseous) Ohhh
'm so sick
The mussels at lunch
You have to help me
() 70
: 'm kind of in my own private hell right now
What's your name
Drew
Drew
it's vitally important
comes skidding from under the stall
Please
You have to take this to Canada
Uh, Canada
It's sort of far away
(struggling) In the Assembly
Give the file to Mr
Wakefield, the Canadian representative
(
) Please
can't
get up
You want me to take this to the Canadian Representative to the United Nations
Hurry
This is a crisis
What can she possibly do
(confused but
) Okay
Drew  the stall and goes to the door
Where's the Assembly
To the left
Run
Drew peeks out the door
It looks clear
Out she goes
: 71
On the run, Warren and Parker ditch through a door marked , Hogan appears from around the corner
- Vacant and quiet
The    and Hogan It's a small room with a few canvas mail sacks piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies
An in-house  mutely broadcasts the now empty Nothing here, Hogan closes the door
, one of the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head up
He's gone
Parker pops up from the same sack
Face to face, there's an awkward moment of attraction between them
(no better idea) You have nice breath
Thank you
(beat) Maybe we should get out of this sack
: - Drew peeks in through the door, reading the on the desks
Bangkok, Borneo, Bulgaria
Canada
The  are in the middle of a heated that we hear being translated (and we see in subtitles)
(Chinese; subtitles) Impossible
This would be globally destabilizing
(pointing angry finger) Hah
Posturing and rhetoric
() 72
: The   is sitting gingerly in his chair, shifting uncomfortably
He looks pale, shaky
Drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his desk with the file
(whispering) Sir
He puts a hand to his stomach -- he's struggling
#2 (ugh; groan) Yes
Oh, no
You didn't have the mussels at lunch, too, did you
Even as she holds out the file, he races past her, puckering his bum
She watches him waddle up the stairs    , Drew sees them
Uh, oh
The only thing she can do to make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian Rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of the Assembly members
She sits up, shuffles the files around
Glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone else is wearing the
She puts one on
Williamson's gaze comes to rest on
'
Hm
That looks familiar
This is when the   stands, furious, and points an accusatory finger at Drew
This crisis falls at the feet of one nation and one nation only
() 73
: How do you defend such a position
The world is waiting to hear
These are fighting words
The Assembly grows
Drew wishes she could   somewhere off planet
She gulps air
Glances left, right
' : Well, 'm not certain
This furrows some brows
(recovering) that   to defend our position
Ah, yes, some knowing nods
leaning over to confer with the  : (subtitles) Is she new
Beats me
She's hot
Weird hairdo
That is absurd
Absurd
Uhhh
where now
She notices the  the Rep in the bathroom gave her and holds it up, shaking it for emphasis
() 74
: (dramatic emphasis) Not so absurd, since  have the documents right here in my possession
This draws a    throughout the hall
The Chinese Rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to confer with his
: - Parker's peeking through the door, checking the hallway
How are we going to find Drew
Something tells me that won't be too tough
Warren points to the
Parker's jaw drops
Her sister is addressing the entire
Assembly
: - Drew glances Williamson
And besides, who said absurd is necessarily bad
Sometimes absurd is good
For instance, absurd can be sort of
funny
In conclusion, propose that all of you should talk amongst yourselves
(quickly) Thank you
Like Cinderella at Midnight, she turns and races up the stairs as the Assembly is in complete turmoil -- his gavel
Canada has proposed further debate
The United States of America seconds the motion
75
- Drew busts through the doors just as Warren and Parker come running with the Detectives chasing them
The three of them make for the front door but a   comprised of a hundred young   blocks their
Warren thinks fast and
Jin zshe miya
, the Japanese Girls all pour outside, Warren and the Girls following
- Once outside, he
Dingo cashito,   ezukai
The   turn around and , blocking Williamson and Hogan's
The three of them run for the line of taxis
You speak Japanese
may not look like an underwear model, but 'm smarter than a hundred of them put together
Warren grabs a Taxi door
Come on
We don't have any money
'm smart  rich
Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through the little Japanese Girls
Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just ahead of
Bennie's
He's holding the door for a cigar- chewing  but watching the Girls climb into the cab up ahead
76
- They jump into the back seat, Warren in the middle
Parker leans urgently into the : Follow that
uh
They're following , Parker
Oh, yeah
The  pulls away from the curb
'  - Williamson   the
Maybe we should give them a little leash and see what they do with it
Fine
But we're gonna have to stop for lunch pretty soon, 'cause 'm getting heartburn
They pull into traffic, following the Cab
In a , Bennie's Town Car follows, too
- Parker leans across Warren to Drew
Excuse me, what were you doing
Someone was sick in the bathroom and they asked me to -- hold on, don't owe you any explanation
You're the one all ' gotta get to this interview or 'm gonna have a nervous breakdown' and yet you have time to address the United Nations
() 77
: You know, technically, you have to have security clearance to enter the Assembly
Not now, Warren
You have a lot of nerve, Parker
It was you that got me tossed off the train
You had to give the bum that dollar
You get the suit,  get the leather bikini
(under) Which isn't so bad
And you got Bernie Lipscomb while got Scrabble with Mom and Dad
Who's Bernie Lipscomb
told you,  didn't know you liked him
It was no big deal
It was to me
How could  know
You never tell me anything
There's a good reason for that
What's that supposed to mean
You know very well what it means, Ms
Big Mouth
Big mouth
Ooh,  hope you miss that stupid interview
() 78
: Oh yeah
Well, the joke's on you, because there isn't any interview
Oops
This just slipped out in anger
Parker's brain has to adjust, then: What
(beat) No interview
screwed up
You screwed up what
Scheduling the interview
You deaf
You're Drew
Drew doesn't screw up, let alone scheduling
You're the Iron Chef of scheduling
missed the deadline
How
After they made the first cut from the preliminary application, we were supposed to send in a form to secure our interview time and filled it out and had everything ready to go in the mailbox and then
Drew is near tears
And then what
Earthquake
Tsunami
Nuclear winter
forgot
Forgot
() 79
: Yes
just forgot
When  found it in my bag a week later, 'd missed the deadline
So today
All this
What are you doing
(humiliated) was going to try to meet Professor Spaulding and
You were just going to jump him
Sort of a guerilla interview
You know, 'm a big Michael Moore fan
look from Parker quiets Warren
Drew's choked up
She just nods, yes
called and the secretary said there were no exceptions to the deadline so  was going to try to see him when he finished the other interviews
knew it was hopeless, but
was so
embarrassed
Drew wipes her tears, then: Oh, to hell with it
She opens the door and jumps out
Drew
Drew, get back in this taxi
Parker starts to open her door on the It's nearly   by a passing truck and she closes it just in time
She's pretty upset
() 80
: Gee, you really are a genius
As the taxi bogs down in traffic, Drew disappears around the corner up ahead
Talk about spontaneous
- Tears running, Drew's walking too quickly for the one stupid shoe
She nearly turns her ankle
Darn it
This is when she sees, parked just down the block
'  with "Michelangelo's Painting" across the back door
That's
that's the painter
Drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep out of sight and watch the van
-- '  - Williamson and Hogan have the same problem with the traffic and can't see clearly what's going on up ahead
Did one of them just get out
think so
Maybe she's going for the dog
Maybe that's what they want us to think
So we stay with the taxi
() 81
: Unless you want to hoof it after the other one
We stay with the taxi
'  - Roger dials a cell phone while The Emperor stands on the passenger seat with his front paws on the dash
As far as we can tell, he's having a great time being kidnapped and doesn't mind being mauve
Get in the back, will ya
The Emperor ignores him, happily watching the streets of New York go by
Stupid dog
But his  has gone through
He imitates a ' (as ) Hello
: '  (  ) - Mrs
Lo Biancho calmly answers her cell phone
Yes
Morty and Bruce have their tracing gear rigged to her phone but have to keep following her around the box
(Girl Voice throughout) If you want to see your dog alive again, listen closely

She looks to her husband, who consults his watch and then holds up
One hour
Take it or leave it
Bruce  her -- keep him on the line
You have one minute to decide
She hangs up
Bruce and Morty
'  - Roger looks at the phone
It wasn't supposed to go like that
He looks at The Emperor
Well, Mr
Fancy Pants
You can wipe that stupid smile off your face
don't think they love you as much as you think they do
He glances at his watch
He believes Mrs
Lo Biancho and is

Where'd she go
think she took a right up there
(to Driver) Follow my sister
thought we were the ones being followed

: Stay flexible, will you please
They turn right

Mrs
Lo Biancho answers
(
) Yesss
Okay
Here's how we make the -- (
) (interrupting again) -- First of all, you forgot to disguise your voice
(to himself) Damn it
(
) Secondly, my husband will meet you in ten minutes on the corner of 43rd and Broadway
He'll have the money
Bring the dog
But that's ridiculous
You'll just bring the police
No way
Consider him Kung Pau
Fine
Don't hang up
The police, it appears, have other priorities, like humans or something
And  assure you, the Hotel Security
people
will not interfere
In any case, little man, we just want the dog back before showtime, do you understand
() 84
: (beat) Okay
Ciao
She hangs up
Roger does, too
(to The Emperor) No wonder you look so happy
As far as you're concerned, you've escaped from the Wicked Witch of the West
Drew watches as Roger climbs out, looks up and down the street, then moves around to the passenger side, grabs The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag
--  for the New York Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden
Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under one arm
The Emperor pokes his nose out
Roger pushes it back in
The dog pokes it back out
(to Emperor) Knock it off
Whoosh
From behind,     and takes off running
Hey
Give me that dog
Holding The Emperor at arm's length, Drew makes a run for it with Roger after her
-- just want you to know that 'm allergic to you  cynophobic
She and Roger race right past
Mr
Lo Biancho, holding out the Saks bag of money
() 85
: Excuse me
can't stop
have to return this dog
'll be right back
Puzzled, Mr
Lo Biancho falls in line behind Roger, keeping up pretty well for an old dude with a gut

- '    - ' Uh, isn't that your sister
It can't be
She's terrified of dogs
'  - They round the corner behind Parker and Warren
'm telling you,  got a hunch these girls don't have anything to do with this dog
Drew blows past them, holding The Emperor
The Detectives exchange glances -- nice hunch -- and they '   - Just as he turns the corner, the
What the hell

He licks Drew's face joyfully as she weaves through the growing crowd

He's mauve
Drew makes it across the floor and out the other side into a tunnel

Drew makes for the  past the   who leap out of the way and just as she reaches the door and pushes it open
-   - , Williamson, Hogan, Morty, Bruce, Mr
and Mrs
Lo Biancho and quite a few  pour out the doors

, Please
'll get hives
(resigned) Oh, go ahead
' The Detectives appear above her
She holds up The Emperor
, uh, just wanted to return him
As the other  and  gather their dogs, Williamson hands The Emperor off to Mrs
Lo Biancho while Hogan handcuffs Drew
Flog her
Step aside and 'll whip her myself
(dead calm) Didn't you say it was a man who called, Dear
So she had an accomplice
We'll beat the information out of the little wench
(handing him The Emperor) Get him cleaned up, Emile
Williamson and Hogan move Drew toward their car
didn't take her dog,  swear
We'll sort it out
() 90
: But  have this interview mean, it's not really an interview
'd never lie to the police
(it's over) never mind
Just as they push her head down into the car, she glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad -- it's the Bike Messenger
For just an instant they lock eyes before the car pulls away
Parker and Warren round the corner at a run, only in time to watch the Detective's car leave with Drew in the back window
What now
We have to go to the jail and tell them what happened
What on earth did happen
Poor Drew
She wanted to get into that program more than anything in the world
With a , they turn to go and  -- knock into Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker
You goin' somewhere
She's paralyzed with fear
(gulp) Hello, sir
Oh my God
Please don't kill me
Kill
() 91
: We don't know anything at all
We didn't see anything or hear anything and 'll swear to that in a court of law
Bennie appears unmoved
Parker closes her eyes, trying to meet death with dignity
Just not in the face
What's the big idea
You two a couple a nutbags or somethin'
She opens one eye
Nut bags
No
mean,    yes
Is there a right answer to  that
See, my sister had this  interview which turned out not to  be an interview, really and   sort of messed things up because   wanted to meet him
Indicating Warren
Really
You came into town just for me
Wow
Not now, Warren
(back to Bennie) Drew was going to be late even though technically she wasn't going to be late since there wasn't an interview and that's when we got in your car promise we meant to pay
It was a true emergency
meant, why you runnin' when 'm trying to give you your bag back
Bennie hands Parker Drew's daybag
Parker takes it, still trying to comprehend
You were just
() 92
: found your mom's number in the book
She said you needed it pretty badly for that big interview
Listen,  gotta go
It's my mother-in-law's birthday and  gotta plant some stupid rose bush and then take her out to dinner at the Pier
See ya around
Bennie waddles over to his Town Car and climbs in
(beat; calling after) Thank you
Well, he certainly is a good Samaritan
Parker looks at the daybag
You guys lead a pretty interesting life, don't you
But now Parker's mind is elsewhere
She pulls out Drew's daybook, opens it
We going to the jail, or what
've never been to a jail before
What time is it
: - is taken of Drew, looking as bedraggled, beaten and defeated as humanly possible
: staring at her -  as Hogan finishes fingerprinting her other hand
() 93
: He hands her a towel to wipe them off
We know that dirty hands would drive the old Drew crazy
This Drew merely tosses the towel into the garbage
Who gives a crap
: - Drew sits among other  , staring zombie- like
An  with freaky frazzled red hair and a whacked out look in her eye sidles over to Drew
() love your outfit
Thank you
Is it Bobo
(how in the world would this woman know
) Yes, as a matter-of-fact, it is
He's a genius
Drew's look of complete spiritual resignation we -- : - Warren and Parker leap from a cab and hustle across campus
In only a few strides, Parker's dusting him
Try to keep up, Warren

'm an intellectual never claimed to be athletic

because of  an ascended testicle

Do you mind

It's all yours
She hands the high heel to Red, who enthusiastically pulls it on and models it
(
) MacLeod
Hogan , opens the cell door
You're free to go
No thanks
'll just stay here with the girls
An eyewitness says he saw who took the dog
Didn't realize the guy was stealing it until he saw us grab you
Hogan takes her by the arm in a fatherly way and leads her out
- Hogan leads her into the lobby where Bike Messenger Guy is waiting
He stands up when he sees Drew
Her dissonance is even more confounded now
() 95
: There's your alibi
don't even know him
That's what he said
Go home
Get cleaned up, a good night's sleep
None of this will seem so bad in the morning
Hogan leaves them alone
Bike Guy steps over
You okay
As an answer, Drew merely points to herself -- look at me
Now answer for yourself
'm Jim Wessler
Thanks, Jim
How'd you know
( ) Who could forget that face
Reminded, Drew puts a hand to her face
Huh
No hives
Suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, Drew becomes self-conscious
Well
bye
She walks past him out the door
Wait
Where are you going
- Jim catches up to her
Thanks for getting me out of jail but  have to go home now because my entire life is ruined
() 96
: Bad day, huh
You turn understatement into an art
Can you just tell me your name
Please
(sigh) 'm Drew MacLeod
The girl who won't be going to the Accelerated Program
Why not
Drew looks at her watch
Because short of flying, there's no way to get from here to  in five minutes
Sure there is
: Parker's on the stairs with Drew's  open, staring into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes but forgot to show up for the semester
Warren's looking over her shoulder
Wow
And  thought  was anal
This is no good
don't do too well with the whole rehearsal thing
'm more of a 'wing it' person
Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass
Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture
() 97
: (all business) How's this look
Drewish
You know, 've always had a thing for librarians
Warren, honesty is fine
But you could edit a little, you know
Got it
Wish me luck
Good luck, Drew
: - about to knock on a door that reads "Professor Que Spaulding, PhD" when the door suddenly opens and the last steps out in a suit and tie, confidence oozing
Parker nods primly as he passes, then steps inside
-   - sits at her computer
She looks over her glasses at Parker
May  help you
'm here to see Professor Spaulding
You don't have an appointment
(beat) Um, no
However
() 98
: This is when the inner office door swings open and the himself, coat over one arm, briefcase in the other, steps out
Parker positions herself directly in front of him, cutting off his
Professor Spaulding
Yes
May  have a moment of your time
'm sorry, but  have a plane to catch
He tries to make a move
Parker blocks him
know
But this is very important
What is this about
Life and death, if you must know
The Professor hesitates for just an instant, giving Parker her opening
She grabs his hand, giving it a vigorous, Young Republican shake
'm Drew MacLeod
Ms
MacLeod,  hope this is interesting
Trust me

(
) Yo
Coming through
() 99
: The Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling across campus with Drew clinging for life to his handlebars
Just outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the brakes and Drew     and like the puppy in the opening, disappears into a shrub
You okay
The old Drew is back
She scrambles out of the shrub
Fine
and up the stairs -- then stops, turns
Wait right there
(beat) mean,  don't want to be bossy
You don't have to stay right there, if you don't want to
'll be right here
Great
She launches herself into the building
'  - Parker sits genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed just so at the ankles, hands folded in her lap
(primly) promise you, though my missing the deadline seems to suggest otherwise, my studies would never suffer on account of my being unorganized
This was, and think anyone who knows me would vouch for this, a complete anomaly

: (') was so thrown when my sister asked Bernard to the dance that simply failed to post the schedule request and seeing it already checked off on my to-do list, over-looked it until after the deadline had passed
Ms
MacLeod,  recall your application being one of the strongest we received
Not seeing your name on the interview list surprised me
assumed, of course, that you'd changed your mind
No
Not at all
This program is my number one priority
Yes, well, 'm sure you can appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be rules to govern the selection process
from the   interrupts them and suddenly the door bursts open and Drew  : Professor Spaulding
can't apologize enough for barging in like this
The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but by Drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look
No
Please
It looks like 'm taking the red-eye now anyway
Drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a face full of Parker, already there
Parker
(worried wink) Hi, Parker
() 101
: What are you doing
(don't blow it) Oh, the Professor and  have had a wonderful talk about how important this program is to me and how it was my sister, Drew, who screwed things up
'm having a little trouble following this
You were
being me
(to Drew) Would you like to sit down
Seeing her plan to help Drew go awry, poor Parker's lip trembles
When  saw them take you to jail
Jail
didn't think you'd make it
knew  wouldn't be any good at it, but  figured at least there was a chance
(beat) That's
sweet
You're not mad
No
'm so sorry for today
() 102
: It's okay
But let's talk about it later
Please
Go right ahead
Thank you
Parker, consider, just for a moment, whether this is the appropriate time and place
Okay,  considered
What  want to say is,  didn't    purposefully set out to ruin your    day, but that doesn't mean 'm not    a little
jealous
Jealous
'm not like you
don't have your intensity, your focus, your
Fashion sense
just mean, maybe, even if don't intend to, maybe that jealousy, you know, gets in the way sometimes
You mean subliminally you're undermining me
don't know if 'd get that technical about it
But yeah
Well, thank you for saying that
You're welcome
(beat) Aren't you going to confess now
() 103
: Confess what
There's got to be something
Like how you lost your shoes
How you're secretly jealous of me
Why would  be jealous of you
Oh, let me see
Because  don't have a stick up my butt
Because know how to have fun
Because 'm spontaneous and creative and men are all my love slaves
Drew stops, ponders this deeply
Nope
Then she smiles, only a teensy bit
Well, maybe about the love slaves
This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters share a smile
Drew turns to the Professor
Professor, 'm Drew MacLeod
Are you certain
wanted more than anything in the world to be a part of your program
still do
But failed
didn't follow the rules
And honestly, before today,  didn't know how  was going to live with that
How to live with failure
'm not good at it
haven't done it much
But today  realized that 've lived in fear of it too long
() () 104
: (') hope my application was a strong one and  came here today to ask your indulgence and to place my name back into consideration
If you won't, 'll understand
Better yet, 'll get over it
Maybe  shouldn't be in such a hurry after all
Maybe it would be best for me to just take this
Drew takes her  from Parker and drops it in the wastebasket
and lighten up
Parker looks horrified at the sight of Drew's daybook in the trash and fishes it out
Thanks for your time
Sorry if you missed your plane
He shakes her hand
It was worth it,  assure you
Now, could you clear up one thing for me
/ Sure
What's this about jail
: Warren and Jim sit waiting when the Girls come out, smiling
Drew turns to Parker
Thanks
The sisters hug, but we

: --
Sis
Yeah
Gotta go
Parker grabs Warren by the hand and blasts around the corner just as
Charley MacLeod pulls up in his truck and parks half on, half off the curb
He leans over, waving to Drew
Hi, baby
Drew goes over to the truck
was in the city
tried to call you
Thought you might want a ride home
Sure
(what
) Is that a new outfit
Yeah
Hey, one minute, 'kay
Sure
Drew goes back to Jim
Thanks
You're welcome
, uh
() 106
: You want to maybe
get together
First  want to take a shower
For about a week
Drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek
Then she reaches into her bag and pulls out a card
Call me, okay
You have a card
Aren't you in high school
She smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck
They pull away, leaving Jim waving
When they're out of sight, Parker and Warren come back around the corner of the building
Oh, man
'm doomed
'll never get home before them
Sure you will
Warren pulls out a  , hits speed dial
Dad
Hey
need a favor
- Passing over the City, Warren and Parker are strapped in, headphones on, and have to talk above the
Warren, something tells me you're spoiled
Yes
But in a good way
: '  - Both girls are putting on makeup, getting ready to go out
Everything appears the same as before, Drew's side neat and clean, Parker's a wreck
() 107
: (sternly) Girls
Quinn steps in, grimfaced
How naive do you think  am
The Girls share a look
Busted
We, uh, don't think you're naive, Mom
No
Honestly, it was all an accident
Quinn holds out her hand revealing a
know what this is
There's almost a palpable sense of relief between the girls
They    and pull up their shirts -- Parker's not the only one who has her naval pierced -- Drew does, too
Parker, 'm disappointed you'd do something like this without consulting me, but Drew
What got into you
Do you know how unhygienic those places are
It was
spontaneous
Yeah
Obviously
Oh, by the way
She holds out her other hand, which has an envelope
This came in the mail
They stare at the envelope --
So
Open it
There's a

: (
) The guys are here
Parker and Quinn stare at Drew
Come on
It doesn't really matter one way or the other
Maybe  shouldn't be in such a hurry
Why don't we go out and have some fun
Besides, if this isn't good news, don't want it to ruin our night
Parker and Quinn simply continue to stare
: MacLEOD   - Charley's laying on the couch with some chips on his stomach watching the game
Jim and Warren are watching, too
So, how'd you two meet the girls
Jim and Warren share a look
This is a story best left untold
/ (simultaneously) dance/ class
Dance class, huh
Stupid    me figured it had to be that   day in New York when Parker blew   off her chem test and Drew was in   jail
Charley smiles
He's not as out of it as he appears
Suddenly, all three women
(offering) Chips
