He tears open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame
He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush, feels nothing

We're in mostly flat, treeless plains

Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head
The boy looks him over dubiously

shakes her head angrily
She wears an aged, beloved with a  on it
Do what he says
He'll kill us both

Do it, Star
Put it down

He struggles to control anger, speaks quietly
don't like it when people point guns at me
It wasn't loaded
quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and handgun-- indeed, both are empty
You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun
(studies them admiringly) Pretty stupid
He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught and are incinerated
and  get to their feet, stare at Marcus
Can  have my gun back
shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up
He still looks at the  in his hands

In the city

gives Marcus a small, reluctant wave
(cont'd) Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better find cover
We spotted some buildings half a mile that way
points but gets no response
He shrugs, sets off with Star in that direction
Kyle calls over his shoulder: (cont'd) You can come if you want
(hissing at him) Why
We don't need him
(a shrug, sotto) like him
He's funny
looks around at the desolate world-- and the two teens receding ahead of him

Nope

Yup

It moves on without spotting them, then takes off in a new direction
and  set to searching the place, something they've done many times
They go through trash cans, check behind the counters and in the kitchen

That flying grapefruit, what was it
Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes
They patrol places like this, looking for survivors

Any red ones
She nods excitedly, hands him a packet
He tears it open, sucks down the contents eagerly

Everybody talks about him
He's the one who's gonna save us
Yeah, right
Him and Jesus
Who's Jesus
You're asking the wrong guy

Were cops like terminators
Well
Nah, some of `em were all right

and started whaling on him, kicking the shit out of him
No reason for it, Max was already in cuffs

Don't even remember it really
they say  broke his neck
() Max must be dead too, now
like everybody else
notices now that Kyle is asleep-- it's as if he's lulled him with a bedtime story
Marcus is oddly touched, pulls a cover over both the kids
starts, half-asleep-- You gonna be here when  wake up
Sure
Good
Stay away from the windows
So saying,  falls back asleep

He has the bible open in his lap, head bowed over it

behind him,  peers out-- and looks relieved to see Marcus is still with them
As she takes a step toward him, he starts awake
Just me

: (cont'd) Whatcha reading
The bible
My grandma always tried to get me into it, but-- it always put me to sleep
() Still does
Would you read something to me
shrugs and nods, flips to a random page, squints at the text
"

She's already on her feet

She points to something: What's that
It's a flower

(full of wonder) So
all those numbers
you could call them and get, like, flowers, or someone to come over and fix stuff, or bring you food

You know, pianos, guitars

How about

Jeremy comes to a stop beside Marcus
Are you all right
Marcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal at his shoulder and leg
What the hell is this
You look like you've been hit by a truck-- Among other things
Look, 'm trying to find some friends-- a couple of kids
They were taken here,  saw some buildings-- eyes him, a little surprised at his ignorance

Hop in, 'll take you there
Marcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy
But Jeremy simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger seat, then gets behind the wheel
With a smile: (cont'd) This round was gonna blow my handicap anyway

He extends a hand
After a beat, Marcus reaches toward it-- Marcus
Jeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly
Marcus blinks, Jeremy cocks his head, then lets go

With that, he hits the gas

Marcus takes it all in with disbelief
didn't think there was-- anything like this left
anywhere
Yes
We're very lucky
Want some
He holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth
After a beat, he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it
This isn't food
Well, of course not
Seems you got a little memory loss going on
Marcus stares at him, confused
Jeremy is starting to realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child
(cont'd) It's a foam resin
It can taste like anything you want it to-- but of course, we don't really need to eat
() Our brains are powered by fuel cells, remember
Marcus just stares, Jeremy gestures at the world around them
() 79
: (cont'd) We're in a transitional phase
Most of us need the comfort of the familiar a little while longer-- food, shelter, sex
Until we forget the old life
As he speaks, he notices his  is nearly empty

We glimpse , -
(cont'd) Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of the hardest habits to break

We won't even need these bodies
From within he removes an identical   with (the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag
He clicks the panel shut again, pops a  in his mouth
Marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away
He reacts to the sound of  , a difficult piece being played expertly--  a  , he sees a practicing
In front of this home, a  and   are hard at work
They're both -400s, with the eerie mask-like faces
Marcus reacts

Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet
He's starting to regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if he'd picked up some homeless guy
We don't call them that here
Marcus grabs Jeremy, who pulls back a bit, alarmed
What are you

The same as you

Of course
That's what this community is for-- people like us
Jesus

You should be grateful to have been chosen
What about the ones who weren't
You mean like Janet and the kids
For a moment, Jeremy's expression darkens
Then he shuts his eyes, and his features relax
Your family
You lost them
Jeremy nods and , looking at him once more
(cont'd) Why are you smiling
`Cause  feel good
The interface recognizes negative emotions-- rage, grief, despair-- and stimulates positive endorphins in response
Thank God, life would be pretty unbearable otherwise, don't you think
- They've left the main street now, driving down a leading to the "facility

Marcus   the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened
() 81
: Tell me everything
How did you people get here
Most of us worked at  or

Angel-- what is it
Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic Life-forms

You can stop choking me, it's not like  need to breathe
Marcus releases him, but remains in his face
Jeremy takes a moment to recover his composure
(cont'd) We replaced the body's hydrocarbons with plastinated compounds while maintaining cellular structure-- analog neural impulses were converted to wireless digital signals, controlling the micro-tech chassis-- English
(sighs, slowly) The goal was a superior support system for the human brain-- to go anywhere, do anything-- explore deep space, the bottom of the sea

He taps his own eye with an audible , not flinching
Marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands
Jeremy points to nearby , a little peevish
