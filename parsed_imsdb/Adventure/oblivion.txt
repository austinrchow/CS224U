: - Huge mountains, destroyed
Buildings enveloped by flows of earth
Awe-inspiring beauty
(
) They arrived almost half a century ago
Aliens, Scavs, whatever you want to call them
Their idea of how-do-you-do was to blow up our moon
Giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and concrete
Telephone polls half-buried in sand
(
) Without her moon, the earth went insane
Most were killed in the floods, as the cities came down, as everything caught fire
year later their ground troops landed, to exterminate whoever was left
station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow child's plastic flip-flops on the dash

We used the nukes
() We won the war, but lost the planet
Low on the , the  rises with the sun
It's a (-)   that circles the earth once a day, like an artificial moon
(

) Humanity had to flee the Earth
We had to unlearn what it meant, to call something our home
Now we live on the Tet, our man-made moon
temporary home before the next step
Everyone's there now
() Well, almost everyone

- An  chirps
man's hand reaches out of bed, silences it
The  swings his feet onto the floor
He sits with his face in his hands, waking up
We hear a He looks up
showers near him, only steamed glass walls between them
She sees him, smiles at him, without modesty
He looks back at her
We watch a familiar morning routine: - The man flicks on a light, stares at himself in the mirror
This is
Early 40's, a good face that enjoys rugged living
Tan and weathered skin
His eyes are curious, kind, almost child-like
The woman squeezes in next to him,
30s, a tom- boy shock of red hair, towel around her neck
She brushes her teeth
Victoria watches the coffee drip, bites toast
Jack lets warm water blast him in the face
Jack pulls a worn high-tech workman's suit from a locker, revealing a photo taped to the door: It's of him and Victoria, younger, in a white-walled high-tech corridor, smiling eager at the camera
He stares at it for a moment, closes the locker door
Victoria hands Jack his coffee
He kisses the top of her head, heads out to work
- He walks out onto the deck of a futuristic home perched 1,200 feet in the air, literally above the clouds
As our minds are blown, Jack moves away from the glass- walled home towards his , a futuristic-cross between a Bell 47 Helicopter and a jet fighter, and we until we're looking down at this impossible structure
Jack, climbing into his ship
: "" 3
- The  stretches to infinity above roiling planetary cloud-cover
The  streaks through our frame, dropping faster than free fall
- Through the canopy of the Bubbleship: The cloud cover below seems to   at us, that's how fast we're diving
There's a small worn - on the dash which vibrates with the ship
Jack is un-phased by the drop, touches a few controls
(
) Good morning, Jack
'll be your flight attendant for the day
This is day
three thousand two hundred and twenty five, in case you were wondering
is running instruments
day at work
Today we will be running support on five Resource Gatherers working the seaboard
Coordinates coming to you
now
Please do confirm
On Jack's heads-up display, five icons glow to life
Yeah,  got 'em
You got 'em, Bob
The Bobblehead bobs
,   - watches the Bubbleship's icon on a screen
She's now wearing a work jumpsuit open over a man's undershirt
She has a natural ease with tech and stress
She sips her coffee, punches up a feed, multi-tasking with cool
Drone perimeter defense is intact, although one went offline last night
How's the drop
() 4
: Oh, you know
Same ole' same
In front of Victoria, almost a hundred years of technological advances
Most prominent a  overlaid with environmental, meteorological, radiation levels
Other screens stream cam-footage from the Bubbleship
Alright, you're blind in five, four, three
watches the cloud wall   at him
(') Two
one
You should come with me sometime
No, thank you
Have a nice ride
The Bubbleship  , goes completely blind
Just vapor and water  the canopy like bullets
On the heads-up display,  numbers roll
The readouts deal with climate, terrain below
Even in this hell, Jack takes the controls, starts to pilot on instruments
One of Victoria's boards flashes
She squints as a large forms near Jack's ship
(') Jack, you got some weather on your five, closing
The Bubbleship is , buffeted
What do you call this
What does a storm look like inside a storm
Like this
The    comes out of the wind and rain from behind Jack's ship, simply eats it up
Suddenly Jack's going end over end, helpless
Warning lights flash
Jack punches controls that won't respond
(') (humming to himself) "'ve got sunshine
() () 5
: ( 2) (') on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside 've got the month of May
" Victoria watches the readouts, helpless
(') ( ) " guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way
" (a little tense) Okay, Bob
Need you to work with me here
In the Bubbleship, Jack works the display, literally a panel with his fist
Suddenly, the Bubbleship with power
Jack regains control as: /
- The Bubbleship  through low clouds, hurtling down past turbulence into
Mysterious black sand dunes, active volcanoes, swirling orange and gold sediment, steaming bright blue hot springs and rich brown craters
Jack takes a moment to marvel at it all
(under his breath) "Talkin' 'bout my girl
" Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of - on the horizon
Essentially titanic vacuums, sucking up the oceans
In front of her console,  charts the Gatherers, and the patrol arcs of their defensive Drones
One blinks, stalled
Okay, we've got another Drone downed last night
Send it
across the heads-up
Jack touches a button
begins to fill, like a street racer turning on the  before dragging
() 6
: Would you like to set a course to reserve fuel
( ) Absolutely not
Bar gaucre hits top
Jack punches it
vibrates in his seat, pinned back
The ship over the surface, following the signal
Now    opens up in front of him which he , barely missing an edge
which seems to have architecture to it
The ship skims close along the walls which are revealed to be rows and rows of stadium seats, half buried in sand
We're in Giants Stadium, New Jersey
Old news to Jack
He surveys below
(') see it, looks like full mid- flight impact
What was its last destination
, through blowing dust, we see a , a spherical mechanical weapon, plunged into the sand
Yo no se
No data
It's not transmitting
(checking the map) Tet coverage will go live in 11 minutes
Jack stares forward at a huge broken sign: "Home of the 2015 World Champions
" You know,  actually read about this game
Giants are literally on their own seven with 25 seconds on the clock
Please do not reminisce on my Comm, thank you very much
He puts the Bubbleship into a soft descent
Victoria observes it on her console
() 7
: ( 2) (') Negative, technician
have no eyes in the sky for another ten minutes
Do not land
: The bubbleship lands thirty yards from the Drone, moors itself by setting spikes from its skids
Blowing sand whips around both
- grabs an old   from between the seats and slides it on backwards
He hoists a , a carbine- sized gun on a sling, and checks its charge as he slides the door open
He's  with sand and wind which now suddenly still, like a freight train that's passed
Anyway
lets off this mile- high bomb
The weather's fast and erratic like this
As Jack starts moving towards the Drone, a heavy mist forms, shrouding it in grey
There's almost no sound, just Jack's feet on earth
(') The thing just sails the length of the field
Victoria anxiously checks a screen, the arc of the Tet's "vision" still not covering Jack's location
Jack  have no scope
The Tet is still offline
He pauses
faint sound on the wind
like a whine
And at the one yard line
interception
Devastation
It's all over
- connected to the ship's two   reach from the hull of the , backlighting  as he reaches the downed drone
() 8
: , a spectacular piece of technology, has landed hard, half-buried in the sand
The basic electronics are still humming, cycling
But the guy's too eager
He starts running it back
Everyone's yelling "Fall down, just fall down
" Jack goes to his knees, examining it, his hands expertly locate an empty tube-like space on the side of the Drone
(') Huh
The fuel-cell has been taken
What do you mean taken
Was it a malfunction
Jack looks at the casing
beaten, pried open
He glances at the ground around him, the dark tunnels
From inside a caved-in tunnel entrance, Jack looks small, vulnerable
Something watches Jack
No
It's a master drone, too
166
Looks like it was hit mid flight, managed to limp its way here
Watch my back, 'm starting field repair
:
Glances at the arc of the Tet's vision - still six minutes away
(') Bob, 'm going to need a cell
An exterior compartment opens revealing spare parts, etc
At the same time, a small , an ball-shaped independent gopher, rolls free from the ship, sprouting wheels
Jack, you need to get out of there
Bring it home to the shop
Jack has a panel open
He pulls a lead from the sleeve of his suit, connects it to a board
We see transfer to the Bubbleship
() : ( 2) So the guy keeps running
30, 40, 50 yards and
He gets pasted
Ball goes loose
Jack, you know they can weaponize a fuel cell
Now a  shoots out of the tool cuff of his suit
( ) And wouldn't you know it, Giants recover, start running it back
Total insanity
'm reading the whole central core off alignment, you don't have the necessary tools
Jack's got an arm and half his chest inside
He takes his  , presses it in next to a board
Systems go green on Victoria's console
(') Hold on, what did you just do
(calling to the ship) Bob,  said  needed
He turns to find that the  is already there, a sitting in its payload bay
now reaches Jack
Distant, an animal in pain
Jack listens, but it's gone
He slots the cell as the Drone powers up, systems coming online
Jack looks around at the stadium
(') Can you imagine it
80,000 people on their feet
Everyone yelling "Go
Go
Go
" Touchdown
He sets his gun against the Drone, raises his arms, running in a circle, making the crowd roar sound
(') "Yahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
" () 10
: (3) : Listening to his stadium cheer sound over the Comm
She rests her head in her hands
The empty ruined structure stares back
Reality returns, sadly
He reaches for the open Fuel Cell door
hesitates, hating what comes next
and that  comes again
Distinctive
An animal's whimper
- Jack stands at the tunnel entrance, shining a light into the depths
The sound is clear now, a low
Jack makes his way down the tunnel, carefully
Ahead, the tunnel meets the circular tunnel that rings the stadium
His light plays over the silty floor, finds: Starving, shivering
It  in a corner
Hey there, boy
Easy
Jack moves forward, hand out
(') You got nothing to be scared of, buddy
The dog suddenly  away into the dark , a
We see  , and Jack hears
(') Ah, shi
, full speed
The animal, , comes  out of the darkness, lumbering after him
Jack  back down the tunnel, the bear's form almost the tunnel behind him
- We   before we see him
loud "'
" as Jack comes  out of the tunnel, the bear on his heels
() 11
: : Jack streaks down the field, 50, 40, 30
The giant bear closing
He can see the drone in front of him, the Fuel Cell Door still hanging open
He puts on a burst of speed but , sliding on his chest, arm outstretched towards the Drone as the bear
He , flips the Drone's fuel cell door shut
Drone 166
It  , weapons and RRRRRRRRRRRRip
It opens up with white plasma fire on the bear which seems to go nova in mid air, disintegrating to   which covers Jack
Jack stumbles to his feet
Drone 166
Its smoking red-hot cannons inches from his face
averts his gaze as the Drone  Jack
Breathing hard, hating this moment
With its ganglia still hanging out, it doesn't seem to be processing
And then just as quickly, the Drone rockets up into the sky and is gone
Jack falls to his knees in the sand, exhausted
Only now realizing that Victoria has been calling his name
Jesus, Jack
What the hell was that
The Tet's scanners finally giving her a high-rez thermal view of Jack
Her display burning red from the residual plasma fire
( ) Call in number 166 for service up top
It's practically got its motherboard and half its hydraulics hanging out
(under his breath) But it still wants to kill everybody
Jack, what happened
Nowtrudging to the ship: 'll see you at the house later
You want anything
Milk
Bread
Anything else that doesn't exist
() 12
: (2) You
He leans against the ship
Smiles tired
It's a nice thing to hear
Well if you want anybody else, you're out of luck
He boards the
We only have two more months, Jack
Please try to resist the urge to do something stupid

She wants him home
He wants
No
The captured Drone data right there in front of him on the heads-up
He's too curious
(') That Master Drone was hit right over mid-town
Same area as the one we lost last night
-- ' , locked and armed, sits atop a ridge, against the bruised and lightning-fractured sky
Jack  the horizon with his , past deserted landscape, an early iron-framed skyscraper that came down semi-intact on its side
Nothing
He lowers the Binocs, glances upwards to where one of the blots out half the sky, breath- taking
It's hovering over what is left of a subsided harbor, a few blasted and rusted hulks of ships
The water level has dropped by a kilometer
() 13
: The Gatherer is sucking up salt water, harvesting the elements essential to create , "Heavy Hydrogen
" At the top of the giant machine, Drones work tirelessly, ferrying containers of Deuterium energy up into the sky
Jack raises the Binocs, snaps a few photographs
There's no Drone signal there
() What are you doing, Jack
One day when we get to Mars, someone will want to know about this
From someone who was here
He stares at the  columns of water draining upwards
(') Do we have to take it all
It's not doing anyone any good here
nods, starts to turn away when something  on the horizon
He raises the Binocs,  to a gallows- like structure
He , but it is still unclear

Actually 've got a bit of a problem with a gyro here, call you when 've fixed it
He releases a catch, pulls a    from a slot in the Bubbleship
He kneels down, hands working expertly, producing a full
As Jack locks the rear wheel in place, the bike  to life
He gets on and opens up the throttle, rooster- tailing off
The bike's electric, but it

: ( 2) rides over what used to be the sea-bed, soaking up the thrill of catching top speed air over embankments of black sand
Completely carefree, enjoying himself like a man who is utterly and completely alone
- Something was here
large metal beam has been propped onto rocks, stretching over
a This was the source of the light reflection
Jack stares down into the hole
black
He  a flare, drops it in
It comes to rest far below, next to the unmistakable form of a
There you are
An instant of
And we're suddenly looking at Jack High tech, symbol readouts changing
Something is watching him
- Inside the hole, looking up
spills towards camera
We descend with Jack, all the way down into the hole, the light receding above
He touches his suit and a light array blazes on, illuminating the walls passing by
-- Jack drops down through what used to be a roof
into the
Vast, ruined, the far end totally collapsed, like a sky-scraper fell on it
He reaches the silty floor, the flare's burning light illuminating the room
He  at the expanse of  that line the walls, stripped and empty
Wonder
and disappointment
He turns to his task, kneels by the Drone
The thing's a wreck
protrudes from a crease
Jack marvels at the accuracy of the shot
He carefully reaches out, slides the fuel cell door open
Again, the   is missing
() 15 : Vika, you're not going to believe
on the comm
There's no signal down here
-- The static  sits inert
Jack
Jack
,   - Victoria, worried
Finally, she turns to the
station reserved for high-tech, long-range communication with the home base
indicator, and a screen for text communication
: "
" Mission, this is Lieutenant Victoria Kohl, requesting Drone intercept at coordinates sending now
Her  goes through a  , then is uploaded where a few seconds later its receipt is acknowledged: : "
" She stares up at the map, sees one of the Drones turn towards Jack's location
She settles back, watching
- looks up and sees how the Drone was brought down: above it is a twisted tangle of chain-mesh and cables strung between two structures, a
Jack spins, his gun coming off his back in a fluid motion
Just the empty cavern, the wreckage at the end
Jack squints at
a wall of books on the shelves beyond the wreckage
Jackpot
() 16
: He steps forward
He raises the flare off the ground, illuminating a void where the entire floor has imploded down seven more stories
What's left is a , with a building-sized ton of twisted metal hanging over it
single bent  still spans the hole
Jack tracks the possibilities
steps out onto the girder
He reaches up to the suspended wreckage to balance
hundred tons of twisted metal just moved an inch above him
Best leave that alone
He balances, inching across this metal tightrope
Finally reaching the other side
Jack approaches the wall of books, hundred of them
He kneels, lifts one, blows dust off the cover: " " He steps back, admiring it
hidden in the debris closes around his leg, piercing armor and flesh
Jack has a second to process and a cable rises from the debris, goes taught
is dragged through the dust inhumanly , headed towards a darkened alcove
He activates a on his cuff, slices through the cable which   as he brings his rifle up,  rounds into the darkness
Half animal, half electronic
Something's in pain, but not retreating,
Jack  , cutting loose the claw, and back towards the  as his girder is yanked away in front of him, pulled into the void below
Jack doesn't slow, reaches the edge,
moment, Jack hanging in space, gravity clawing at him, falling
into the far side
For a moment dangling over the fall, then Jack hauls himself over the far side
emerge from recesses
We get glimpses of feathers, oily flesh, metal
They  as he reaches his line, clips in and  automatically, the suit riding the line up at neck-snapping speed
() 17
: ( 2) The line trembles under his weight and stress
, improvised from bone and sheet metal, enters the frame and
Jack has a second to feel the slack hit
And then he's the ground
Can't get his air
Staggering wildly to his feet,
Suddenly a  blasts down through the ceiling hole
Its lights turning night to day, its cannons
In the   of canon fire, we see Metal and hair fry to  as the insect- like creatures
Other shots
Fire and plaster dust fills the space
Jack shields himself from the debris as the Drone ceases firing,  on Jack
The same awful moment as it him
Then it lifts away, is gone as quickly as it arrived
And with its departure, the darkness comes again
Silence, whatever was here is now gone
Jack takes in the destruction for a hard beat: The ash of an alien, burning paper twisting in the air
He looks up towards the light above
long ways above
- Jack appears, dirty-faced, filthy and frustrated, crawling, lugging his own weight up through the sink hole
Finally back to the surface
He shakes himself off
notices his bike has been taken
(- ) That was my bike
He kicks at the dust, the rocks, curses at the pain as he's reminded of his injured leg
He stares at the long walk ahead, the wall of wind and rain that now hits him, soaking him
He starts walking
18
- The debris in the air makes for spectacular sunsets
Jack's Bubbleship bursts from the low clouds, carrying Jack home after the long day
We see the " " formed by the rubble from the destroyed moon
- Jack marvels at the ring, thoughtful
But then checks his read-outs
Victoria knows what he's looking for
Check your seven
Jack touches his controls and the Bubbleship Canopy so Jack's facing away from the direction he's traveling in
Low on the , the  floats in the sky
It's setting, glows a dull orange, like a Harvest Moon
She's leaning back in her command chair, her feet propped on the console, also staring out at the Tet
Strangely quiet
In Jack's face a curious mixture of nostalgia, and confusion
This small metal planet is his home
Goodnight, folks
See you back here tomorrow
Same time, same channel
He punches the throttle, and screams across the tops of the clouds through the beautiful light, arriving at
,   - The  walls of the   reflect the Bubbleship as it lands
catch the landing rockers of the and lock it down against the buffeting wind
- Jack drops the last piece of his environment suit
He touches a button and warm water sprays down
Through the glass, he can see Victoria inside the Sky Tower
She nods at him, a tense welcome home
He nods back
There is no privacy in the Sky Tower
() 19
: As the glass walls go opaque with steam, he closes his eyes, the water running over his face go through his imagination: Early in their tour, Victoria girlishly jumps on the sofa with a pint of ice cream, laughing
Also early
Jack watches Victoria sleep, brushes hair from her face, affectionate
And the memory
Suddenly becoming: , seen through a cheap telescope
Jack, pulling away from the telescope, happy, turning to
, staring back at him
Jack , snapping out of the memory
,   - Rows and rows of shelves, mainly empty now
Jack and Victoria have gone through almost all of what they needed for a 5-year tour
Jack grabs a container of water
,   - Jack starts to hang up his workman's suit, pauses to stare at the photo of a younger him and Victoria on the Tet
They look so eager, so innocent
He shifts slightly to where he can see out to the Tet itself, sinking below the horizon
2,   - The area is devoted to
Lifts, parts, shelves, odds and ends of gear and weaponry, tables of tools, a written-off  at the back
Jack comes in, glances at his newest arrival, the self- beached  166
Even deactivated, it looks like trouble, like pure evil
He opens a drawer, slips into the drawer, shuts it
20
,   - We finally see the whole thing
It couldn't be more comfortable, although it continually vibrates in the wind:  is sitting, reading her own work notes
In the background, Chaplin's "Modern Times" plays silently on a large screen
goes up behind her and kisses her on the head
(not looking at him) You're not supposed to bring up surface items
sips water, then waits even longer before
No
'm not supposed to bring them in the house
He's right
He exchanges his water for a glass of something stronger, and goes and sits down
tried to reach you earlier
If we're going to be an effective -- You're right
Then you can't just -- Jack leaps up, only to return a second later with a small bundle held together by an old rag
He hands it to her, pleased, watching her reaction
She opens it to reveal a small   in a pocket of fresh, rich soil
Her eyes play over it
(') Where did you find this
Ah-ha
So it's okay when  bring you something
But if  -- She  suddenly, opening one of the glass doors of the Sky Tower and heading outside where she holds the seedling away from her body, off the edge, lets it drop
() 21
: She comes back in, washes her hands in the sink, upset
(') Was that really necessary
know you think 'm a stickler for the rules, but you have no idea what sort of toxins could be in something like that
He chuckles
(') 'm sorry,  don't think it's funny
It was just a plant, Victoria
That's not the point
We have two more months and the last thing we need is you putting it all at risk
He shakes his head, grimaces as he limps away
(') () You're hurt
What happened
He admits it with a glance, offers no explanation
She comes over to him, examines the wound professionally
(') Come on
- It is tiny, but state of the art
seriously examines his wound, cleaning it out
It's no small wound but they're less concerned than we would be
Victoria pulls on gloves, opens cabinet and removes a watery substance as well as a small electronic wand
She smears the substance onto his wound, a
This is gonna pinch a little
() 22
: Hit me
She activates the wand, shines ultra violet light onto the substance
beat, then he   in pain
Through the healant we see the  begin to knit and repair
Skin and sinew literally regenerating
to new
() Serves you right
She kisses him on the forehead, turns away
,   - Wine is involved, candles
Victoria is mellower, much
This is a couple who knows each other's differences and admires them
This isn't an argument
'm not saying you can't go into your caverns, 'm saying we have a job and if 'm trying to reach you and you're off on one of your adventures -- Look, they trained me to fix drones
That's my job,  get that
But it's not what  am can't simply do the same thing over and over again, every day, with that
world down there
(toasts the sky) And if mission has a better Drone tech, they can get him to baby- sit
He gets up, tries out his leg
Stiff, but healed
It's only a little while longer
The Gatherer's have collected most of the resources we need for Mars
Pretty soon -- Pretty soon, there won't be anything left down there
No more plant life, no more water
() () 23
: (') So forgive me if  want to enjoy it a little before the end
You act like there's not a war going on down there but there is and we can't leave even two of those things alive
( ) Dammit, Jack
They nearly killed you today
They eat in silence for a moment, then: Actually, it was like they were trying to
catch me
(trying to joke) Guess  look tasty
He goes over to her, puts his arms around her
Please be careful
If they get to you, what happens to me
puts a finger to her lips, then kisses her
(') Answer the question
Jack considers this
Then he pulls his shirt off over his head
For sex
(') () Jack
Come on
- Talk about an infinity pool
The pool is miles in the sky, with a glass bottom
The cold wind is constant overhead but heaters flare with the changes in temperature, compensating
Jack glides graceful underwater, his nude form silhouetted against the roiling dark clouds below
He surfaces near Victoria, who's stayed dressed on the edge with a glass of wine
() 24
: He kisses her, steals a sip of her wine, then pushes back into the water, looking up at the stars, the streaming moon-rubble above
Can you imagine when we go back up
Having a face to face conversation again
can't believe it's finally ending
( ) We made it
Jack looks away
It's not so bad down here
They certainly don't have anything like this
wonder what duty  would have pulled
Probably programming the Mars boats
'd have been overhauling the zero- toilets
( ) 'm serious, it's dangerous work
mean, you think you have control of the situation
He swims closer
She smiles, he presses on
(') But then you realize, there are some things that were never supposed to happen in zero
Stop
It's awful
Just thinking about it,  get afraid
She , reaches for her wine, accidentally knocks the glass which tips over, and rolls right off the Sky Tower
They watch it disappear into the darkness below
(') Ocops
() 25
: ( 2) () 've been happy here
With you
(watches water fall from her hand) can't remember zero gravity
Physically
Can you
Here, let me show you
He reaches up  her into the pool
She screams, laughing as she goes in
She surfaces, pulling her soaking shirt over her head and tossing it to the side
should have seen that coming
Jack smiles, then takes a breath and goes under
He floats face-down, staring through the bottom of the pool into the lightening-stung clouds below
and then Victoria's form glides underneath him, looking up at him, smiling
She stops moving and her body rises towards his
He opens his arms, and she floats up and against him
They embrace, kiss
Two bodies, intertwined underwater, a thousand feet above a roiling thunderstorm
Their lips part, he pulls back to look at her
But it's the   who stares back at him
,  -- Jack wakes, breathless, troubled
He doesn't know this woman who invades his dreams
Next to him, Victoria lies asleep, curled in the sheets
Shaken, he quietly gets up, grabs clothes
and goes where he goes when Victoria is asleep
,   - Jack moves to a  where he keeps his finds
a few coins, a watch, a pistol, a snow globe showing the Nativity
book:
produces his newest find from the library: He opens it
() 26
: He was three years old when he took this earliest step in education; a lesson of color
The second followed soon; a lesson of taste
as he reads: he remembered quite clearly his aunt entering the sick room bearing in her hand a saucer with a baked apple
He puts the book down, strangely troubled
,   - The console sits inert, unattended
Suddenly, a radiates on the , its origin elsewhere
signal
- floats in deep space, a recognizable design from our time
- Empty, dark
Frozen crystalline dust hangs in the air
The ship is dead
Suddenly a panel "blips" on
Other systems go active
The ship is waking up
There's a   as the engines prime
, in the hold
We close on one
'
,  - Jack's eyes blink open, waking from another dream
He sits up, troubled
- Victoria works in her
She grows perfect, blemishless
The roof is open to the sky
Victoria makes a small depression in the earth, taps three seeds out of a labeled envelope
() 27 : comes through, kisses her
Then moves off towards his work
Don't go out today until we get a signal
Jack looks back
She's never said this before
She's genuinely worried
Then what would you say in your report
Victoria looks away, stuck
(') can't get to a site fast enough unless 'm already out there
You know that

On its way
Be careful, okay
- Jack's ship skims over the surface of a deep pool of water
Up ahead, a waterfall explodes its force into the pool, spray and mist already reaching the Bubbleship
All right, 'm coming up to the location
Jack begins flying slowly up the twelve hundred foot wall of falling water which almost seems to conceal a Petra behind its veil
Jack reaches the top

It's a wonderful town
The Bronx is up, and the Battery's down

He touches the screen and the signal goes quiet
What did you find
It's an old radio system
It's been reactivated

Jack looks at the batteries, the wire

: (') Jack, that signal's going out over the whole territory
You need to blow the structure
It's the Empire State -- It's ancient history, Jack
You know the procedure
Blow it
He pulls several  from the Bubbleship's storage, starts to set them
He pauses, staring at the railing, the old telescope
Change of plans
He walks towards the batteries, a blade sliding out of the cuff of his suit
He reaches them and the lines
The signal dies

The signal goes to pure static as Jack steers into a steep canyon, rock on all sides
Barely room to squeeze, but Jack's not worried
This is all familiar
That's right, Bob
You know where we're going

It's not the first time he's done this, but she hates it every time

He lifts another book,     : () 34 : How can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods

It's a Greek funeral vase
Which want my ashes in, incidentally

Jack, please
This isn't why we're here
This is just what we have to do before our real lives begin

And what if  can't
They stare at each other, each obscurely frightened

Exercise, not pleasure
,  - Jack stands at the end of the pool, watches Victoria stoke powerfully towards him
She sees him as she reaches the edge, stops, looking up at him
This is important, something Jack's been wanting to say for a long time: read these books, of what it was like down here, before
He sits, his legs dangling into the water
She pulls up close, her arms on the side

He remembers a yellow kitchen, a baked apple

She wipes her eyes

What was your shuttle's mission
She turns to him, watches him carefully in the dim light
And then, lying: don't remember
should get back to the ship
might be able to find the flight recorder
Your ship
it's pre-war
(again, careful) Have you ever seen a ship like that
No
No, of course not
This answers something important for Julia
wonder what brought us back
There was a transmission don't know who sent it

An awkward beat, then: How did you know my name
You look like someone  once knew

Thank you, Jack
They shake

In a few hours, the Tet will come online
Victoria will report your rescue and  imagine they'll send someone down for you

You could say that

Alright then
Don't you want to know

The Tetis still low and far on the dark horizon, silhouetted bythe first signs of sunlight growing in the East
The Bubbleship's  start up with their distinctive whine
As they head towards the ship, Victoria comes out from the house, a robe pulled on
Jack
What are you doing
'll bring her back before Tet- Rise
We just want to try to find the flight recorder
You can't know everything watching from a mile up
She shouldn't be -- Julia turns on Victoria, quickly
Thank you
feel very well
Then, coldly, she boards the ship
She's the flight officer, she wants
to see the wreck of her ship and secure items there
You'd want to do the same thing
Jack, please
() 53
: Don't worry, we'll be back before you have to make your report
That's not it
can't protect you with the Tet offline and just have a very bad

He turns and boards
Julia is staring at her through the bubble-canopy
The bubbleship rises and then falls off to the side, plummeting towards earth

The craters, emaciated seascape

: So  guess 'm around
a hundred years old
() What happened next
He gestures towards the moon ring in the sky
The Scavs assumed taking out the moon would wipe us out, and it almost did
But we re-grouped, fought back
We beat them in the end
She glances at him
(') That's if you call nuking half the planet beating anybody
He looks at her, shrugs
They fly past a , its column of water lifting from the seas

Deciding not to

: Victoria watches as    Alien figures pass the camera feed
Moving towards Jack and Julia's position
Victoria,
Julia looks up at Jack, directly for the first time
He stares at her
(') How do  know you
'
Suddenly her vision racks
, sees emerging out of the mist, dozen of them
Alien tribesmen, bristling with weapons, war-like high-tech headdresses
Mandibles and claws
Terrifying and close
Jack reaches for his weapon, bringing it around and -- He's hit from the side by a
Its armored body bringing him to the ground
He tries to  , sees Julia grabbed
He twists, sees Scavs crawling over the Bubbleship
(') Bob
In the background, the Bubbleship  , Scavs falling off as Jack  , breaking the Scavs hold
He rolls away towards his weapon- - straight into the legs of a   holding an improvised club which now comes down,
,   - stares at image of the wreck growing  as the Bubbleship rises

- Darkness
Small, glimpses of earth moving by, then darkness again
Jack and Julia are tied to a huge   pulled by twelve
combination of old scavenged military hardware and new innovation to adapt to a world without engine-power
Giant treads roll forward as the dogs  against metallic harnesses
Jack's head lolls to the side
He blinks, looks over to see Julia next to him, unconscious
He tracks up
At the top of the sled, a massive Alien Scav pilots the sled, sand whipping through a head-dress we recognize: The
He holds a long whip, cracks it over the dogs who haul the sled forward
We slow, letting the sled pull away from us into the dark as we travel , towards where we came from, reveal
The Bubbleship's  has been following
machine meant for small journeys, it rolls inside the tread path left by the sled, but it can barely handle the terrain
- Victoria hears the    , arriving
She rushes to the glass of the Sky Tower, sees the Bubbleship, docking itself
Auto pilot
No one inside
- From far away, we see the sled wind up this rocky canyon which opens onto a massive wall of old concrete and steel
Something giant and industrial in its time
The sled approaches, seems to disappear as it moves under a shadowy outcropping of rock
In the dark underneath, huge metal doors
close
-- Almost complete blackness, just the  of a slow drip of water
In the far distance, the howls and chatter of Scavs
Jack's blood-encrusted eyes blink open
Irises dilate trying to orient
He raises his head, can barely see
() 59
: He and Julia lie in the only pool of light in the room, filtering in from a high ventilation shaft
She's unconscious
Around him, in the dark, the sense of movement
His eyes adjusting, he squints into the dark
There's a on the edges of the light, watching him
Jack tenses as the figure
strikes a match on the floor, brings the flame to its face, revealing
An Old Man:
He sucks in on the end of a cigar
For a moment, their eyes meet
Then the match goes out
Dark silhouette again
Only the feint orange glow from the cigar
MonteCristo, #2
Do you have any idea how long 've waited, for this
He  a stream of smoke into the beam, then moves closer, into the light
Beech's face is lined with age and exposure, his skin scarred from battle
His teeth yellowed and crooked, but his arms and body are strong
Jack
Beech's voice is calm, with a barely held- back malice lurking just under the surface
(') Well, let me tell you, Jack
It's been a long time
Who are you
Where is this
inhales again
There's a piercing curiosity to Beech's gaze, studying him
We're deep underground
Very deep underground
We were taken by the Scavs
Oh
The "Scavs"
() Tell me, Jack
Have you ever met a Scav, up close
() 60
: (2) Jack is suddenly aware of other  in this room
Motion, on the periphery
Hair
Feathers
Scavs
(') No, of course not
You just repair the damage, keep the Drones up and killing
Don't ask many questions, do you, Jack
No part of the
( ) job description
Beech pulls off the cigar
(') Brutal, if you think about it
The way your Drones - The Scavs took everything from us
And if you're working with them -- Interesting, Jack
Interesting
You're worried  might be some kind of
Collaborator
Jack doesn't respond
(') () Lllllllights
beat, then a  of lights flickers on, revealing , all around them, heavily armed
Julia , the light bringing her to
Jack moves to protect her, tracks ten,  people
He looks where    of men and women stare down from above with undisguised animosity
Forty, fifty more
At the front, a strong battle-scared Scav, , hovers on the edge of violence
He's been recently
(') You see
We're not Aliens, Jack
We're very much human
Jack can't process
Human face after human face
() 61
: ( 3) (') Of course that's a problem
Your drones go for human shapes, human voices
So
we change our shapes, change our voices
( ) The Drones still kill us, but they're not nearly so aggressive as when they smell a human target
Did you ever ask yourself why that is
No, they're programmed to To what, Jack
( ) You saw it yourself
You almost got yourself blown to bits protecting her
've been meaning to ask you, why did you do that
Anyone would have
Anyone
Would have
Interesting
Julia comes around, her eyes flickering open, She , looking frantically for an escape
Jack her, protecting her, calming her
Beech gets , studies Jack, what he's doing
Nods
(') Very interesting
Beech moves away
Jack moves after him and suddenly forty or more weapons lock onto him
Sykes closer than any other
(') Careful, Jack
'm afraid you're not very popular here
Beech switches his gaze to Julia
(') Welcome back to earth, commander
Hope you like what we've done with the place
() 62
: ( 4) Beech moves on
Jack and Julia follow, cautiously
-,   - They pass into a giant area devoted to agriculture of wide, two-story glass tubes hold  bearing fruit
Their roots are held bare, bathed only in moist air
We grow what we can, under the lights
It isn't much; Wheat- grass, some vegetables, what beans and soy we can
The general state of our health proves that human beings are not herbivores, but the alternative is not appetizing to anybody
( ) Not yet, anyway
When we get you up to the Tet, there's plenty - There is
Plenty
Plenty of what
Food
Foreveryone
() Look,it'samazing you've lasted thislong
But the radiation zonesare growing
All of this, willbe gone soon
The zones
the area you don't patrol
No one does
You go there --- -- Your organs boil from the inside
've heard
Beech moves on, turning down another corridor
There are , stacked against the walls
Picasso, Monet, Kandinsky, Warhol
in piles
() 63
: Grand Piano is pushed in a corner, other instruments propped against it
They pass a room filled with , another with a  mounted in front of a projector
For a moment, Jack forgets everything else
It's like his private collection at Crater Lake, but a hundred times bigger, richer
Julia stops in front of a painting of a young girl in a field of golden grass, staring towards a farmhouse on the horizon
She turns to Jack
It reminds me of home
,   - is communicating with the Tet
She has been crying, sick with worry
He's disappeared
( ) My Technical Officer, Jack Harper
He's gone

The Scavs took him

He has a

Victoria experiencing jealousy she didn't fully understand before
(') There's a woman with him
The survivor of the crashed shuttle, Julia Sommerville
Silence

: (  ) Prep the survivor for immediate evac

'm requesting permission to re-task the Drones for search and rescue
(  ) Permission granted
Victoria gets to work on the console, re-tasking Drones
Another  makes her look over

() Yes,  mean

Tet Comm Status: "
" - Jack and Julia are held back by Scavs as up ahead Beech's second-in-command, the battle-hardened , whispers heatedly in his ear, glancing back
Not everyone thinks having Jack and Julia here is a good idea
Jack peers over the edge of the gantry they are on , ancient   churn
Jack, what he said about the Tet
(not looking at her) It took three decades to build the Tet
And when it was finally ready and it was time to go up, there were people who refused
Leaders, who told their people to stay
Staring at Beech, the glint in the man's eyes
() 65
: (') And so they stayed
And they were slaughtered
Whatever the conversation is, it doesn't go well
Sykes storms off, angry
Other Scavs go with him
- The  has reached the Canyon, starts to make its way in towards Raven Rock
,   - Vika is on a tear, working hard
Unable to reach Jack, she's looking for any clue, anything to help find him
To that end she's replaying the recordings of her last transmission from the Bubbleship
We hear her last : ' Jack
Jack
There's something coming your way
Victoria , chilled
She hits , then : ' It'll be fine
Trust me
' 'm trying to
' 'll be home for breakfast
Alone in the Sky Tower, this hits Victoria hard
Victoria  at the counter, letting it go further back
Then,
Just
Then we hear Victoria's end of a conversation we already witnessed: '  ( ) (') 'm near the
border territory
still more than five clicks from the
beacons
() 66
: ' What are you doing out there so far, Jack
Then the static for a moment filled with
Victoria hits
She stares
Makes an adjustment, plays the  again
Something drawing her in
,   - Large bay, filled with machinery, computers
Other things scavenged from the wreck of the Odyssey including several Delta Sleep Pods
Scav Soldiers work in the center of the bay on a
It's been opened up, taken apart
All of its circuit boards and wiring spread out, hooked to computers
To the side, other soldiers are grouped around something
Jack tracks the object they're working on: The scarred Jack saw on the Odyssey
Its been opened up and some ten scavenged Deuterium fuel cells have been fitted inside the casing
The bomb
She  something, wheels on Beech, angry
(') You brought down the Odyssey
You sonofabitch you crashed our ship
There were people on board, all so you could get -- know what  did
But tell us, Commander, why did you have a bomb on board, what was it for
Tell him
She looks at Jack, reluctant to say it, but
The Tet
is an alien ship, Jack
The odyssey's mission --- Our mission, was to investigate it
Jack shakes his head no
Angry
() 67
: It attacked us
First it destroyed our moon
Then it unleashed its primary weapon, a brilliant weapon
was born there
was born in Chicago, Jack used to go to baseball games with my father
used to get two big hot dogs, fill 'em up with relish, and mustard
Just go to town
Me and my pops, watching the sox
(quick, pressing) You have any memories like that Jack
No, my father was a -- Was what
Tall
Fat
He yell at your mom
Ever go to a baseball game, Jack
( ) already told you -- Right, sorry
Tell me how your mother smelled
What
My mother, smelled like warm fruit
Like oranges, sitting in the sun
Jack starts to speak
Stops
Beech moves to one of the scavenged   , runs his hand over the embossed name-plate
() 68 : ( 2) (') If you had looked more carefully at the wreckage of the odyssey, you would have noticed there were two empty sleep pods
The Pilot, and the Co-pilot
Jack stares at the name plate on the : "
Harper
" It was you, Jack
What
You and Victoria
We were all on the Odyssey
We were supposed to make contact
No
The Tet is an alien vessel, Commander Jack Harper
It came and destroyed our moon and most of humanity when it did
And ever since, with your help, it's been trying to finish the job
() 'm sorry, Jack
It's not good news,  know
You've been turned to the wrong side
Beech goes to the , stares down at it (') But now, with your help, we can finally destroy it
You're insane
This is insane
He turns to Julia, but she won't help him
(') (to both of them) There are people up there - What
People like you
We are the last real people
() () 69
: ( 3) (') Pockets like this one, hiding out, dying
Probably all over the planet
Beech raises his gaze to Jack
Deadly serious
(') We didn't win the war, Jack
We lost
These words hit Jack
He starts to reply, finds he can't
Beech approaches, fatherly, gentle
(') It has taken us ten years to get here, but we finally have a weapon, and a working Drone to carry it
Except we can't successfully program the Drone
It's not our technology
( ) But you can, repairman
That is the beautiful irony
It gave you the skills
- The  crawls up the Canyon finally arrive at the entrance to Raven Rock
It stops, scanning the face of Raven Rock
hits it, it tumbles back, utterly destroyed
,   - Victoria is working hard, intent on deciphering the sound
She doesn't notice the image of Raven Rock appear on a side monitor, transmitted from the
- Suddenly,  and several other Scavs burst into the area
All eyes go to Jack and Julia as the ruined is brought in
() 70
: It followed him here
told you this was a mistake
Beech, processing
All around the periphery,
This is a disaster
Well well, we may be out of time
Set the Drone to return to the Tet upon reactivation
It needs to go right to the center -- No
It will kill - () It will kill that ugly stain on the sky
That's all
Now program the Drone
Soldiers push Jack towards the opened Drone
Jack stares at the read-outs, the electronics
Sykes  a weapon from a female Scav soldier, lines it on Jack
No
won't do it
He won't help us
We bury them both, make our run as soon as we can load up
Jack stares Sykes down
You know  stare into weapons every day, so you can put that away
Because here's what  can tell you
(back to Beech) If the Rover found us, the Drones will too
Unless you want them to find you, let me get somewhere where  can send a signal
Somewhere far from here
Beech
caught
() 71 : ( 2) ( ) What's your plan, Jack
Tell the Tet where we are, so they can send a nice big welcome -- The Drones would kill you
Let me try to stop that
You can't trust him
(staying on Beech) You're wasting time
On Beech, Sykes
- Jack and Julia stand near the entrance to Raven Rock
Sykes appears with the white rectangular box, tosses it down in the dirt at Jack's feet
Beech watches as Jack unfolds his motorcycle
Behind them, other Scavs are packing up, readying an exodus
can fix this
Well, you're the repairman
Jack powers up the bike and gets on
He looks at Julia who hesitates, then she climbs on the back of the bike
'll get to the antenna, send a signal with my location
The Tet will call off the search
You should be safe, for now
Jack starts to go
Jack
What if  told you that had been to your radiation zones
And what  found there
Would change everything you think you know about the world
() 72
: Jack looks at him, hearing this
Then  the bike
Beech stares after them, the rooster-tail of Jack's bike racing away across the ruined landscape
What makes you think he's any different from the others
Beech stares at him a moment, then back out
She does
Beech turns away
- Jack pilots the electric bike across On the back of the bike, Julia takes in the incredible beauty around her
Finally, in the shadow of a jagged mountain, the slows and
Jack checks the charge: it's dead
They climb off and Jack leaves the bike where it lies, headed off on foot
What happened
She's staring into the distance where an old  of a lies shattered against a cliff-face
The Scavs brought it down ten years ago
All
this time, thought we were at war with the Scavs
but it turns out we were just killing each other
He turns, heads off on foot
After a moment, she follows
- Jack and Julia reach the top of a high cliff, with what looks like a   protruding upwards at its edge
() 73
: We   them, staring down a familiar 1,200-foot waterfall
Jack has returned to the top of the Empire State, this time approaching from above
Together, they climb  the craggy rock face
Two tiny figures against a massive backdrop, a mortal fall below
- Jack is the first to drop onto the cracked cement of the deck
He moves forward, pulling the plastic and camouflage off the transmitter and repeater
He gets to work on the repeater
It's old tech, hard to make it talk to the Bubbleship
Julia stands a ways off
For a moment, their gazes meet, then he continues working
,   - Victoria is hard at work, processing the sound that caught her attention
She has it playing through the whole sky tower: The  are broken, static-like, almost
Strange and guttural
Fingers fly over controls, making adjustments
This time the sounds parse into
male and a female voice
Almost apprehensive, she pulls an electronic filter, overlays it on the signal, which suddenly drops into perfect clarit :  recording of Jack and Victoria, from a different patrol
' () And  want a dishwasher, the kind that you can put -- ' don't think they'll have those on Mars, Honey
' Okay, fine
No dishwasher
How about just you
All the time
' Yes
When we get there
Her face totally still
Strangely frozen in the face of this sweet little exchange
() 74
: And then a  breaks from her lips
The kind you can't control
Her fingers , , she plays the recording, puts it on a loop
- The voices  through the Sky Tower, over and over
Frightening that their simplicity contrasts so much with the effect they are having on Victoria who moves into the main room, white as a sheet
She looks up as
The Bubbleship lifts off from its platform and sails into the sky
She watches it go, then rushes back towards her station
- Jack stares at the  Antenna, down at the repeater and the line of code he hopes he's transmitting
What will you do now
Jack doesn't answer
He moves to the edge of the deck, stares out, unwilling to meet her eyes
That old man is smart
Those fuel cells, the way he's got them tied in with your device
He could blow the whole station
Jack, you can't turn them in
He glances at her, shakes his head
What do you want from me
'm just a repairman
() This is bigger than me
Jack moves off to a corner of the deck by the old telescope
She follows him, steeling herself
() You and  started the same year at () () 75

what could be out there
Life
Look, stop, okay
Just -- But for you, it was always the stars
You wanted to fly further and faster than any one else

man who wouldn't bow out of a fight, ever
You and that old man have this story
Except  know who am, okay
know who  am
No, you don't
That thing brainwashed you, it erased your He turns, starts to lean on the old telescope, draws back, staring at the thing like it bit him
(') That's right
What do you remember
: The auto-piloted Bubbleship skims over the surface of downtown, headed towards the Empire State
Jack is staring at the telescope, agitated, confused
Why do
what is it about this place
Ten days before we got our go- ahead, you asked me to meet you here
() 76
: ( 2) :
Eager to find out where the Bubbleship is headed, she punches up the live feed
Julia comes close, puts a hand out, rests it on his chest
She moves closer to him, searching his eyes
(') Don't you remember what happened here
: The Bubbleship now moving  the waterfall
Victoria, leaning forward, watching the feeds
Julia takes one of his hands, places it around her waist
Moves closer still
When  sleep
You're always there
She kisses him

Next to her, a   peers through the telescope
Now he pulls away, turns to her
There, right there
Take a look
She smiles, puts her eye to the telescope

Oh, okay

She , looks over
There he is, holding the ring -- -  () The Bubbleship    directly in front of them
Jack, kissing Julia, tries to break away, confused, guilty
Julia holds on
She reaches to her collar, pulls free a necklace, a familiar ring dangles from it
There are a few pages missing, but it's the same book
,   - Victoria stares at the screen, the image of Jack kissing Julia, then breaking away
She's strangely cold, like there's simply nothing left to feel
- Jack pilots the ship, a tense silence between he and Julia
He checks a few readouts, then hits the Comm
Vika, it's me
'm
all right
'm coming in
Don't report in to Mission, not until  get back
No response
Dead air

As she moves through, she unzips her jumpsuit, steps out of it, moves on
Her shirt, then bra, land on the floor
She moves on

The whole thing has been opened up
Wind blows freely through papers, magazines
Vases have been blown over, water spilled

Trespassing in a space that doesn't belong to him

And if he's just a crazy old man
Jack looks at her
It'd be a funny moment, but it's not

Beech gives a command and the great steel door groans , revealing

Their weapons

Wind and sand blow around him
He breathes in
Breathes again
Waiting for a painful death, that doesn't arrive
Son of a bitch, old man
Words die on his lips as he tracks the plume of smoke from the downed Drone 166, lifting over a nearby ridge

It lies smashed and smoking at the bottom of an incline
Finally dead
The wind and sand are beginning to whistle now, growing intensity
Jack starts to stand
when a   makes him turn
Jack hits the dirt as  , just like Jack's, screams overhead and lands next to the , in a moment eerily reminiscent of the first scene of the film
Below, a  gets out of the second Bubbleship
He wears the same kind of suit as Jack
He's got a bandana wrapped around his lower face to shield him from the sandstorm
Jack reaches for his , bring them to his face only to find the lenses shattered
Reaching the downed Drone, the  kneels next to it and in a familiar fashion begins utilizing his tools to fix Drone 166
He locks a damaged cannon back into place, tightens it
Jack suddenly realizes what the man's doing
He stands, the wind now blasting in his direction, he starts running down the hill towards the man
() 87
: (') Hey
Hey, wait
Stop
Don't touch that Drone
His words are eaten up by the wind and sand
He rushes forward
We only see his hands as he works on Drone 166
He's very good
Even in the growing sandstorm he clips out a ruined board, slots a new one in
Runs a by-pass around a wire-bundle
The Repairman's fingers go to a familiar switch to activate the Drone
' No
Wait
The Repairman hears the voice, even as he flips the switch
He  , spinning around, his carbine coming off his back, lined on Jack fifteen feet away who '  --
Holding the weapon on him
The man is Jack
cleaner, newer, but identical version of Jack
Jack stares, transfixed
Now it all makes sense: The Garbled transmissions, Victoria's last words, who or what he really is, and is not
Not so for Jack 2
He takes a step back, confused, horrified
tense moment
' Jack
Julia has just crested the rise, sees the two Jack's
Also understanding
Julia
Stay back
Jack 2 senses her movement,  and  his rifle as Jack rushes forward -- (') No
-- He   2 and they both go down, the weapon They fight over the weapon

: ( 2) Blow for blow combat, their physical strength and training identical, the only exception being that  2 is fresh, his suit immaculate, a man who has just arrived at work, maybe just arrived on the planet
Standing, watching the two clones fight
she suddenly drops to her knees, her hand on her side
Blood seeps between her fingers
She's been shot, badly

Jack grapples with Jack 2, trying to control him
(') You have to understand
You have to understand
Jack 2 throws Jack, leaps on top of him, trying to throttle him, in a full panic
Jack drives up into his gut, rolls away
(') We're just Drones
We're just Drones, man
You and me
Don't you get it
Don't you know
Jack 2 comes at Jack wildly, emotion over-amping technique
Jack  the blow, wraps Jack 2 up in a choke-hold
(') It's okay
It's going to be okay
Jack 2 goes limp, unconscious
Jack lets him go, staggers back
Everything finally processing
Then: (') Julia
He turns towards Julia, sees her kneeling there, holding her side
The blood seeping between her fingers
runs to her as she begins to fall
She is conscious, but just barely
But still, she   from him
() Don't touch me
Don't She lurches away from him, body running on fear and adrenaline
Jack nods, accepting her terror of him
() 89
: ( 3) He moves forward, lifts her up against her willand carries her to shelter among the rocky terrain closeby
- Jack sets her down
There's blood frosting her lips and her skin has gone pale
He looks back, sees the Bubbleship and Jack 2's form lying next to it
He realizes something
'll be back for you

He stares out at the unconscious Jack 2 in front of the ship

then lights sparkle across the board
(') Okay
Let's go home
The Bubbleship 2 lifts off
/
2 -  () Making the approach
And then he sees it: Another Sky Tower, just like his
It had to be there
The Bubbleship closes on this new Sky Tower
2,  - woman we know but do not know is starting her new garden
2
She looks happier, a little younger and more radiant than the Victoria we knew
It's earlier in their tour
Victoria 2 looks up as the Bubbleship lands
as Jack gets out and crosses the bridge towards her
2 You're early
() 90 : As he approaches she notices his damaged environmental suit
2 (') What happened out there
lost contact
stares at her, heartbroken
Just a bit of a dust up
2 Are you all right
He nods
She comes over to him
He marvels at her beauty, the simplicity of life here

She comes close, brushes his hair away from his forehead

No, 'll get it
He kisses her
Gentle, loving

And as  goes into the sky tower, she returns to happily planting her roses
Oblivious
2,   - As Jack heads through his work area he sees
Just started, but not much different from his own
() 91 : Some coins, a book,
, left open to a page, a passage underlined
He reads: We shall not ceasefromexploration And the end of allourexploring will be to arrivewherewe first started and know the placeforthe first time
He nods, strangely moved, moves on
2,  - He grabs the healant and wand
He shuts the cabinet, stares at his reflection in the burnished steel
2,   - He opens the door to the locker
Stares at the brand- new, unworn picture of he and Victoria, taped to the inside of the door
2 - Jack comes out into the living area of Sky Tower 2, noticing everything: The furniture, the big things are exactly the same, but the little personal touches, the smaller details are different
He sees it all in a different light now
Things that he never looked twice at before
The items used to keep them from the truth
Victoria 2 comes in from outside, washes her hands
2 We should watch a movie tonight
He sits, looking around himself
He belongs here
He fits here
Victoria munches on something
2 (') was going over the catalog and there's still a bunch of your favorites  haven't seen
She glances over, smiles
Who wouldn't forget everything for that smile
92
2 - Jack stares down as the Bubbleship   from Sky Tower 2
He sees Victoria 2 come out, looking at him puzzled
Then she moves towards her Control Station
After a moment, her voice comes over the Comm
2 Hey, you didn't say goodbye
() Good bye
He turns the Bubbleship, towards - Jack touches down in the second Bubbleship
Drone 166 still lies there, but Jack 2 is
- Jack clambers into the enclave to where he left Julia
She's passed out, she looks dead
There's blood on the ground around her
He pulls her into his lap, pulling away the clothing around the wound
As he does, her eyes flutter open
She's delirious, eyes fixing on him
This is gonna pinch a little
( ) Okay
He spreads the  over her wound, activates it
For a moment, nothing
Then the skin starts to knit
And Julia starts to
2 - Julia is unconscious, propped in the passenger seat of the ship
Jack climbs in, jams Bob the Bobblehead onto the dash
It bobbles at him, ready
Jack hits the gas and the Bubbleship lifts into the air
93
2 - The Bubbleship soars through the sky
There's something particularly calm, picturesque, exquisitely beautiful about the earth below
Jack pilots
In the seat next to him, Julia is pale, propped against the canopy, recovering
She watches him
He's aware of her gaze, but he doesn't look over
,  - Julia weakly stands amidst the tarped supplies, aware she's trespassing somewhere utterly private
Outside, the sound of Jack splitting wood
She takes in the books, the records, the mementos of the past
Sees the Jammer up and working
Jack comes in, gets to work piling wood in the fireplace
He won't meet her eyes
Scared of himself, ashamed in front of her
always thought that plateau up there could be for a house someday
thought about remaining here, letting the rest of humanity run off to Mars
And we'd just stay here
Jack stops himself, realizing how easily he said "we
" 'm sorry
Jack
No
He moves away from her, lights the fire, it starts to crackle
He gets up and goes, walking down to the lake
She stands near the fire, glad for its warmth, watching him out there, silhouetted in front of the lake
He stares out over the water
Letting the truth wash over him
And then  from the grotto
the opening bars to the Temptation's "My Girl
" 94
,   -- Julia stands by the record player, watching the disc revolve
She looks up when Jack's form appears in the doorway
He's been out there too long, cold
He loved this song
Jack sits, shivering, looking out at the lake
She moves to him, wraps a blanket around him
What was he like
He was arrogant, and annoying, and the best man 'd ever known
Some distant part of Jack smiles at that
(') And  loved him
'm not that man
Shhhhh
Yes you are
She rests her head against on his shoulder, holds him
Simple, caring
His eyes
close

As an  pops champagne, Jack and Julia find a private alcove, he lifts out the engagement ring that she wears on the necklace around her neck
We should just tell everybody
No, when we come home
They

- Their bodies entwined
Kissing, touching
Clothing pulled away
Staring into each other's eyes
- Younger Jack stares out the window at the Odyssey on its launchpad in the distance
Steam rolls off its engines
It's being readied to launch
Hey
He looks over, smiles
She's naked under the sheets, happy, smiling back at him
-  () Jack's eyes blink open
Julia is asleep near him, peaceful
He turns, stares into the lightening morning sky
The Tet rising with the sun
-- Jack walks to the water's edge
He stares at the reflection of the Tet in the glassy surface of the lake
And under that, a fish, nibbling algae
He smiles at the fish
(
) Good morning
He turns
She's there, arms held around herself against the chill of morning
They look at each other, so much to be said
We can't stay here
She smiles, nods
2 - Jack and Julia fly low over terrain
As the Bubbleship crests a rise and drops down into a steep canyon, she takes his hand
He glances at her, lets his hand stay in hers
The entrance to Raven Rock looms ahead
() 96
: His eyes narrow
There's , drifting from inside Raven Rock
- As the Bubbleship touches down, the carnage becomes clear
few shattered  lie here and there, but there are bodies and smoking blast points everywhere
grabs his carbine, heading inside
Stay here
- As Jack moves into the darkness of the ruined Raven Rock, his suit's lights blaze on
He moves in, weapon ready
Bodies are everywhere, blasted to pieces
still burn here and there
Paint bubbles on burning canvas
Records melt and drip in the heat
Jack turns a corner, finds Sykes
But his eyes are dead
Sykes still holds a spear implanted in a Drone's wrecked body
draws Jack's attention
,  - is slumped in a chair, blastburnt, clutching a charred black box in his arms
His eyes half-lidded, he : Newsreel footage, from when the Tet arrived
On the screen crowds stare, the  meets, Cults form
in the sky, its surface , then starts to come apart
People
Cutting to War Footage
Alien Troop-ships touching down, their design distinctly Tet-like
They discharge waves of warriors
: Hand held, war-journalism
We see the alien soldiers pushing back resistance
All of them are versions of Jack
One sights the cameraman,
Blows him away
Camera hits dirt
Jack is there next to Beech
He's just pushed the projector over
() 97
: (not looking up) The first ones were soldiers, programmed only to kill
Beech slowly, painfully, looks at him
Little emotion in Beech, just resigned recognition
(') Later, there were new versions

The Tet needed something different
And finally there was

The Tet

For such a simple task
To steal our water, our life

It's just

Why didn't you tell me
Not the kind of news that

It will go on, devouring world, after world
() You like books, Jack
Beech closes his eyes, recalling from memory
() 98
: ( 2) (') "Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valient never taste of death but once
" Beech's voice trails off
Jack kneels in front of Beech
The old man's eyes are open, fixed on the artwork, the remnants of humanity
But they don't blink any longer
Beech is dead
Jack reaches up, closes Beech's eyes
He removes the box from Beech's arms: The flight recorder from the odyssey
' There is a way
Julia stands in the doorway to the library
It wants me
Bring me to it

You know  am
It's the only way

Jack works in front of an open Delta Sleep Pod from the Odyssey
He  the cylindrical  to the Pod, slots it into the space for personal effects
Is it ready
Julia is standing at the entrance to the room
He nods and she approaches,  at what will be her coffin
Julia
Let's just do it
She moves to climb in, then turns to Jack and kisses him
It's a kiss filled with a lifetime of kisses missed
Finally, it breaks
She backs away, into the Pod, next to the
Trembling as the door starts to
Suddenly, she's very scared
Fighting back panic

She puts hers on the other side

He touches a button and a pale gas starts to fill the chamber
Julia realizes that this will be her last moment of consciousness
Trembling, crying, afraid

And she falls asleep
Jack stares at her sleeping form

,   - The Bubbleship hovers high above the clouds, the Delta Pod attached beneath it
Jack  down at the earth
He hits a control and the ship rotates, so it's facing upwards towards the Tet which fills the sky above
Jack touches the throttle and the Bubbleship begins to
Jack has the odyssey flight recorder on the seat next to him
He touches a control and   fills the canopy
It's distant, fuzzy, recorded from deep space
Jack listens as the Tet grows in size in front of him

Did  mention we're still really far away
Mission plan has us approaching to one hundred kilometers, doing our initial readouts
Yes, because everyone knows, if you want to really know something, one hundred kilometers is the best -- Stop
We don't know what it is, if it has intentions

The Bubbleship has reached the stratosphere where the blue sky gives way to black space
We see the small ship detach from the blue curve of earth, the blackness of space in front of it

It crossed whatever light years of space and time to come this close to us

, remembering
-   () They must have been given clearance to approach, because the Tet now  the view in front of them
Mission control says maintain one thousand meters
Original Jack touches a control
The Shuttle pushes forward, a little
(') What are you doing
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
We have our orders, Jack
We're to let it proceed without -- We are
We're going to let it proceed whereever it's going
He lifts out of his seat, floats back towards the mid- section of the Shuttle
Jack
() 103
: He's already pulling on a spacesuit
Near him is the row of Delta Sleep Pods
In the nearest one, he can see Julia, asleep
He puts his hand on the glass
'll be right back
, Are we really going to do this
He looks over
original Victoria is already pulling on her spacesuit
last glance back at Julia, then he turns away
He smiles at Victoria, drifts next to her, pulling out a small camera and pointing it back at the two of them
Let's make history
The birth of the picture of the two of them, eyes filled with anticipation
The photo in Jack's locker
- The shuttle airlock cracks
Two figures in Space Suits emerge
Small puffs of gas, they head towards
The Tet  in front of them
Their small forms shrinking at they approach it
His face seen through his visor as they approach
Filled with wonder
The dark shadow of the Tet crossing over him, blacking out everything

Now it   with a familiar and evil sound
It moves off, searching

Drone fire reaching him

She crouches by it, opens it
Whatever she sees moves her to tears as    , the form of Drone 166 rises into view
Its weapons trained on her
She looks up, right at it, resigned

She stares up, tears already running down her face

108 The explosion is like St Elmo's fire, refracted across the sky, all over the face of the earth
Julia looks down at her hands which hold:  rolled canvas, the only object inside the metal cylinder
She unrolls it now
