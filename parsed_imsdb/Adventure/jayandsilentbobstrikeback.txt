Screenplay by Kevin Smith : long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far away-- -- We   on the block of stores (Quick Stop/), from sometime ago, In fact,  isn't ; it's    -- a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window white-trash  (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby
The Baby wears an oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, and messily eats a
There are food stamps in the Mother's hands
Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks up the free cheese, 'kay
She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, then looks back at the baby on the ground
She takes off her baseball cap and places it on the baby
This'll keep the sun out of your eyes
You be good now
She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall
With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks kind of familiar
Then, another  (also very young) decked out in a concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair enters, with a black skullcap wearing  slung at her hip
She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets her Baby down beside him
Don't fucking move, you little shit- machine
Mommy's gonna try to score
enters, heading toward the convenience store
He takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted
Excuse me--who's watching these babies
The fat one's watching the little one
Oh, nice parenting
(walking away) Leave'em out here like that and see what happens
The Passerby walks away
The Mother flips him the bird
,
(waving her off) Ah, keep on truckin'
(to baby) 'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me how to fuckin' raise you
Motherfucker, man
Who's he fucking think he is
What's the worse fuckin' thing could happen to you sitting outside the fuckin' stores
Fuck
The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat
Then, they look at each other
The larger one says nothing
The smaller one says-- Fuck, fuck, fuck
: and   stand where the Babies sat
The Record Rack is now
Jay is mid-chant
(as a chant) --fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck
Mother- fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck, noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed, smoking weed, doing coke, drinking beers
Drinking beers, beers, beers, rolling fatties, smoking blunts
Who smokes the blunts
We smoke the blunts
pair of  approach them
1 Lemme get a nickel bag
Fifteen bucks, little man
Put the money in my hand
If the money does not show, then you owe-me-owe-me- owe
(changing up to Morris Day) My Jungle Love
Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh
think  want to know ya', know ya'-- 1 (digging in pockets) What the hell are you singing
You don't know "Jungle Love"
That shit is the mad notes
Written by God Herself and handed down to the world's greatest band--the motherfucking Time
2 The guys in that Prince movie
1 Purple Rain
2 Man, that shit was so gay--fucking eighties style
Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against the wall
Bitch, don't you  say an unkind word about The Time
Me and Silent Bob modeled our whole fucking lives after Morris Day and Jerome
'm a smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and Tubby here's my black manservant
Just then,  exits the video store, locking the door behind him
What'd  tell you two about dealing in front of the store
Drop the kid and peddle your wares someplace else, burn-boy
(walking away) And for the record, The Time sucked ass
He exits
Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go
After a beat-- Yo-youse guys wanna hear something fucked up about him and the Quick Stop guy
- Randal joins Dante behind the counter
Dante rings up a customer, a half-eaten submarine sandwich sitting on the counter
Randal grabs it, takes a bite, and starts reading a newspaper
Hey, can't we do something about those two stoners hanging around outside all the time
Why
What'd they do now
'm trying to watch Clash of the Titans, and all  can hear is the two them screaming about Morris Day at the top of their lungs
thought the fat one didn't really talk much
What, am  producing an & Biography about 'em
'm just saying they shouldn't be loitering around the stores like they do
Neither should you, but we let you stay
See, man--if you were funnier than that,  never would've canceled us
What
Nothing
Enter Teen 1 and Teen 2, chuckling
1 Two packs of Wraps
(beat) Yo--how was the service
What service
2 The one at the Unitarian church where you two got married to each other last week
What the hell are you talking about
1 Jay said you had a Star-Wars--themed wedding and you guys tied the knot dressed like storm troopers
2 Yeah
And he said you're the bitch and you're the butch
Oh, sorry--the Leia and the Luke
'm the bitch
Well if we were gay, that's how 'd see it
Would you shut up
1 (to  2) Holy shit, dude
The honeymoon's over
We're not married to each other
1 Well, sure
Not in the eyes of the state or any real church, Skywalker
(heading for the phone) That does it
'm gonna do something about those two
shoulda done a long time ago 2 In a galaxy far, far away
1 (exiting) May the Foreskin be with you
Hand Jabba the Hutt
(into phone) Yeah,  want to report a couple of drug dealers out in front of the Quick Stop
-- Jay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a , who frisks them
What the Fuck, Serpico
What'd we do
We got a report that two guys were hanging around outside the stores, selling pot
We don't smoke pot, yo
Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers
1 Here're the rolling papers you wanted for your pot
And your change
Thanks
(getting in Jay's face) And The Time sucks ass
Teen 1 races off
Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop stops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand
He eyeballs the pair
No pot, hunh
What do you need this for
What
got a wiping problem stick these little pieces of paper over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit stains in my undies
(unbuttoning pants) You don't believe me
Lemme show you
Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back over his shoulder
Just spread my cheeks a little and you can see the fucking stink nuggets-- Pull up your pants up sir, Now
Jay bends down to pull up his pants and
Silent Bob cracks up
The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the car
Let's take a ride down to the station
What
It's suddenly a crime to fart, motherfucker
'     -- An   of Brodie's store in the heart of Red Bank
(
) No fucking way
on the huge, cartoon sign of  outside to-- '     -- himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he puts new books in the racks
Dante and Randal slapped you with a restraining order
Judge said if we go within a hundred feet of the stores, we get thrown into County
So you gonna abide by the court's ruling or you gonna go Bandit-- Reynolds style
Fuck yeah
You know what they make you do in county
Toss the fucking salad
don't like this fuck's asshole; 'm gonna do it for some stranger
guess if you really wanted to hang out in from of a convenience store, you could just buy your own now-- what with all that money you guys made
Hell yeah, bitch
(beat) Wait a second--what money
The money from the movie, dumb-ass
What the fuck are you babbling about
(pulling a bagged-and- boarded issue down from the wall) The Bluntman and Chronic movie
(dawns on him) Oh my God--don't tell me you have no idea there's a movie being made of the comic you two were the basis for
What
Since when
Goddamit, man-- (taps his wrist) Here's the pulse, alright
And here's your finger-- (shoves his hand down the back of his pants) --far from the pulse, jammed straight up your ass
(extracts hand and extends it to Jay) Say--would you like a chocolate covered pretzel
Brodie leads them back to the counter
You see, kids, if you read Wizard, you'd know it's the top story this month
Check it out
Brodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to the headline: Snootchie Bootchies
Bluntman and Chronic Get Big Screen Treatment
There are pictures of , as well as drawings of Bluntman and Chronic
When the fuck did this happen
Well, after -Men hit at the box office, all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on
Miramax optioned Bluntman and Chronic
Miramax
thought they only made classy flicks like The Piano and The Crying Game
Yeah, well once they made She's All That, everything went to hell
So you're saying you haven't gotten a cut of the movie
Didn't Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book
We haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie
Well boys, 'm no lawyer, but  think Holden and Banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash
mean they're making a movie based on characters that are based on you and Quiet Robert
It ain't me and Quiet Robert
It's a pair of stupid-ass superheroes that run around saying "Snitchy-Nitchies" or something
believe it "Snootchie Boochies
" Regardless--you're getting screwed
If  was you guys, 'd confront Holden McNeil and ask him for my movie check
Shit yeah
We gotsa get paid
And on that note, we cue the music
Jay lays down a House bass beat
Brodie complements it with his own beat
' -- Jay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building and knock
' -- Holden McNeil, opens the door and smiles
Well
have been waiting years to do this
(smiles) Look at these morose motherfuckers right here
Smells like someone shit in their cereal
Bunngg
Jay and Silent Bob enter
Holden closes the door, following them
What the fuck took you so long answering your damn door
You trying to talk another girlfriend of yours into some of that gay-ass three-way action with your buddy
No,  was just showering your mother's stink off me after  gave her a quick jump and sent her home
But now that you mention it-- (to Bob) Thanks, you know
You could've made the moral of that story you told me a bit more clear
Silent Bob shrugs
So what brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods
Oh, 'll tell you what our necks are doing in your woods-- Silent Bob holds up the Wizard article
Where's our motherfucking movie check
You heard about that too, Hunh
Well, 've got nothing to do with it
That's Banky's deal
He owns the property now
signed my half of the Bluntman and Chronic right over to him years ago
Why the fuck would you do a thing like that
Because 'm almost thirty, for God's sake--why on earth would  want to keep writing about characters whose central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes
You gotta grow, man
Don't you ever want more for yourself
(off Silent Bob) know this poor, hapless sonovabitch does
look in his doe eyes and see a man crying out, "When, Lord
When the fuck can your servant ditch this foul-mouthed little chucklehead to whom  am a constant victim of his folly, and who bombards me and those around us with grade- foolishness that prevents me from even getting to kiss a girl
Fuck
When
Silent Bob nod like he's finally understood
Jay looks at him, hurt, and Bob tried to downplay the comment's truth
'm the chucklehead
Fuck you--you're the dumb-ass who gave away his comic, and now you ain't got no fat movie check neither
When you're right, you're right wish 'd broken off a little piece for myself
Because if the buzz is any indication, the movie's gonna make some huge bank
What buzz
The Internet buzz
What the fuck is the Internet
' -- Holden's at a computer terminal
Jay and Silent bob look over his shoulder
The Internet is a communication device that allows people the world over to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another
(off monitor) Here's what we're looking for: "Movie PoopShoot
com" (to Bob) "PoopChute
" Yeaaahhh
This is a site full of militant movie buffs: sad bastards who live in their parents' basements, downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors they despise yet can't stop discussing
This is where you go if you wanna hear frustrated would-be filmmakers mouth off with their two- bit, arm-chair-director's opinions on how they all could've made a better Episode One
On the computer monitor, we see the site mainpage load up
Holden begins navigating the site
Here
This is about the Bluntman movie
(reading) "Inside sources tell me Miramax is starting production this Friday on their adaptation of underground comic fave Bluntman and Chronic
" Friday
Shit
Does it say who's playing us in the movie
No, but if it's Miramax, 'm sure it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon
They put'em in a bunch of movies
Who
You know--the guys from Good Will Hunting
You mean the fucking movie with Mork from Ork in it
Yeah, 'm not too big a fan either
Though Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms
Word, bitch
Phantoms like a motherfucker
Holden and Jay slap hands
Holden points at the monitor again
Now down here is where you can gauge the buzz
This is the Shoot Back area
It's where people who read the news get to chime in with their two cents
Here's what a guy who goes by the chick-magnet Net handle of "Wampa- One" thinks about Bluntman and Chronic
(reading) "Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only work in small doses, if at all
They don't deserve their own movie
" (to Jay) He's got a point
Fuck him
What's the next one say
(reading) "Bluntman and Chronic is the worst comic  ever read
Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters
couple of stoners who spout dumb-ass catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech and Chong or Bill and Ted
Fuck Jay and Silent Bob
Fuck them up their stupid asses
" Who the fuck said that shit
guy who calls himself "Magnolia- Fan
"  Check out what the guy after him said: "Jay and Silent Bob are terrible, one-note jokes that only stoners laugh at
They're fucking clown shoes
If they were real, 'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid
can't believe Miramax would have anything to so with this shit
, for one, will be boycotting this movie
Who's with me
" (leans back) And then there are about fifty more posts from people who agree to join Spartacus-here's boycott of the flick
(grimly) 'm gonna kill all these fucks-- Ah, let it go
Number one, they're a bunch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the Net to insult people who're doing what they wish they were doing, and number two, they're not really talking about you guys--they talking about Bluntman and Chronic
But they said Jay and Silent Bob
They used our real names
It doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life
Really
Yeah
And all these people who read that shit think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob
And maybe one night, me and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, and she'll be like "Oooo
want to suck youse guys dicks off
What's your names
"  And 'll be like, "Jay and Silent Bob
" And she'll be like, "Oh-- read on the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs
"  And then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead
Well fuck that
We gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- bitches before they ruin our good names
First off,  don't know how good your names really are
Secondly, there's not much you can do about stopping this bile
The Internet's given everyone in America a voice, and everyone in American has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies
As long as there's a Bluntman and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it
Jay steams, thinking
Then, a light dawns on him
But wait a second--if there wasn't a Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about Jay and Silent Bob, right
They're not saying anything about you now--they're talking about fictional characters
(oblivious to Holden; to Bob) So all we gotta do is stop 'em from making the movie
Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you're due in the process
Are you fucking retarded
Look, 'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since Greedo shooting first
mean, a Jay and Silent Bob movie
Who would pay to see that
Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for a beat
Then-- But since it is happening, you might as well just ignore the idiots on the Internet, go find Banky, and get your "motherfucking movie check
" As you so succinctly put it
That's what's important here
No, Holden McNeil--what's important here is that there's a bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the Internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can't even get laid
Putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do
(off monitor) When did it say they're making that movie
They start this Friday
So if today's Tuesday, that gives us-- (counts) Eight days
It's more like three days
Right
Three days to stop that stupid fucking movie from getting made
'mon, Silent Bob-- Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose
We're going to Hollywood
They stride off
Holden shakes his head
Now that's what  call the Blunt leading the Blunt
-- Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled "Los Angeles
" They nod at each other and then climb aboard
After a beat, they re-emerge
Tickets
Since when did they start charging for the bus
They head toward the depot
Didn't we used to ride that shit to school every day for free
-- The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey
-- Jay makes his way up to the
We in Hollywood yet
It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles, sir
We left twenty minutes ago
didn't ask you about Los Angeles
asked you about Hollywood
Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir
Don't change the subject
Are we in Hollywood yet or not
Please sit down, sir
Jay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat
Why don't you take your seat Ralph Kramden-- Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob
'm fucking bored, man
There ain't shit to so on this bus
Silent Bob mimes jerking off
already did that
Twice
Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across the aisle and spots a     playing a handheld video game
He leans over to him
Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn
Leave me alone, little kid
The Child gives him the finger
Jay goes wide-eyed, turning to Silent Bob
That fuck called me a little kid and gave me the finger
Go kick his ass
Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, "He's ten years old
" You're my muscle, ain'tcha
Silent Bob kind of nods
So go open a can of whup-ass on that little fuck, and get me his game
Silent Bob sighs and stands
He climbs over Jay into the aisle and stands in front of the child
He looks at him and registers doubt
He looks back to Jay, who waves him on
Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches for his game
The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts punching himself in the head
Silent Bob dives back into his seat, trying to look nonchalant
The Child stops crying
Jay looks at Silent Bob
You're one tough motherfucker, you know that
-- The bus pulls over by the side of the road
-- The Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the bus, followed by pissed-off
They been in there going on half an hour now
Two of them
Doing God knows what
The Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts
This bus isn't moving another inch unless you clear out of there right now
No answer
The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder
The door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the bus
The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed into the bathroom, holding a massive joint
Um-- think something's burning back here
-- As the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left behind
The whole fucking world's against us, dude
swear to God
Silent Bob nods
Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching
-- Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still
This sucks balls, man
How come we ain't getting no rides
'Cause you're doing it all wrong
Jay and Bob look behind them
There's a  hitching as well
You gotta induce the drivers a little
Like how
Like this
The  holds out his sign to them
It reads: Will Give Head For Ride
Yeah, but what happens when you get in the car, and you don't make with the head
Don't they kick your ass to the curb
Sure--if you don't make with the head
Jay and Bob look at him for a long beat
Then-- Eww
You eat the cock
Yeah
If it'll get me a few hundred miles across country
'll take a shot in the mouth
Yeah, but we ain't gay
Well, neither am
But have you seen the price of bus tickets lately
Shit-- don't wanna cough up two hundred bucks just to get to Chicago
Well,  don't wanna cough up some dude's sperm
Don't be so suburban--this is the new millennium
Gay, straight--it's all the same now
There're no more lines
Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot
There's one
On this side of it, we ain't gay
All hitchers do this
Why do you think people pick us up
If you get a ride, it's expected-- don't care who the driver is
It's the first rule in the Book
What book
The unwritten Book of the Road
starts to pull over to the side of the road
The Guy points to it, as if to say "See
" The passenger-side door opens
The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door
He looks out the window at Jay and Bob
Follow the rules of the Book, and you'll get where you're going in no time
Excuse me
Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go face-first into the  ' lap
The Truck Drivers smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road
Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear
Then, a pulls up
The  driving rolls down the passenger side window and leans toward them
You two boys need a ride
-- The  drives, smiling
Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun
You both don't have to sit back there
One of you can sit up here with me
Silent Bob shakes his head "no" to Jay
Jay shrugs and climbs up front
So where are you boys from
New Jersey
What brings you to Indiana
We're going to Hollywood
Hollywood, hunh
That's a long ways away
Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up
Well, do unto others
That's what the Book says
(misinterpreting completely) Wait a minute--you follow the Book, too
live my life by it
Really
You
Of course
You know how lonely it gets on the road
Thanks to the Book, 'm never alone--if you know what mean
guess
This guy back there explained it to us
But  didn't think you'd be into that
Are you kidding
've dedicated my life to it
Every hour of every day
Shit--you nuns are alright
You live by the Book, too
You picked us up, didn't you
gotta
That's good to hear
But it takes deed, not words
It's a lot easier to say you live by the Book than to actually do it
(looks at him) Can you do it
You want me to do it right now
No time like the present, right
Jay looks back at Silent Bob
Silent Bob shakes his head "no
" Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and starts to bend down
Alright
(he suddenly stops) You hear that
She's not a Catholic
She's a Presbyterian
Jay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed
-- The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road
Jay gets kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun
Silent Bob rushes out too, and the car races off
Jay's wipes his mouth
He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth
Dude--she had seventies bush
-- Jay and Bob continue hitching
can't believe this shit
Five hours and not a single ride
Every day, millions of people hitch to Hollywood and stop studios from making movies about 'em
But when you and me try it, it's like we're trapped in a fucking cartoon
familiar-looking  pulls up in the other side of the raid, The horn beeps
Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug, and race across the street, get in
The van pulls off
-- Jay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at-- clean-cut , a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed Beauty, a stoner , and a
Jay looks at Silent Bob
Zoinks, yo And now we can finally solve the mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls
Pull off their masks and let's see who they really are
don't think they are masks
don't think they're Hitchhiking Girls either
Ghouls, you fucking moron
Not Girls
(to herself) Though  wish they were hitchhiking girls
Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking girls-- Let's kick them out
We've got a mystery to solve
The only mystery here is why we take our cues from a dick in a neckerchief
Keep it up, Beatnik
'll feed you to the fucking dog
(covering her ears; shrieking) '
The Gang look to Jay and Bob
Youse guys need to turn those frowns upside down
And we got just the thing for that
(pulls out a bag of joints) We call them Doobie Snax
-- As Jay and Bob toke up, we go all - and 70's freaky (with the image seeming to )
Through their stoned haze, we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken off to reveal a man inside a costume
Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint and look back
Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief
Bookish and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other
The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says-- Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its   sticking way out of its sheath
It's monstrous
Jay and Bob go wide- eyed
Look at his fuckin' lipstick
He's got a stoner-boner
Jay and Bob smile and pass out
We cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to Weed-Vision
They stare at the
Jay and Bob
think they passed out
Great
What do we do with them now
Let's cut out their kidneys to sell on the black market and leave them in a seedy motel bathtub full of ice
Oh God, not again
-- Jay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming
There's a scar on his back
-- Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming
He startles Bob awake as well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see the scar
It's not there
Holy shit,  had a horrible dream
(looks around) Yo, 'm hungry
Where can we get some breakfast
Bob looks around, and then locks on something
He points, and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods
'   -- An   of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob enter
'   -- As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public He tugs at Silent Bob's arm
Yo--check that shit out: the Internet
Let's see if those fucks said something new about us and that stupid flick
Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal
He inserts a dollar and types, following it up with a mouse click
The pair look at the screen and go wide-eyed
"Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob is gonna lick balls, because they both, in fact, lick balls
Namely each other's
" Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed
Eww
(reading further) "Yes--they are real people
Real stupid people
Signed, Darth Randal
" (to Bob) Motherfucker
It's time we wrote something back
Type this shit down
Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates
All you motherfuckers are gonna pay
You are the ones who are the ball- lickers
We're gonna fuck your mothers whole you watch and cry like little bitches
Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who are making the movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our shit, then shit our shit, then eat their shit which is made of our shit that we made 'em eat
Then all you motherfuckers are next
Love, Jay and Silent Bob
Silent Bob finishes typing and presses "Return"
He and Jay nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking up at the menu board
That'll fucking show 'em
Now we eat our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get back on the road, get to Hollywood, and stop that fucking movie from getting made
No more hairy-bush nuns, no more dogs
We keep our eye on the prize, and not let nothing-- and  mean --distract me
As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the
doors and freezes
gorgeous  walks through the front doors, all in - to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
She's bathed in light, glowing
She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us
Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed
Silent Bob looks at him, then at the
Girl
He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's eyes, getting zero response
' The Girl smiles at us
His  goes from her face, down to her breasts, then down to her crotch
Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle of the floor
He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss on her mouth
After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous with the music
The Girl kindly tries to deter him
But it's just a fantasy
Jay's still standing there next to Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge
Silent Bob rolls his eyes
He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line
She smiles at the zombified Jay
(off cup) Oh my God
Do you get free refills with that
Oh, what--this
just wear this for protection
You know--so no guys try to grab my shit
Hi
'm Justice
(dreamily) And  am so fucking yours-- Silent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze
mean hi
'm Jay
And this is my hereto life-mate, Silent Bob
It's nice to meet you
Justice, hunh
That's a nice name
(under his breath, to Bob) Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree
- ------- (back to Justice) So you come here often
Oh, 'm not from around here
My friends and  are taking a road trip, and we just stopped to grab something to eat
Your friends, hunh
Where they at
(pointing) Out there
By that van
Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a  with three other gorgeous  stretching outside of it, throwing their hair around, looking incredibly sexy
Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him-- Dude-- think  just filled the cup
-- Jay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food to her friends
Ladies, ladies, ladies
Jay and Silent Bob are in the Hizz-ouse
Who the fuck are these guys
This is Jay and Silent Bob
(to Jay and Bob) Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy
Where the fuck did they come from
met 'em inside
They're gonna hitch a ride
don't know if that's such a great idea
Jussy
Sure it is, Juggs
Oh my god--he just called Sissy "Juggs"
'm on it
Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife
Chrissy, no
Sissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands
We're in the middle of suburbia, Chrissy
Let's try to act like it
And what-stupid ass little foul- mouthed bitch-boys don't get their balls cut off in suburbia
(oblivious) What's with the knife
We having cake or something
Holy shit--he's retarded, to boot
(to Silent Bob) Yo--she called you retarded
(to Justice) What's wrong with you, Justice
You do remember where we're going, don't you
That we do have a job to do
They're just gonna tag along for a few miles
They won't get in the way,  promise
(cutesy) Please
Fine--they can ride with us
But they're so out of here before we get to Boulder
Honest Injun
"Honest Injun"
(to Sissy) can't believe what a pushover you are
And  can't believe fine-ass bitches like yourselves eat that shit
Don't you know fast food makes girls fart
Suddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by , who's getting into the van
Say--what's all this talk about farting
Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to sweet and airy, totally switching characters
// Hi Brent
This is Brent
He's with us, too
Brent, tell these sillies that girls don't fart
Of course they don't
Only skeevy stoners fart
The very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay and Silent Bob
What up, homies
(off the Girls) Wow, Three guys, four girls-- (to Jay and Bob) What's the count boys
Jay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes
-- The van drives down the road
We hear singing from inside
-- Brent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and Bob listen, rolling eyes
Hey there mister science-guy
Don't spray that aerosol in my eye
For don't really want to die
'm a noble rabbit
What're you guys, like a cover band or something
We're the Kansas State chapter of --Students Against Animal Cruelty
And we're on our way to Colorado to give Provasik a piece of our minds
Everyone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob
What the fuck are you bitches babbling about
Hey
Watch the language little boy
There are females present
Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts them
Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical lab where they perform gross experiments on animals
So, what kind of animals are we talking about here--like bears and rhinos
No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats
heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak for them, who will
(touches Justice's arm) Right, Jussy
Jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition
After a beat, he relaxes
Hey, uh--Brent
Can  talk to you over here for a second
Brent joins Jay, strumming his guitar
Jay addresses him confidentially
Be honest, yo--you're down with this for the fine-ass pussy, right
'm down with this because  love animals, stupid
Even sheep
Of course
Sheep are beautiful creatures
They are beautiful, aren't they
Oh God, yes
So then you'd fuck a sheep
What is your damage little boy
You've got a sick and twisted world perspective
No, you misunderstand me, Prince Valiant
mean if you were another sheep
Would you fuck a sheep if you were another sheep
--suppose so
That's what  thought
(suddenly loudly, to all) ' '
-- The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled out of the moving vehicle
Jay throws his guitar at him as well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off
-- The van drives down the road
-- Missy drives
Sissy sits in the passenger seat
Chrissy kneels between them
What the fuck are we gonna do now
Shut up, 'm thinking
In the back, Justice studies some blueprints
Jay joins her, and she quickly folds them up
Is Hollywood near where we're going
Is that where you guys are from
Ch'yeah, right
Jersey represent
Oh, a Jersey Boy
What brings you all the way out here
Well, we couldn't hang in front of the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of the strainen-en order, which sucks ass 'cause it's been like our home since we were kids
Silent Bob even busted his cherry there
(to Bob) You did
'll bet she was a lucky girl
Bob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has strayed
Look, fuck that fat fuck--'m trying to tell a story here
Sorry
Anyway, we were talking to Brodie and he said there's gonna be a Bluntman and Chronic movie
So we went to see Holden McNeil, and he showed us the Internet, and that's where we found all these fucking little jerkoffs were saying shit about us
So we decided to go to Hollywood and stop the movie from getting made
And now we're here
Wow
have no idea what you just said
Yeah,  get that a lot
So you like animals, huh
Sure
That's cool
Even snakes
You can't exclude an animal just because it's not cuddly
Of course like snakes
How about trouser snakes
What's a trouser snake
Just then, a little   appears on Jay's left shoulder
(to Jay) What the fuck are you waiting for
She went for the setup
Reach in your fucking pants, and pull yer cock out, bitch
That's the kinda shit girls like
Suddenly another little   appears in Jay's right shoulder
2 Right about here's where the angel's supposed to show up and tell you not to pull your dick out
But we bitch- slapped that little fuck and sent him packing, so it's smooth sailing
Let 'er rip, boy
They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick, when suddenly a little   appears on his shoulder, rubbing a swollen jaw
Sorry 'm late
So what's the deal here
(looks down) Oh, shit--you're not thinking of whipping your dick out at this fine piece of woman, are you
Jay thinks, then nods "Yes
" The Jay Angel rolls his eyes, and slaps him
Tell you what: look at Silent Bob
See if he thinks it's a good idea to whip your dick out
Jay looks to Silent Bob
Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in his pants to Jay and shakes his head "no," sternly
Jay withdraws his hand from his pants
The Jay Angel nods, satisfied
That's it, boy--put the dick down
You gotta go from the heart, yo
No little perv bullshit will do for this one
Be smooth
Be Don Juan de la Nootch
Now  gotta go beat the shit out of two suckerpunching little bitches
Remember--don't pull your dick out until she asks you to
(beat) Or until she sleeping
Bunnnnggg
The Jay Angel blinks away
Justice looks at Jay, a bit confused
Don't ask
(beat) So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like me do to help the animals
You really don't want to help us-- What the fuck are you talking about
Sure  do
'd do anything for you
Justice smiles
Jay tries to recover
mean, youse guys
'd do anything for youse guys
For the lift and shit
You sure
Sure, 'm sure
said it, didn't
Fuck Well--okay
Let me talk it over with the other girls and get back to you
You do that
Jay takes Justice's hand and kisses it
'll be right here
He winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the can, near Silent Bob
He's still smiling at Justice and winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly, then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls
Fuck you
Fatty
-- The van pulls up and all pile out, stretching
The Girls head toward the store
Justice calls over to Jay and Silent Bob
You guys want anything from inside
No, we're cool, thanks hon
Justice smiles and heads inside
Jay and Silent Bob study the front of the foreign convenience store
They look for a place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one
After a beat-- It just ain't the same, is it
This place licks balls compared to Quick Stop
Silent Bob shakes his head "Yeah
" And speaking of licking balls--how 'bout that Justice chick
She is too fine
And she smells so fucking pretty
She's got a nice voice, too
And that body
Smoking
You know, she never once said "fuck off," when was talking to her, or pulled out the pepper spray, or nothing
tell ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one
-- Justice is at the microwave when she's suddenly surrounded by the other girls
Smooth move, Justice
(slapping Justice upside the head) Nice going, Four Eyes
Ow
Why the fuck did you let that little stoner throw Brent our of the van
Oh please--if  had to listen to one more of those stupid songs,  was going to throw him out myself
We needed Brent, Justice
He was our patsy
We'll find someone else
Besides, didn't see you trying to stop Jay from throwing him out
Because  didn't want to blow our cover
Cover, shmover--you all hated his songs, too
Not as much as  hate you
Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance, Fuck, if  don't get to kill someone soon, 'm gonna--fucking kill someone
(rubbing Chrissy's shoulders) Don't mind Chrissy
She's just a little too wound for sound
Then how about you help me take the edge off
Chrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot and heavy in the middle of the convenience store
Other customers regard them wide-eyed
(to Customers) They're really good friends
(   ) Would you two knock it off
We're in the fucking heartland here
Try to blend
They already do--she's the milkmaid, and she's the cow
Oh, 'm a cow, am
'm a mad cow, bitch
And now 'm gonna rip your head off and fuck your spine stump
Enough
(calm to Justice) We have a very simple gang here, Justice
'm the brains, Chrissy's the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl
But lately, 'm having a hard time figuring out what you're doing here
That makes two of us
Shit--your name doesn't even fit the rhyme scheme
That's because very few names rhyme with "douchebag
" (getting in her face) You're dancing on my last nerve, Strawberry Shortcake
(to Sissy) You deal with the weak link
'm gonna take Missy into the dirty convenience store bathroom and hate- fuck the shit out of her
Chrissy drags Missy off
Justice and Sissy watch them go
And you said letting them read all that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to anything
Don't change the subject
You know what you have to do now, right
Since you let our patsy slip away, you've gotta convince the little kid and that fat guy to take his place
They've gotta break into Provasik now
Uh-uh
Uh-huh
You'll do it; or you're out of this gang
Just use the little one's crush to convince him, since he's so fucking in love with you
Jay
No he's not
What--am  blind
He wasn't kissing your hand back in the van like he was fucking Lord Byron
Well, maybe he was just raised with manners
-- walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store
(to exited Girl) , (to Bob) Yeah
-- Sissy continues to confront Justice
You're the one that brought the kid in, Jussy
So you've gotta make amends
Jay is not taking Brent's place as the patsy
That kid and his quite friend are our only options at this point
Now we got about two hours before we get to Boulder
That gives you plenty of of time to work on him
'm not gonna do it
Why the fuck not
Because he's just to so innocent
Justice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing alongside Bob
Look at him-- -- Jay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's  to Silent Bob
'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little asshole
Finger-bang and tea-bang my balls--in her mouth
Where
Where
In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her mouth
Balls, balls, sweaty balls-- -- Sissy eyeballs Justice, who's still looking out at Jay
Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or us
Justice looks at Sissy
Sissy nods at her
Justice looks back out at Jay
-- Justice talks to Jay and Silent Bob
Steal a monkey
Shit--no problem
It's not really stealing--it's liberating it, and-- (finally hears him) Wait a second--did you say, "No problem"
Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the time
(to Bob) Right, Lunchbox
Silent Bob glares at Jay
It's not like it's a bad thing
It's for a good cause
Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri-- (takes her hand) The cause of love
(kisses her hand, then releases) Snoogans-- What the heck is that
What's what
"Snoogans,"  believe it was
What the fuck do you think it means
It means "'m kidding
" Ohhh
Well, that's too bad
She smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front of the van
Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then humps silent Bob's leg like a dog
(singing) can't believe 'm gonna get some pussy for stealing a monkey
(speaking) If 'd known it was that easy, 'd've been stealing monkeys since  was like seven and shit
Jay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves
Don't, motherfucker
Don't you ruin this for me
Me and Justice are gonna get married one day, so don't be giving me that "we-ain't-stealing-no- monkey" look
'm Morris Day; you're Jerome, bitch
Don't forget that
That girl
That girl's in love with me
Up front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives
They're gonna do it
Good
They do their part-- (pats a video camera) And we'll do ours
Justice eyes Sissy, then slumps in her seat
-- The Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs, parking in front of another large building
-- Jay and Silent bob get out, along with Justice
They wear Ninja masks
Missy and Chrissy follow
Remember--we meet back here when you're done
You sure you're okay with this
As sure as  am that you're the hottest bitch  ever seen
Chrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy away
What's twisting that bitch's tits
Maybe it's because women don't like to be called "bitches," Jay
They don't
Well how 'bout "piece of ass"
How about not
Well, what the fuck am  supposed to call you, then
Something sweet, you big goof
Something nice
(thinks; then) Boo-boo kitty fuck
(laughing) Okay
That's a start
Sissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming it at Jay and Bob
Jay, before you go, could you say something into the camera about the clitoris
What
(to Sissy) Man you are such a bitch-- (off Justice; to Jay) She's just a little embarrassed
See, Jussy and  are putting together this documentary for our Human Sexuality class, and we need a male perspective on the clitoris
The female clitoris
Uh--yeah
Jay, you don't have to do this
She elbows Sissy
Nah, it's cool, hon
There's a few things  can say about the clit that 's like you to hear
(clears throat; into camera) am the master of the clit
make that shit work
It does what ever the fuck  tell it to do
No one rules the clit like me
(off Silent Bob) Not this little fuck
None of you little fucks out there
am the clit commander
Remember that-- commander of all clits
Jay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces
Justice shakes her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles
Awesome
Knock 'em dead, Tiger
Sissy climbs back into the van
(to Justice) So--can  get a little kiss for good luck
Justice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips
So--can  get a little blow job for good luck
Justice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down
He heads off, revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in midair
Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out
Justice watches them go
Jussy
'mon
Justice climbs back into the van
-- Justice sits, glaring at Sissy
Hey, Lover-girl
You cock-block my authority again, you lose your fucking fronts, you got that
Yes, sir
Sissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment
Phase One, down
While we're executing Phase Two, you edit that tape and grab a new car
No sweat
Let's suit up
-- Jay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn, stopping at the building
Silent Bob pulls a out of his coat
He fires it into the air as Jay quickly gives the "metal" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame
-- It's dead quiet and still
Then, the pair smash through a window, landing in the floor in a ball
They lift their Ninja hoods
Jay glares at Silent Bob
You fat fuck-- -- Missy peers through binoculars out the window
They in
You can say that
Time to shine
Let's go
-- The quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black
They head for a
Stopping at the front door
Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures elaborately back, racing away into the night
Justice offers Sissy a look
You are so gay
Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button
On a digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four different digits
The door lock  open
Once we're inside,  want complete silence
(holding up high-tech device) Missy whipped this up
It counts our decibel level
If it goes into the red--alarm, we're dead
So not even the slightest noise, got it
Justice blows her off
Sissy enters the building, followed closely by Chrissy
Justice lingers at the door, taking one last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay and Bob
(pokes her head back out) Justice
Move your ass
Justice heads inside
We  up to reveal a sign that reads: -- Jay and Bob stand there, looking around the room
It's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking tear forms in silent Bob's eye
Jay rolls his eyes and hits him
Stay frosty, you big fucking softie
We've got a job to do
Silent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight
The pair wade through the cages
Jay stops at an   hanging on the wall
Inside it, there's a pistol
Check this out, Lunchbox
Animal tranquilizer
This shit fucks you up like Percocets
Jay elbows the glass, breaking it
He takes the gun out and tosses it to Bob
Hold this
Later, me and Justice can shoot each other with it and fuck like stoned test bunnies
Bunnggg
Silent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat
The pair look through the cages, until  the distinct Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage from where the sound emitted
He smiles
(reading) "Suzanne
" Boo-yah
-- The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway
At the other end is a glass case, full of
Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays the air in the hallway
She watches the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray
Suddenly, within the mist, laser beams become apparent
Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few steps back, shaking her hands to limber up
She then runs forward and does an impressive series of flips down the hallway, not touching a single laser beam
Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly
Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture to Justice
Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm
Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly
Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to Chrissy
Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly
Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are even more impressive than the other two, including running up walls and pushing into handstand flips
When she passes the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, arms in the air like a gymnast
Then, she lets out a loud, manly
The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts through the building
Holy fuck--the little stoner was right-- Sissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds
She ours them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed by Justice and Chrissy
-- The Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy pulls up in a
Boom Box
Missy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the convertible
can't believe it
Months of planning and it's all blown by a fucking fart
We can't just leave them like this
That alarm's gonna bring the cops here any minute
That was always the plan, Justice
They take the heat off of is long enough until we can get out of town
Chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van
Kaboom, you little stoner fucks
The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into the car with them
It's set
Let's roll
The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there
The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting down from two minutes
-- Jay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them
Something seems to move inside it
The head for the exit, but Silent bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the cages
Jay hits him
What the fuck are you looking at
There ain't no snacks here, man
Now we got what we came for, so let's get the fuck out
Silent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn
Jay shakes his head frustrated
Yeah, it's sad
But what the fuck are we supposed to do about it
Silent bob offers Jay a look
-- The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob (carrying their bag), and   --cats, dogs, birds, rabbits
All race off into the night
Jay and Bob race toward the van
Jay screams at it
Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks
Oh shit-- Three   screech up, the van between them and Jay and Bob
The  leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn
Jay looks to Bob, pissed The counter on the device attached to the van hits "0," and the van
Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one direction, the Cops in the other
On all fours, Jay looks at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye
Justice-- We crane up from him as he bellows-- Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still carrying the bag
' -- We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a opening the door and heading inside
' -- The Deputy enters just as a  is coming through at an operations board
He rips it off, reading it
His eyes go wide
Oh, fudge
(calling off) Marshal Willenholly
-- sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily
Below frame, he jerks off
Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby-- It takes two hands to hold doesn't it--
Uhhh-- As he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him
'
(
) Sir, we got a report of a break-in at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing lab
Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine
There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants
Have you read this article on the mule-suckers in Tijuana
Good God, wish that was in our jurisdiction-- 'd shut down every last one of those ass-cock chuggers, personally
The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then at Willenholly
What
"Ass" means "donkey
" Yes, sir
(hands him a fax) (looks at fax) Boulder, hunh
Well, gas up the jet
We don't have a jet, sir
And Boulder's only ten minutes away
Then gas up the next best thing
-- There are   all over the place now
The burned out van is being poured over by Cops
Just then, Willenholly pulls up on a
He parks it and surveys the wreckage
My, oh my, oh my
Who let the cats out
(thinks) Wait--is that right
1 (
) Excuse me--who the hell are you
Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket, revealing a badge
Federal Wildlife Marshal
This investigation is now under my jurisdiction
1 Oh really
And why is that
Because someone let a whole mess of animals out of their cages, sir
1 Well, we believe that was just a diversionary tactic used to call attention away from the real heist over here at the Diamond Exchange
Yeah, right
That's a believable scenario
It sounds more like something out of a bad movie
Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera
Then, another joins them
2 Sir, the Provasik people say they've rounded all their animals up, except for one: an orangutan
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen
Our fugitive has been on the run for 6 hours
Average simian foot speed over uneven ground--barring injuries or preoccupation with tire tubes, mites or bananas--is four miles an hour
That gives us a radius of twenty miles
3 (calling out from crowd) Twenty-four, sir
What
3 Six hours times four miles an hour is twenty-four
(doing the math in his head) Yes
Yes, you're right
My bad
Twenty- four miles
Now what  want out of all of you is a hard target search
4 Excuse me, sir
Yeah
4 What does that mean, exactly--a "hard target search"
What's a "hard target"
Well
It's--a target--that's--hard
Anyway-- 4 So are you referring to the search's level of difficulty
Or is the hard target the monkey
3 Or the people who stole the monkey
The  now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of "Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,"etc
Willenholly rubs his temples
Okay, how about this
What  want out of all of you is a thorough search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in that area
Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles
1 Wouldn't it make sense to put them up at every twenty-four miles--seeing as that's how far they'd have gotten in the last six hours
They begin chattering amongst themselves again
Willenholly looks at them all, defeated
He starts to cry
This is so frustrating
It's just so hard sometimes-- (yelling) ' Another  joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope
5 Sir, this was just delivered to the station
What is it
5 It's a tape from the terrorists who're claiming credit for the break-in
Is it  or Beta
You know what-- never mind
Do you have a
-- Willenholly and the Cops stare at the
, shocked, as the video ends
Oh my God-- (without looking up) Have the jet gassed up and ready to go at a moment's notice
Sir, we don't have a jet; just a helicopter
(dialing his cell phone) Doesn't anybody have a jet anymore
(into cell phone) Plafsky
It is Willenholly
You gotta get me on the national news, pronto
Why
Because we may very well be dealing with the two most dangerous men on the planet
-- Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at-- (the )--who sits on a log across from them, staring back
This is Jussy's monkey (to Suzanne, angrily) , Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly
Jay and Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and pulling back as if he's going to strike
(to Silent Bob) Do something
Tons of Fun
Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave
Suzanne drops her hands from her face and waves back
Jay cranes his neck to see over silent Bob
Is that fucking thing waving at us
Suzanne nods
Jay steps out from behind Bob
They state at the ape
Holy shit
That monkey understood us
Maybe it's some sort of super- monkey
Suzanne offer them a "raspberry
" Spitting as if the comment was ridiculous
Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at this
What the fuck was that for
It's not a stupid idea
seen it in Congo
Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, "Congo stunk
" Silent Bob smiles in agreement and amusement
Jay looks at him, stung
You're my bitch
You get my back
Don't go joining this chimp's side
Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought
Silent Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers
Yo--what if there's more super monkeys up in the lab
Maybe they're making an army of 'em up there
Holy shit
Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the -Files Roswell--style
' : We enter into '  and see-- -- We  over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching blueprints for an insidious war machine
An orangutan shakes hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the -Files
(
) Working in secret with a crew of double-dealing, nicotine-fiending fucks that're selling out the human race, these supermonkeys will use simian science and their genius 's to make man and monkey alike believe that they're the superior species
-- monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of apes, who wave fists in the air
(
) Then all it'll take is one little monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the dumber chimps into a frenzy, until they go all ape-shit and start demanding more bananas, better pay, and human flesh
-- Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield, and is shot in the neck
He collapses, revealing a on horseback holding a rifle
Two other Gorillas throw a net over him
(
) You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job
And if you don't wind up with a monkey hog in your mouth, you'll be captured, killed or worse
-- Cornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a living, screaming, Dante
(
) Eaten alive
-- The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like atmosphere
Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of bananas
The sign now reads: Ape Stop (
) Then these monkey fucks'll start wearing our clothes and rebuilding the world in their image
-- We start on a   of Jay on the beach, looking up, then    to  Jay kneeling before the beach buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised
(

(at statue) : -- Another close-up of Jay's painted face
Behind him, Suzanne and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake
Jay eyes Suzanne angrily
Not on my watch, motherfucker
Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously
,  -
Jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the dirt
Suzanne then goes over to Jay, pulls his face to hers, and kisses him on the lips
Alright--you can live
For now
Silent Bob helps Jay to his feet
You see that

The logo gives way to the video of Jay and Bob that Sissy shot before the Provasik break-in
Jay's yelling into the camera
Coming out of the video footage, the Anchorman shakes his head, chilled
Terrifying
Here to help us understand this footage is Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly

They go by the obvious code names "Jay" and "Silent Bob

-- On the  screen is Willenholly and the video capture of Jay and Silent Bob

(
) There's nothing to suggest that, no
But these men are still to be considered very dangerous
(to Dante) told you that restraining order was a good idea
-- On the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel, Sissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink champagne
On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans against the open sliding glass door, watching the news report on a  inside the room with the volume turned way up

Justice turns the  off and yells up to Sissy
Your tape worked
The news is all about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik break-in, with almost no mention of the Diamond heist
(yelling down to Justice) told you those two were the perfect patsies
Now we lay low for awhile-- just in case--and start planning the next job
Don't you feel any regret
Jay and Bob don't deserve this
They were really sweet
The only thing  regret is not gutting that little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his vitals
You are so nasty
'll show you nasty, you little slut
Would you two get a room
Fine--we'll take yours
(getting up in Sissy's face) am gonna stain your sheets, bi- otch
Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside
Sissy rolls her eyes
Sarah Lawrence girls
Go figure
They're your gang
Oh and not yours
You know,  don't get you, Justice
You used to be all about the girl stuff: stealing, boning, blowing shit up
Now you're like this little priss with a conscience
It's really a fucking drag
We all gotta grow up some time
If moping around over some little boy you're crushing on is being grown- up, then pass me my Wonder Woman underoos
Don't you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys
Awww
Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty about setting up her boyfriend
Then how about taking a shower
Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace
They rain down on Justice below
Just then a approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas
You the gals that ordered the pizzas
This dopey bitch ordered the large plain, but  could go for some hot, thick, Sicilian
No charge, lady
He rushes into the motel, Justice sighs, looking up at the stars
(quietly) 'm sorry, Jay
-- Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating
Jay chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne digs into a banana split
You know, Justice died trying to save this monkey, so maybe we should keep her around
That way, we can honor her memory
Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their food
Look at you Tubby Bitches
'm waxing all sentimental, and you're all about a fucking meal and shit
Now ain't you glad we stopped to eat
And you were all piss-scared the cops'd bust us or something
You know what say
(singing, a la ) (
) (via bullhorn) ' , Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat
Then-- You think they're talking to us
-- There's a few   outside, and the  is yelling at the diner through his bullhorn
Beside him are the other (to other ) Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty
Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind the car, gun drawn
The ape
What
An orangutan's a member of the great ape family
It's not a monkey
Look, who's the Federal Wildlife Marshal here
(into bullhorn) , '
, '
-- Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth, like scared rats
What the fuck are you waiting for
Go out there and give 'em the monkey
Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked
Oh, what, man
said that shit before knew they were gonna shoot us
Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but  ain't takin' no bullet for no monkey
Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears
Jay rolls his eyes
Oh, brother--this is like something out of fucking Benji
Look man, maybe it's not that bad back at the lab
Maybe they experiment on 'em by, like making 'em fuck a bunch of different, good-looking monkeys
We don't know
Maybe they got it real sweet
Suzanne shakes her head "no
" Bob points to her, as if she's strengthening his point
(to Suzanne) You stay out of this, you weepy little chimp
(looks around thinking) Fuck man,  ain't no strategist
You're the guy that makes the blueprints
don't even have the fucking smarts of a little-- Jay's eyes fall on a scared  in a nearby booth
There's a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a baseball cap
--kid -- Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner
The Sheriff looks on
' (to cops) Everyone has bullets in their guns, right
Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between them (they're holding her raised hands)
She's now dressed up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face
It's a pretty piss-poor disguise
Don't shoot
We're just trying to take our son out of this hostile environment
From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly
Their "son"
Maybe they're one of those gay couples
Jay seizes on the idea
Silent Bob nods fervently
Yeah
We're gay
And this is our adopted love child
We're not from around here
Don't make us go back to our liberal city home with a tales of prejudice and bigotry in the heart of Utah
(whispers to Bob) You see the shit  gotta put up with for you
Now  got this guy thinking 'm gay
Oh God, this is the last thing need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals shooting their mouth off in the liberal press that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes gays
,   '
'
You see this badge
think 'd recognize an ape if  saw one
And the only thing  do recognize here is a political fiasco 'm, going to avoid by letting this butt-fucking Brady Bunch go
Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by-- And 'll tell you another thing: what if that guy shows up around the stores one day and starts telling everybody you and me are poo-gilists
How are we gonna get any pussy then, hunh
(
) ,
Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked
They look back out at Willenholly, who's yards away
Jay points at himself, as if to say, "Me
" (via bullhorn) , ,
(calling over) So we can just go
(via bullhorn) Yes, sir--or ma'am
Please accept my apologies for detaining you and your unorthodox-but-constitutionally- protected-family unit
(amazed) Un-fucking believable
'd like to offer a big gay thank- you, sir
We'll tell all our gay friends that Utah is Gay friendly country for gays who are gay
'm sure Utah appreciates that
You might also want to make it clear that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's Office is also pro-'mo as well
(winks at the sheriff) And might  add, that's one fine- looking boy you're raising
Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm
See,  knocked up a hot woman friend of ours who  also fuck on the side
So as not to be all-the-way-gay
But my tubby husband here is one hundred percent queer
He loves the cock
He certainly looks insatiable
'Bye 'Bye Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road
Willenholly and all watch them go
The Sheriff is livid
Well, it's not my way--but damned if there doesn't go one happy family
(balloon two) Now, we just shoot some tear gas into that diner, and when the two guys run out with the monkey, we'll-- Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking
He looks to the Sheriff
That was the them, wasn't it
-- Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing
said you "love the cock"
gotta be the craftiest motherfucker alive
, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now in full panic mode
Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing
Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets
, -,
-- The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't), shots still ringing out
Jay spots a manhole
He points at it, screaming
Silent Bob pops the cover off, With bullets ricocheting all around them, Jay leaps into the manhole
Jay lands in a sewer tunnel (like in The Fugitive)
Suzanne lands on top of him
Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape
(yelling up) -- Bullets hitting the pavement around him, Silent bob dives into the sewer grate as well, but-- Silent Bob gets stuck
Jay rolls his eyes
You fat fuck
Silent Bob struggles while Jay and Suzanne try to pull him through the hole
You just--had to--order pancakes-- didn't ya
-- on the running Willenholly and Sheriff
Fire a warning shot into that bulbous ass
One rectal breach, coming up
-- Jay and Suzanne pull with all their might
Bob strains
-- on the Sheriff, as he squints to aim
Open up and say "ahhhhh," you stoner sumbitch-- -- on Silent Bob bellowing
-- The Sheriff's gun fires
-- Jay and Suzanne fall backwards, as Silent Bob pops through
-- The bullet ricochets off the curb, as Silent Bob's feet slip through
-- Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne are in various states of collapse
Jay and Bob look up at the hole
Just like Winnie-the-Pooh
-- Willenholly and the Sheriff arrive at the manhole
Wow
That was an incredibly daring escape
(to Sheriff) You must see that a lot, hunh
Shut up
Sire, you're very taciturn
Willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff looks on
You and your men stay up here
When corner them, 'll call you for back-up
What're you doing
They're trapped
The only way they can get out of there is right here
Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't wait for his prey to come to him
He comes to it
Or goes to it
Is it "comes to it" or "goes to it"
(shakes it off) 'm going in there
'm counting on you Sheriff
Willenholly embraces the Sheriff
You've taught me so much
Willenholly then climbs into the sewer, disappearing
The Cops look at the Sheriff for a beat, who heads
saying-- Fuck this asshole
Let's go back to the station and get some donuts
-- on Jay, Bob, and Suzanne, looking into the distance, bathed by natural light
We  the loud sounds of water rushing
This reminds me of the night  fucked your mom, yo
One big-wet, smelly, gaping hole, and me wishing  had a board tied to my ass-- to reveal Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne standing at the precipice of the sewer tunnel that pokes out of a
Water rushed below
--to keep from falling in
Willenholly aims his gun at the trio's backs
,
Our heroes comply, but Jay speaks
-- ' '
(beat) ,  ' '
(beat) ,    ' ,    -- (pointing to Silent Bob) Jay and Silent Bob face Willenholly and kneel
But Suzanne's still looking out of the dam
See, man
He's lining us up like fucking circus seals
Well, 'm going first-- don't want no mouthful of monkey-spit when  gotta blow this fucking -Man
on Suzanne, who's looking down at the raging water below
Her brow hardens with purpose
on Suzanne's right hand grabbing Jay's right hand
on Suzanne's left hand grabbing Bob's left hand
Suzanne leaps forward at us, pulling Jay and Silent Bob backwards
-- Suzanne leaps from the mouth of the tunnel, dragging Jay and Bob with her
-- Willenholly goes wide-eyed, holstering his gun
Oh, no--think you can pull a Peter Pan on me
He races toward the mouth of the tunnel and leaps out as well
-- As Willenholly plummets, he passes Suzanne hanging by her feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the tunnel
She's hanging upside down, holding Jay and Silent Bob's hands
-
, -- -- Willenholly plummets toward the water below and ker-splashes into the drink
-- Suzanne has pulled Jay and Silent Bob back into the mouth of the tunnel
You see that shit
Damn--remind me not to get on the monkey's bad side
Yo--boost her up
So we can talk, so we can get the fuck out of here
Silent Bob lifts Suzanne over the tunnel onto the-- -- --pavement near the manhole
She sits there, looking down
-- Silent Bob lifts Jay over the top of the tunnel toward the road, -- Suzanne sits by the side of the road
car pulls into the shot
Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway just in time to see-- The passenger door slamming on a  with Los Angeles plates and a sign that reads
Suzanne is looking out the back window waving
Jay and Bob leap to their feet, chasing after the truck
,
' -'
The truck speeds away in the distance
Jay and Silent Bob stand there, panting
Man
Who the fuck just steals a monkey
Silent Bob indicates themselves
Oh yeah
(pissed) Well this fucking blows
We got one more day to stop those fucks from making that movie, and someone goes and takes the only thing  had left from the one woman  ever loved enough to try to stick my hand down her pants
Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne
Go after the monkey
How the fuck are we supposed to know where that thing's going
Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went
Jay stares at him
What
What is that supposed to mean
Don't just fucking point like-- (imitates him) You ain't the broad in the Children of a Lesser God
Use you fucking mouth for more than eating, ya tubby bitch
Bob starts an elaborate pantomime
Jay tries to guess what he's saying
You gotta take a shit
No--you gotta take a salad
Take a salad
What the fuck are you trying to say
Bob's on the verge of tears, trying to mime out his message
Silent Bob grabs Jay and screams into his face
, Bob releases Jay, breathing heavily and storms off in the direction of the car went
Jay watched him go for a beat, then follows, muttering under his breath-- Say it, don't spray it, bitch
' -- (
) "And might  add, that's one fine- looking boy you're raising
" ' -- The Sheriff and his men stand around, eating donuts, laughing
The Station doors slam open, and Willenholly enters, soaking wet
All the Cops stare at him
Well, if it isn't the wildlife experts
Did you come to it or go to it
Do you have a microwave here, Sheriff
We have a toaster oven
Why
Because  need to dry my gun out so can
This might cheer you up
(hands him paper) Your office just faxed this over
Guy there say it's a post from an Internet chat board, signed by a "Jay and Silent Bob
" Your man thinks it's a lead as to where those fellas are taking the ape
(reading) "All you motherfuckers are gonna pay
You are the ones who are ball- lickers
We're gonna fuck your mothers while you watch and cry like little bitches
Once we get to Hollywood--" (looks up) They're going to Hollywood
-- We take a quick visual tour of the city, including the sign, the line of front of Krispy Kreme, the line in front of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, the Simpson star in the Walk- of- Fame, the Rocky and Bullwinkle statue, the Beverly Center, Jerry's Famous Deli, the Hollywood and Vine sign, Mann's Chinese Theatre, the Star Wars footprints outside of Mann's, the Chateau Marmont, people on cell phones, Trashy Lingerie
propositioning a potential , and finally-- -- We start on the street sign, and   to a that pulls up
gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with Silent Bob sitting in the back seat
After a beat, Jay pops up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around
The Woman sighs, and zips up her pants
Jay and Bob hop out and wave to the Woman as the car pulls away
Bob offers Jay a look
What
It's not like it's cheating
Justice blew up
Two  approach them
1 Hey, little man
You want some of this
2 How about you, Big Boy
1 If you've got fifty bucks we can get nasty
Oh yeah
How nasty
2 As nasty as you wanna be, poppie
Alright--first, 'll want to tongue your bung while you juggle my balls in one hand and play with my asshole with the other
But don't stick you finger in
Then
'll wanna pinky you and put it in your friend's brown, while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie cup
After that, 'll wanna smell your titties, for a while, and you can pull my nutsack up over my dick, so it looks like a Bullfrog
Then want you to flick at my nuts while your friend spanks me into the same Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in
Then we throw the Dixie cup out
The Hookers look at him, dumbfounded, Then-- 1 Oh, that's it honey
quit
(walking away) This job just passed the point of no return
2 (to Jay) You one fucked up puppy, poppie
(watching them go) What
You said 'nasty'
(shakes his head; to Bob) Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck up
-- Jay and Silent Bob walk
Alright, here's the plan: first, we find out where they're shooting that movie at
After we shut that shit down, we can start looking for the monkey
But before we do any of that shit, we gotta find a motherfucker in the know
Someone who's like, the mayor of Hollywood
They pass a  leaning against a wall, trying to make a sale
(subtly) Crack
You want some crack
Sweet- ass rock
Get you high
No man, but you want some weed
(beat) You on the job
(pulling out a card) Yeah, boy

It reads: ,  408

Shit, no, we might have to strike in September
Norma Rae like a motherfucker
You gots to get your benefits, you know what 'm saying

Yo--maybe you can help us out
You know where they're shooting a movie around here
You in this town and you gonna ask that question
Be a little more specific
It's a Miramax flick
We gotta bust it up so people stop calling us names on the Internet, even though they're not really talking about us but these characters based on us, and at the same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who- got-killed-in-a-car-explosion's monkey
Jay exhales
The Dealer stares at him for a beat
don't know that the fuck you just said, little kid
But you touched a brother's heart, so 'm gonna help you out with some directions to the studio
You know where Miramax is at
Fuck, yes
Miramax accounts for seventy-eight percent of my business

Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent Bob

Jules Asner is in front of the Miramax Studios main gate

Studio
Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are on the lot, shooting a super-secret project
Have you seen then roaming around
at Miramax Studios
No, Steve
But  did see Casey Affleck buying a soda at a concession stand earlier
But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob
None whatsoever
However, to be fair, all the feds have to work with is murky videotape, so no one's even a hundred percent sure what Jay and Silent Bob look like, exactly
For all we know, they could already be on the lot
As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her, looking up at the studio sign
They then notice the camera and start waving behind Jules
-- Justice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on
She hops out of her seat
Oh my God
Jay
No
Justice looks around, panicky
Her eyes fall on-- The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table
Justice looks at the diamonds, then the  screen
She thinks for a beat, then-- Fuck it
She pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in her pocket
-- The door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys
In the bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning
Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity
Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place
As she crawls back out, we   on the note, which reads: , --
-- The convertible skids out, taking off
-- There's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap)
Wiping their mouths
Sissy holds Justices's note
That bitch
That fucking, fucking bitch
(to girls) Get dressed
We're going after her
Fuck that,  didn't get to cum yet
Which is more important to you: a fortune in diamonds or busting a nut
Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs
Chrissy stands there still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties
(
) Chrissy
Now
Fuck-- Chrissy races back up the stairs
- The
packs up
Jay and Silent Bob study the main gate
They watch the   approach a car that's just pulled up
The Guard checks the driver's pass, then lifts the gate to let the car through
Jay looks to Bob
We gotta play this right
Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard booth
The  leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle and giving chase
-- Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like an open alley then smash into it, falling down
The open alley is a background painting that's being moved by some Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact

(from walkie-talkie) Oh, that Affleck
Backup on the way
Hey
make you a deal: this guy'll suck your dick off if you let us go
Contrary to what you believe, not everyone in the movie business is gay
Well, how about this deal: he sucks my dick while you watch and jerk off
The Security Guard stops, looks around, then releases them, reaching into his pants
Alright
But make is fast
And sexy
Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared
Dude, it's either this or jail
And you know what they make you do in jail
Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees, reaching for Jay's pants
The Security guard bends down low to watch at crotch-level
Suddenly, Jay hammers his two fists into the Security Guard's neck, knocking him out
Silent Bob falls into a sitting position on the ground, relieved
Jay looks at him
Well what are you waiting for, bitch
Start sucking
Bunnggg
(looking around) Alright--where they shooting this movie at
Silent Bob points behind Jay, at the  they're in front of
There's a    waiting at the door
Worth a shot
Like a shot in the mouth, you gay bitch
Eww, dude--you were really gonna suck my dick
Silent Bob shakes his head "no," wide-eyed as Jay heads off
When Jay's out of frame, Silent bob shrugs like, "Yeah-- guess  was

What's it this time
Beaver trouble
Some kind of unauthorized marsupial trafficking
The agents crack up, stifling their laughter
(taking it in stride) No, no--nothing like that
Say--there aren't other people listening in, are there
No way, man
It's just me and you talking here
Good
'm tracking a monkey down that's on it's way to Los Angeles, and  could use some bureau backup
Los Angeles, hunh
Maybe we should stake out Clint Eastwood's place
Didn't he used to drive around with a monkey that'd punch people and drink beer
The Agents crack up
Willenholly's catching on
Am, uh--Am  on speaker phone
No way--Dunston
Alright, now that's not fair
know didn't make it as high up as you guys, but my job's just as important
Calm down, Will
Don't go all

The Agents crack up even more, Willenholly's pissed
come to you as a friend--as a fellow professional--and this is the shit get
You're right, Will
Tell you what-- we'll get our best man on your case right away
You might've heard of him
He's a doctor
(excited) Oh, a doctor
His name's Doctor Zaius
The Agents laugh hysterically, pounding the desk, Willenholly tears up, enraged
Willenholly throws his cell phone across the car, the mocking laughter still emitting from it
Willenholly cries

Let's remember who talked who into doing this shit in the first place
Talking me into Dogma was one thing, but this-- 'm sorry this is taking you away from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses- who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely- flick you're supposed to be doing this week
Oh--'m touchy-feely
take it you never saw Forces of Nature
You're like a child
What've  been telling you
Sometimes you've gotta do the safe picture
Sometimes, you do it for art
Sometimes, it's the payback picture your friend says you owe him-- They take a beat and look at the camera
Then-- And sometimes, you go back to the well
And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games
Now that's just mean
Jay turns excitedly to Bob
This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick, 'cause that's those two fucks from that Mork movie
Now all we gotta do is figure out a way to get close to them-- The

Just stand there and react
Don't say anything
Bob goes a little wide-eyed
Jay smiles at him

(calling out) Alright, people
Lock it up
Let's go for picture
Jay and Bob eye Ben and Matt fiercely, Ben and Matt are oblivious
On the count of three, we rush those fucks and beat the shit out of 'em
'Cause if they're all fucked up, they can't make the move, right
Alright, then
One--two-- / (
) Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season
Jay and Bob freeze and look at each other, then
The Clapper/Loader holds a clapboard in front of Ben's face
It does indeed, read: Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season
/ Scene sixteen, take five
The Clapper/Loader claps the board closed and races off
Ben looks to Gus
Action, Gus
Gus looks up from counting his money
Jesus, Ben-- said 'm busy
Ben shakes his head and then starts the scene with
/ You should check it out, it's a good course
But, you know, frankly, found the class rather elementary
You know,  don't doubt that it was
remember that class
It was just between recess and lunch
/ Are we gonna have a problem, again
There's no problem
was still just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the Southern Colonies
See, Wood says-- / (stepping in) What'd  say
Didn't  say you'd be back here regurgitating Gordon Wood
But you forgot about Vickers-- No,  just read Vickers, so 'm up on inherited wealth, Hunting
But you're not the angry, brilliant young mind you once were, just itching to vent your frustrations
In the background, Jay and Silent Bob get bored and head out of the shot
After a beat, they get pushed back in by the Once Sean told you it wasn't your fault, you lost the edge, William
You stopped hitting the books with a vengeance, and now 've read shit you haven't even heard about yet
Face facts, my friend--love made you a soft little pussy boy, unable to stand up to an academic showdown, like you used to
You're just no longer that good--Will Hunting
(gets in his face) Now how do you like them apples
Matt/Will turns away angrily, facing Ben/Chuckie, looking downwards, steaming
/ don't like the sound of them apples
Will, what're we gonna do now
/ Chuckie-- (snarling) It's Hunting season
Matt/Will spins to face Clark with two huge guns in his hands
He blows Clark away, Jay and Bob hit the deck
Matt/Will stands there, guns smoking
/ Apple sauce, bitch
Suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the Security guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other who comb the place
Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a ten-oh-seven on our hands
Wait a second
wasn't with any hookers today
The Security Guard sees Jay and Bob crouched behind Ben, He points, screaming
Ben and Matt turn to Jay and Bob, Jay smiles
Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms, yo
Jay and Bob then race out-of-frame, closely followed by the Security guards
Matt head off, arms thrown in the air
If anyone's looking for me, 'll be in my trailer trying to figure out how  got here from an Academy Award
-- Jay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door, blocking it
They race ten feet to another soundstage across from them and head inside a door
-- Jay and Silent Bob rush in to see-- Wes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar- looking   and
The Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4 / Scream four, scene thirty-seven, take one
(claps it and rushes off) Action
The Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff, until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out
Alright, you bastard
Let's see who you really are
Shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed
Fucking Miramax-- (getting up) Shannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask
Shannen, usually  say "cut
" monkey
Jesus, you guys aren't even trying anymore, are you
The market research suggest that people love monkeys
Jay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne
They rush out
West shrugs to Shannen
See
Security Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair
-- Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne
On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting
The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until-- At the end of the alley, a set   pulls up, and four Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking their path
Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the other Security Guards gaining
What the fuck are we gonna do
Just then, a
on a bike pulls up nearby
He ditches the bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front
Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket
They start pedaling away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse
Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart
Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the vehicle, taking flight, Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as-- Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a soundstage) a la
Jay and Bob look down, then at each other
They smile
Then they look ahead and let out a scream
The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage Building
-- The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling onto the floor covered in glass
They look up to see
dressed as Jay and Silent Bob, looking down as them
Holy shit--that looked like it hurt
Are you guys alright
(off Suzanne) Hey
They've got a monkey
Jay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other
Yo,  think that shit just kicked in
Let's get you guys on your feet
James and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet
All stare at one another, perplexed, Then-- (to James) See man
Its never, "Hey--you were in Loser, or, "Dude--you rocked in Boys and Girls
" It always comes back to that fucking pie
'm haunted by it
Well, you put your dick in a pie, dude-- Enough
(to Jay) Jason Biggs
Yo-you really get to third base with the Russsian chick like you did in the movies
You mean Shannon
Sadly, no
She's fucking hot, man
If  was you, 'd been like-- Jay mimes a series of sexual maneuvers
Jason and James look on, bewildered
(off James's-look) What, man
You never did one of these
Jay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James, blown away
Holy shit
You're the Dawson
It's James, actually
James Van Der Beek
Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing Joey away from you
If  was you, would've drowned his ass in your Creek and shit
know, Because what--is Josh better looking than me
Fuck, no
mean, who on earth is better looking that me
ask you
Joey, man
She's too fine
Yo--did you ever get to third base with her
Well, there was this one time-- (catching himself) Wait a second--who are you guys
They're our stunt doubles, dumbass
(to Jay) Right
Stunt doubles for what
The movie we start shooting in a few minutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back
(to Bob) You're doubling me
'm playing Bluntman,  Silent Bill
Bob Right
And he's playing Chronic Ray
Jay
Shit, did you even read the script
There's a script
Jay and Bob stare at them, blankly
Then Jay puts up his finger, indicating they should wait a minute
He gets into a huddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne
These are the guys who are playing us, yo
We take them out, and bickety- bam
No movie
Silent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne
Suzanne heads off, leaving Jay and Bob to huddle
(off Jay and Bob, to James) What's with the weird, gay huddle going on over there
What's gay about it
It's two guys talking in a corner
Man--why are you such a homophobe
'm not a homophobe
You are
You're always calling things gay
"Ooo--look at the gay huddle, dude
" Suzanne approaches them
Hey--look at the monkey
Next you're going to tell me the monkey's gay
He's so cute-- (to Suzanne) 'mere
Monkey
'mere-- Suzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame
While Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a beating are heard,
Alright, here's what we do: start swinging, and don't stop until those young Hollywood fucks are out of commission
Ready
Break
Jay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide- eyed
Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied and beaten and knocked out cold
She holds her hands skyward, clasped like a champion
That's one funky monkey
Suddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room
(
) Mister Biggs
Mister Van
Der-- Beek
This is Security
We've got a pair of intruders at large, and they crashed through a window we thought might be yours
(to door; deepening voice) Uh--yeah
They're in here
Do they have you hostage
Should we call your publicists
mean, we kicked those guys' asses bad
They're--knocked out
-- The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James
Great work, sirs
If you let us in, we'll take over-- (
) (through door) Me and Jason Biggs are naked in here
Together
The Security guard look at one another
Uh--okay
We'll just be--outside the door, sirs
The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job face to the rest
-- Bob opens an   in the wall
He puts Suzanne into it and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her
She nods, and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet
What the fuck are we gonna do
How are we gonna get out of here without them seeing us
Silent Bob pulls a pair of hangered  from the closet, smiling
-- The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a waiting Cop Car
The pair are still dressed like Jay and Silent Bob
'
'
' -
(to Cops) He'll be the pie--in prison
-- Jay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits)
This was a good idea, Lunchbox
In these outfits we're totally incognito
Suddenly, and
appears, grabbing them by the shoulders
Mister Biggs
Mister Van Der Beek
Great--you've changed costumes already
Let's get you to set
(pulling them off) The director doesn't like to be kept waiting
-- It looks like the Batcave, but it's not
Off to the side, near the monitor and chair setup, a black  eyeballs the hustling, white crew
Look at all these crackers, Seventy million dollars and  can't even get a black grip
white
brings a cup of latte to the Director
Here's your coffee, sir
(eyes the coffee) You spit in this
Because  know all you white folks are pissed off that the studio'd entrust a multi- million dollar to a brother
didn't spit in it, sir
Then taste it
Go on
The
takes the cup and sips from it
He tries to hand it back to the Director
It's all good, sir
No it ain't all good
Oh, you think want it now, after your lips touched the cup
Get the fuck off my set
You the man, sir
No you the Man
And that's the problem
The Director glares at the scared
, as he cautiously skulks off
approaches
Uh, Chaka
Yeah, hi--'m Banky Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and Chronic
We met a few weeks back
'm the executive producer
/ Oh--you're the executive producer, hunh
Well go "produce" me a latte no white folks spit in--okay Fucky
Banky
just wanted you to know that  respect your work as an artist
'm something of an artist myself was the inker on the comic book
An inker
What, like you trace
Banky's face drops as the
joins them
Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the set, Chaka
don't see 'em
Where are they
(into bullhorn) On the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake rock
Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as --step from the darkness
Jay and Bob survey the set, amazed
This must've set 'em back a couple hundred bucks
Look at this shit
(off their outfits) gay hood ornament, and the color Purple
Who the fuck are you
Who the fuck am
'm the fucking director, is who  am
Chaka Luther King
The creator of all of this
Wait a sec-- thought Holden and Banky created this shit
And 'm stealing it
'm taking it back for all the shit you people have stolen from us
Did you know, came up with the idea for Sesame Street before
was going to call it
--Niggaz with Puppets
(beat) Alright--enough small talk
Let's shoot it
Chaka heads back toward his monitor
Jay and Bob are confused
Wait, wait, wait
Aren't you gonna direct us
'll be directing you to the food stamps line after  fire your ass, if you talk back like that to me again
But we don't know what we're supposed to do here
We didn't even read the script
So
Neither did
Shit, neither did the studio
(pointing
) Look man, it's not hard
In this scene, the bad guy breaks into the Bluntcave
You make up some shit, fight him for a while,  film it, yell "cut," and then head back to my trailer, where  got more white women waiting for me there than the first lifeboat off the Titanic
(confidentially) They all want a part of the movie, and  got just the part for 'em
Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off
'
(
) Chaka climbs behind his monitor
The
is waiting for him with another cup of coffee
got you another cup of coffee, sir
Spit free
Chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down
The Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and Bob, getting ready
After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob
/ just wanna say that  loved when you fucked that pie
(calling off) , -,
The clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off
From behind the monitor, Chaka calls out-- Jay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for a beat
Then-- / Uh--Snootchie Bootchies
Suddenly, the wall to their left explodes
Jay and Bob hit the deck
Through the smoking rubble steps ---the arch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic
He's a normal-looking man with huge, overgrown
/ What the fuck
- You thought 'd never find your precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp Knight
But now you and your sidekick are finally in the grasp of Cock- Knocker
/ Why do they call you "Cock-Knocker"
Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls
Jay drops to his knees, wailing
Cock-Knocker then pulls a vibrator-looking device from his cape
He presses a button on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a light saber
- Any last words before  bust your balls, Bluntman
Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left
His eyes fall on-- wall of armaments, on which hands a  , under the placard:  --
It's out of his reach
Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating
He reached his hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick
Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip
The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive pose
Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair start light saber dueling
(from behind monitor) Damn
Now that was one special effect
This picture's gonna make House Party look like House Party Two
Or House Party Three
Shut the fuck up
Cock-Knocker battles Bob back
He vogues some impressive blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head
He lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose
Cock- Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on his ass across the floor
Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver a saber kill-shot, when we hear-- (
) --
Cock-Knocker turns to see-- Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a double-sided saber
He clicks it and  beams emit (a la the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One)
Call me Darth Balls
Bunngg
Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong Saber
(from behind the monitor) think George Lucas is going to sue somebody-- -- Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a shotgun
He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside the flashing red light
(looking around) So, this is Hollywood
(suddenly full of purpose) Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent Bob
Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door
-- The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two shots,
Willenholly goes wide-eyed
It's not Bluntcave
We're on a different soundstage, where a kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure
There's a Barney-sized  surrounded by little
The Kids stare back at Willenholly terrified
The Mooby suit has smoking bullet holes in it
Mooby collapses
Oh my God-- (to kids) Um--sorry
That was supposed to be a warning shot
Uh--it looks like 'm on the wrong, uh--wrong set
The Kids look at the fallen Mooby
On looks angrily at the Willenholly
You killed Mooby-- (to Kids) '
The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as he's attacked
-- Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle
- (breaking character) You are not upstaging me, Van Der Beek
Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker, hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear reactor
Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other hand
- (to
Chaka) -- ""
On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire)
Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber, Jay grins at Cock-Knocker
Now whose balls have been busted, bitch
Suddenly, a gun shot rings out
All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun first on Jay, then Bob
The
stops here, Jay and Silent Bob
(revealing badge: calling out) Everyone stay calm
'm a Federal Wildlife Marshal
These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey
(
) They didn't really steal that monkey
All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows
Willenholly trains his gun on her
Jay's mouth drops
It was just a diversion so we could steal these
Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing them
And they're not the leaders of The
is not real
No--the clit's real
The female orgasm is a myth
(to Jay) Are you guys alright
thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty Fuck
(smiling) You remembered
(back to business) It was a frame-up, Jay
Sissy
Missy, Chrissy, and  are international jewel thieves
We were setting you up as a patsy, but  couldn't go through with it, because
because love you
Yeah
So that means you'll fuck me, right
(
) If she does, it'll be considered necrophilia
All turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the shadows, guns drawn
Because she's gonna be one dead bitch
(to Justice) Hi, Jussy
We catch you at a bad time
You should've just let these guys go down, Jussy
Hey,  wanted to go down, but  was waiting until  got to know her a little better
See, there was this little angel on my shoulder, and he said-- Shut the fuck up before  shoot you where you stand in your pansy red booties
(looking down) Holy shit,  am wearing pansy red booties
(to Bob) Man--why the fuck didn't you tell me
Let's have those diamonds, Jussy
can't do that, Sissy (points her gun at Jay) Then lover--boy gets one in the brain
All turn to look at Chaka
Would any of you lovely ladies like a private audition to be in my movie
Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand
It lands on the ground discharging
Then everyone starts shooting and running for cover
Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile
Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed craft service table labeled
They pop back up and start firing at Willenholly
Willenholly leaps behind a barren craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented can of  Cola
He pops up and returns fire
When both are out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and reload
From behind his table, Willenholly yells-- ' : --' , ,
:  '
The Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire again
Chaka ducks behind the monitor
shitload of white people with guns
Time to get my black ass out of here
He races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each other defensively, striking kung fu poses
You really let me down, Justice
Throwing it all away for a little stoner with bad pronunciation
(
) (ignoring him) What's it gonna be, Sissy
Which fighting style do you want me to kick your ass in
Are you kidding me
taught you all all your moves myself
There's not a style you can bust that  can't defend against
You're no match for my "Shaolin Monk
" Yeah, but  can bury you with my "Crouching Tiger
" little "Venus's--flytrap"
'll counter with "Dragon Crane
" How about a little "Bitch, My Man Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy"
(beat; smiles) Bring it on
Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and screaming
Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action
Yo-- hope one of 'em rips the other one's shirt off and we see some tit
Both Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding
Banky joins them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head
Mister Biggs
Mister Van Der Beek just wanted to say hi
'm-- Banky fucking Edwards
Just the motherfucker we came to see
(shocked) Holy shit
What the fuck are you guys doing here
Sissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the floor, screeching
Jay, Bob, and Banky continue
Stop the movie
Are you crazy
All these assholes are calling us names on the Internet, 'cause of this stupid movie
feel for you boys-- really do
Those Net snipers can be really cruel
But Miramax paid me a shitload of money for Bluntman and Chronic, so it occurs to me that people bad- mouthing you on some web-site is none of my
Oh--but  think it is
Banky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes
Here we go again-- Shut the fuck up
(to Banky) We had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights
And as we're not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property, Bluntman and Chronic, when we said property was optioned by Miramax Films you were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the concept to another medium
As you failed to do that, you're in breach of the original contract--ergo, you find yourself in a very actionable position
Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay
After a beat, Jay adds-- Yeah
Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming
So, what do you guys want, to go away and take your lady friends with you
Shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the Internet anymore
Even if there's no movie, people are still free to talk shit about you on the Internet
That's what the Internet's for: slandering others anonymously
Stopping the flick isn't going to stop that
In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the air
Well this isn't fair
We went to Hollywood,  fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the motherfucking nuts
We ain't leaving empty-handed
On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap
What's up baby
You look good
Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy
Oh yeah
(pushing Sissy off him) Get the fuck offa me, pig
Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair
Jay, Bob, and Banky continue
You guys are gonna ruin my movie career
Well, we want something for our mental anguish
Tell you what: we'll settle this monetarily
'll give you half of what  made
Half
Half's not good enough
Fine--'ll give you two-thirds of what  made
Fuck-you--you already said half
You can't take it back
Silent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand
Done Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor
Both get up, facing each other
Your shit is so tired, Justice
Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--
Justice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage
Sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out
Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting
Hello
Truce
(beat) think  killed both of them
Suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and  standing behind him, holding the gun up in the air
Justice surveys her handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile
'mon guys
It's over
Jay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her
Yo,  was just about to jump in there and get your back
Then, the  of  rings out in the distance
Holy shit, the cops
We gotta get out of here
No
'm tired of running
Justice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps his face
You awake, Marshal
Marshal
(tries to move but can't) Oh my God, 'm paralyzed
The monkey shot me in the ass and paralyzed me
Oh the irony
(off Suzanne's gun) You're not paralyzed
It was just a tranquilizer
Jesus
Tranqued by a little monkey
My friends in the Bureau are never gonna let me live this down
You have friends in the
(crying) They all made it in, but  failed the exam
Why the hell else do you think  became a Federal Wildlife Marshal
'Cause 'm a joke
Justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking
Then-- Maybe not
can make you a deal that'll get you into the
, regardless of test scores
What kind of deal
You drop the charges against Jay and Silent Bob and say you never found the ape
Make sure the world knows they're not in control of any
Now wait a second-- 'll explain later, Jay (to Willenholly) In exchange, 'll give you the diamonds  stole, and turn in Sissy, Missy, Chrissy, and myself
But want a reduced sentence
You'd be willing to do that
(off Jay) For him
'd be willing to do anything
Justice stands and takes Jay by the hands
'm an international jewel thief who's facing a jail sentence
That's alright
'm a junkie with a monkey
If  go to prison, will you wait for me
don't know
Will we fuck when you get out
Justice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately
The kiss should say it all, but-- Don't change the subject
Will we fuck when you get out
Snoogans
Justice and Jay kiss again
Suzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up
She grabs his face and kisses him
Willenholly looks to Banky
Wow
There's a lot of love in the room
Regardless of what you may have heard
do not kiss guys
-- Justice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls her away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car
Sorry, Justice
We've gotta go
(to Jay: friendly) Hey--stop stealing monkeys
Fuck you
Fair enough
Willenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the car
(to Jay) Wait for me
What--here
Jay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away, leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky
They start walking down the lot
Well, boys--you're rich in love-- (indicating Jay) Well, you're in love
And to top that off, you've got your own monkey
What more could two guys from Jersey possibly want
All those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the Internet, for starters
What do  keep telling you
There's not much you can do to stop that
Well, short of showing up at all their houses and beating the shit out of them,  guess
Jay and Bob suddenly freeze
They look at each other and smile
(to Bob) You know--with all that money we're gonna make we can buy a lotta plane tickets
-- passenger  flies through the sky
-- Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house
They check the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod at each other, and cross the street
-- The doorbell rings
answers it to see Jay and Silent Bob standing in the doorway
Can  help you
Yes
Ma'am, Does-- (reading of paper) William Dusky live here
Yes
He's my son
May we talk to him, please
One moment
She walks away
After a beat, a fifteen-year-old  comes to the door
Yeah
Yo--do you post as-- (reading off paper) Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot
com
Yeah
And did you write "Fuck Jay and Silent Bob
Fuck them up their stupid asses
Yeah, a while ago
So
Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the , pull him outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front lawn
-- The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite direction
-- Jay and Bob knocking at another door
Another  answers
They speak, she heads inside, and another  comes to the door
On Movie Poop Shoot
com
did you say Jay and Silent Bob-- (reading off paper) "--are fucking clown shoes
If they were real, 'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid
" (chuckling) Yeah
Really-- Again, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit out of him
-- Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a
-- Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a
-- Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a
-- Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a
-- The marquee reads: The front doors open and the  lets out
First we see and
Now that was worse then Clash of the Titans
still can't believe Judy Dench played me
Hey--remind me to renew that restraining order
Why
Because 'm gonna blast the flick on the Internet tonight
- and  exit
- Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent comic book movie
Tell'em Steve-Dave
- Would you stop saying that
and  come out
Well, that was just another paean to male adolescence and its refusal to grow up
Yeah, sis--but it was better than Mallrats
At least Holden had the good sense to keep his name off of it
Why wouldn't Miramax option his other comic instead
You know--the one he drew about you and him and your relationship
You mean Chasing Amy
That would never work as a movie
and  exit
'm so fucking embarrassed-- Honey, you should be
They took your characters and reduced them to one ninety-minute-long-gay joke
It was like watching Batman and Robin again
Thanks
That means a lot coming from the guy who pretends to be Shaft as opposed to the guy who takes shaft
don't hear you complaining nightly
In fact, the only thing  do hear you say is "Yes, Hooper
Cradle the balls and work the shaft
" (looking around) Hey
Hey
What'd we say
Not in public
guy behind them calls out to Banks
Nice movie, you fucking Tracer
(recognizing him) You--
