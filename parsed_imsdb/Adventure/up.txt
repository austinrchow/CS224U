(
) "Movietown News" presents
Spotlight on Adventure
The mysterious
massive waterfall cascades down a gigantic, flat-topped mountain
(
) What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity: a lost world in South America
Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls, it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science
Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit
painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer
(
) Why, our subject today: Charles Muntz
massive  descends on an airfield
(
) The beloved explorer lands his dirigible, the "Spirit of Adventure," in New Hampshire this week, completing a year long expedition to the lost world
- Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no one is more enthralled than 8 year old
(
) This lighter-than-air craft was designed by Muntz himself, and is longer than 22 Prohibition paddy- wagons placed end to end
Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen
(
) And here comes the adventurer now
2
: the dashing Muntz descends down the gangplank to the delight of the crowd
His dogs trail him
(
) Never apart from his faithful dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort
It's a veritable floating palace in the sky
An opulent dining room
(
) complete with doggie bath and mechanical canine walker
One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill
(
) And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees
And how
Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature "thumbs up" stance
"Adventure is out there
" In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up
(
) But what has Muntz brought back this time
Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a curtained object
Gentlemen,  give you: the Monster of Paradise Falls
He pulls away the drape to reveal a
Ooh
Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging
(
) And golly, what a swell monster this is
But what's this
Skeptical scientists analyze the bones
3
(
) Scientists cry foul
The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton
No
Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other famous explorers
(
) The organization strips Muntz of his membership
Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously from his jacket
Carl
Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield
He grimly addresses the crowd
(
) Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast
alive
promise to capture the beast
alive
In the theater, young Carl smiles
And  will not come back until  do
The crowd
Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible lifts off
(
) And so the    explorer is off to clear his name
Bon voyage Charles Muntz, and    good luck capturing the Monster of    Paradise Falls
Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle
: 4
, 1930' -  - Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk
He still wears helmet and goggles
: (
) Here's Charles Muntz piloting his famous dirigible
: (
) He hurdles Pike's Peak
Carl jumps over a small rock
(
) He hurdles the Grand Canyon
Carl jumps over a crack in the sidewalk
(
) He hurdles Mount Everest
Carl jumps over a tree stump
and smacks into it instead
(
) He
goes around Mount Everest
Is there nothing he cannot do
: (
) Yes, as Muntz himself says: "Adventure is--" '  (
) "Adventure is out there
" Carl stops
Who said that
The voice comes from a dilapidated , windows boarded up and lawn overgrown with weeds
The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes
'  (
) Look out
Mount Rushmore
Hard to starboard
Must get the Spirit of Adventure over Mount Rushmore

Carl walks toward the voice
'  (
) Hold together old girl
How're my dogs doing
Ruff ruff
,  - Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer
He follows the voice toward the living room
'  (
) All engines ahead full
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet
Rudders eighteen degrees towards the south
,   - Carl rounds the corner to see
, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles
Bare footed, her overalls are patched and dirty
The old house has been transformed into a make-believe dirigible cockpit
Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty old bicycle
It's a beautiful day, winds out of the east at ten knots
Visibility
unlimited
(yells a command) Enter the weather in the logbook
The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage
Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars
Oh
There's something down there
will bring it back for science
Awwww, it's a puppy
Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to the wall
(
) No time
storm
Lightning
Hail
Ellie pops up in front of Carl
6
What are you doing
Carl screams
He lets go of his balloon
It floats through a broken part of the ceiling and disappears
Ellie circles Carl accusingly
Don't you know this is an exclusive club
Only explorers get in here
Not just any kid off the street with a helmet and a pair of goggles
Do you think you got what it takes
Well, do you
Carl
Alright, you're in
Welcome aboard
She offers her hand
Carl looks down, embarrassed
What's wrong
Can't you talk
Carl is frozen
Ellie softens
Hey,  don't bite
She takes off her helmet
Her hair frizzes out in all directions
She removes a homemade    pin from her shirt and pins it on Carl
You and me, we're in a club now
Carl smiles
saw where your balloon went
Come on, let's go get it
Carl watches her stride out of the room
She pops back in
My name's Ellie
She grabs his hand
Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room
7
, There it is
Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon
Between them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam
Carl
Well, go ahead
She pushes him out onto the beam
Go on
Carl steels his courage
He puts on his goggles, starts forward
and  through the floor

blaring
'  - One lone light on upstairs

Ellie climbs in the window
Thought you might need a little cheerin' up

'  - The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight
Ellie whispers, as if to protect a National Secret

Ever
In my life
Carl's eyes widen in alarm
You'll have to swear you will not tell anyone
Carl nods
Cross your heart
Do it

"  ripped this right out of a library book
Carl  in horror
'm gonna move my clubhouse there, and park it right next to the falls
Who knows what lives up there
And once  get there
She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, " '
" Past that, the pages are blank
Well, 'm saving these pages for all the adventures 'm gonna have
Only

Ellie closes the book, disappointed
Carl has a thought
He looks at his toy dirigible
That's it
You can take us there in a blimp
Swear you'll take us
Cross your heart
Cross it
Cross your heart
Carl does
Good
You promised
No backing out
Carl shakes his head "no
" Well, see you tomorrow kid
Bye
Ellie hops up and jumps out the window
"Adventure is out there
" She pops back in

Carl looks out the window after her in amazement
He rests his head on his balloon
Wow
The balloon pops

If you go past -- Two blocks down

Russell runs down the block clapping and calling
Sniiiipe

Strings tug at the chimney
The house strains

The house rips away from its foundation
The nurses duck and  as the house soars over them
Carl looks out the window and
So long boys
'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls
- Balloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the house floats past
The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection

The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away from the city
Carl looks out his window
Good riddance
25

Russell
Hi, Mr
Fredricksen
It's me, Russell
What are you doing out here, kid
Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and holding on for dear life
found the snipe and  followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse
The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through the clouds
Please let me in
No
Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone
Beat
The door opens again
Oh, alright, you can come
Russell runs into the house past Carl
in
27
' ,  - Russell , panicked
He looks into living room
Huh

Russell chuckles and points at the photo of young Ellie
Goggles
Look at this stuff
Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas
Wow, you going on a trip
(reads from the engraving) "Paradise Falls:  Land Lost in Time
" You going to South America, Mr
Fredricksen
Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket
Don't touch that
You'll soil it
You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your  and clocks and stuff
Russell runs over to the steering rig
Whoah
Is this how you steer your house
Does it really work
Kid, would you stop with the -- Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and forth
Oh, this makes it go right, and that way's left
Let go of the -- knock it off
Russell looks out the window in front of him
28
Hey look, buildings
' ,  - Russell and Carl arrive at the window
That building's so close  could almost touch it
That gives Carl an idea
: Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house
Wow
This is great
You should try this, Mr
Fredricksen
Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away
(looking up) Hey,  can see your house from here
(struggling to hold on) Don't jerk around so much, kid
The rope slips through Carl's hands
Russell
: Carl stands beside Russell at the window
Russell's fall had been a daydream
Well, that's not gonna work
Carl leaves Russell at the window

Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus
' ,   -  - , Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon strings with his housekeys
29
Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for what
warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go by each other and that's how we get lightning
That's nice, kid
Carl turns off his hearing aid
Silence
He smiles
Russell tries to get Carl's attention
storm is brewing in the distance
(nearly silent) Mr
Fredricksen, there's a big storm coming
It's starting to get scary
We're gonna get blown to bits
We're in big trouble, Mr
Fredricksen

30
My pack
Russell  on top of the backpack
Got ya
The pack slides toward the
Russell screams
He's about to slide out when the house tilts and the door swings shut
The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl
He chases after it

Carl gasps and runs to protect it
The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall
Carl lunges to catch it
' , The storm rages
The house is tossed into the storm clouds
All goes black
' ,   - Carl is asleep

Nothing
The finger pokes Carl's face again
Carl
Whew

Steered us
31
After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so  went ahead and steered us down here
' , Carl opens the window and looks out
Huh
' , The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds
' , Can't tell where we are
' , Oh we're in South America all right
It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer
Russell holds up his
-what
My dad gave it to me
It shows exactly where we are on the planet
With this baby, we'll never be lost
Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window
' , Carl and Russell watch the tiny  unit descend into the clouds
Oops
32
' , Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings
We'll get you down, find a bus stop
You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother
Sure, but  don't think they have busses in Paradise Falls
' , small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house
' , There
That ought to do it
Here, 'll give you some change for bus fare
Russell follows Carl toward the front door
Nah, 'll just use my city bus pass
' , The house lowers into the fog
(
) Whoah, that's gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house
' , Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down into and through the thick, dark clouds
Mr
Fredricksen, how much longer
Well, we're up pretty high
Could take hours to get down
Something flashes by them in the fog
Carl leans forward
33
() that thing was
building or something
Another dark object whooshes past them
Carl ducks
What was that, Mr
Fredricksen
We can't be close to the ground yet
brief view of rocks directly below them
Carl
, The house  into the ground
Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground
They land hard
Carl's house is floating away
Carl runs after the   dragging across the ground
Wait, wait
No don't, don't, don't
Carl grabs the hose and is   in the air
Whoah
Hey, hey
Russell  onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground
Russell, hang on
Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a
Whoah
They slide toward the edge
and stop
The drop is thousands of feet
Carl is
Walk back
Walk back
34
Okay
Russell  Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge
Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around
Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only scattered rocks
(out of breath) Where
where are we
This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr
Fredricksen
The wind picks up and they  against it
(to house) Don't worry, Ellie
got it
The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped, flat-topped mountain on which they stand
Across it, some ten miles away, is
Carl stares
He can't believe it
There it is
Ellie, it's so beautiful
The landscape is stunning
Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of the house atop the falls
We made it
We made it
Russell, we could float right over there
Climb up
Climb up
You mean assist you
Yeah, yeah
Whatever
Okay, 'll climb up
Russell  Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face
35
Watch it
Sorry
The hose jiggles as Russell  out of frame
Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up
Got it
Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen
You on the porch yet
Russell is just inches above Carl, still  to climb
He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted
What
That's it
came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile
Aw, great
Carl paces
Hey, if  could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge
What are you talking about
We could walk your house to the falls
Walk it
Yeah, after all, we weigh it down
We could walk it right over there
Like a parade balloon
Carl considers this
36
,  ,  - The house floats against the sky
The hose descends from the house and ""s to tie to both Carl and Russell
They wear the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing
Russell inspects his surroundings
() Uh-huh
We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons
And if we're not at the falls when that happens
Sand
we're not getting to the falls
found sand
Carl
He looks up at the house
Don't you worry, Ellie
We'll get our house over there
Russell looks up at the house
Who's Carl talking to
Huh
(shrugs it off) This is fun already, isn't it
By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted
Oh, Mr
Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call
Caw caw, raaar
The    sets off Carl's hearing aid
37
Wait
Why are we going to Paradise Falls again
Hey, let's play a game
It's called: "See who can be quiet the longest
" Cool
My mom loves that game
They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away
: ,   - Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape
Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks
Two dark shapes are chasing the prey
Each has a light
Hunters
,    - The prey dodges various , one after another
metal cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire
The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end
,  - The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each wearing large, -
They surround the prey
Escape looks impossible
The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash
The dogs head off in pursuit
stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain
They whimper and run off
38
,   -  - Carl steps out from behind a shrub
The  is in fact his
Darn thing
(calling back) 'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up
Russell plods forward, dragging his feet
'm tiiiired
And my knee hurts
Which knee
My elbow hurts and  have to go to the bathroom
asked you about that five minutes ago
Well,  didn't have to go then
Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt
don't want to walk anymore
Can we stop
Russell
If you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you
There's no tigers in South America
Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge
Zoology
Oh, for the love of Pete
Go on into the bushes and do your business
Okay
Here, hold my stuff
39
Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands, secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs
He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand and a pile of leaves in another
've always wanted to try this
Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to
(
) Mr
Fredricksen
Am  supposed to dig the hole before or after
Eugh
None of my concern
Beat
(
) Oh
It's before
Carl covers his ears
,   - Russell pats down a mound and  in satisfaction
He is about to return to Carl when he spots some
Huh
Tracks
() Snipe
Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping
Here, snipe
Come on out, snipe
Snipe
The footprints continue for a time, then stop
Huh
Russell munches on a chocolate bar
Something  in the bushes behind him
He turns to look
Behind him,   takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips out
40
Russell turns
Nothing there
Another nibble
Zip
Ha
Gotcha
Russell peers into the shrub
Don't be afraid, little snipe am a Wilderness Explorer so  am a friend to all of nature
Want some more
Russell holds out the chocolate
The beak pokes out and nibbles
Hi boy
Don't eat it all
Come on out
The beak zips back into the bushes
Come on
Don't be afraid little snipe
Nice snipe
Good little snipe
Nice
massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell
giant snipe
, Carl checks the knot on his hose harness
Russell and the massive creature step up behind him
found the snipe
(humoring him) Oh, did you
Are they tall
Oh yes, they're very tall
41
Do they have a lot of colors
They do indeed
Do they like chocolate
Oh ye-   Chocolate
Carl turns to look
Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored
Carl
What is that thing
It's a snipe
There's no such thing as a snipe
But you said snipes eat-- Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird
The bird  at Carl and grabs Russell back
It cradles Russell like a baby
Whoah
Russell
Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off
Go on, get out of here
Go on
Shoo
The bird
It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around playfully
It looks scary and fun
() Whoah
Whoah
42
Careful, Russell
() Hey, look Mr
Fredricksen, it likes me
Russell
The bird grooms Russell
() No stop, that tickles
Carl pokes the bird with his cane
Get out of here
Go on, git
The bird sets Russell down
It stalks Carl,  and ruffling its feathers
Aaaah
Uh-oh
No no no no no Kevin, it's okay
Mr
Fredricksen is nice
Russell pats Carl on the head
"Kevin"
Yeah, that's his name  just gave him
The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak
Hey
Beat it
Vamoose
Scram
Carl waves his cane
The bird eats it
Hey
That's mine
The bird chokes and the cane comes back up
43
Aaah
Shoo, shoo
Get out of here
Carl shoos the bird away
The bird mimics him
Go on, beat it
, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air
The bird mimics this as well
Can we keep him
Please
'll get the food for him, 'll walk him, 'll change his newspapers
No
() "An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole
" That doesn't even rhyme
Yeah it does
Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house
Hey, look
Kevin
What
Get down
You're not allowed up there
The bird is on Carl's roof
It swallows a balloon
It
The bird coughs up the deflated balloon
Russell
You come down here right now
The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell
Sheesh
Can you believe this, Ellie
Ellie
(gets idea) () 44
(cont'd) Uh, hey Ellie, could  keep the bird
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
(to Carl) She said for you to let me
(to Ellie) But  told him no -- (catches himself) told you no
-
The bird  at Carl
,   - Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist
Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail
The bird follows, eating
see you back there
It "hides" behind a rock, still totally visible
Go on, get out of here
Shoo
Go annoy someone else for a while
(
) Hey, are you okay over there
The bird dashes away
Uh, hello
Carl and Russell look around
In the midst, some 100 feet away, they see the
Oh
Hello sir
Thank goodness
Carl walks toward the man
It's nice to know someone else is up here
can smell you
45
Carl stops
What
You can smell us
can smell you
As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a
Hey
Russell
You were talking to a rock
Russell points to another rock shape
Hey, that one looks like a turtle
Sure enough
Look at that one
That one looks like a dog
The "rock" walks forward
It is a dog
What
Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment
The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it
Hey,  like dogs
(calls out) We have your dog
(to self) Wonder who he belongs to
Sit boy
46
The dog sits
Hey look, he's trained
Shake
The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it
Uh-huh
Speak
Hi there
Carl and Russell freeze
Did that dog just say "Hi there
" Oh yes
Carl  back
My name is Dug
have just met you and  love you
Dug jumps up on to Carl
Uh
wha
Dug wears a high-tech collar
The dog's thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker
It can talk
Unfortunately, it talks non-stop
My master made me this collar
He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that  may talk --
Dug stares transfixed at a tree
False alarm
My master is good and smart
It's not possible
Oh it is, because my master is smart
47
Cool
What do these do, boy
He inspects the collar and twists a dial
Hey would you- () -cuerdo con tigo- () use that collar- () -watashi wa hanashi ma- () -to talk with,  would be happy if you stopped
Russell, don't touch that
It could be radioactive or something
Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell
am a great tracker
My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself
Have you seen a bird want to find one and  have been on the scent
am a great tracker, did  mention that
The bird tackles Dug and
Hey, that is the bird
have never seen one up close but this is the bird
(to Carl) May  take your bird back to camp as my prisoner
Yes
Take it
And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog
Oh  can bark
Dug
And here's howling
Dug
The bird  at Dug
48
Can we keep him
Please please please
No
Russell falls to his knees, pleading
But it's a talking dog
It's just a weird trick or something
Let's get to the falls
Carl grabs Russell
The bird follows, as does Dug
Please be my prisoner
Oh please oh please be my prisoner
,    - Footprints
dog's nose follows the tracks
This is , a bulldog
Oh, here it is
picked up the bird's scent
second dog: , a Rottweiler
Wait a minute, wait a minute
What is this
Chocolate
smell chocolate
'm getting prunes and denture cream
Who are they
Ah man, Master will not be pleased
We'd better tell him someone took the bird, right Alpha
, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them
(high-pitched voice) No
Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again
49
Alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in helium
(') Find the scent, my compadres and you two shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage
Beta and Gamma look at each other
Hey Alpha,  think there's something wrong with your collar
You must have bumped it
Yeah, your voice sounds funny
Beta and Gamma
Alpha turns
They stop laughing
Beta
Gamma
Mayhaps you desire to --
All three dogs look for the squirrel
False alarm
(') Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that  have been assigned by my strength and cunning
No no
But maybe Dug would
You might want to ask him
Beta and Gamma  derisively
Yeah,  wonder if he's found the bird on his very special mission
Do not mention Dug to me at this time
His fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed
Ha ha ha
Do you not agree with that which  am saying to you now
Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat
50
You are wise, my trusted Lieutenant
Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta's collar
(') This is Alpha calling Dug
Come in, Dug
The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug's collar
Hi Alpha
Hey, your voice sounds funny
know,  know
Have you seen the bird
Why yes, the bird is my prisoner now
Yeah, right
The screen view adjusts to see the bird
It hisses
Impossible
Where are you
am here with the bird and  will bring it back and then you will like me
Oh, gotta go
On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy's face
It's Russell
(on video screen) Hey Dug
Who you talking to
The video screen goes blank
The dogs  excitedly
What's Dug doing
Why's he with that small mailman
51
Where are they
Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar locates Dug
There he is
Come on
The dogs sprint off into the jungle
,  - The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg
Oh please oh please oh  be my prisoner
Dug, stop bothering Kevin
That man there says  can take the bird and  love that man there like he is my master
The bird
am not your master
The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg
Dug jumps up on it
am warning you, once again, bird
Hey
Quit it
am jumping on you now, bird
Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether
Russell
At this rate we'll never get to the falls
Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over
Carl falls, pulling the house into a tall rock
Carl
He turns his anger to the group
52
am nobody's master, got it
(points to bird) don't want you here, (points to Dug) and  don't want you here
(points to Russell) 'm stuck with you
And if you two don't clear out of here by the time count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane
ball
Oh boy oh boy
ball
Ball
Carl pops off one of the tennis balls
You want it boy
Huh
Huh
Yeah
Oh oh oh
Yes,  do
do ever so want the ball
Go get it
Carl throws the ball far away
Dug chases after it
Oh boy, oh boy
will get it and then bring it back
() Quick Russell, give me some chocolate
Why
Just give it to me
Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird
Bird
Bird
Carl  the chocolate
The bird runs after it
53
Carl grabs Russell and runs
'mon Russell
Wait
Wait, Mr
Fredricksen
Carl pulls them down a slope
He slips
Above the tree line, the house  into a tree
Daah
Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks
Carl slips and his foot goes into the water
Aaahh
What are we doing
Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves
buzz around him
Carl climbs up the hill
He  over a dead branch
Hey, uh, we're pretty far now
Kevin's gonna miss me
,   - They climb over a ridge
Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight
Carl sits down on a rock,
54
think that did the trick
He turns
Dug
With the ball in his mouth
Hi, Master
Afternoon
Carl turns the other way
The bird
It  at him
Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl's lap
,    - clap of thunder
Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house
Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire
Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg
He rolls his eyes and looks up at the house
Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie
(
) Which one's the front
Russell struggles to set up the tent
He reads his manual
Is this step three, or step five
Carl    at Russell's ineptness
There
Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into place
Carl can't watch
An off screen
Russell walks to Carl
Miraculously, he looks unscathed
All done
Russell turns, revealing a large   on his face
55
(pointing to tent) That's for you
The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the cliff
Awh
Tents are hard
Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness Guy
" With the 's and the badges
Yeah, but
can  tell you a secret
No
Alright, here goes
never actually built a tent before
There
said it
You've been camping before, haven't you
Well, never outside
Well, why didn't you ask your Dad how to build a tent
don't think he wants to talk about this stuff
Why don't you try him sometime
Maybe he'll surprise you
Well, he's away a lot
don't see him much
He's got to be home sometime
56
Well,  called, but Phyllis told me bug him too much
Phyllis
You call your own mother by her first name
Phyllis isn't my mom
Carl realizes he put his foot in it
Oh
The two sit silently together, watching the fire
But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right
Carl studies Russell's sad optimism
He looks at the missing badge on Russell's sash
Hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep
Don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus
Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg
Mr
Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner
We have to protect him
Russell  and lies down on the rock next to Carl
Can Kevin go with us
Alright
He can come
Promise you won't leave him
Yeah
57
Cross your heart
Carl looks down at Russell
Cross my heart
Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep
He shakes his head and looks up at the house
What have  got myself into, Ellie
: ,    - frog sits next to Carl's glasses
It
Carl's hand smacks it like an alarm clock
The frog hops away
Carl rises, looking up at the house
Morning Sweetheart
The balloons on the house are wilting
We better get moving
He scans the camp
The bird is gone
Huh
Bird's gone
Maybe Russell won't notice
(calls out) Alright, everybody up
Russell sits up with a
Where's Kevin
He's wandered off
Kevin
Dug, find Kevin
Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird
Find the bird
Find the bird
Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left
58
Oh, look
There he is
Russell points to the right
The bird is on top of Carl's house
Dug turns around
The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof
Hey, that's my food
Get off my roof
Yeah, get off of his
In the distance,   call out
The bird  back
What is it doing
The bird is calling to her babies
Her babies
Kevin's a girl
The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof
Her house is over there in those twisty rocks
Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the
The baby birds call from somewhere inside
She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them
The bird "hugs" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head with her beak
She  at Dug
Wait, Kevin's just leaving
But you promised to protect her
Her babies need her, we gotta make sure they're together
59
The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth
Carl gathers up the hose tether
Sorry Russell
We've lost enough time already
Yeah
,    - The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes ahead
She scampers back toward the house
, Russell chews on some chocolate
This was her favorite chocolate
Because you sent her away, there's more for you
Carl rolls his eyes and
They hear rustling from the bushes behind them
Huh
Kevin
Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously barking and growling
Carl protects Russell with his cane
Dug is conflicted
Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl
He turns toward Dug
(high-pitched voice) Where's the bird
You said you had the bird
Oh, yes
Oh, yes
Since  have said that,  can see how you would think that
60
Where is it
Uh, tomorrow
Come back tomorrow and then  will again have the bird
Yes
Alpha  angrily
You lost it
Why do  not have a surprised feeling
Well, at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and The One Who Smells of Prunes
Carl and Russell look at Dug
He turned on them
Dug shamefully lowers his head
Master will be most pleased we have found them, and will ask of them many questions
(commanding, to Carl) Come
Wait, we're not going with you
We're going to the falls
Gamma and Beta  fiercely at Carl
Get away from me
Get down
The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners
Dug follows
The house is pulled after them, and on the roof:
,    - Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon
Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls
Four more large dogs join the group
Carl and Russell watch warily and continue their march
They round a bend
Before them is a
61
, The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening
step out of the cave
Carl and Russell stop
More dogs approach from the side
Every way Carl turns there are more dogs
Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell
Closer
closer
From the darkness a voice: (
) Stay
The dogs stop
figure peers out from the darkness
It examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house
You came here in that
Uh
yeah
In a house
floating house
The man laughs
Carl and Russell laugh along nervously
That is the darndest thing 've ever seen
You're not after my bird, are you
But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, 'd be happy to oblige
The dogs  uproariously at the man's joke
Well, this is all a misunderstanding
My dogs made a mistake
The figure walks out toward Carl into the light
Carl recognizes him
Wait, are you Charles Muntz
Well
Yes
62
The Charles Muntz
Muntz gives him the "thumbs up
" "Adventure is out there
" Carl  with glee
It's really him
(to Russell) That's Charles Muntz
() It is
() Who's Charles Muntz
Him
Yes
It is him
He is
'm Carl Fredricksen
My wife and , we were your biggest fans
Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand
Muntz is charmed
Well, you're a man of good taste
Muntz  at his joke
Carl joins in
You must be tired
Hungry
Uh-huh
(to dogs) Attention everyone
These people are no longer intruders
They are our guests
The dogs
63
Follow me
like you temporarily
You do smell like prunes
will not bite you
Muntz walks into the cave
Carl and Russell excitedly follow
- Wow
Carl's eyes adjust to the dark
Muntz's dirigible the "Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave
(
) 'm sorry about the dogs -- hope they weren't too rough on you
(
) We weren't
Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine
Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house
Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible
We're not actually going inside the "Spirit of Adventure" itself
Oh
Would you like to
Would
Carl  like a little boy
Wait up, Mr
Muntz
Carl and Russell follow up the ramp
Jiminy Cricket
Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta
Not you
64
What do we do with Dug
He has lost the bird
Put him in the Cone of Shame
Dug
- Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible
Dug sits forlornly with a   around his neck
do not like the Cone of Shame
- Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room
It's a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures, and rare cultural artifacts
Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and Russell through the room
Most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums: New York, Munich, London
`Course  kept the best for myself
Did you ever
Will you look at that
Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium
Beast charged while  was brushing my teeth
Used my shaving kit to bring him down
dog approaches carrying a menu
Muntz waves it off
Oh, surprise me
(to Carl) Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as "dental equipment
" Muntz
Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one of the bones
65
Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise
Oh, you recognize it
'm impressed
That's an interesting story there
dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth
Muntz glances at the bottle
Hm, excellent choice
(to Carl) found it on safari with Roosevelt
Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle
They sloppily pour two glasses
He and  fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings
And did he cheat
Oh, he was horrible
Muntz and Carl
Alpha interrupts
(high-pitched voice) Master, dinner is ready
Oh dear, broken translator
It's that loose wire again
(leans down, fixes it) There you go big fella
(deep scary voice) Thank you Master
Russell reacts
liked his other voice
Muntz
Well, dinner is served
Right this way
66
, Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a large table
So how are things stateside
Almost tempted to go back a few times, but  have unfinished work here
Please
Dogs pull back chairs for them
They sit
Dog waiters place napkins on their laps
hope you're hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef 've ever had
Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove the silver plate covers at the same time
The meals look delicious
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again
Yes
Russell is served a hot dog
His waiter can't resist and eats a bite
Hey
Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his glass
Hey
Carl looks around, still enthralled
Oh my Ellie would have loved all this
You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls
He gestures toward  , tethered outside the porthole window
67
'm honored
And now you've made it
You're sure we're not a bother
'd hate to impose
No no
It's a pleasure to have guests -- a real treat
The dogs erupt into excited barking
Treat
Treat
want a treat
No no, quiet
Calm down
Calm down
In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog
Hey
(') Shouldn't've used that word
Having guests is a delight
More often  get thieves, come to steal what's rightfully mine
No
Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room
They called me a fraud, those
dah
But once  bring back this creature, my name will be cleared
The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples, feathers
Hundreds of them
all of
Kevin
This is Muntz's obsession
He looks over to a full size skeleton
Beautiful, isn't it
've spent a lifetime tracking it
Sometimes years go by between sightings
() 68
(cont'd) 've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives
Can't go in after it
Once in, there's no way out
Lost so many dogs
Muntz is lost in reverie
And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take
But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place
Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton
Hey, that looks like Kevin
"Kevin
" Yeah
That's my new giant bird pet
trained it to follow us
Muntz and Alpha exchange glances
Follow you
Impossible
How
She likes chocolate
Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz
Chocolate
Yeah,  gave her some of my chocolate
She goes ga-ga for it
Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it
But it ran off
It's gone now
Muntz stares
He walks to a table full of flight helmets
69
You know, Carl
These people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories
"Surveyor" making a map
Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table
It rolls across the floor
"Botanist" cataloguing plants
Muntz topples another helmet
He lifts a third to show Carl
An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls
He drops the helmet
It rolls to Carl's feet
That's the best one yet
can't wait to hear how it ends
Carl glances around nervously
Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits Well
It's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going
Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table
Oh, you're not leaving
We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality
Come on Russell
Carl leads Russell toward the door
But we haven't even had dessert yet
Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly
70
No, the boy's right
You haven't had dessert
Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee
Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like something out of a bad dream
Oh, you really must stay insist
We have so much more to talk about
distant
Everyone stops
Kevin
Muntz walks to the window and looks out
Atop the roof he sees
It's here
He turns back to Carl
but they're gone
(to dogs) Get them
Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon
Hurry
am hurrying
Dogs descend down the ramp behind them
They're coming
Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening
Dogs block the cave opening
Carl stops short
(
) Master, over here
71
Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave
Carl and Russell run toward him
The cave leads to a steep incline
The dogs are getting closer
There's no choice but to
The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts
Go toward the light, master
Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell
The bird sees the dogs
She jumps off the house and lifts Carl and Russell on her back
She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her
Russell and Carl   for dear life
Balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling
The house lowers
Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path
Carl tugs at the house but it  against the rock, pulling Russell onto the ground
Russell
Dragging on the ground, Russell gets  around badly
,  - The dogs close in on Russell
Alpha bites at his heels
Carl fends off Alpha with his cane
Get back
Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down
The dogs stop short
Carl looks back as the bird keeps running
Dug is up on the canyon wall
He caused the avalanche
Go on Master
will stop the dogs
Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs
72
Stop you dogs
The dogs run around Dug
Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path
The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind
She rounds a corner
Russell   over the abyss
The bird jumps from rock spire to spire
Russell swings back and forth wildly in the air
Help
Help
Russell does the
Gimme your hand
Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can  it and Carl him back onto the bird
Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line --
river winds 100 feet below
Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward
Hang on to Kevin
Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar
Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries them across the chasm
Alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below
Carl   but safely across the river chasm
The dogs are stuck on the other side
Carl painfully gets up
He looks up at his house
It's still intact
He breathes a
(
) Kevin
The bird tries to stand but  pitifully and falls back to the ground
Russell rushes to her side
73
The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite
She can't stand
Russell applies a bandage
From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the   call
Kevin  back to them
She tries to stand, but can't
Russell runs to her side
No no no
Kevin
Stay down
(to Carl) She's hurt real bad
Can't we help her get home
Carl looks at the bird's wounds
He looks to the rock maze, then to his house
He knows the right thing to do
And he hates himself for it
Alright
But we've got to hurry
, Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz
You lost them
Uh, it was Dug
Yeah, he's with them
He helped them escape
Muntz snarls in anger
Wait
Wait a minute
Dug
He leans over a
: -  - '   powers on, and a signal zeroes in on Dug's location
74
Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing
Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree
See anything
No, my pack is not following us
Boy they are dumb
Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house from behind a tree canopy
This is crazy
finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us
What a joke
Hey,  know a joke
squirrel walks up to a tree and says forgot to store acorns for winter and now  am dead
Ha
It is funny because the squirrel gets dead
They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees
Careful Russell
The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured  on the porch
You okay, Kevin
Kevin goes back to sleep
Russell looks at her
You know what, Mr
Fredricksen
The wilderness isn't quite what expected
Yeah
How so
It's kinda
wild
mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book
Hmm, get used to that, kid
75
My dad made it sound so easy
He's really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff
He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings
Russell smiles at the thought
And afterwards we'd go get ice cream at Fentons
always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle
Then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and 'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins
like that curb
He looks up at Carl
That might sound boring, but think the boring stuff is the stuff remember the most
They walk in silence
Carl understands
The bird babies   in the distance
Kevin
Look, there it is
Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by
He tries to run but is pulled back by his tether
, Carl unclips Russell's tether
Hold on Russell, stand still
Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house
Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward the labyrinth entrance
Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies
She runs off ahead
Carl and Russell
Look at that bird go
Wait up, you overgrown chicken
76
That's it, go Kevin
Go find your babies
Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce spotlight hits them
'  lowers overhead
Run Kevin
Run
net shoots out and binds her
She falls and
Oh no
The net catches on a rock
Carl and Russell run to her aid
Russell, give me your knife
Carl saws frantically at the net
(
) Get away from my bird
Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible
Beside them, a group of dogs drag forward '
Muntz hurls a lit lantern
Flames burst up beneath the house
Heat waves ripple up
Balloons
Carl's house into the fire
' ,   - Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor
,   - No
Carl panics
He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife
Muntz motions to the dogs
They swarm past Russell, knocking him down and grabbing the bird in the net
No
Carl pulls his house away from the flames
77
The bird   plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible
Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible
Careful
We want her in good shape for my return
Let her go
Stop
Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes
The dirigible flies off
Kevin
Carl beats out the flames with his jacket
He extinguishes the flames
Carl collapses on the side of his house
You gave away Kevin
You just gave her away
This is none of my concern didn't ask for any of this
Master
It's alright
am not your master
And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened
Bad dog
Bad dog
Dug slinks off, tail between his legs
Carl angrily puts on the harness
Now, whether you assist me or not, am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me
He walks off
Russell falls in behind
An angry dawn breaks
78
,   - Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape
Russell's harness drags along side, empty
Russell walks behind
- With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place
The house groans as it comes to rest
Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff
- He looks over
He's finally made it: Paradise Falls
Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge
Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing
Next to him stands the real house, just like Ellie wanted
(
) Here
Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground
don't want this anymore
Russell walks away
He sits on a rock, alone
Carl picks up the sash
He walks up the steps of his house
' ,  - The door opens
Carl steps in
He's back in his house for the first time in days
' ,   - Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess from the rough journey
Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the table into position
He pushes their two chairs back into their place
79
Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits
Quiet
Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside
Carl surveys the room
The   rests on a table near him
He opens it and puts Ellie's drawing back
He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie
He turns to the page marked:  '
Carl sighs
He managed to bring the house to the falls, but Ellie never made it
He closes the book
But as he does, Carl sees something he hadn't before
The blank pages at the end are no longer blank
of the two of them
On a picnic
Celebrating birthdays
Another and another
photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs
Carl's face warms
Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw adventure in everyday life
photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in their chairs
Beneath it, Ellie has written: "    --
,
" Carl smiles
He looks over to Ellie's empty chair
On the arm is Russell's sash
Carl picks it up
He looks to Ellie's chair
He crosses his heart
'  - Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch
Russell
80
But Russell is nowhere to be seen
shadow crosses Carl
He looks up to see Russell floating off, hanging from a
Russell
'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't
Russell fires up a   and steers himself off into the sky
No, Russell
No
Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it
He struggles, but the house doesn't budge
The balloons have lost too much helium
Furious, he  a chair off his porch
It lands atop the mountain rocks with a thud
This gives him an idea
: The  smashes onto the rocky ground
Chairs, dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house
Slowly, one corner of the house lifts
Then another
Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch
It teeters
and falls
The house lifts off
Wahhoo
The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of things
Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side atop Paradise Falls
' , The house soars into the air, sails billowing
' , Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies
81
Carl's eyes go wide
Russell
' ,  - The door swings open
Dug

Can  stay
Can you stay
Well, you're my dog aren't you
And 'm your master
You are my master
Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses
Oh boy
Oh boy
' ,  - The house flies off into the sky
(
) Good boy, Dug
You're a good boy
- Russell steers through the clouds toward the
- Dogs play poker
Behind them, Russell flies past with the leaf blower
They turn to look
Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window
He smashes into the wall
82
Ooph
He tries again and  through the window
- Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower, ready for action
Yes
Don't worry Kevin
'll save - Growling dogs move toward him
Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs
, Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized
She's miserable and scared
And they wouldn't believe me
Just wait till they get a look at you
Alpha enters
Master
The small mailman has returned
What
Dogs tie Russell to a chair
Let me go
Muntz enters
Where's your elderly friend
Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face
He's not my friend anymore
83
Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out
Well, if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind
, Muntz drags Russell through the trophy room
Where are you keeping Kevin
,   - Muntz sets Russell down and walks to a control panel
Let me go
Scream all you want, small mailman
None of your mailman friends can hear you
'll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training
Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the porthole
Flying toward him is '
Alpha
Fredricksen's coming back
Guard that bird
If you see the old man, you know what to do
Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room
Hey, where are you going
'm not finished with you
Nice talking with you
Muntz slams the door
Light emerges from the floor
Russell is on the ramp, which is opening
Russell
84
, Muntz enters the cockpit and takes the wheel
Where are you, Fredricksen
The dirigible turns, revealing Carl's house sneaking up behind
' , Carl steers toward the cockpit
He dons Russell's sash, then hooks his cane onto his back
He's fighting for a cause
He hears
It's Russell
Tied to his chair, he slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the edge
Russell
Carl steers his house to the dirigible
,  - Carl flings the hose,  it to the ramp railing
Using his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him just as Russell slides off the ramp edge
They land safely together
Mr
Fredricksen
Dug
Bring `er over

You came back for Kevin
Let's go get her

Carl leaps back into the dirigible
Dug follows
Russell  against his bonds
, Carl and Dug sneak down a hall
They see dogs ahead and hide
How do we get past these dogs
Uh
Dug points to a grate in the wall
, Dug leads Carl "backstage" through a vent shaft into the dirigible
They sneak past two biplanes
, They emerge through a grate near the ceiling
They look down into the room where the bird is kept in a cage
Kevin
The bird recognizes Carl and
Don't worry Kevin, we're on our way
Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs
Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above
86
Allow no one to be entering through these doors
Guard well that bird, my minions
() What do we do now, Dug
Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end of Carl's cane
,   - Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage
He bangs his cane
All the dogs turn
He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air
Who wants the ball
Me

The dogs scramble after it
,      - The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit

Behind them Carl shuts the door
The dogs realize their mistake
Uh-oh
87
, Carl opens the cage door
'm sorry Kevin
Let's get you out of here

Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on the porch and fall off
Russell  as he falls
The hose unspools
Russell reaches the end of the hose
Russell grabs onto it and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down
The house drifts away from the dirigible
, The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues
He's in Hall
He's in Hall
It's the old man
88
Does anyone know where they are
On cue, Russell  into the dashboard window of the control room and  across, dangling from the hose
Muntz stares, slack-jawed
Whoooaaah
The house floats off
(into radio) Grey leader
Take down the house
' Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind
What's that noise
From beneath the dirigible emerges
- From beneath the dirigible, three spitfire airplanes emerge
As they get closer, it is clear they are being flown by
(into radio) Grey leader, checking in
Grey 2, checking in
Grey 3, checking in

Any last words, Fredricksen
Come on, spit it out

He falls backwards
90

Don't jerk around so much, kid
Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug
Oh  am ready to not be up high
Carl  heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face
