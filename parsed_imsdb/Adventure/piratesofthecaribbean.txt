: - gray, impenetrable wall of fog
From somewhere comes the of a  ' , singing, slow tempo, almost under her breath
(
) Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life for me
Suddenly a massive  emerges from the grey, the Winged Victory maidenhead looming
It's a British dreadnought, the
Dauntless
Formidable, frightening, twenty-five gun ports on a side, and rail guns to boot
-  - , strawberry blond hair, stands at the bow railing, gazing at the seas, still singing -- drink up me hearties, yo, ho
, who was born old, skin a dark leather, clutches her shoulder, startling her
(sotto) Quiet, missy
Cursed pirates sail these waters
You want to call 'em down on us
Elizabeth stares wide-eyed at him
Mr
Gibbs
, a dashing young man, Royal Navy to the core, glares sternly at Gibbs
Standing besides him is , a man of obvious high station, brass buttons on his thick blue jacket
He is Elizabeth's father
(') That will do
She was singing about pirates
Bad luck to sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog-- mark my words
Consider them marked
On your way
'Aye, Captain
(as he moves off) Bad luck to have a woman on board, too
Even a mini'ture one
He returns to his deck-swabbing duties, surreptitiously takes a quick swig from flask
think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate
Think again, Miss Swan
Vile and dissolute creatures, the  lot of them
intend to see to   it that any man who sails under a  pirate flag, or wears a pirates  brand, gets what he deserves: a  short drop and a sudden stop
Elizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a sudden stop' means
Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung
Captain Norrington
appreciate your fervor, but  am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter
My apologies, Governor
Actually,  find it all fascinating
And that's what concerns me
Elizabeth, dear
we will be landing in Port Royal very soon, and beginning our new lives
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station
Yes, father
Chastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail
(') (to herself) still think it would be exciting to meet a pirate
The fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea is visible -- -- but suddenly, a  comes into view
young boy, , floating on his back in the otherwise empty water
There is nothing to show where he came from, or how he came to be there
(') Look
boy
In the water
Norrington and Swann spot him -- Man overboard
Boy overboard
Fetch a hook
Haul him out of there
Quick movement and activity on the deck
Sailors use a boathook to snag the boy he the passes
Norrington and Swann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck
Elizabeth sidles in for a closer look
(') He's still breathing
Where did he come from
Mary mother of God
Attention is turned away from the boy -- The sea is no longer empty
from a ship litters the water
along with the bodies of its crew
What is left of the ship's hull , a ragged British flag hanging limply from the stern
The
Dauntless slips silently through it all
The scene calls for hushed voices
What happened here
An explosion in the powder magazine
Merchant vessels run heavily armed
Lot of good it did them
(off Swan's look) Everyone's thinking it
'm just saying it
Pirates
There is no proof of that
It could have been an accident
Captain, these men were protection
If there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them
Of course not, Governor
(to the crew) Come about and strike the sails
Unlash the boats
Gunnery crew
jackets off the cannons
(to Swann) Hope for the best
prepare for the worst
(to two sailors) Move the boy aft
We'll need the deck clear
They lift the boy
Swann pulls Elizabeth away from the rail, away from the hideous scene in the water
Elizabeth,  want you to accompany the boy
He's in your charge now
You'll watch over him
Elizabeth nods gravely
Swann hurries away to help unstow the longboat
The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop deck, behind the wheel, then hurry off
Elizabeth kneels down besides the boy
His good looks are not lost on her
She reaches out, gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes -- Suddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now
Elizabeth is startled, but their eyes lock
She takes his hand in hers
My name is Elizabeth Swann
Will Turner
'm watching over you, Will
He clutches her hands, then slips back into unconsciousness
His movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabeth sees he wears a chain around his neck
She tugs it free, revealing-- One side is blank
She turns it over -- gazes up at her
Vaguely Aztec in design, but to her eyes, it means one thing only: (') You're a pirate
She glances back at the crew
Sees Norrington, giving orders, moving toward her
She looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision
Takes the medallion from around his neck
Hides it under her coat
Norrington arrives
Did he speak
His name is Will Turner -- that's all  found out
Very good
Norrington hurries off
Elizabeth steals away to the stern of the ship
Examines her prize -- the gold medallion wisp of wind, and she looks up -- Out over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as a ghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner -- It has
Elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out
The ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes -- but not the mizzen-top
and there hangs the frightening skull and crossbones of the Jolly Roger
Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull on the flag is the same as the one on the medallion
Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except for the black flag
As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears to and  at her -- Elizabeth shuts her eyes tight -- '  - ' -- and then snap open again, startled wide with fear
But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing on the stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark
She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory
) Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as possible without moving
Might there be someone in the room with her, looming over her
She turns, ready for anything
She is alone
Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp besides the canopied bed
She carries the lamp across the room to a dressing table, sits down
She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches into a space beneath it and removes -- The
She has kept it all this time
It has not lost its luster -- or its sense of menace
She gazes at it as she absently returns the draw to its place -- knock on the door;    Elizabeth jumps up, startled knocking over her chair
(
) Elizabeth
Is everything all right
Are you decent
Yes -- yes
She puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown as Swann enters, carrying a large box
uniformed maid, , follows
Still abed at this hour
It's a beautiful day
Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing: Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of  , built on a natural harbor
On a bluff at the mouth of the harbor stands  , its stone parapets lined with cannon
(') have a gift for you
He opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet dress
She lets out an admiring gasp
It's -- beautiful
May  inquire as to the occasion
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts
Elizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened- off dressing area
Estrella follows, carrying the box
(') Although
did think you could wear it to the ceremony today
(
) Ceremony
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony
Elizabeth peeks around the screen
knew it
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington
a fine gentleman, don't you think
(no answer) He fancies you, you know
Behind the screen, Elizabeth
(') Elizabeth
How's it coming
-- She holds her hair and      the medallion (still around her neck) out of the way as the      maid cinches her into a corset over her slip
Estrella       has her foot in Elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces      tight
Difficult
to say
(
) 'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London
(holding her breath) Women in London must have learned to not breath
Estrella is finished
Elizabeth takes a breath -- and winces
butler appears in the doorway of the room
Governor
caller is here for you
'  -  - The caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer, looking very out of place, and knowing it
He holds a long presentation case
He polishes the toes of his boots on the back of his calves, but it doesn't help
Ah, Mr
Turner
It's good to see you again
The caller turns -- it is
Handsome, with a watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years
Good day, sir
(holds out the case) have your order
Swann hurries to him, opens the case
Inside is a beautiful dress sword and scabbard
Swann takes it out reverently
(') (') The blade is folded steel
That's gold filigree laid into the handle
If  may - He takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one finger at the point where the blade meets the guard
(') Perfectly balanced
The tang is nearly the full width of the blade
Impressive
very impressive
Commodore Norrington will be pleased, 'm sure
Do pass my compliments on to your master
Will's face falls
Clearly, the work is his, and he is proud of it
With practiced ease, he flips the sword around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case
(bows slightly) shall
craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated -- He stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann - Elizabeth stands on the stairs
Granted, the dress may be painful to wear, but holy smokes
Elizabeth
You look stunning
Will tries to speak, but can't
He gives up, smiles to himself, and simply nods emphatically
Will
It's so good to see you
Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion is hidden in the bodice of her dress)
(') dreamt about you last night
Will reacts with surprise: "Really
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate - (ignores her father) About the day we met
Do you remember
could never forget it, Miss Swann
Will, how many times must  ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'
At least once more, Miss Swann
As always
Elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his response
Well said
There's a boy who understands propriety
Now, we must be going
Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door for Elizabeth
Elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and strides past Will
Good day, Mr
Turner
'  - Swann follows Elizabeth out the door
Good day
He watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the driver
(') (to himself) Elizabeth
: Swann glowers at his daughter
Dear,  do hope you demonstrate a bit more decorum in front of Commodore Norrington
After all, it is only through his efforts that Port Royal has become at all civilized
-  - The skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad in buccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky promontory
There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing a sign: -
The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of them
On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in the rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling rogue' was coined: Captain
He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass
Raises a tankard in salute
Suddenly, something below catches his attention
He jumps from the rigging - -- and that's when we see that his is ship is not an imposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a single sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon
And it leaks
Which is why he has the tankard: to bail
Jack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to control the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the promontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him
The huge British dreadnought,
Dauntless dominates the bay
But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and a mortar in the middle of the main deck
It is tied up at the Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below Fort Charles
-  - Smoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down the sail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock
The , a long ledger tucked under his arm, is there to catch a line and help Jack tie up
If you're out rolling scuppers in this tub, you're either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid
It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide
He starts up the dock, strapping on his sword belt; besides the scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small powder horn
The Harbormaster cuts him off
It's a shilling for the dock space, and you're going to have to give me your name
What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name
He tosses three shillings onto the ledger
The Harbormaster considers, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr
Smith
Jack gives him a half-salute as he goes past
Looks across the water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles
Above the Interceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremony is underway - - With choreographed precision, Swann removes the sword and scabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed Navy man
He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it out vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform
Norrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, and Swann lets go
Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face
Swann steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps back
Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow officers, turns again and nods to the audience - dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families
Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard
The silence is broken by loud
Backslapping from the Navy men
In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out beneath the hot sun
She applauds briefly, then winces
Discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material of the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her discomfort
-   - Two sailors on sentry duty,  and , take advantage of what little shade there is on the dock
But when Jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert
This dock is off-limits to civilians
Sorry,  didn't know
Music drifts down from Fort Charles
Jack looks up, shields his eyes
(') Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh
You two weren't invited
No
someone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians
This must be some important boat
Ship
Ship
Captain Norrington's made it his flagship
He'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake
Commodore
Right
Commodore Norrington
That's a fine goal, 'm sure
But it seems to me a ship like that -- (indicates the Dauntless) -- makes this one here just a wee superfluous
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed
That so
've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable
the Black Pearl
Mullroy scoffs at the name
MULLR0Y There's no real ship as can match the Interceptor
The Black Pearl is a real ship
No, it's not
Yes it is
've seen it
MULLR0Y You've seen it
Yes
You've seen the Black Pearl
Yes
MULLR0Y You haven't seen it
Yes,  have
MULLR0Y You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out
No
No
But 've seen a ship with black sails
MULLR0Y Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl
Is that what you're saying
no
MULLR0Y (turns back to Jack) Like  said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey
But Jack's not there
Murtogg and Mullroy look around, spot Jack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor, casually examining the mechanism
(') You
Jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise
The sailors hurry toward the gangplank
(') Get away from there
You don't have permission to be aboard there
Jack spreads his hands in apology
'm sorry
It's just such a pretty boat
Ship
The sailors study him suspiciously
What's your name
Smith
MULLR0Y What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr
Smith'
And no lies
None
Very well
You've rumbled me
confess:  intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating
said, no lies
MULLR0Y think he's telling the truth
He's not telling the truth
He may be
If he were telling the truth he wouldn't have told us
Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you
Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point -- - Elizabeth, pale and perspiring, fans herself weakly, oblivious to the music and chatter
May  have a moment
He extends his arm
She takes it
He walks her away from the party, toward the parapet
rather too long of a silence as Norrington works up his courage
(') (a burst) You look lovely
Elizabeth
Elizabeth frowns, unable to focus
Norrington mistakes her expression as disapproval
(') apologize if  seem forward -- but  must speak my mind
(') (working up his confidence to do so) This promotion confirms that  have accomplished the goals  set for myself in my career
But it also casts into sharp relief that which  have not achieved
The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman
(beat) You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth
can't breathe
(smiles) 'm a bit nervous, myself -- Elizabeth loses her balance, stumbles away from Norrington
She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself, but it slides off - -- and then she vanishes over the wall
Gone
(') Elizabeth
-   - Jack reacts, pushes Murtogg aside to see - Elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff
It seems to take her a long time to reach the sea -- Elizabeth hits the water, narrowly missing the sharp rocks
wave breaks, and then she is washed out away from the cliff, struggling feebly
, Norrington looks down -- He leaps to the top of the parapet, prepared to dive -- a lieutenant,  catches his arm
The rocks, sir
It's a miracle she missed them
Norrington shakes off his arm, looks down -- and realizes Gillette is right
He jumps down and runs -- -   - Jack, Murtogg and Mullroy are still in shock from the sight
Aren't you going to save her
MULLR0Y can't swim
Murtogg shakes his head -- neither does he
(rolls his eyes) Sailors
Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water
Norrington and several other men pick their way down the cliffs
They are too far away to get to her in time
Jack scowls
He has no choice -- and it pisses him off
(') Fine
He pulls a pistol from his sword belt, hands it to Murtogg; then hands the belt to Mullroy
(') Don't lose these
And then he dives into the water, swims toward Elizabeth
Elizabeth struggles to keep above water, gasping for air '- then a swell rolls over her, and she is submerged - , Elizabeth drifts down, unconscious
The current turns her, and the  slips loose from her bodice
The  turns slowly, until the  is fully visible
shaft of filtered sunlight hits it, and it - -  - : The British flag flies, blown from an offshore breeze
Suddenly the wind dies, and the flag goes limp
: Wood and metal fittings on lines bang against masts
The wind dies, and there is silence
:    feeds clucking chickens, frowns when they all suddenly go quiet
:  weather vane moves slightly in the wind
The wind stops, and all is still
And then
the weather vane , and holds steady -- the wind has picked up again, but now blows
from the sea toward the land
l)  : an   pulls a rope line, pauses
Turns and gazes to the sky, frowning
The mangy hound at his side starts  incessantly - : The lines bang against the other sides of the masts, the wind far stronger now
: the British flag flies in the opposite direction, snapping in the new onshore breeze
-  - Norrington rushes down, intent on the climb
Beyond him, past the rocky point, far out to sea,  gathers - -  - : the medallion hangs below Elizabeth's unmoving form - - and then Jack is there
He wraps an arm around her and makes for the surface
, Jack swims toward the dock, struggling
It is
: far more difficult than it should be
He stops stroking, and they submerge
: Jack realizes that   it is Elizabeth's heavy velvet dress that is weighing   them down
He pulls at the buttons on the back, and they   give way
He skins her out of the dress, and kicks away from   it
The dress falls like a cloud into darkness - : Jack swims with Elizabeth, much more quickly
, Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haul Elizabeth out of the water
Jack climbs up, exhausted
Elizabeth is on her back; Murtogg holds her arms above her head, pumping them
Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth
Not breathing
Murtogg looks down; it seems hopeless
Jack steps up, drawing Murtogg's knife from its sheath
Move
He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the knife -- Murtogg is shocked - Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away
Elizabeth remains still
And then -- she coughs up water and gasps, choking on her first full breath
Jack is relieved
never would have thought of that
Clearly, you've never been to Singapore
Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg - and that's when he spots - The
Jack catches it up in his "hand
(') Where did you get this
Before Elizabeth can answer, the  of a  is at Jack's  -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, in fact, looking bright and sharp
On your feet
It looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth, most of her clothes gone
He gets to his feet
The rest of Elizabeth's erstwhile rescuers reach the scene, including Swann
Elizabeth
Are you all right
He strips off his jacket, drapes it around her
Yes -- yes, 'm fine -- Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer
Norrington looks at Jack
Jack nods as best he can with a blade beneath his chin
Norrington sheathes his sword, and extends his hand
believe thanks are in order
Jack takes Norrington's hand gingerly
They shake - -- and Norrington tightens his grip, yanks Jack's arm toward him, then tears back the sleeve of Jack's shirt - -- exposing a  on Jack's inner wrist: a large '
' (') Had a brush-up with the East India Trading Company, did you
pirate
The others react in shock, but the sailors are well-trained --in an instant, half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack
He stands there, still holding the corset
(') Keep your guns on him, men
Gillette, fetch some irons
Norrington notices something else -- below the '' brand is a tattoo: a small bird in flight across water
(') Well, well
Jack Sparrow, isn't it
Captain Jack Sparrow
If you please
Norrington looks out at the bay
don't see your ship -- Captain
He said he'd come to commandeer one
(to Murtogg) told you he was telling the truth
(currying favor) These are his, sir
He holds out Jack's pistol and belt
Norrington takes the pistol, examines it, notes the powder horn on Jack's belt
(to Jack) Extra powder, but no additional shot
Jack shrugs
Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt, opens it
He frowns at the reading
Moves the compass this way and that, keeping it parallel to the ground
(') It doesn't bear true
Jack looks away, a bit embarrassed
Norrington returns the compass to the belt
Draws the sword half from the scabbard
(') half-expected it to be made of wood
He slides it back into the scabbard, hands it to Mullroy
(') Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north
and no ship
You are without a doubt the worst pirate  have ever heard of
Ah, but you have heard of me
Gillette returns with shackles, approaches Jack
Carefully, lieutenant
Elizabeth steps forward
Swann's jacket slips off her
She is unconcerned, but he is intent on putting it back on her
Commodore,  must protest
Pirate or not, this man saved my life
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness
Gillette snaps the manacles closed on Jack's wrists
But it seems to be enough to condemn him
(smiles) Indeed
Now that Jack is safely chained, Norrington nods to his men
All but one stow their weapons, and two step forward - Finally
Lightning-quick, he snaps the   corset  around the hand and wrist of the man holding the   pistol  and yanks
The pistol sails into the water
Before   anyone  can react to that, Jack has the manacle chain wrapped   around  Elizabeth's throat
Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a shield
Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men
(') (backing away, toward land) Commodore Norrington
my pistol and belt, please
Norrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration
(') Commodore
Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington
Norrington holds them out to Jack
(') Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth
Elizabeth is more angry than frightened
Miss Swann
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind
She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack's quicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her
He jerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly
(') Now, if you'll be very kind
She figures out what he wants: put the belt on him
(as she works) You are despicable
saved your life; now you've saved mine
We're square
Done
He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumps against the cargo gantry
(') Gentleman
m' lady
you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow
He shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free a belaying pin -- a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted up to the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope - Pistols fire -- and miss
Jack swings out, out, out, away and around from the gantry
Norrington has held his shot
With careful aim, he tracks Jack's trajectory- Jack drops from the rope even as Norrington
His shot tears the rope - -- as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, he snaps the length of manacle chain over the line and grabs hold of the far loop -- slides down the line - -- drops to the deck of a ship
He runs, leaping to another ship, then out of sight - On his heels
Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort
(to Elizabeth) Elizabeth, are you - Yes, 'm all right, 'm fine
Go capture him
Norrington's taken aback by her ire, and wisely hurries away
Swann drapes his coat around Elizabeth
Here, dear
you should wear this
Elizabeth shivers, finding suddenly that she is cold
Glances out at the bay - -- where a   moves across the top of the water
She takes the jacket
Thank you, Father
and let that be the last of your fashion advice, please
But she accepts his comforting embrace
-  -  - The fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall
An armed search party moves along the street
They glance down an alley- On the far side is another search party
The men nod to each other, continue on
moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath the eaves of a building
He still wears the manacles
Across the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru door set in the middle
Above is a sign with a black anvil
'  - Jack slips in through the door, takes a look around: No windows
The forge is dark, lit   by lanterns
Work-in- progress is scattered about: wagon   wheels, wrought iron gates, pipes -- even a cannon with   a crack in it
But every tool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat
Jack is startled by a noise:  , in a blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a bottle
Jack gives him a hard poke
Another
Brown snorts, turns away
Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled sledge from its place on the wall
Moves to the glowing coke furnace in the middle of the room
Slowly
he holds his right hand over the furnace, the chain down in the embers
The chain begins to
Jack sweats, grimaces at the pain - Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on the glowing links
One
Jack drops the sledge, plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water
Steam billows
Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it
Blisters form beneath the manacle -- but his hands are free
The  of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover
Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him
Spots the drunken Mister Brown in the corner
Right where  left you
Something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall
The sledge lying beside the anvil
(') (under his breath) Not where  left you
He moves casually toward the sledge
Then grabs for it -- but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand
Will jumps back
Jack stands there, sword leveled at Will
He backs Will up, toward the door
Will glares at him
(' ) (voice low and tight) You're the one they're hunting
The pirate
Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head
then frowns, regards Will
You look familiar
Have  ever threatened you before
've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates
Ah
Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record
So if you'll excuse me
Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in the honing guide
Before Jack can react, Will has it in hand
(') Do you think this is wise, boy
Crossing blades with a pirate
You threatened Miss Swann
Only a little
In response, Will assumes an en garde position
Jack appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing
Jack attacks
The two men stand in one place, trading feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost impossible to follow
Will has no trouble matching Jack
(') You know what you're doing, 'll give you that
Excellent form But how's your footwork
If step here - He takes a step around an imaginary circle
Will steps the other way, maintaining his relationship to Jack
(') Very good
And if  step again, you step again
(continuing to step around the circle) And so we circle, circle, like dogs we circle
They are now exactly opposite their initial positions
(') Ta
Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him
Will registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious overhand motion, he throws his sword - -- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the latch, barely missing Jack
Jack registers it, then pulls on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the way
Jack rattles the latch
Tugs on the sword a few times -- it is really stuck in there
Jack mouths a curse, but when he turns back to Will, he's smiling
(' ) That's a good trick
Except, once again, you are between me and the way out
(points his sword at the back door) And now you have no weapon
Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an anvil
Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward
Will and Jack duel
Their blades flash and ring
Suddenly, Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at Will's head
Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed
Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming him
Will quickly picks up another sword
Jack becomes aware that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords, knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion
(') Who makes all these
do
And  practice with them
At least three hours a day
You need to find yourself a girl
(Will sets his jaw) Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her
direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with anger
No
practice three hours a day so that when  meet a pirate can kill him
He explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the air, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing
Jack parries with sword and chain
Jack's chain wraps around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling - So Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the ceiling
Not good
He parries using one hand, twisting and dodging around the furnace - Jack compresses the bellows, blowing a into Will's face
Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up, kicks with his feet, knocking Will back
Jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the ceiling
Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second, hitting Will on the wrist
Will drops his sword, falls down, gets up - Jack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes
Will steps back, directly in front of the back exit
Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly
(') You cheated
(smiles; what do you expect
) Pirate
Jack steps forward
Will steps back, fully blocking the door
(') Move away
No
Move
No
can not just step aside and let you escape
Jack cocks the pistol
Will stares back
The stand-off lasts for a long moment
You're lucky, boy -- this shot's not meant for you
Jack uncocks the pistol
Will is surprised, reassesses Jack Suddenly, Mister Brown  his bottle against Jack's skull
Jack crumples to the ground
The front and back doors smash open, and  fill the room
Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground
Excellent work, Mister Brown
You've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive
Just doing my civic duty
Jack groans
Norrington stands over him, smiles
believe you will always remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped
Norrington's men haul Jack away
Will watches them go
Brown looks at his bottle -- broken
That ratter broke my bottle
- The thick fog blankets the entire bay now, and the town
The only structure visible is Fort Charles, high on the bluff, like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey
Above the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars waxing moon shines, giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow
-  , just below the stone parapets of the fort, visible briefly deep in the fog, like a shark fin slicing through the water: the  of a ship,   billowing
Flying from the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull
The Black Pearl has come to Port Royal
'  - '  - maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace, slides it between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed
Nice and toasty
Thank you, Estrellia
The maid nods, exits
Elizabeth opens a book, begins reading, toying absently with the medallion chain around her neck
The lamp flame begins to diminish
Elizabeth tries to turn it up
No good
The flame goes out, and the room is black
'  - Will, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops
His attention is drawn to the window
He opens the shutter and peers out -- nothing but fog
Almost without noticing, he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall
Takes it down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands
- :  mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his mouth
Three seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their cell door
One holds a loop of rope; another waggles a bone
The dog just sits and cocks its head
Come here, boy
Want a nice, juicy bone
In an adjoining cell, Jack lies on a pile of straw
You can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move
Excuse us if we ain't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet
-  - noose hangs from a gallows in the courtyard
Norrington and Swann walk along the far wall
Has my daughter given you an answer yet
No
She hasn't
Well, she had a taxing day
Ghastly weather tonight
Bleak
Very bleak
From the distance, there is a  - What was that
-- and then the  of an incoming ball -- Cannon fire
He tackles Swann as the wall of the parapet  -- - Jack sits up
There are more  - know those guns
He peers out through the bars of the window
The other prisoners crowd around their window as well
(') It's the Black Pearl
(frightened) The Black Pearl
've heard stories
she's been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years
and never leaves any survivors
There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl
-  - The Black Pearl still cannot be seen -- but the fog lights up around her with each boom of her guns
She's firing on both sides now, hammering both the fort and the town
-  - Streets, buildings, docks and ships shatter and explode beneath the onslaught
Villagers panic, run for cover, dodge flying debris as best they can
If this is not hell on earth, then it's about to be -- -- long boats emerge out of the fog, carrying They swarm from the boats, striking down ,villagers indiscriminately and setting fires
'  - Will slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of his back
He puts a dirk in his belt, then a second and a third
He picks up a second axe and a sword
Will slides back the doors of the forge -- woman runs past, chased by a -  wearing a yellow bandeau
Will backhands the axe square into his chest, a deadly blow
Will heads out, up the street -- -  - The moon is obscured by smoke rising from the burning gallows and wooden roofs
Cannon fire continues to rain down, but the fort's own cannons now return fire
Governor
Barricade yourself in my office
(Swann hesitates) That's an order
Swann turns to go -- but finds himself face-to-face with a pirate -- , a handsome blond man with gold earrings
Beyond Koehler, more pirates come up over the far wall
Koehler grins and raises a cutlass - -- Norrington's sword blocks Koehler's slash
(') They've flanked us
Men
Swords and pistols
The battle is joined -- '  -  f   - Elizabeth looks out a window at the scene below: even through the fog, multiple fires are visible, and ships burn in the harbor
Shouts and cries of pain
Cannon fire She notices movement directly below her window: two , approaching the house -- pirates
Elizabeth bolts from her room-- - She reaches the railing overlooking the foyer, and cries out, just as the butler opens the door -- too late; there is the  of a gun, and the butler crumples
Elizabeth ducks down in horror, peering through the balusters
The pirates scan the foyer, searching
The leader is , a sallow-looking pirate with a bald head
Suddenly Pintel looks up, and locks eyes with Elizabeth
How could he know she was there
Up there
The pirates rush for the stairs
Elizabeth scrambles back into the nearest room-- - Elizabeth shuts the door, locks it, listens as the pirates pound up the stairs -- Miss Elizabeth
Elizabeth jumps
Estrella is right behind her, terrified
They whisper: (') Are they come to kidnap you, miss
The daughter of the governor would be very valuable
Elizabeth realizes she's right
There is the  of a body against the door
Listen, Estrella -- they haven't seen you
Hide, and first chance, run for the fort
Estrella nods
Another  at the door -- it gives a bit - Elizabeth shoves Estrella into the corner, between a tall wardrobe and the wall
Dashes for the side door
When the door smashes inward, it slams into the wardrobe, and the maid cannot be seen
The pirates run in -- spot the open side door, and run for it -- '  - Pintel is the first through, and gets the pan of the bed warmer in the face for his trouble -- he staggers back, holding his nose -- - Estrella breaks cover, runs for the hall, unnoticed
'  - -- Elizabeth swings the bed warmer at the second pirate, but he catches it by the handle -- Elizabeth can't jerk it free, so she wrenches it over -- the pan lid swings down, the second pirate -- hot coals spill on his head, sizzling
Elizabeth dashes for the hallway stairs - / -  - The pirates burst from the bedroom -- Pintel goes for the stairs, but the second pirate vaults the handrail -- Estrella registers the butler's body, but continues out the still-open front door at a dead run
Elizabeth follows -- The second pirate lands between Elizabeth and the front door
His face is , his hair  -- he reaches - Elizabeth pulls up short, runs the other way -- Pintel, on the stairs, grabs her by the hair -- Elizabeth doesn't slow -- she spins, grabs Pintel's arm with both hands and pulls him hard, belly-first, into the cap of the newel post -- he lets go of her hair -- Elizabeth keeps going - Elizabeth slams the double doors shut, throws the bolts
The interior shutters are closed over the windows
Above the fireplace are two crossed swords
Elizabeth climbs on the firebox; she grabs one of the swords by the hilt and pulls -- but it won't come free
Both swords are securely attached to the wall
Damn
from the doors -- the pirates are relentless - On the table is a platter with fruit, cheese and bread
Elizabeth grabs the knife from the platter - Like any bread knife, it has a round point
Elizabeth jabs it into her palm -- it's useless as a weapon
Double damn
The blade of a boarding axe breaches the door -- the pirates will be through soon -- Elizabeth looks around - - The doors give way; the pirates charge through - -  - Empty
Elizabeth nowhere to be seen
Pintel and Smoldering Pirate search, under the table, behind draperies
We know you're here, poppet
Come out and we promise we won't hurt you
Smoldering pirate gives him look -- he wants to hurt her plenty
Pintel shakes his head: 'Don't worry, 'm lying
' (') We will find you, poppet
You've got something of ours, and it calls to us
- Elizabeth hides in the dumbwaiter box, wrapped around the double pulley ropes that go through the center
(
) The gold calls to us
Elizabeth registers that -- she pulls out the medallion, rubs the gold with her thumb
This is their objective
Light spills into the- box through gaps in the top as the door above is slid open -- Elizabeth looks up through the gaps - Pintel leers down at her
(') Hello, poppet
Elizabeth works the ropes to lower  the box
Pintel pulls the other way; he's stronger, and  the box rises
Elizabeth tries to stop it -- wraps her left  forearm through the rope and lets it jam against the top of  the box
Elizabeth gasps at the pain, but the box stops
She saws at the rope with the bread knife
Smoldering pirate helps pull the rope, crushing Elizabeth's forearm
Tears of pain on her face, she keeps sawing - The rope parts, and the dumbwaiter box  - - From behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a , and a cloud of dust
The door slides open, and Elizabeth clambers out
Her head is cut, she is streaked with dirt, and can barely stand
She leans over the table, trying to recover
The sound of running  gets louder
Please, no
Elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion
and a desperate idea occurs to her
The pirates burst through the door
Elizabeth backs away, holds the bread knife out to ward them off
They come around either side of the table, stalking her - (') (gasps it out) Par
Parlay
Pintel can't believe his ears
What
Parlay
invoke the right of parlay
According to" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain
know the code
If an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete
It would appear, so do you
To blazes with the code
He steps forward, dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him
She wants to be taken to the Captain, and she'll go without a fuss
He looks to Elizabeth: 'right
' Elizabeth nods
(') We must honor the code
Smoldering Pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk
He grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm - -  - Will races along, momentarily free of the pirates
He spots the Governor's Mansion in the distance
There are moving away from it -- Elizabeth, forced by the two pirates
Will hurries forward - Suddenly a  jumps out from the shadows, slashes; Will defends himself
The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow bandana
Will hesitates -- didn't he already kill this guy
The hesitation is just enough for another , swinging a flaming torch, to  Will in the head from behind
Will crumples
The pirate lights a second torch, hands it to One-arm; they hoot with delight and head off, setting fires as they go
On the ground, Will doesn't move
-   - The wall of the cells  inward
Jack pulls himself out from under rubble
Moonlight spills in through the gaping hole created by the cannon ball
Beyond it: freedom
But it is centered on the other cell
The part of Jack's cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through
Praise be
He and the other two scramble through
(') (back to Jack) My sympathies, friend - - you've no manner of luck at all
The three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view
Jack is alone
Cannon fire continues, occasional hits shaking the fort
The dog cowers under a long bench, key ring still in his mouth
Jack sighs -- resigned, he picks up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog forward
It's all right, doggie
come here, boy
Come here, Spot
Rover
Fido
To his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench
Jack continues to coax him closer
The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block
He ,
He backs away from the door, whining
(') What's the matter, boy
The dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him
The door to the cell block bursts open
pair of pirates step in:  and
This isn't the armory
He turns to go, but Koehler has spotted Jack
(Dutch accent) Well, well
Look what we have here, Twigg
It's
Captain Sparrow
Huh
Last time  saw you, you were all alone on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance
'd heard you'd gotten off, but  didn't believe it
Did you sprout little wings and flyaway
His fortunes aren't improved much
The two laugh
Jack doesn't
He steps forward, close to the bars
This puts him in a spill of moonlight
He is tight with fury
Worry about your own fortunes
The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers
and mutineers
Koehler and Twigg don't like hearing that
Koehler lashes out, grabs Jack by the throat through the bars
Jack clutches the pirate's wrist, looks down - Where they enter the moonlight, Koehler's wrists and hands are skeletal
Jack's eyes go wide -- he is holding a skeleton arm
(' ) You are cursed
Koehler sneers, shoves Jack backwards, hard
Now out of the moonlight, his hand is normal
Jack stares, realizing - (') The stories are true
Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door
Looks back
You know nothing of hell
And then they're gone
- Amid the thunder of cannon fire, a longboat slips through the fog
Elizabeth sits in the prow
Columns of water from cannon balls geyser up around the boat
The fog parts
Elizabeth looks up to see -- The Black Pearl, a tall galleon, its black sails looming high above her
At the bow is an ornately carved figurehead of a beautiful woman, arm held high, a small bird taking wing from her outstretched hand
The longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling from a winch
-   - Lit by lanterns; no moon is visible beneath the fog
Smoke hangs heavy above the deck
Elizabeth's longboat is raised above the deck rail -- pirates spot her, and stare
One polite fellow steps forward to offer his hand
She takes it and steps down
She huddles, self-conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe
didn't know we was taking captives
She's invoked the right of parlay
with Captain Barbossa
-- an imposing  in silhouette stands by the wheel, too far away to have heard Pintel's words
But his head turns at the mention of his name
The silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs
cloud of obscures him -- and then, as if he skipped the stairs, he strides out of the  on the main deck- This is
Despite the bright colors of clothing, definitely not a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley -- or anywhere, for that matter
Elizabeth, more terrified than ever, cannot look away from his eyes
But she musters her courage - am here to -- The Bosun  her
You'll speak when spoken to
His wrist is grabbed -- painfully -- by Barbossa
And you'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay
Aye, sir
Barbossa releases him
Turns to Elizabeth, smiles -- it shows both silver and gold teeth
My apologies, miss
As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted
Captain Barbossa
have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal
Barbossa is both impressed and amused
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates
What is it you want
want you to leave
And never come back
Barbossa and the pirates laugh
am disinclined to acquiesce to your request
(helpfully) Means' No
' Very well
She quickly slips the medallion off, darts to the side rail, dangles it over the side of the ship
The pirates go quiet
(') 'll drop it
My holds are bursting with swag
That bit of shine matters to me Why
Because it's what you're searching for
You've been searching for it for years
recognize this ship
saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England
(interested) Did you, now
Elizabeth glares at him
She's getting nowhere
Fine
suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it
She flips the medallion up, off her finger - She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly
(') You have a name, missy
Elizabeth - (stops herself from saying "Swann"; then:) Turner
(embroidering) 'm a maid in the governor's household
(curtsies) Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected
The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods
You've got sand, for a maid
(curtsies again) Thank you, sir
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that
family heirloom, perhaps
Of course
(offended) didn't steal it, if that's what you mean
No, no, nothing like that
(comes to a decision) Very well
You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return
Can  trust you
It's you who invoked the parlay
Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now
or these be the last friendly words you'll hear
Elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice
She holds out the medallion
He grabs it, clutches it in his fist like hope
Our bargain
Barbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to the Bosun
Still the guns, and stow 'em
Signal the men, set the flags, and make good to clear port
For the first time since the attack began, the  of the guns ceases
Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved
The pirates hustle to follow orders
Barbossa turns away
Wait
You must return me to shore
According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren - Barbossa wheels on her
First
Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so  'must' do nothing
Secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply
And you're not
And thirdly
the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules
(grins gold and silver) Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner
Elizabeth stares in speechless terror - -  - - As the Black Pearl turns out to sea, Elizabeth is led back along the deck to the captain's cabin
The fog starts to dissipate, turning to a light mist; through it, the Black Pearl makes for the scarlet glow of dawn
-  - - Will comes to, still where he fell, gets to his feet
He takes in the devastation of Port Royal: the harbor is dotted with burning and sunken ships; buildings are razed and still smolder
The aftermath of hell on earth
Will turns, and runs for the Governor's Mansion
'  - Will races past the smashed doors, into the foyer
Calls out: Miss Swann
Elizabeth
terrible silence answers him
He spots an overturned chair, fallen bookshelf - - '  - Will bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe
They've taken her
They've taken Elizabeth
group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette among others, gathered around a map
The map is so large it drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a chair
We're aware of the situation
We have to hunt them down -- and save her
Swann's worry has made him short-tempered
Where do you propose we start
If you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it
If anyone does, tell me
(Will is silent) Leave, Mr
Turner
Murtogg has remembered something
He ventures it warily: That Jack Sparrow
he talked about the Black Pearl
Mentioned it, is more what he did
Still -- We can ask him where it is -- maybe he can lead us to it
That pirate tried to kill my daughter
We could never trust a word he said
We could strike a bargain - No
The pirates who invaded   this fort left Sparrow locked in   his cell
Ergo, he is not their   ally, and therefore of no value
(through with Will) We will determine their most likely course, and launch a   search mission that sails with the   tide
Will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map
That's not good enough
This is Elizabeth's life
Norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across Will's back, and guides him roughly to the door
Mr
Turner, this is not the time for rash actions
(low) Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth
(firm) Now, go home
He opens the door, and then turns away
Will watches him walk back to the desk
Will's face sets in resolve, and he leaves
-   - Jack strains, trying to budge one of the bars
Even with the damage from the cannon ball, it won't move
He hears the sound of the door latch - The door opens, and Will slips in
Looks around
Jack lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and unconcerned
Will marches straight up to the bars
Are you familiar with that ship
The Black Pearl
Somewhat
Where does it make berth
Surely you've heard the stories
The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta
an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is
The ship's real enough
So its anchorage must be a real place
Where is it
Why ask me
Because you're a pirate
And you want to turn pirate yourself
Never
(beat) They took Miss Swann
(he was right) So it is that you found a girl
Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone
see no profit in it for me
Will slams his fist against the bars in frustration
Jack is surprised at the outburst
Will thinks
makes a decision
can get you out of here
How
The key's run off
(examines the cell) helped build these cells
Those are hook-and-ring hinges
The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free
Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum
Jack watches Will as he speaks, and it dawns on him -- Will is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past
Your name is Turner
Will gives him a puzzled look
Yes
Will Turner
Jack grins
Will Turner
(he stands) 'll tell you what, Mr
Turner
've changed my mind
You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, 'll you to the Black Pearl
(sticks out his hand) Do we have an accord
Will gives him a suspicious look
The deal seems too good
Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling
Will shakes it
Agreed
Agreed
Will looks around, figures out   what he needs
He makes a chair his fulcrum, and levers   the long bench under the door
Pushes down -- it's hard   work -- but the cell door rises, and then falls forward,    down on the bench and chair
Jack is impressed
He steps out of the cell
Someone will have heard that
Hurry
Will heads for the door
Jack searches the desk, cupboards
Not without my effects
We need to go
Jack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass
Straps on the belt, checks the shot in his pistol
(') Why are you bothering with that
My business, Will
As for your business -one question, or there's no use going
(joins Will at the door) This girl -- what does she mean to you
How far are you willing to go to save her
(no hesitation) 'd die for her
Good
-  - The Jolly Mon, four inches of water in the bottom, squats low in the water, heeled to one side, creaking on its lines
(
) Ah, now there's a lovely sight
Jack hops down into the boat
Prepares to make way
(') knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report her
Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there's no predicting 'em
But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way
Jack notices that Will is standing, frozen on the dock, staring at the boat in dismay
(') Come aboard
haven't set foot off dry land  was twelve, when the ship  was on exploded
(regards the boat) It's been a sound policy
No worries there
She's far more likely to rot out from under us
Will steels himself, steps into the boat as if its going to capsize with the slightest movement
Jack hoists the sail
(') Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably
He nods toward the
Dauntless, looming in the harbor
Will whiteknuckles the gunwales
We're going to steal a ship
That ship
Commandeer
We're going to commandeer a ship
Nautical term
It's still against the law
So's breaking a man out of jail
Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start
(smiling) My advice -- smile and enjoy it
- The Jolly Mon bobs its way across the bay, dwarfed against the
Dauntless
Will holds a stay line with iron fists
This is either crazy, or brilliant
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide
The Jolly Man nears the rudder of the much larger ship - -   - There's been a breakdown in discipline; about a dozen Navy sailors are gathered together on the main deck, playing dice
Murtogg and Mullroy among them
Suddenly, Jack and Will jump out, into the open - brandishing pistols
Everybody stay calm
We're taking over the ship
(a beat) Aye
Avast
Jack gives him a look, shakes his head: don't do that
The sailors all look   at them -- and then burst out They grin,   shake their heads
Jack stands there, grinning with them --   but his gun is still level
The Lieutenant, ,   steps forward
You're serious about this
Jack moves his pistol across, points it at Gillette
Dead serious
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men
You'll never make it out of the bay
We'll see about that
More guffaws from the crew
couple sailors move forward, hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand
Sir, 'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise
Fine by me
We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound
(a curt nod) Agreed
You have the momentary advantage, sir
But  will see you smile from the yard arm sir
As likely as not
(calling) Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship
-  - Sailors make their way down a rope ladder, crowd onto the Jolly Mon
Will pushes hard against the windlass, to no avail
the anchor is too heavy for one man
Jack notices
little help
Gillette shrugs, gestures to Murtogg and Mullroy
The three men throw their weight into the windlass, and it turns
Jack's pistol is on them the whole time
can't believe he's doing this
The windless turns, bringing Mullroy into view
You didn't believe he was telling the truth, either
The windless turns some more, and there's Gillette
(over his shoulder, to Will) Do you have any idea, boy, what you're doing
Another quarter turn - No
-  - Jack and Will crank a capstan, raising the forward jib sail
It luffs and billows out
The huge ship inches forward slowly, pulled by just the one sail
Jack grins
Lookee there, mate
We're underway
-  - Norrington moves along, concentrating on a manifest
Alongside him is governor Swann, who glances over - Sees the tiny Jolly Mon headed toward them, riding low in the water, overloaded with sailors
Beyond that, the Dauntless sails -- albeit slowly -- for open waters
Commodore -- moment
But -- Please
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship
Norrington glances out at the bay
Sure enough, the Dauntless is on the move
Norrington takes a brass telescope from his belt, opens it, trains it on -- The main deck
He picks out Will - Rash, Turner, too rash
-- then spots Jack, at the wheel
Lowers the telescope
(') That is, without doubt, the worst pirate  have ever seen
- Out in the open sea, Jack leans on the wheel, relaxed; not much sailing to do with a following wind
Will looks back - They're coming
He points: the sails of the Interceptor fill out, and the ship cuts through the water toward them- - Norrington's smaller ship quickly comes alongside the slowmoving Dauntless
Its decks appear empty
Grappling hooks are thrown, and sailors draw the two ships together
Norrington's men swarm across
Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges
, away from the   Dauntless, and past the railing of the Interceptor, where a   single  stands watch -- and we find a soaked Jack and   Will as they climb up over the side of the smaller ship,   unseen
Jack tackles the Sentry from behind, covers hi1rmouth
Can you swim
(the man struggles) Can
You
Swim
Jack removes his hand
Of course, sir
Like a fish grew up summers living in Dover, with my uncle - Good
Jack lifts the man up, throws him overboard
Quickly unties the ropes to the grappling hooks
Will cranks the capstan bars, raising the foresail - - Norrington emerges from a gangway -- and sees his other ship moving away
Sailors
Back to the Interceptor
But the distance is already too great
One brave sailor tries to swing across on a rope, Errol-Flynn style, but falls short with a splash
Jack waves, and shouts across the distance - Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way
We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves
Norrington seethes, but his order to Gillette is measured: Raise the sails
The wind is quarter from astern by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines
Gillette looks surprised at the order -- but relays it
Hands
Come about
Jackets off the cannons
(to Norrington) We are to fire on our own ship
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate
The  turns the wheel
The Dauntless' course does not change one whit
Captain, there's a problem
The Steersman spins the wheel
It goes round and round, with no signs of slowing
(') He's disabled the rudder chain, sir
So it would seem
The Interceptor dwindles with distance
Gillette watches it go, with some degree of admiration
He's got to be the best pirate 've ever seen
Norrington reaches out, stops the spinning ship's wheel
So it would seem
The Interceptor makes for the horizon line and with the time passage, the ship is gone; the sky turns a deep twilight blue - - -- with the fat white moon riding just above the horizon
Suddenly, the edge of a black sail cuts into the foreground, accompanied by the  of the wind and the of canvas - - '  - Elizabeth stalks the cabin
Pintel enters, carrying a black silk dress
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this
Tell the captain that  am disinclined to acquiesce to his request
(happy) He said you say that
He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked
Angry, Elizabeth holds out her hand
Pintel's grin fades
(') (hands it over) Fine
He exits, pouting
Elizabeth examines the dress - - '  - Barbossa enters, followed by  carrying trays of food, wine, table setting, etc
Elizabeth stands at the small table in the dress -- lovely
Maid or not, it fits you
Dare  ask the fate of its previous owner
Now, none of that
Please dig in
The table is set
Elizabeth sits, cuts a tiny piece of meat, eats it daintily
(') No need to stand on ceremony, and no call to impress anyone
You must be hungry
Elizabeth drops the pretense: she's starving, and begins to eat like it
Barbossa watches her intently
(') Try the wine
Elizabeth does, a huge swig; she tears off a hunk of bread, devours it
(') And the apples -- one of those next
She starts to bite into the apple -- stops
She is suddenly aware of Barbossa's gaze -- and that he is not eating
It's poisoned
She shoves her plate away -- and takes the opportunity to palm her knife
Barbossa
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner
Then why aren't you eating
Would that  could
He produces the medallion, lets it dangle from his fingers
(') Do you not know what this is, then
It's a pirate medallion
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta
Elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug, intrigued despite herself
( ') Ah, so you don't know as much as you pretend
Back when Cortes was cutting a great bloody swath through the New World, a high priest gave
him all the gold they had, with one condition: that he spare the people's lives
Of course, Cortes being Cortes, he didn't
(nods) He'd've made a great pirate, that one
Barbossa stands, moves to a shelf
Puts a key to a medium- sized polished wooden box -- the Captain's chest
Opens it
(') So the priest, with his dying breath, called on the power of the blood of his people, and put on the gold a curse
If anyone took so much as a single piece, as he was compelled by greed, by greed he would be consumed
Inside the chest are charts, some gold, a sextant -- and a few pages of a Mayan , pieces of tree bark inscribed with Mayan glyphs
Barbossa removes them carefully, sets them on the table
Pours over them
(') Within a day of leaving port for Spain, the treasure ship carrying the gold
something went wrong
The ship run aground, every man aboard dead, save one
He survived long enough to hide the gold ashore
(beat) Over time, the dark magic of the curse seeped into the place, making it a cursed island
An island of death
Isla de Muerta
He looks up
Elizabeth has been rapt, involved in the story -but feigns a dismissive attitude
That's all very interesting, but hardly believe in ghost stories any more
Barbossa is angry
He stands, sweeps the food off the table
You idiot girl
It's no make- believe
My crew and , we found the gold, and we did more than take one piece, we took it all
Rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it away in exchange for drink and food and pleasant company
But we found out: the drink could not sate us, and the food turned to ashes in our mouths, and no amount of pleasant company could ease our torment
(regains his composure) We are cursed men, Miss Turner, condemned, to be forever consumed by our own greed
Gold calls to , always, and we are driven, always, to find more, and add it to the treasure
Barbossa picks up the priceless Codex
Crushes them in his fist
(') There is but one way to remove the curse
All of the scattered pieces of the treasure must be restored in full, and the blood repaid
(he throws the pages aside) We've recovered every piece -- save for this
(holds up the medallion) And as for the blood
that's what we have you for
(pleasant, finally getting to his point) And that's why there's no sense in killing you
Yet
Elizabeth stares at him, horrified
Using the toe of his boot, Barbossa flips an apple up off the floor, catches it, extends it to Elizabeth
(') Apple
Elizabeth slowly reaches for the apple -- and then comes up out of her chair, trying to run around Barbossa_ They struggle briefly, and then suddenly he shoves her away- Elizabeth's stolen  is buried in Barbossa's chest, to the hilt -- Barbossa is completely unaffected
He opens his shirt to get a better look at the knife, pulls it out with little effort
There is  on the blade, but none anywhere else
(') 'm curious -- after killing me, what is it you were planning to do next
Elizabeth backs away, whirls and barrels out the door - -   - -- Elizabeth comes to dead stop
She stares, her jaw working, trying to scream but unable to - The pirate crew works at their stations, coiling lines, navigating the ship, swabbing decks -- but where the moonlight falls across their bodies, they are nauqht but Elizabeth turns away from the sight - Barbossa stands just inside the doorway, out of the moonlight
He grabs her roughly by the shoulders and jerks her back around -- Elizabeth shuts her eyes - Look
(shakes her) The moonlight shows us for what we really are
We are not among the living and so we cannot die - He spins her back around to face him -- he leans forward, putting his face in the moonlight, turning it into a gleaming  with gold and silver teeth - (') -- but neither are we dead
We have all the desires of the living, but cannot satisfy them
Ten years  have been parched of thirst, and unable to quench it
Ten years,  have been starving to death -- and haven't died
(raises his hand) (') And  have not felt anything for ten years
Not the wind on my face, nor the spray of the sea
(reaches toward Elizabeth) nor the flesh of a woman
Elizabeth flinches away from the skeletal hand
It drops away -- he takes a bottle of wine from the opened case beside the cabin door, uncorks it with his teeth, raises it (') You'd best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner
Because now you're in one
He tilts the bottle and drinks -- it runs over his jaw, through his rib cage, drenching his clothes
Elizabeth darts around him, back into the cabin, and shuts the door
Barbossa hurls the bottle away
- '  - Elizabeth huddles in the far corner of the cabin, terrified
- The Interceptor cuts across the waves
Jack at the wheel; Will tightens a line, moves back astern
-   - Will sharpens his sword with a whetstone: shhhk -- shhhk For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study
worked passage   from England as a cabin boy
(an attempt  at guile) After my mother  passed,  came out here
looking  for my father
Is that so
My father
William Turner
Jack says nothing
Will has lost the patience for guile
(  ' ) 'm not a simpleton
At the jail - - it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help
(a smile) Since that's what  wanted, didn't press the matter
But now - {an accusation} You knew my father
Jack considers his reply -- settles on 'truth
' knew him
Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner
Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill
'Bootstrap
' Good man
Good pirate
And clever -"-  never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him
When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin
(angry) That's not true
swear, you look just like him
It's not true that my father was a pirate
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it
He was a merchant marine
He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules-- (laughs) You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another
There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life
And they're all 'merchant marines
' My father did not think of my mother -his family -- as a burden
Sure -- because he could always go pirating
My father -- was not -- a pirate
Will's sword is out, levelled at Jack
Jack gives him a disbelieving look, sighs
Put it away, Will
It's not worth getting beat again
You didn't beat me
You ignored the rules of engagement
In a fair fight, 'd kill you
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it
He kicks a lever on a wench
The sail boom whips around and slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship
His sword clatters onto the deck
Will dangles above the water
Jack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the course
Picks up the sword -- and pokes at Will with it
Will hand-over-hands away from the blade, to the end of the boom
(  ' ) As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention
Must, Should, do, don't, shall, shall not -- those are just suggestions
There are only two absolute rules
(ticks them off on his fingers) (') What a man can do
And what a man can  t do
Will looks away, not interested
(') For instance: you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man
or you can't
Now me,  can sail this ship to Tortuga, by myself
(Will looks alarmed) But  can't just let you drown
Jack swings the boom back in
Will drops to the deck
Jack holds the hilt of the sword out
Will takes it
Glares at Jack, considers what he'll do next
Jack watches him coolly
Will turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down, and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk Jack breathes silent sigh of relief
Notices his hand is shaking -- he takes the wheel
Tortuga
Oh -- did  forget to mention that
- dank and dirty port, where the tides seem to have swept together the scum of the Caribbean -- pirates, privateers, prostitutes, thieves, and drunkards
With its cantered, rotting docks, weatherbeaten buildings, and odd assortment of livestock running free -- a donkey, chickens, etc
-- it is far less civilized than Port Royal
Jack and Will move through the crowd
woman turns her head -- she has noticed Jack
We need a crew
We can manage the ship between islands, but the open sea, that's another matter - Suddenly the Redhead  Jack, hard
Satisfied, she turns and strides off
Will ignores her
Just do it quickly
(rubbing his jaw) Don't worry
've already got my Quartermaster -- there
Jack leads Will toward a pub: the Faithful Bride, the emblem over the door a politically incorrect painting of a smiling woman holding a bouquet in her chained-and-manacled hands
Jack pulls open the door; Will goes inside passing a pretty women coming out -- she sees Jack and immediately him, cursing something in Chinese
Jack backs away - - Jack closes the door on the woman, joins Will
They take in the place -- it is populated with a slightly higher class of scum
Jack spots a , smiles, moves forward - --and is suddenly  by a waitress
This is , tall, strong, tough; she didn't spill a drink off her tray
You stole my boat
AnaMaria
Have you seen Gibbs need to put together - She  him again
Will shakes his head, heads for the bar
Jack gets up
(') Borrowed
Borrowed your boat
(off her look) Without permission
AnaMaria charges; Jack backs away, puts a table between them
She chases him around the table, still carrying the tray
My dory
The Jolly Mon
Where is it
Safe
At Port Royal
With the Royal Navy
That boat is my livelihood
You'll get it back
Or one better
(a threat) will
Away from them, a  calls for his food
AnaMaria scowls at Jack, moves away -- comes back for
one more Jack
Over here
, Will has spoken to the Bartender
Jack arrives, rubbing his chin
(') He knows Gibbs
The Bartender nods 'yes
' Then nods 'out back
' Then produces a water bucket from behind the bar
Jack and Will exchange a look,-and Jack takes the bucket
-  - drunken man lays in the mud, having a friendly conversation with two pigs
He wears an old tattered Navy jacket
sudden    splashes across his face, revealing: this is old   (the man who told pirate stories to Elizabeth when she was a child)
He sputters and roars: Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot (recognizes Jack) Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping
It's bad luck
Well, fortunately,  know how to counter it
The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition
Aye, that'll about do it
Jack helps Gibbs to his feet -- and then Gibbs is hit with a second wave of water
Will stands there with the bucket
(') Blast it, 'm already awake
know
That was for the smell
- Jack and Gibbs sit at a table in the shadows, a single candle illumining them, speaking in hushed voices
Will is away from them, at the door, hand on sword, keeping a look- out
tankard is set down
Gibbs lifts it to take a swig - Just the one
Gibbs pauses
He takes a dainty sip
Make it_ast, then
Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours
First -- have you found me a crew
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack
Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx
Now where,  wonder, would they have gotten that idea
Gibbs evades answering by taking a long sip
Jack leans forward
Gibbs leans forward
(') 'm going after the Black Pearl
Gibbs straightens up like he's been hit
He stares
He reaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets it back down
He leans forwards again
Jack has not moved
Say again
Ilm going after the Black Pearl know where its going to be, and 'm going to take it
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl
Aye, and that's why  know where it's going to be, and that's why  know what Barbossa is up to
All  need is a crew
(shakes his head) fool's errand
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants
Something he needs
And you've got that, have you
: Jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and shifts his eyes' -- behind him, Will, still on guard, glares a sailor away from the table
Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner
Gibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard
Peers at Will
Then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones
Well, lookee there
'll allow you may be onto something, Jack
(considers, nods) There's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you
'll find some men
Gibbs downs the drink,  the tankard on the table
Will reacts to the sound, draws both sword and dagger, kicks over a table for cover, and whirls on anyone who moves
(') Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he
That he is
-  -  - On the docks, a disheveled, motley and weatherbeaten group of about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line-up
Feast your eyes, Cap'n
All of 'em good sea-faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth his salt -- (sotto, making his point) -- and crazy, to boot
Jack holds up a hand -- enough
He moves down the line, Gibbs at his side
Then he notices AnaMaria in line, dressed like a man, He raises an eyebrow
You owe me a boat
Jack nods, continues
One sailor is quite fat, another thin and sickly
Jack is not happy with his choices
He stops in front of , a short sailor with a large, colorful  on his shoulder
Jack raises an eyebrow
Cotton here is mute, sir
Poor devil had his tongue cut out -- Cotton opens his mouth to show this -- Jack grimaces
(') -- so he went and trained the parrot to do the talking for him, nobody knows how
Nobody knows the parrot's name, neither, so we just call it 'Cotton's parrot
' Jack decides to test this
Mr
Cotton
Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost certain death
Cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder, raises it -- ' Wind in your
Wind in your
Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes
' Cotton nods vigorously, lowers the parrot, and it goes silent
Jack shakes his head
Steps back
That goes for the rest of you
Danger and near certain death
(turns away) For we are to sail for the Isla de Muerta, to rescue the daughter of Governor Swann
An equal share of the reward shall be - Jack hears movement, looks back -- several potential crew members back away in fright; first one, then another, turn and run, followed by more
Soon just a half dozen are left, including Cotton (with parrot) -- and AnaMaria
Shut up, before you lose them all
These are the only ones worth having
(glances at the sky) And we're going to need them- - of lightening and the  of thunder
The canvas of every sail is stretched taut
The ship rocks as it drops into the valley of huge swell, climbs up the other side
On board, the new crew members scurry about their tasks, pulling lines and trimming sails
Excellent sailors, it takes everything they have to keep the ship afloat
AnaMaria is at the helm
Gibbs staggers along the deck
That fool will have us lose the canvas, and the masts besides
On Jack, a  wind blowing back his hair, eyes intent on their course
Gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him
(') Werd best drop canvas, sirl She can hold a bit longer
The wind picks up, howling
Jack smiles
(shouts) What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood
(shouts) We're catching up
Jack turns back to the sea, enjoying himself
Gibbs stares at him like he's a crazy man
' - '  - The sound of  pounds down on the deck above - - then suddenly stops
Elizabeth moves to the stern windows, looks out at the rolling sea below -- no escape there
She hears the sound of a  calling, gazes up, wondering - '   - High on the main mast, Twigg cups his hands to his face, calls down: Isla de Muerta
Isla de Muerta, off the port bow
, Barbossa moves to the rail
The storm clouds are breaking up
On the horizon is a dark, ominous shape: Mostly sheer unfriendly cliffs that shoot straight into the water
It is surrounded by a slate grey sea
Barbossa grasps the rail with both hands, his expression a mixture of loathing and fear
Jacoby approaches, hesitant
Orders, Captain
Bring her in, not too close
won't brave the reef, not until high tide
We lay anchor before dark
Jacoby nods, backs away
Barbossa continues to stare - (') that is, if it first doesn't sink back down to hell from where it came
- The Interceptor, on open waters, glorious, her white sails set wing-to-wing
- : Jack's compass, cradled in both hands
Jack leans over and studies it -- almost like he's praying
-- the face shows old-fashioned rose petal style direction markers below a quivering indicator that settles on -- southeast
Bear three points starboard
AnaMaria turns the wheel, adjusting course
The ship leans into the new direction
Jack looks down - -- where the indicator spins, reverses, settles on -- northeast
(') Six points port
AnaMaria frowns, but follows the order, turns the wheel back, and the ship responds
Will works on deck, coiling a rope -- but he watches Jack and AnaMaria, clearly not happy
Gibbs hobbles up
Left handed-ropes are coiled against the sun, or it's bad luck
(twirls a finger) Anty-clockwise
Gibbs takes over the task
The ship shifts course again
Will has had enough
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work
(voice low) That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lie
Really
(moves closer) So
what's the story on the pistol
Gibbs settles in, happy to have a willing listener
'll tell lee
Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts
This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl - What
He never told me that
Ah -- he's learned, then
Plays things more close to the vest
See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England
Somehow  he came by the money to commission the Pearl
Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share
(lowers his voice) So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too
So Jack gave up the bearings
(shakes his head) That night, there was mutiny
Gibbs voice is a whisper, now, so Will has to lean closer
(') Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crewmen
He was marooned on an island, left there to die
How did he get off the island
(loud) didn't
Will and Gibbs jump
Jack is right there beside them
(') My body's still there, rotting away, and  am but a ghost
Will and Gibbs aren't sure what to make of that
Jack laughs
How did you get off the island
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold
He starts off
Wait -- what about the pistol
The pistol
When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot
No good for hunting, or surviving, really
But after three weeks of starvation and thirst -- the option of that pistol begins to look good
Jack lets this sink in
He pulls out the pistol, raises it
(') But  survived
And  still have that single shot
It's meant for one man
My mutinous first mate - Barbossa
Jack shoots a glance at Will -- nods, and moves away
-   - On Barbossa, face upturned
No expression in his eyes
Around him a group of pirates, Elizabeth among them, stand as still as stones, in front of a dark cave opening
Their faces look upward, their total lack of movement disconcerting
Above the cave, on a hillock, the pirate Koehler gazes out toward the horizon
Slowly he , head-to-toe, from pirate to - The  has climbed free of the storm clouds, rising large
and full on the horizon
The skeleton turns - Moonrise, Captain
First night of full
Hah
(to the pirates) Be mindful of pits and crevasses
Stay together
He takes a torch
Moves into the cave
The pirates follow
-         - The group keeps together under the firelight
The path leads between boulders on a slope downhill
From the echoes and shadows, it's clear the cave system must be huge
Elizabeth glances over -- the torches illumine caverns off to the side -- and just the edge of a mound of coins
Clearly there is more, but the rest is lost in darkness
Twigg, gazing upward in wonder, moves a few feet away from the group
Barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm
Careful, mate
Fall down there, you'd die and miss Judgement Day -- for not even the Lord himself'll come look for you here
Barbossa lets go, and moves on, descending down, twisting and turning, but always down - - Cotton pulls a sail line, looks out -- sees something
He lifts the parrot off his shoulder, strokes it along the back
' Land
Land
ho ho
Indeed, the faint outline of Isla de Muerta is in the distance on the port side
Will stands, excited, jumps onto the rigging for a better look
But AnaMaria, at the helm, stares at Cotton, and the parrot
How does he do that
They'll be anchored on the lee side
Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island - -  - Flickering torchlight
Pirates stoop low to enter a cavern -- and revealed is the spectacular treasure of Isla de Muerta: overflowing ,chests of coins, gold and silver ingots, jewelry, objects d' art, jade and ivory, brightly colored silks, furniture, jewels and pearls; mirrors and swords -anything and everything of value that might be carried by ship, is here
The pirates move through, Elizabeth can't help but gaze in wonder
The curse drove you to gather this
(
) Aye
And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded
But it will drive us no longer
Elizabeth pauses, staring at herself in a jewel-encrusted mirror -- and then is pushed along by the pirates
-  - The Interceptor lies at anchor in the distance
Closer, Jack and will row away from the larger vessel in a small longboat, toward the rocky shore
The  of a waterfall grows louder
Will looks: ahead of them is a black  , right at water level
What's that
Depends
On what
On whether the stories are    all true
If they are, that's    a waterfall that spills over    at high tide, with a short drop to    an underground lagoon
If not    - By now, the moving water tugs on the longboat, and they are sucked in -- (') -- well, too late
The boat rushes forward, plunges into the darkness - -   - -- the longboat takes a harrowing drop over a short waterfall
but then lands safely in a gorgeous underwater lagoon, floats lazily toward a sandy shore
Chalk one up for the stories
Will leaps out into the water, pulls the boat ashore - -   - The pirate group reaches the end of a small chamber of mostly jewels and pearl piled around a large bed - -   - -- and then emerge into the largest cavern of all, also crammed with treasure, including several mountains of gold coins that reach the ceiling
Treasure everywhere - Except for one spot in the center
hole in the ceiling lets in a column of moonlight, which illumines: stone chest, lid pushed back, decorated with carved Aztec glyphs, filled with gold coins identical to Will's medallion
sharp stone knife lies on top
In front of it, buried in the sand is a skeleton -- and this one doesn't look like it's going to move ever again, judging by the sword in its back
crab scurries away from it as the group approaches
Here we stand before the cursed treasure of Cortez himself
Won by blood, it demands blood in return
All eyes turn -- onto Elizabeth
Pintle takes the stone knife from the chest, approaches her
Elizabeth shrinks back, but is held by two other pirates
Pintel grins
Grabs her by the wrist
She turns her head away, shuts her eyes
Pintle raises the knife
and then very carefully, daintily, uses just the sharp tip of the knife to just prick
Elizabeth's finger
One tiny red drop of blood appears, and drips down onto the medallion
Elizabeth opens her eyes, surprised
What did you expect
We're all gentlemen here, right and proper
The pirates laugh
Barbossa takes the medallion, grins at Elizabeth
You know the first thing 'm going to do after the curse is lifted
(grins) Eat a whole bushel of apples
Barbossa approaches the chest, shining in the beam of moonlight
(') What was begun by blood, let blood now end
He tosses the gold medallion onto the others
The pirates tense, waiting, expectant
long beat
They all look at each other, look at themselves
Nothing happens
Did it work
don't feel no different
How do we tell
Barbossa frowns, draws his pistol, and  the pirate next to him -- Jacoby -- square in the chest
Jacoby reacts in shock, grabs his chest
but doesn't die
You're not dead
No
(realizes) He shot me
It didn't work
The curse is still upon us
Barbossa searches his mind for an answer
turns to Elizabeth
You
Maid
Your father
What was his name
(grabs her roughly) Was your father William Turner
Elizabeth takes time to smile before answering: No
The pirates cry out in alarm
Barbossa gathers himself, getting his rage under steely control
Where's his child
The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner
Where
Barbossa  her hard across the face, sending her sprawling
(to Pintel) You brought us the wrong person
She had the medallion
She's the right age
She said her name was Turner
(to Barbossa) You brought us here for nothing
Barbossa whirls on him -- If you had sailed with Morgan for ten years like  have, you'd know not to question me
Elizabeth sits up, watching the pirates argue, for a moment unnoticed
Suddenly, a scabbard comes down, right above her
Startled, Elizabeth looks up -- -- Will is at the top of a mound of coins, reaching down with his scabbard for her to grab onto
Elizabeth quickly leans forward, takes the bloodied medallion from the pile
Reaches back, grabs the scabbard
Will pulls her up - (') If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak
Any more talk, 'll chain ye to a cannon and send ye to the watery depths
sound catches his attention -- coins falling
He looks up, sees Will and Elizabeth at the top of the treasure stack
, Will grabs a large shield, flings them forward -- the two ride down the mountain of coins on the far side, slide through a small opening - -   - Behind them, loose coins from their slide come down in an avalanche, sealing the entrance
Elizabeth jumps up, silver platter in hand, ready to swing -Jack catches her before she can do any damage
They recognize each other
You
Me
You're in league with Barbossa
No, 'm -- rescuing you
Elizabeth can't comprehend that one
You
Will gains his footing in the rubble
Miss Swann
We're here to rescue you
(sounds of pursuit, approaching) It's going badly
This way
They race off, toward a bit of moonlight - - The three climb up a dark crevasse that leads out onto the island
Will takes Elizabeth's hand, helps her
'm glad we got here in time
Truthfully -- you were a bit late
The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away
As if on cue, they hear the yells of pirates, coming closer
They take off - -  - The three race through the rocks, the sounds of pursuit close behind
Suddenly Jack stops
Come on
No
This won't work
(a quick decision) 'll stay behind, and fight them
You go on
Will and Elizabeth stare at him
No
'll lead them away
The sounds are closer
(') Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship
'll keep 'em busy
Are you sure
Jack -- this is not something you have to do
'm sure
When you've led the kind of life  have, there are debts that must be paid
Maybe  can balance the scales a little
Will nods, hesitates
gives Jack his sword - - now Jack has two,
one for each hand
Elizabeth gives him a quick kiss
Will and Elizabeth race away, and are gone
Jack watches them for a moment, turns to face the pirates
He sticks the two swords in the ground, crossed
Leans casually against a rock
group of pirates round a corner, cutlasses drawn, ready to fight -- but Jack raises his hand
(') invoke the right of parlay, according to the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew
- Jack stands before Barbossa, surrounded by pirates
Jack has a wide smile on his face -- and Barbossa doesn't like it
'm inclined to kill you now, Jack Sparrow, without so much as a word, if you don't lose that grin from your face
Jack's smile remains
Barbossa puts a hand to his cutlass - The woman's blood didn't work, did it
Barbossa hesitates
(') know who's blood you need, to end the curse
Say the name, or  slit your throat
No you won't
Barbossa nods
Pintel steps forward, puts a blade to Jack's throat
Jack's smile widens
Now
() Now
(Pintel grins) No, don't kill him
Surprised, Pintel lowers his cutlass
Jack's expression hasn't changed
(') Allow me the humor of listening to your terms
Simple
have something you want more than anything
The way to free you from the curse of the treasure
You have something  want -- more than anything
The Pearl
(laughs) Oh, that's fine
And just how do you expect this to work
You give me the Pearl
Then  tell you who you need
Barbossa stares at him, incredulous
That's your offer
You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all  have is a name
That's right
'm supposed to
trust you
The pirates laugh
'm a man of my word
The pirates laugh louder
(' ) You see, 've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse
Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice
'll torture it out of you
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do
Jack is still smiling, intentionally smug now
Barbossa sees his options dwindling, begins to pace
Blast you
'll throw you in prison
Wait as long as you like
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word
Let's say  tell you the wrong person
What would you do
Track you down and - He sees where Jack is headed
And if  tell you the truth, you become mortal, and you won't come near me because you know 'd kill you
Barbossa hesitates
The pirates are amazed at how the tide has turned; Barbossa has gone past considering the idea, and might even do it
Jack,  don't trust you, and that's a fact
Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that
See, that's where we're different
trust you
to do what it takes to get what you want
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, 'll give you that
(decides, smiles) We might just have to sign articles, you and
Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain
Jack nods
(') Pintel
set sail
If this fool plan is to work, we'll need the medallion, and that means catching the ship which brought 'em here
Jack is caught completely off guard
For the first time, his smile fades
What -- you don't have the medallion
That fool woman took it
You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside
'll watch my back
Bosun
Set up Mr
Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine
in the brig
(to Jack, a smile) Meaning no disrespect, of course
Jack nods, and is taken away
Barbossa stares after him, not hiding his mistrust
- At full sail, headed out to sea
Gibbs glances at Elizabeth and Will, talking alone on the forecastle -- shakes his head
Two women on board
man don't have to be superstitious to know that's trouble
Elizabeth holds the medallion, and finishes her tale: you were in danger
so  took the medallion
And 've kept it ever since
They thought  was you, that they needed my blood
And it didn't work
She hands him the medallion
Why would my father send this to me
To keep it away from them
No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock
If  had known- (anticipating him) -- then we never would have met
Will nods
They hold each other's gaze a moment
Will turns away first, leans on the rail
Looks out to sea, back the direction they came
can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us
guess you can never truly know someone else's heart
Will glances at her, and nods
, Gibbs peers forward, scanning the horizon
There is a tiny island in front of them
Shift your heading, steer clear of that island
Fifteen degrees starboard
On the aft deck, Cotton concentrates on his work, securing a halyard
Suddenly Cotton's parrot flaps its wings, takes off, lands on the starboard bulwark, squawking - ' Dead men tell  tales
Dead men tell tales
Dead men tell  tales
Cotton looks up - on the horizon, following: black sails
Gibbs and AnaMaria appear, and see the ship
Can we outrun them
Not a chance
Make for the reef
- Miles of blue water
The Interceptor tacks, leaving a long white wake
The Black Pearl matches it -- gaining
- Barbossa and Pintel eye the Interceptor, two hounds chasing the fox
What's he doing
Is he going to run her aground
- The Black Pearl is now close behind the Interceptor -- and the Interceptor is headed for the island
Drop the forward anchor
at the stern of the ship pulls a release, and the ship's anchor races down into the water, the metal chain jumping and twisting on deck
The chain stops, and the Sailor locks it - - With its forward momentum and the anchor down, the Interceptor to turn quickly, pivoting around the anchor
- Barbossa and Pintel watch as the huge ship brings its cannons to bear right in front of them
All hands
Prepare to come about
But for now, the Interceptor has the advantage, and takes it: its cannons boom, and cannonballs rain down
-  - Jack sees what he can out the porthole
In the cell with him is Twigg, acting as a guard
Don't hit my ship
mean, kill the lying scoundrel - (to Twigg) 'm a little conflicted, here
Twigg just stares
- Elizabeth watches  as the Black Pearl comes about -- and then there is the  low, loud  of two dozen cannons firing as one
The  Interceptor is hit
barrage of shots follow; most find  their mark
Sailors dive for cover, leaving their cannons; clearly they are overmatched
-   - Barbossa laughs
Strike your colors, you bloody cockroaches
- Another round of fire; Barbossa shows no mercy
Looks like they mean to send us under
There -- she's raised the Jolly Roger, upside down
AnaMaria, Gibbs, Cotton, even Elizabeth -- all know what this means
Will doesn't
He looks to Gibbs for an explanation: ( ') It's a signal
If we resist, it won't just be death
There'll be torture as well
We're not going to just surrender
That we are
The Black Pearl fires again, a double-ball shot with a chain connecting the two
It hits the main mast dead ani a ,  sound as it breaks, falls to the deck
Barbossa moves his ship alongside, preparing to board
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few- Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight
Will stares -- and nods
But his expression is still defiant
The deck slants; the ship is sinking
pirates swarm across on ropes, and take control of the Interceptor
-   - The top masts of the
Interceptor sink into the smooth' crystal waters of the Caribbean - -- as Will and Elizabeth, held by pirates, are brought before Barbossa -- and see that Jack stands beside him, manacled
Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton and the other crewmembers huddle together
Barbossa's wrath falls on Elizabeth
Welcome back, Miss
Last time on board, you played me right clever, make pretending and all
hope your stay this time is more pleasant
Boys, show her some hospitality
He shoves her into a group of pirates; they yell their approval
She is pushed from one to another
This goads Will to action
He head-butts the pirate behind him, grabs a pistol, waves it at the pirates
She goes free
Will leaps onto the ship's rail
He steadies himself with a hand on the rigging
Points the pistol at Barbossa
What's in your head, boy
She
Goes
Free
You've got one shot -- and we can't die
You can't
can
He leans out over the ocean
No
Jack pushes forward
Will -- don't do anything stupid
Don't say anything stupid - My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner
His blood runs in my veins
(raises the gun to his head) You need my blood
And on my word will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker
Pintel squints at Will; the pirates murmur surprise
It's true - he's the spittin' image of old Bootstrap
Even talks the same
Jack drops his head
Barbossa grins at him
Looks like you're back to having nothing to offer
And hers got Old Bill's courage curse on him, and you
Barbossa steps forward
Enough of that
(to Will) Name your terms
Elizabeth goes free
We got that part
Anything else
And Jack
And the crew
Free and unharmed
f you agree
then
will remain with you
Barbossa considers; his crew waits
Finally - Agreed
You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune - Will -- you can't trust him
You must swear by the Holy Bible
Eh
You have my word, then -- on the Good Book,  do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul
Barbossa crosses himself, as do many of his men
Will lowers the gun
steps down -- the pirates surround him
They snatch away the pistol
(') Boatswain
Take your captives belowdecks
Chain them in the galley, and teach 'em how to row
Gibbs, AnaMaria, Cotton and the rest are led away under guard
Barbossa looks out to sea, toward the islet
(') Hah
Look there
That's the very same island we made Jack governor of on our last trip
(nods") When you sail the open sea as long as , you learn to trust the signs fate sends your way
(dejected) Amen to that
Jack, Elizabeth
'm a man of my word and you're to be set free, right quick
(loudly) Men, break out the plank
goes up from the pirates
Will realizes what Barbossa intends to do, struggles with his captors
No
You gave your word
Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue
Those as know me know  wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship
(nods) agreed to set them free
didn't say when
nor where
- The Black Pearl lies at anchor, closer now to the islet
-   - Jack, wrists still bound, stands in the classic 'walking the plank' pose
Elizabeth is next in line
Pirates crowd the ship's rail to watch
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime
No good can come of it
Now, Jack
That reef is less than a league distant
It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then
Barbossa smiles, shows a pistol
Points it at Jack
You'd best take a swim, Jack
The last time you did this, you left me a pistol, with one shot
The pirates mutter agreement
That's proper, sir, according to the code
By the Powers, you're right
( turns around) Where's Jack's pistol
Who's got it
Bring it forward
gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time
pirate hands Jack's pistol to Barbossa
Tell you what
'll   give you one pistol, and let you   be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death yourself
(grins) That is, presuming   you're not both drownded
The pirates laugh
Barbossa tosses Jack the pistol -- but over his head, and down into the water with a splash
() So how did you get off that island, anyway
You can go to your grave not knowing
That's fair
Jack glares at Barbossa
Then he's prodded with a cutlass, takes a step out
Reaches the end of the plank -- steps off
Jack plunges down into the water
Appears on the surface, floundering, struggles to stay afloat
Will and Elizabeth exchange helpless looks; there is nothing they can do
(') The lady's next
But first, 'll be wanting that dress back, if you please
Elizabeth hesitates
then strips it off, leaving her in a silk slip
She throws it at him
Here -- it will go well with your black heart
Barbossa indicates the plank
(' ) will not walk into the ocean
You'll have to throw me in
Barbossa raises an eyebrow, grins, nods
Have at her, lads
The pirates rush to comply
Lift her up, toss her over the rail -- with a scream she falls -- -  - We follow Elizabeth amid foam and bubbles as she down through the water
Blue and clear, with streaks of sunlight cutting down; bright coral and tropical fish, and a lovely young woman in a silk dress
if it weren't for the mortal danger, the scene could be described as gorgeous
Elizabeth spots Jack, below her now, sinking, struggling
She swims down
unties his bonds
Elizabeth starts for the surface
Inexplicably, Jack swims the other way, further down into the depths
- Elizabeth breaks the surface, looks around
And then, finally Jack appears, sucking in air
He shows what he went after: his pistol
He tucks it into his shirt
You went back for that
We need to head for the reef
She starts swimming
Jack hesitates
The Black Pearl is already underway; he stares at it
That's the second time 've had to watch that man sail away with my ship
He turns away, and swims after Elizabeth
-  - : The surf line
Elizabeth's feet leave prints in the sand
and then meet up with matching footprints she made earlier, going in the same direction
She has walked all the way around the island
(
) Not all that big, is it
Jack lays on the beach
He has dismantled his pistol; the parts, ball and powder dry on his scarf
Has it changed since the last time you were here
The trees are taller
Jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry; they are
He sets about re-assembling and loading his pistol
hope you have no intention of using that
Jack has finished putting his pistol back together
He shoves it in his belt, walks off
Not yet
Ask me again in a few weeks
Elizabeth can't believe it
Captain Sparrow
We have to get off this island -- immediately
Don't be thinking 'm not already working on it
He climbs up toward a clump of palm trees
Digs for something beneath the sand
He finds it: a large iron ring
What is that
Is there a boat under there
Jack heaves the trap door up and over, revealing a pit
Inside are barrels and bottles of rum
all covered with dust and cobwebs, long abandoned
Jack's face falls
(') What
What's wrong
How will this help us get off the island
It won't
It won't, and so we won't
He jumps down into the pit, cracks open a bottle of rum,
takes a swig
But
you did it before
Last time - Last time,  was here a grand total of three days
Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and bartered passage off
(') But from the looks of this, they've long been'out of business, and so that won't be happening again
(takes another swig) We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that
So that's it
That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow
You spent three days on the beach drinking rum
Welcome to the Caribbean, love
He gathers up a few bottles, heads for the beach
(') You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord
We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again
And we've got rum, praise the Lord
We can stay alive a month, maybe more
Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair
month
Will doesn't have a month
We've got to do something to help him
You're right
(hoists the bottle) Here's luck to you, Will Turner
He drinks -- and defiantly returns Elizabeth's angry gaze
But then turns away, sits down
(') Don't be thinking 'm happy about this, Elizabeth
But  see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which  can do nothing about
Not when you can drink instead, at least
Jack tosses her a bottle
Try it
It goes down rough, but it goes down - - and the second swig goes down easier
Elizabeth considers
Comes to a decision
She unseals the bottle, takes a swig
They sit in silence for a bit
And you will call me Miss Swann
Jack toasts her: you got it
Elizabeth studies her bottle
gives Jack a sidelong glance
Back to her bottle (') (under her breath) Drink up me hearties, yo ho
What
What was that
(Elizabeth smiles) Something funny, Miss Swann
share
Please, Nothing
it's nothing
Just
'm reminded of a song  learned as a child
song about pirates
know a lot of songs about pirates, but none 'd teach a child
Let's hear it
Oh, no
it's silly
Back in England we didn't know   a thing about pirates, really
They seemed so romantic and daring   - Jack likes the way that sounds
(') (looks at him) That was before  met one, of course
Now  must hear this song
An authentic pirate song
Have at it
Well, perhaps
with a bit more to drink,  might
More to drink
He gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her
She drops her half-finished bottle to catch it
Opens it, takes a sip
(') Well
Elizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self- consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on
We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho
She gestures for him to drink
He does
(') We kidnap and ravage and we don't give a hoot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho - -  -  - The middle of the night
fire
Jack and Elizabeth are roaring drunk, arm in arm, singing the song all the way up to the stars -- / Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
Yo ho, yo ho, it's a pirates life for me
this song
(sings) Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We're beggars and blighters, ne'er do well cads, Drink up me hearties, yo ho
(gives it a touch of Irish ballad) Aye but we're loved by our mums and our dads
Drink up me hearties, yo ho
They hoist their bottles, but only Jack drinks
He drains the bottle, then tosses it away
(') When  get the   Black Pearl back, 'm going to teach   it to the whole crew, and we'll sing   it all the time
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main
Elizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle
Jack doesn't have a bottle to salute back
She hands him hers
He drinks, then settles shakily to the ground
Elizabeth sits beside him
Not just the Spanish Main
The whole ocean
the whole world
Wherever we want to go, we go
That's what a ship is, you know
Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails
That's what a ship need_
but what a ship is -- what the Black Pearl really-is
is freedom
Elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again
Ah, well
the company is better than last time
And the scenery has definitely improved
(coy) Mr
Sparrow
'm not sure 've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk
We've got a few bottles left
and we've yet to tap the kegs
Elizabeth shrugs with a sleight -- but promising -- smile
She picks up the empty bottle from the ground, holds it up
To freedom
To the Black Pearl
They tap the bottles together
Elizabeth feigns a drink as he chugs
He taps his bottle against her again
She laughs, feigns another drink - -  - -- ' , dead asleep, lying in the sunlight
His nose twitches
bit of  drifts by
His nose twitches again
His eyes open
Jack  and sits up
He rubs his head, looks over - -- all of the foliage in the middle of the island is Smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky
Jack leaps to his feet
He sees Elizabeth, as she pours out the last of the rum, dowsing a scrub brush at the base of a palm tree
It goes up in
She rolls the barrel forward -- it starts to  merrily
Jack can't believe his eyes
What are you doing
You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum
Yes, the rum is gone
She wipes her hands together
One of the rum barrels in the fire
Why
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels
Two - She points to the sky
(') That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction
The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could mass it
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted
Exactly
Elizabeth turns toward the sea
(') Just you wait, Captain
In an hour, maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open' and you'll be seeing white sails on that horizon
She sits down, determined
Shields her eyes, scans the water, waiting, searching
Jack is speechless
He throws up his hands, stalks up the sand dune, just to get away from her
-   - At the crest of the dune, Jack stops -- and stares, incredulous
We come around to see what he is looking at - Past Jack, anchored the other side of the island, white sails glorious against the turquoise waters, is the
Dauntless
longboat is already being rowed toward them
Jack shakes his head
They'll be no living with her after this
-   - Norrington gives Elizabeth a hand disembarking from the raised long boat
Elizabeth, 'm" relieved you're safe
(re: Jack) Clap him in irons
And behind his back this time
Commodore, you can't do that
You're speaking up for him again
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but  doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig
(she's right) We had time to get to know each other
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta
No
The pirates have taken Will - Your father is frantic with worry
Our mission was to rescue you and return home
That is what we shall do
Mr
Turner's fate is regrettable
But so was his decision to engage in piracy
Commodore, please
Norrington, think about it
the Black Pearl, its captain and crew
the last pirate threat in the Caribbean
How can you pass that up
By remembering that  serve others, not only myself
Commodore,  beg you -- please do this
for me
As a wedding gift
am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition  rescue Mr
Turner
Not as a condition -- a request
Norrington considers
To Gillette: Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to come about
He'll give you our heading
Gillette unlocks Jack's manacles
Jack raises an eyebrow
Congratulations, sir
Crew men lead Jack toward the bridge
Sailors go about their tasks, and the ship begins its slow turn
Elizabeth,  hereby withdraw my proposal
What
know now where your heart truly lies
Elizabeth looks at Norrington, seeing him in a new light
And now  know
where yours does, as well
They gaze at each other for a moment
Norrington looks away
You may seclude yourself in my cabin
'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard
Then  can wear men's clothing
That would hardly be proper
Well,  am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin, 80 suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage
Norrington is exasperated, but then can't help but grin - this is exactly why he loves her
She grins back at him - she's not going to change
Murtogg, take our guest below, and find her some trousers, and a shirt
Elizabeth smiles, allows herself to be escorted away
Norrington watches her go
then turns his gaze to the sea
-  - Pintel enters the cell
It appears empty -- but that's because Will is hanging from the rafters, trying to shove up the ceiling planks with his legs
That ain't going to work
That's the gun deck above yea Will drops lightly to the deck
Suddenly: What happened to William Turner
Ah, William Turner
Stupid blighter
He threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him- particularly after we found Cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition
He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did
That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure -- to you, as it were: so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we_ remain
And then he ran
And he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him
That's a nice thought, to be sure, and wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself
But, no
See, what he'd done, _ didn't sit too well with Captain Barbossa
so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over
Will reacts with shock at the account of his father's fate
(') Yep, last  saw of Bootstrap Bill, was his face looking up, as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker
(sighs) It was only after, we found out we needed his blood to solve the curse
That's what you call ironic
Barbossa appears behind Pintel, flanked by several other pirates
He regards Will for a moment, then: Bring him
-   - Jack goes to the rail and waits, pretending to look out at the sea
Elizabeth, dressed in sailor's clothes to excellent effect, joins him
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything
Nor did you,  noticed
He might delay the rescue
and that would be too late
Exactly
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed
have a plan
If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief
and one-sided
What's your plan
(
) Isla de Muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon
Elizabeth -- below decks
will not compromise your safety
She starts to speak; he turns away
(') Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my quarters, and make sure she stays there
Norrington gazes through his spyglass, at the island
Jack watches with some amusement as Elizabeth is escorted away
(') don't like the situation, mister Sparrow
The island is riddled with caves
will not put my men at a disadvantage
Funny,  was thinking   along those lines
How about you let me   go in alone, and while you're setting   up an ambush, 'll trick the pirates out   to you
You would do that
They left me stranded
Twice
What have you got to lose
(looks at him) Nothing  wouldn't be please to be rid of
(smiles) knew you'd listen to reason
-   - Torches are lit
Barbossa leads Will, guarded by Pintel and a band of pirates, into the caves
-   - long boat is prepared to be lowered over the side
Jack wraps his pistol securely in an oilskin pouch
That chart  drew up'11 get you past the reefs
If you're steersman's good enough, that is
'll be at the wheel myself
'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them
The crewmen release the lines, and the boat drops - -  - The pirate group moves deeper into the caves
Will moves along unwillingly
No reason to fret
It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins
(grins) Best play it safe, and spill it all
guess there is a reason to fret
- The Dauntless drifts into the lagoon
Norrington and his men prepare to go ashore
h -  - Lit by torchlight
Will notices: a crack runs between the floor and the wall of the cave, widening into a ravine
Careful, now
You could fall in and still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt
Will makes a decision
He intentionally stumbles
Pintel shoves him forward -- Will continues forward, grabs the pirate in front of him, swings him into the wall of the cave
Catches the pirate's torch, and uses it to ward off the others
You deserve to be cursed -- and remain cursed
He steps to one side -- and drops into the ravine
The wall of the ravine becomes a loose gravel slope; Will hits it, and tumbles down, disappears into black
Blast him
pox on him, and his father, and the whole damnable line
Fan out
Find him
- '  - Elizabeth looks out the Captain's small porthole -- sees boats laden with Navy men headed for shore
She turns away from the porthole, wishing there was something she could do
Suddenly there is a flutter at the window-- Cotton's parrot is there
' Drink  me hearties yo ho
Drink  me hearties yo ho
The bird flutters off; Elizabeth races to the porthole, and then to the stern window to see it flyaway
She looks down -- and there, fastened to the stern of the ship, is a small rowboat
-  - Will races forward, turning this way and that
He sees a light ahead, heads for it, turns a corner - -- and runs straight into Jack
Do you have any idea where you're going
Jack
Don't talk
These caves magnify sound
Just follow me
-         - Norrington and men land on the beach, and spread out
They silently take up positions around the main cave entrance
- Jack leads Will out of a narrow passage -- and stops, staring
Will is a few steps behind
Are you certain this is the right way
It's the right way
Will join him -- and see what Jack is staring at: Treasure piled on treasure, sparkling, glowing, seemingly endless
At the center is the moonlit clearing, and the stone Aztec chest
Thank you, Jack Sparrow
The jump -- Barbossa is standing right behind them, flanked by his men
The trio whirl to run - - more pirates emerge from hiding
Nearly the entire crew of the Black Pearl is there
The pirates grab Will and Jack
Will struggles, but Jack does not fight at all
(') You couldn't have led him back more directly if you knew exactly where you were going
He laughs, and moves toward the stone chest
The pirates follow, dragging Will and Jack with them
You did know where you were going
You did lead us directly to them
(Jack's silence confirms it) Why
Jack looks away -- as Will is manhandled toward the chest
Barbo8sa steps up to him (becoming skeletal in the moonlight) and puts the medallion around Will's neck
He picks up the stone knife
What was begun by blood, let blood now end
He raises the knife to Will's throat - You don't want to be doing that
Barbossa pretends to think about his words
No,  really think  do
(shrugs) All right then
That makes Barbossa pause
He steps out of the moonlight
Why don't  want to do this
Because, right about now, the
Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor
Jack
- - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves
buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates
Do you believe him
No
(indicates Will) But him  believe
He is genuinely angry
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack
that is, if you're mortal
What're you suggesting
Jack shakes off the hands holding him, strolls toward Barbossa, Will, and the chest of coins
Simple
Don't kill the boy yet
Wait for a more opportune moment
Will glares, listening to every word he says
Jack scoops up a handful of coins from the chest
(') (drops the coins one-by- one back into the chest) Like after you've killed
Every
Last
One
of Norrington's men
can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all
Last time you did that, it didn't end 80 well for you
The situation has changed
That so
Aye
See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the
Dauntless
There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do
Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue
The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas
(beat) But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl
Jack smiles and spreads his hands: me
(') sail for you as part of your fleet, give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa
' (sticks out his hand) Do we have an accord
Barbossa licks his lips
It's tempting
(') Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right
Men
Are you up for it
The pirates yell to the affirmative
(') Mr
Pintel, select five men to stay here
Take the rest of the men out
not through the caves
Jack's expression falters; this he hadn't planned for
There's
another exit
Aye, for us there is
-  - Moonlight shines down into the shallow waters, brightening coral, sparkling over the rippled sand floor
Suddenly all the fish
Briefly, the waters are empty
And then  appear in the distance, seeming to waver in the shifting current
They scuffle forward, kicking up clouds of sand -- The figures resolve into the skeleton , moving silently across the lagoon floor, swords glinting
The tatters of their clothing drift in the water
Their skull heads are fixed in an endless grin
The   glides forward - And stops next to a huge iron  -- twice his' height, even buried halfway into the sand
heavy  with barrel-sized links climbs up toward the surface - falls across the Lead Pirate -- he , and we see that it is Pintel
He looks up - Above, the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of the
Dauntless, silhouetted by moonlight
The huge shift drifts, again spilling moonlight below - And the pirates gathered around the anchor are once again , staring with upturned faces
The Pintel-skeleton puts a knife between his teeth, starts to crawl up the iron rings
Other pirates crowd forward, and soon the anchor-chain is clustered with skeletons - - Elizabeth has the small boat out, and rows away from the Dauntless, looking ahead over her shoulder
Cotton's parrot is nowhere to be seen
In the distance, Pintel breaks the surface near the Dauntless, intent on climbing the anchor; he looks over - Just as Elizabeth rounds the point, and rocks obscure the small longboat from view
More skeleton-pirates appear, and Pintel continues his climb
-  - Two , alert and vigilant, stare out toward shore
The island reveals nothing but blackness
There is a scurrying sound -- bones scraping against wood - and the sailors
They listen, intently -- nothing
Ship rats
Big ones
(nods) Hate those things
They turn back toward the island, continue their vigil long pause
(') Taste all right, though
That they do
From behind, the two sailors at the rail are well-lit by a lantern
Suddenly shadows appear, skeletons, climbing up the sailor's backs
-  and then the skeletons appear, reaching -- the two sailors are grabbed from behind -  - Two bodies are tossed out over the rail, hit the water with a splash
-  - Pintel looks down into the water, satisfied
Puts away his knife
Notices, pulls out a long piece of seaweed from his rib cage
Tosses it
Turns to the others
Be quick, now
Train the starboard guns on the beach, and set your aim
Wait for my signal, we don't want to spook them
The pirates hurry to comply - -   - Elizabeth rounds the point further, and sees: the Black Pearl, anchored in the neighboring cove
fleck of color - Cotton's parrot, as it darts in through a porthole
Elizabeth slows her efforts, silently approaching the ship
-   - Four  -- who really ought to be keeping watch - instead have gathered wine bottles and rum casts into a pile, along apples, biscuits -- all the food on the ship
They act out a mock-feast, in anticipation of the curse being lifted
skeleton offers two bottles skeleton
Which would you prefer first, good sir -rum, or wine
- believe 'll have a spot o' rum, if you don't mind, and thank'ee kind sir
They burst out laughing -- a hideous sound that wheezes through their bones
Behind them, unnoticed, Elizabeth peeks cautiously around a corner
She picks her moment and sneaks past quickly, down a gangway, disappearing into the blackness of the ship
-  - Gillette crouches, running low behind a line of rocks
He reports to Norrington: All the men in place, sir
Ready to fire
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that
It's the sound of cannon fire -- coming from the Dauntless
Cannonballs hit the shore; men cry out in anguish
(') Men
Take cover
The sailors scramble to find refuge - -   - Will, guarded by pirates, glares at Jack
You've been planning this from the beginning
Since you learned my name
Jack takes the opportunity to move toward him
Oh, please -- do  really seem that clever
Before Will can answer, Jack smoothly slips the sword from a Pirate's scabbard -- tosses it to Will, who catches it despite his surprise
(') Use it well
He draws his own sword -- and clobbers the Pirate
Barbossa and the other pirates stare in shock - Confound it, Jack --  was actually beginning to like you
Swords are drawn, and the Pirates attack
Jack and Will take on multiple opponents, each with his own style: Will parries, glissades and disarms with lightning fast and perfect form, while Jack uses his blade, fists, acrobatics and anything within reach to survive
-  - The sailors charge
The moon emerges from behind a cloud - Suddenly army of   rise up from the sea, and charge the stunned sailors -- several men are struck down - Steady, men
Remember -- we're the Navy
The sailors recover their nerve, and engage the enemy
It's a full on battle, Royal Navy against Skeleton Pirates - The Navy men are driven back, surrounded - Suddenly there is a massive  of cannon fire
Norrington, in the midst of a swordfight, tries to see - (') What is happening out there
- It's the Black Pearl, manned by Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton, and captained by Elizabeth, coming around the point, cannons blazing
- The pirates on the ship are caught by surprise, try to turn their cannons to this new foe - -  - Gillette sees the Black Pearl firing on the Dauntless
They're on our side
Take heart, men
The Royal Navy stand their ground and fight - -   - Only two pirates left: Barbossa and Jacoby
Jacoby rounds on Will; Barbossa faces off against Jack
Just so you know, Jack --  don't think you're that clever
think you're a fool
mortal fool
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide
Jack drives him back, making Barbossa laugh
You can't beat me, Jack
To prove his point, he drops his own sword -- and catches Jack's sword with both hands
Jack can't free it
Barbossa twists the sword from Jack's grip, reverses it - - -      '
Will battling Jacoby, sees it -- he smashes Jacoby in the jaw, crumpling him Jack
Jack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest
He takes a few steps backward, toward the Aztec gold -- when he steps into the moonlight,
Well, isn't that interesting
Skeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest
He pulls something from his pocket: one of the Aztec coins
(' ) They're so pretty,  just couldn't resist stealing one
It's a curse, guess
Barbossa grabs up his sword, and rushes Jack
Both men are in moonlight now, two skeletons in pitched battle
So what now, Jack Sparrow
Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgment Day
Or you could surrender
He shoves Barbossa back, out of the moonlight
Barbossa stalks the room, his attention focused on Jack
Or  could chain you to a cannonball and drop you in the deepest part of the ocean, where you can contemplate your folly forever
Barbossa charges - - Jack stands out of the moonlight, flesh and blood again, holding his smoking pistol, still aimed at Barbossa
(') Hah
Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot
He didn't waste it
Will stands over the Aztec chest, holding a bloody sword, his left hand in a fist
He opens the fist - -- the medallion, blood covering it, drops from his hand, revealing the cut in his palm
Barbossa stares, then looks down at his chest
Blood blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole
It spreads quickly
Barbossa clutches his chest, his face registering pain for the first time in years
Barbossa falls heavily to the ground, dead
Jack blows the smoke from the barrel of his pistol
tosses it away
-  - Murtogg  a pistol at a pirate
The pirate is hit, screams in pain, and crumples to the ground
Mullroy runs through another with his sword
The pirates react to the sight, and quickly realize their peril
They set their weapons down in surrender
-  - The Black Pearl comes alongside the Dauntless, and Jack's crew swarm across, overwhelming the pirates
The sailors on the beach see it, and
-  -   - Will wraps a cloth around his palm; Jack joins him near the chest
Well, you're the worst pirate 've ever heard of
(smiles) You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can It betray his friends
What kind of pirate is that
(admits it) The worst
(beat) On the other hand, maybe 'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice
-- and who knows how to get what he wants
Now that's a great pirate
Jack cuts his palm, grips the coin he stole above the chest and then hesitates
Will looks at him
Jack releases the coin
It lands in the chest beside the other bloody coin
Suddenly, the lid of the chest, all on its own,
Elizabeth stares at it
Let's get out of here
-  -  - Jack, Will, and Norrington gather together on the beach
Elizabeth calls out: You're all right
The three men turn as one
An awkward moment -- which of them does she mean
Elizabeth races across the sand, toward them -- and straight to Will
She throws her arms around his neck in a hug
Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers
And how did you get off the island
Elizabeth can't believe that's what he noticed
Indignant, she steps away from him
Yes,  am wearing trousers
And as for how we got off the island -- ah, that's a grand adventure, but now is not the time to talk about it
She reaches a hand behind his neck, decisively kisses him
(') There
And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss
Elizabeth,  think it doesn't matter- that we are of a different class - It doesn't
-- but that was not a proper kiss
Pure consternation on Elizabeth's face - (') This is a proper kiss
Will sweeps her in his arms, leans her back, and kisses her long and well - Jack puts a hand on Norrington's shoulder
Tough luck
was rooting for you
-   - Close on: Will's face, stoic, staring forward
He stands straight and unmoving
Around him are members of the Royal Navy, standing before for a group of witnesses from town
It is the courtyard on the top of Fort Charles
trial is underway -- with Will as the defendant
and though  do say so with regret, the law is clear
The penalty for piracy is death by hanging
In the crowd, Elizabeth squeezes the hand of her father, Swann
She lets go as Swann stands
By your leave,  wish to speak on behalf of the boy
(a glance at Elizabeth) It is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere desire   to do good, at great personal risk
It   seems to me, that in the rare occasion   where the right course is committing an   act of piracy, then an act of piracy   is the right course
(cheers of approval) So in my capacity as Governor,    intend to grant a pardon to -- Sir
All eyes turn
Gillette stands at the top of a stairway
(') Jack and his crew have escaped
(gasps from the crowd) There was no damage to the cell
they must have been set free
Will and Elizabeth exchange looks
You
Not me, you
No, not me either
Swann notices something the parapet, points The Black Pearl
People rush to the parapet
Sure enough, below in the bay are the distinctive black sails of the Pearl
The ship cuts through the waters very close to the point - -- where the gallows of the pirates are
Suddenly Jack appears, on the point; he swings off the one empty gallows, across and down onto the ship's rigging as it passes
Sir
Shall  break out the cannons
don't think that will be necessary
Norrington raises his hand
twirls a key on his finger
(') day's head start
That's all he gets
Will, Elizabeth and Swann look out toward ocean- -   - Jack monkeys down the rigging
AnaMaria is at the wheel
Captain Sparrow -- the Black Pearl is yours
Jack runs a hand lovingly along the rail, then takes the wheel
It feels good -- right -- in his hands
He enjoys it, and then shifts to 'Captain' mode
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail
Aye, aye, sir
Mr
Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail - you and Cotton
want every inch of the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape
Gibbs actually stomps the deck, executes a salute
Jack stands at the wheel: he's got his ship back, and all is right with the world
He begins to unconsciously hum: "Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me
" He realizes what he's doing and smiles, the orchestra takes over as the Black Pearl sails for uncharted waters
