: Written by John Collee & Peter Weir 1
- From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering, abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided valleys of water
Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the ocean and an adjacent coastline
In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering darkness:  three-masted sailing vessel
2
- [   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her great guns projecting from every gun-port
As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise
3
- The ship in silhouette -  : Surprise Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls
Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806 Mission: Intercept and destroy French Privateer, Acheron 5
- , with his back to us, bends over the table, studying charts
His servant, , a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow

The glass catches the setting sun as it drops below the great casement windows
lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and retires
(Absently) Thankee Killick 4
: a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline
Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first, bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view
Then another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one
On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and detailed information in fine copperplate script: 6 fa
Shoals suddenly to half fa
Rocks (exact position unknown)

- Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant  , his pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running from brow to chin
He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out
7
'  - Dr  , a keen naturalist, sits at his desk surrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific instruments
[   ] glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but the doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced structure, is too engrossed to notice him
8
'  - In the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from an early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles
(16) and   (13) are arguing about whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth mates  (15) and  (14) wait for the game to resume
In Out
In
It was here
The line is in
It was there
It was out
Out In
Tell him Boyle
It was in  say
The lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much older than the rest
This is , aged 24
He's a sensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing up briefly as   passes
9
- - By the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog
Faster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down greedily One man, , sits shirtless while another, , brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first link of what will be a great chain round 's waist
, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in the middle of a story as  passes, everyone knuckling their foreheads in deference to the officer
10
- Boys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of 'jacks' with some sheep bones
,  and  are the powder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns during action
11
- hundred hammocks swing like strange pods, close packed under the immense beams
Most of the occupants are already asleep: here an arm, there a lolling head Lights out
On the bosun's command, the last of the off-duty men climb into their hammocks
The last lights are extinguished
Only ' lamp remains, moving up the ladder to
12
- The uppermost or weather deck consists of two parallel gangways linking the forecastle (forward) to the quarterdeck (aft)
The lead is dropped from the bows
As  walks aft to the quarterdeck as each man lets go his coils of the deep sea line
Watch there
Watch Somewhere a bell sounds and the silent figures of the watch call from their stations
- Lifebuoy all's well
- Starboard gangway all's well
- Starboard bow all's well
Over this, the splash of the lead and the repeated cry of "Watch there
Watch
" 13
- Pullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd Lieutenant , a short tubular man in his early 20s
climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first time: a heavy-set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair clubbed at the back At the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel
The helmsman, - a London cockney with a boxer's face - gives their current course
nods, then moves to the gunwale with
Jack sniffs the air and speaks in a low voice
How  do hate a lee shore You think we'll have long to wait
(shrugs) Intelligence reports had her leaving Boston on the 12th, that should put us at least a week ahead
She'll be in for a surprise, Sir
The pun on the name of their ship was unintentional, but lets out a great hoot of laughter, shattering the tense, expectant silence
In for a "Surprise"
Now that's wit
"In for a Surprise"
'Pon my word  shall have to tell the Doctor
He leaves, still laughing
Those on the quarterdeck are more amused by 's unique sense of humour than by the feeble joke itself
(') (calls back) Don't put her on the reef, Tom
'll try not to, Sir
13A
' Jack looks around the door What do you have there, Stephen
He enters
Stephen has wired together the thorax of a bird's skeleton and is suspending lead weights from it The breastbone of a frigate bird
Do you remark its prodigious strength
Jack bends forwards into the candle-light, sharing his friends keen interest in this strange assembly do and  am not in the least surprised, for it reminds me of nothing so much as a ship under sail
See here the bowsprit
Here the mast, and here the backstays running aft
(adds another weight) Ten pounds sixteen ounces
am preparing a paper for the Royal Society
Jack straightens, moving with care between the bottled specimens, open books and brass measuring instruments was thinking when our business here is finished, we will have to put in to Recife for provisions
You may care to take a tour round the forests of Brazil, botanizing and collecting specimens
An anaconda or two
giant cassowary
should like it of all things, Jack
Thankyou

- Time passes
The fog intensifies
White coils of mist drift and eddy over the glassy sea,    as the ship moves slowly through the night

The coffee-pot swings on its gimbals

Finally he gives up trying to sleep

- on deck again
Six bells and all's well

The mist beginning to shift as an offshore breeze picks up
- 90 fathoms, white shelly sand
Four knots, Sir

Not two miles distant, Sir

Mr
Hollom
saw nothing, nor heard anything either
Shall  ask them men to stand down
steps closer to the bow, and again lifts his telescope
29 slow pan across the sea, past a darker patch of fog
What was that
The lens pans back toward the darker area to see a series of flashes
30 He turns and shouts to the crew - Lie down
Everybody lie down
His words are underscored by a series of distant explosions, followed by a deep rumble, then a tearing, howling sound
31 Chain shot and grape, bar and canister shriek through the air
blizzard of iron
32 The crew hit the deck, the last to drop is  hanging grimly to the wheel
33 Close, as he tries to bury himself in the deck timbers
34 35
36 The broadside hits the bows and a cloud of splinters and metal scythes the length of the deck at head height
This is rapidly followed by billowing smoke from a small fire now burning on the forecastle
is working at putting the fire out as  issues a stream of orders
Run out the guns
Marines to the tops, and get that wounded man below
He pulls a gold watch from his pocket and checks the time
36A Hollom is nervously supervising a gun crew which includes and his mates
-cast loose now
Um swab
That's right
Run out your guns
The men work as a team, largely ignoring Hollom's hesitant instructions
The shot rack is empty Shot
There's no shot

() As red-coated marines led by Captain  climb into the rigging  calls to his clerk - Note the time Mr
Watt
An anxious   appears
She's out of our range, Sir
calls to his sailing master,
Closer, Mr
You must lay me alongside her at pistol-shot
purses his lips
He knows what he's doing and slightly resents the instruction (') Mr
Pullings - bow-chasers to fire as she bears
38 She's crossing their bows, about a mile distant
39 is racing up the larboard gangway to the forecastle, past men stacking hammocks as blast protection
40 Gun-captains stand ready, the slow-match burning in the tubs
Fire on the uproll
The little drummer's huge eyes are fixed on ' face
The ship rolls
(') Fire
The drum-roll is all but drowned by the blast of the guns
The smoke clears, the gunners look on baffled as their balls bounce harmlessly off the side of the enemy ship
(In Greek) Witchcraft
Never seen the like of it Damn and blast you
See to your guns
Fire high
Fire for the masts and rigging
As the enemy's murderous long guns run out again
41 Her French ensign clearly visible as she swings broadside on to the approaching Surprise - again her side lights up in a series of red flashes
42 By the dim light of a battle-lantern  struggles to hold a wounded man on the table, his feet slipping in pools of blood on the deck
More sand on the floor, Mr
Higgins
The slightly hung-over  reaches for the sand bucket and is thrown over by the awful jarring shock as the Acheron's third broadside hits home
43
- The Captain's crockery smashes to the deck
, cursing freely, stows what he can
44 Shards of timber implode, followed by a great spout of water knocking the massive   sideways as he runs for the ladder carrying two cannon-balls
second explosion, a second jet of water and , finding his feet, starts yelling for the carpenter

As  dives for the ladder

Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or dead
The dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around dangerously

emerges from the smoke, meets 's horror-struck gaze and takes command
Davies
Get those bodies overboard
(to ) Mr
Hollom sir
sits immobilized by fear
grabs the poulterer, , who has been rescuing the ship's goat, Aspasia
(') Jemmy - leave the damned goat and take Mr
Hollom below
Aye, sir
The ship heels as she turns
Midshipman , Calamy's rival in the game of marbles, turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free
He throws a hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes against the bulkhead
shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft
carries on shouting to the powder-monkeys - More shot
More cartridge
47 In the great jagged hole on the gun-deck where the gun was destroyed,  stands framed, a wrathful soot-stained figure
He glances back at his men, hunched and ready, itching to fire
(bellows) Steady
Wait for it
48 to see the two ships about to pass abreast, the Surprise heading south as it were, the enemy ship, north
The French vessel is clearly the bigger ship, and from both come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums
They will pass broadside to broadside, 500 yards apart
49
-, watching the enemy, judging the moment
wait
And
The great guns go off all together
The cannons leaping back between their crews
snatches a powder-monkey, , out of the way of the lethal recoil
50 Smoke clears to reveal holes in the enemy's foretopsail, a bowline hanging loose, but again many of her balls have failed to penetrate the enemy timbers
By all that's holy what is that ship made of
His question coincides with a third full broadside from the Frenchman
The Surprise's wheel shattered
thrown aside,
jerked back to the taffrail, the mizzenmast hit
rope sheers and   is smacked on the skull by a swinging boom
Midshipman , running up on deck, goes to help and is struck down by a flying splinter - a shocking wound to his upper right arm
51 is half-way up the ladder when he falls, scored across the forehead by a musket-ball
Eyesight blurred
Hearing gone
He is dimly aware of small arms cracking above his head, and someone trying to lift him
Belay there ye poxed son of a whore
You must go below, Sir, you must let me help you below
puts a hand to his bleeding forehead and drags himself back up the ladder
52 furious exchange of fire between  's marines and the sharpshooters in the enemy's rigging
Howard, a big red-faced man, is in his element, laughing madly every time he scores a hit
53 emerges into bloody chaos: screams of the wounded all around, the enemy ship moving astern in mist and gun-smoke
He wipes blood from his eye as he raises his telescope
54/55
As the ship passes, her name is visible on the transom - Acheron
Sir
Jack lowers his telescope
Pullings' expression spells catastrophe It's the rudder
56 Grim-faced,  hobbles to the shattered taff-rail, sees soaked, having climbed down onto the stern-post
(shouts up) It's shot away below the waterline
58 , up to his armpits in blood, operating on a wounded man, looks up to see three more seriously injured men arriving
He pauses, aware of some change
Why are we not firing
57
- Spirals of drifting smoke
Blackened bleeding men, their guns pointing at nothing No steerage
We're fish in a barrel 59 The fog has rolled back, like a great curtain, to reveal the two frigates
The badly damaged Surprise, drifting rudderless
The Acheron, most of her sails intact, beginning the turn which will put her in position to finish off the Surprise
60 is joined by  as the enemy vessel starts crossing their wake
He's coming about, Sir
Should  strike the colours
All eyes on Jack, poised on the brink of awful defeat
'm afraid there's nothing else for it
looks from the wall of fog to the three little boats they are towing astern
Damned if there ain't
We'll tow her
61 Sudden feverish activity, running and shouting as men scramble down into the boats
settles himself beside in the cutter, turning to look at the approaching Acheron
His
: puffs of smoke from its bow-chasers
Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what sail you can
Stern-chasers to fire when she's in range
62 Gouts of water from the enemy gunfire rise not fifty yards from them, acting as little needed encouragement for the boats to get clear of the stern and pull around towards the bows as
64
/ Men scramble up the ratlines, and through the shattered rigging
65 Two long brass nine-pounders set up through the open windows of the Captain's day cabin, open fire on the approaching Acheron
Fire
65A , captain of the maintop, directs his men about the mare's nest of rigging, getting a tattered top-sail to fill with what little breeze there is
Sharp now with that fancy-line
To the clew line from the reef points, Cully, double up and run her back again
66 Through ' telescope: the enemy ship coming straight at them, her guns now getting the range of the Surprise
She's gaining on us
Start the water, carronades over the side
67 Crewmen furiously at work cutting the ropes securing the guns on the quarterdeck
68 Water spouts from the pumps, while at the same time the quarterdeck guns tumble into the ocean
(: they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck, not their main armament on the gun-deck
) 69 races to the bows
Towlines strain as the three small boats pull the great ship toward the curtain of fog and cloud
He yells to the straining oarsmen - Pull
Pull for your lives
70 The men heave on their oars, faces bathed in sweat, the towlines taut behind them, dragging the Surprise toward the safety of the fog-bank
71 to see the Surprise slipping into the cover of fog and low cloud, only her top masts visible, before they too disappear
72 joins his officers looking back into the white-out, in the direction of the enemy
Quiet now
No calls, no shouts
Mr
, signal the men in the boats to head due east
hurries toward the bows, as behind them the fog is momentarily illuminated by flashes of gunfire from their pursuer
73 , in the prow of the jolly-boat, sees  on the ship, signalling the turn to eastward
signals to  in the stern of the jolly-boat
(urgent whisper) Starboard haul
And stroke
Stroke
One side stops rowing and the boat turns
74 low angle, the ship coming slowly toward us
Beyond, the rowers strain at their oars, the great ship rearing out of the mist above them, as though carried on their backs
75 Somewhere astern and to the left  can hear shouting on the Acheron
Flashes of cannon fire, directed away from them
He's beating inshore
Keep rowing 76    , () - The tortured sounds of exhausted men rowing as skeins of mist drift away to reveal a dim, yellow moon
On the horizon the battered ship in silhouette, lines stretching ahead to her three small boats
77     - Some of the wreckage has been cleared aside, the wounded moved below
We can hear their moans, and the constant creaking of the bilge pumps
and his officers scan the moonlit sea through telescopes
's telescope :  long slow pan along the dark horizon
believe we've lost her, Sir
collapses his telescope
Pass the word to ship oars 78    BOATs
- The rowers slump forwards in their seats, their hands raw and crabbed
79  - moves down a ladder past  coming up from below, soaking wet and exhausted with his mate Nagel
Three feet of water in the hold, Sir, but the pumps are keeping it from gaining
Very good, Mr
Lamb
The constant creaking and sloshing of the pumps becomes louder as he continues down past men handing up food and powder from the flooded levels below
81
- Stephen, his face spattered with blood, is adjusting the wick of a lantern when Jack arrives beside him (sotto) What's the butchers bill
Six dead, thirteen wounded
He notices the gash on Jack's forehead Your head
(Brushes him away) Later
raises his lantern to reveal groaning bloodstained men close-packed in the gloom
Together they make the rounds, passing men propped upright by their mates, pale with shock or tense with pain, some struggling to breathe, some barely alive
clasps hands, whispers encouragement
bandaged head swims into the glow of the lamp, streaked with blood and deeply unconscious
(') Who's this - Joe Plaice
(sotto) severe depressed fracture of the skull
am not sure he will see out the night
Moving on to another barely recognizable face: young Blakeney, pale and sweaty, breathing hard from the pain and the blood loss
Mr
Blakeney
Just a broken arm, Sir
looks at , whose expression is grim, but he says nothing, steering Jack forward to the foot of the ladder where they can speak more privately will do everything possible
know you were close to his father
Jack nods, defeat weighing heavily, and makes to go
Stephen puts a restraining hand on his shoulder
(') One moment Jack let me look at that brow of yours
Its a scratch
will tell you if its a scratch or not
Sit down
Jack submits meekly, and sits on a lower rung while Stephen puts a bandage round his forehead How did he find us Stephen
Seven weeks sailing and he happened in darkness on our exact position
Its uncanny
He really is a phantom Unless she was alerted to our presence, and looking for us
Tosh
How could that be
The French have their spies, in Britain as elsewhere
(astonished) You're saying there are traitors in the Admiralty
am saying do not imagine it was a lone privateer who did this to us
He is working for Napoleon himself, with access to all that tyrant commands, overtly and covertly
So do not let defeat weigh too heavily upon you
82
- Wan dawn light reflects off the ceiling onto the bloody, bandaged officers, conducting an angry post-mortem as serves coffee
Call her a frigate
Ha
You ask me she's no more a frigate than a painted Dutchman
More like a ship of the line, a two-decker more'n a frigate
is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed
One does wonder what manner of hull she has
Our balls seemed to bounce right off her
Jack enters, his head newly bandaged
He walks past the seated officers and stands looking out through the stern windows
The officers continue their conversation, though their words are intended for Jack She had the weather-gauge and long eighteens which could hit us beyond our effective range
That's the sum of it And   40 guns to our 28,  counted the muzzle flashes
It was an unfair match, no dishonor in defeat no dishonor at all
Jack still has his back to them
He puts his hand in his pocket and finds something there - the shattered fragments of his gold pocket watch
(sighs) Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so we'll bend our spare
Sir
Jack finally turns
(') Mr
Allen is confident, with basic repairs, we can get home as we are
allowing for a stop in Jamaica
At Port Royal we can haul her into dry- dock, and hopefully get her home without
We're not going home
An expectant hush
is all ears, as he picks up the coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray
(') What is our purpose here gentlemen
Why were we sent
To punish a blackguard privateer who has decimated our Atlantic whaling fleet and now threatens to do the same in the pacific
Are we to leave those ships to his mercy and slink back into Portsmouth - another defeat to add to the list
Is that what we draw our wages for
say we pursue her and pay her back with interest With respect, Captain, she could be half- way to Cape Horn by the time we're repaired and underway
(sternly) Then there's not a moment to lose
83 exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups
As he passes them to his mate,   - (a whisper) We're for the Horn
84
- Word passes like lightning from the wounded in the orlop, to the beak of the ship -   The Horn you say
-   Never
In this condition
-   Eh
What news mates -   Heading for where
85
- few of the old 'Surprises' have gathered for a smoke, all of them men who've sailed with  before: Jittery alcoholic Higgins, loyal Nehemiah Slade, sharp-faced tobacco-chewing Faster Doudle, and the big Welshman Awkward Davies, still shaken by the loss of his gun-crew
higgins We're for hell in a hand-barrow if you ask my opinion slade 'm game
If the captain says we can take her we can take her
Can we catch her is the question
And if we do what's different
She'll just hold us off with them long eighteens til she sends us all to the bottom
All for what
'll tell you for what, matey
She's a privateer, loaded with all the gems of Araby
Think of the gold
Think of the prize-money
Hoi there
You men jump to it
86
- The gratings are hauled aside and light floods down into the gun-deck
87
- - Part of a huge tree-trunk - spare timber for repairs - is manhandled by a dozen crewmen
Heave
And heave
Handsomely now
One long pull
Belay

- Crewmen labour at the capstan
(
) Two six heave
Two six heave
The huge log rises from below and hangs suspended from its gantry
shouts down from the quarterdeck - Have her placed along the gunwale for now, Mr
Hollar, and the guns moved to that side also

' Men are hanging in the rigging throwing down damaged sections of rope
All clear below

- looks down to where  and others have lifted the broken rudder from its hinges

- The ship swarming with men, cutting, splicing, hammering and hauling
Every able-bodied soul hard at work

- An optimistic breeze has picked up, fluttering the tattered ensign
The deck is now sloping at a forty-five degree angle hands a sandwich to Pullings who passes it down to
Damn this wind, Mr
Pullings
The Acheron will be making a hundred and fifty miles a day in this
Aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping to board the odd merchantman smiles at this and bites into his sandwich
To the uphill side, carpenters are erecting a scaffolding over the side of the ship
94
- The ship's copper-plated keel is partly revealed as the men clamber and slip about on the steeply-sloping side erecting scaffolding
The tropical heat resounds with shouts, curses and hammering
95
- Carpenters working inside the scaffolding, are fitting new sections of wood into the holes low in her hull
Down
Down
Stop
The new piece of wood is an almost perfect fit marks the places where it is jamming

Then he begins to work on it with his rasp
96
- Among tropical fish, a diver, a Greek crewman, ' ' (father of  ) a hammer at his belt, plugs a few smaller holes with hemp fibre, then surfaces to

Powder-monkeys sweat on the bellows
The ship's blacksmith is churning out iron bolts, pintles and gudgeons, which are snatched away by  with tongs and thrown into a bucket of water to cool
few yards away, wood chips fly from 's adze as the ship's massive new stern post takes shape
The new rudder is laid out flat, already cut to its final shape and being strengthened with great nails and iron bands which   and   are nailing into place

Blakeney looks around, disoriented and finds Calamy by his side
Joe Plaice told me when you die they sew you up in your hammock with the last stitch through your nose
to make sure you're not just sleeping You know old Joe, always telling [ ] stories
Is it true though
[    ] About the last stitch
Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine first

Then he realizes, with sudden horror, that it wasn't a dream You would have died else
Blakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away (') Come

Below him the great work is nearing completion, men swarming like ants over every part of the hull
climbs down past   who has one leg looped through the shrouds and is splicing a rope with both hands and his teeth
Farther down, a patched sail is being furled up tight in its gaskets
Beyond that, at the base of the main-mast a fascinated group of men have gathered to watch the Doctor trepanning 104

No, that is just blood
These are his brains
Exposing them to view
Several of the crew move in for a closer look
The armourer hands  a flattened coin, which he begins to screw in place over the cavity as the old hands whisper his praises to the men who have never seen Stephen at work
Physician he is, not one of your common surgeons
Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and the strong fives, wouldn't look at you for under ten guineas on land
[   ] Knows his birds and beasts too boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell you what it's thinking
105
- wind causes the ship to turn on its moorings, stirring impatiently, like a racehorse ready to be off as
106
- jumps down from the mizzen ratlines
Let us be off, Mr
Allen
Weigh anchor
All hands to make sail
Mr Hollom
107 Barefoot men are suddenly running to their stations, racing above and below, running out along the bowsprit, up the ratlines, along the yards
small group, supposed to be assisting Hollom, are contrasting slow off the mark Bear a hand there you fellows
The men he is addressing, shoot him a look of distaste which unsettles Hollom slightly, then they assist him pulling on a rope 108
- Up and down Sir, thick and dry for weighing
109
- Men strain on the capstan bars
110
- The anchor bursting up out of the sea
111
- The shrouds darken with climbing figures, framed against the sun
(
) Trice up
Lay out
Sheet home
Hoist away
112
- staring up as the sails unfurl and fill with wind
Cheerly there in the foretop, our William
'garnsl sheets
Hands to the braces
Men slide down ropes from high amongst the shrouds, then swing out and drop down to the deck like monkeys, pulling ropes and sails tight with the weight of their bodies
113
- The ship spreading its wings
sudden cracking of canvas as she turns and runs directly downwind
114
- The sun has sunk lower
, solid as the rock of Gibraltar is back at the helm, the wind stronger and directly behind
Speed, Mr
Boyle heaves the log clear of the ship's side
The log line races out on its reel
checks the run, pulls the pin
Ten and a half knots, Sir
makes no comment but the news seems to please him
115
- The great hull powers past us
116 117
- prepares toasted cheese in his small serving-area
From inside the cabin, the sound of a violin and a cello tuning up
glances irritably at the door and elbows his mate,
Here we go again: scrape, scrape, screech, screech and never a tune you could dance to, not if you were drunk as Davey's sow
118 and  are both keen amateur musicians - , violin,  cello
As Stephen completes his tuning, Jack experiments with a refrain
Is that one  know, or are we breaking new ground
am trying to remember that air they played all those years ago at the Governors house in Port Mahon
You remember When we first met
Corelli if 'm not mistaken
He plays another riff If that is your "" you are very much so
This is
Jack corrects his  string, plays another few bars Or Locatelli
pom pom pom pom All  remember is you being unable to sit in your seat the entire performance
Aye and you practising apon that poor bishop with your "puddings athwart the starboard Gumbrils" or some such arrant nonsense
(laughs) No
That was off Toulon, during the blockade
At our first meeting they played this: He plays a short refrain No
No
Entirely off the mark
pom-pom- have now He plays another variation (enjoying the game) Or was it something like this
Cello answers violin, as they hand it back and forth, improvising freely now with an infinity of variations, sometimes playing together, sometimes separately, suddenly hitting it, the music soaring and continuing over 119
,   - The tiny ship on the vastness of the ocean
From its side, cotton-wool puffs of smoke
120
- - rippling broadside, the crews sweating over their guns
And pitch 'em up
It's spars and rigging we want
timing the gap between each broadside
Three minutes ten, Sir
Not good enough
We must fire three broadsides to her two
Again
Turning to , who though much recovered, still looks pale and a little unsure of himself
(') Mr
Blakeney
Think you can supervise a gun
As you will
Sir
'Spitfire', hop to it
takes command of the gun
To one side  is in charge of 'Beelzebub', on the other side  is now directing 'Sudden Death'
Once again the orders are given, and the crews, now competing with each other, go through the sequence: 'Out Tompions', 'Cast loose your guns', 'Cartridge
Ball
Prime
Run out your gun
Prime
Aim
Stand clear
Fire
' 121
- As another broadside shakes the deck,  hauls his collecting net on board and empties out a glistening array of sea creatures - shrimps, squid and minnows, glinting like opals in the pink light
(
) Two minutes five, Sir
Again
122
- It's a race
's orders are just a formality, the sequence having become so automatic now
Out Tompions
Run out your guns
Prime
Seconds ticking away on 's stopwatch, barrels float on the sea a hundred yards out
(
) (') As she bears, from forward aft
Point your guns
Fire
123 The black ship spouting tongues of flame, the water around the target barrels erupting in great spouts
(
) Two minutes dead
124 Boom
Another splendidly coordinated broadside resounds through the ship as the powder-monkeys come racing down through the dreadnought screens to the magazine and back with more cartridge
For them too it's a race, little  just ahead of , hot on his heels
125
'  - The sound of the guns is faint down here, at least when heard from 's perspective - his ears are stuffed with wax
He is surrounded by his specimen bottles, and he looks from his microscope to his ledger where he is documenting the array of aquatic life-forms
He removes his ear-plugs, but the noise of the guns is deafening and he hastily replaces them
126
- - watches the second hand of his stopwatch, glancing up as he notes - The concentrated fury of the men swabbing, ramming, heaving in, heaving out, firing at a raft this time
And he stops the watch as the first gun fires
One minute forty-nine, Sir
His voice is drowned by the firing of the other guns in close succession entirely demolishing the raft, the sound mixing with cheering and the frenzied hammering of Nagel and his mates as the gun-deck partitions are cheerfully re-erected
127
- The table is dragged back into place and settings laid for dinner
enters, his face flushed with victory
Killick
Killick there
appears
(') What do you have for us tonight
Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face
Aah
My favorite
128
- The sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards through the warm night
Crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck
Now they sit around in groups, supping their grog
Someone produces a jaw-harp, someone else a drum
guitar is passed from hand to hand, stopping with who sings a ballad in an African dialect
There's an effortless integration of race and rank, of age and nationality - bonds forged by battle and hardship
gets up and dances a Greek dance: obviously a favorite among the crew
Cheering and cat-calls
Lanterns coming up from below
More dancing, insults in many languages, and a song
- Boneparte Boneparte That red-faced son of an old French fart Hey ho, stamp and go Stamp and go, stamp and go Hey ho, stamp and go 129
- The singing mixes with the end of a lively dinner given by for his officers, including a special guest, young With your permission, Sir, Mr
Mowett has composed a short poem in honour of our mission
Let's hear it, Mr
Mowett
Reactions around the table, glasses re-filled in anticipation
stands and declaims with a number of precise airy gestures, like a conductor
Our brotherhood, some old, some new
In blood baptized, in strength renewed
In purpose unified and true
All thoughts of home forsaken
Where duty leads us, there we go
Nor rest nor comfort shall we know
Until the unrepentant foe, is boarded sunk or taken (raising their glasses) Aye
Capital
Well said
Hear him, hear him
'Sunk or taken'
Aye and when we do take her we shall give her to Tom Pullings as his first command
If he don't die before then
Bumpers up Tom ( toast) 'To wives and sweethearts'
They raise their glasses - 'To wives and sweethearts'
And may they never meet
Amid the laughter someone bumps Blakeney's stump
He winces, then puts a brave face on it (to ) believe you knew Nelson, Sir
Lord Nelson
Yes
had the honour of serving under him at the Nile
(aside) Mr
Mowett, the bottle stands by you, sir
(as the bottle moves on) In fact  dined with him twice, and he spoke to me on both occasions
The table goes quiet
is wide-eyed, though partly from his strenuous efforts to appear sober
(
) (') The first time he said to me - 'May trouble you for the salt, sir
'  have always tried to say it as close as could [   ] The second time someone had offered him a boat-cloak on a cold night and he said no, he was quite warm - his zeal for his king and country kept him warm
Amid the general agreement - 'Hear him, hear him', etc
is noticeably silent
(') It sounds absurd,  know, and were it another man you would cry out, "Oh, what pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm, but with him you felt your heart glow
(raising his glass) To Lord Nelson
Lord Nelson
[ ] Stephen joins on the toast, but  knows that his friend deplores such overt patriotism and seeks to draw him back in with a joke
You see those two weevils, Doctor
He points at a faint movement amongst the crumbs of a ship's biscuit
do
Which would you choose
The table tenses with anticipation of one of the Captain's 'jokes'
concentrates
There is not a scrap of difference
They are the same species of curculio
But suppose you had to choose
Then  would choose the right-hand weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in both length and breadth
There  have you
You are completely dished
Don't you know in the Navy you must always choose 'the lesser of two weevils'
He thunders with laughter, the rest joining in, breathless with mirth, tears of laughter streaming down their faces 'Pon my life
He who would pun would pick a pocket
Dye not smoke it doctor
(poker faced) Sure there would be some poor thin barren minds that would catch at such a paltry clench
Then he too cracks a smile and joins in their laughter 130
- The crew continue with their own celebration
The excitement penetrates  's stupor
Never having woken since the trepanning he suddenly opens his eyes and speaks
"
And the righteous shall inherit the earth
" The men around him stare in amazement
You hear that
He said something
Joe spoke
Say something else Joe Handy with that gasket (shouts up to the quarterdeck) He spoke doctor
Joe plaice spoke 131 The officers have appeared on deck with their coffee and Stephen raises a hand in acknowledgment
132
- Midshipmen   and  are eating from a bag of broken biscuits ('ships nuts') as they sit perched up in the rigging
On seeing , they break into their own song
Our captain was very good to us
He dipped his prick in phosphorus
It shed a light all through the night
And steered us through the Bosphorus
133 pretends not to have heard, but he can't hide his smile
Beside him in a chair sits , his empty jacket sleeve pinned to his front 'Nelson' style, laughing incredulously at the older boys cheek
From somewhere on the forecastle,  and his top-men start singing
- Farewell and adieu you fine Spanish ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain
The older midshipman,  joins in, his fine voice soaring effortlessly over the others, hijacking their roistering ballad and converting it to something much more poignant
For we've received orders to sail for Old England
Perhaps we shall never more see you again His singing is appreciated by  on the quarterdeck
What a wonderfully true voice Mr
Hollom does possess
134
- and  are less than impressed with  and sing over him, led by  the cook
Come all you thoughtless young men, warning take by me, And never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea
135
- The Surprise sailing away from us, the chorus drifting across the darkness
135a The colours are changing, from the rich hues of the tropics to the cold muted colours of colder, more southerly climes
Still the surprise sails on 136
- Fingers trace a course down the east coast of South America
Another, more detailed chart is placed on top of the first
This one's by Colnett, Sir
He travelled with Captain Cook and carried a pair of Arnott's chronometers
finds their position and marks it with pencil
knock on the door
Officers and crew are now dressed according to the change in climate Couple of the men to see you, Sir
(without looking up) Show them in
The door opens to reveal  and  carrying something
(') What's this
scale model of a ship, 15 inches long, perfect in every detail
Jack takes it, delighted, the name picked out in gold on the stern - Acheron
It were Warley's idea, Sir
thought she were familiar like, then remembered where 'd seen her - in Boston, during the Peace
[   ] In Boston
(nods) Yes, Sir
She's Yankee built
seen them working on her, something right strange about her scantlings
Then  seen them balls bounce off her an'  got to thinking
If you look here, Sir
One side opens up
He pulls a side off the model, exposing its construction
Mister Nagel here done it just like seen her - a third layer 'tween the outer and inner ribbing - diagonal bracing, see
Just like the
Constitution - our 12 pounders couldn't penetrate except at close range
He passes the model to
(') Killick
Killick, there
enters
(') An extra ration of rum for these men, from my private store
(shaking his head) Which  was saving for Saluting Day, Sir
Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for Mr
and me
Let us live whilst we're alive
goes to get the bottles hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship, as though studying its tiny occupants
(') He's vulnerable here
He taps the stern windows
(') Cross her stern, rake her with a broadside through her length
But how to get close enough
Past those long eighteens
That's the devil of it
136b The Surprise has stopped level with a Spanish merchantman, which lies three hundred yards away, headed in the opposite direction
The two boats have hove to and are communicating by megaphone, Stephen translating the Spanish captains words, He says they were chased for three days till they finally our-ran her
Forty gun French privateer headed due south
Capital
Thank him and let us be off
The Spanish captain, already making sail, waves and shouts a greeting, which Stephen calls back to him
(') What did he say there
Spanish farewell
"May no new thing arrive
" New things being generally by their nature bad
137
'  - Stephen is with Blakeney, re-bandaging the younger man's stump
Blakeney looks away, his eyes moving over the doctors collection of books, learned texts in French Spanish, Greek and Latin Do you have a manual of exercises sir
Exercises
Physical exercises, to make the left arm as powerful as the right once was
think that will happen with usage, at least to a certain extent
But not completely
will never be whole again, will
No but you will adapt to your new situation The natural world shows us any number of examples of how that is possible
Blakeney bites his lip You know my father was a great fighting captain
It was always his expectation would follow in his footsteps
worry that with this arm  will now be good for nothing but book learning and philosophy
Ah
Like me you mean
(becoming tearful) cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot or climb the rigging
Cannot even dress myself
What chance to  have now of even making first lieutenant
You have every chance
You hear me every chance
Only the other day  heard the captain singing your praises
Your courage, your fortitude in battle, your skill at logarithms and double elevations whatever they may be
And when you are rated lieutenant you shall have someone to tie your bootlaces for you
Aye and help you with your jacket
Here take my handkerchief
believe we are summonsed to dinner
139
- The maintop captain, , shouts to the deck, his breath forming in the frosty air - Sail on the larboard bow
140
/ throwing on a heavy boat-cloak, running for the ladder, behind him trying to get a scarf about 's neck and a cap on his head
141
- Follow  as he runs up the ratlines, over the futtock shrouds, then up the topmast shrouds, finally arriving at the very top of the mast, to join  and
Where away
Hull down, two points off the larboard beam
takes the telescope
142
Just the tips of masts, the hull below the horizon
(
) She's a frigate all right, but no way of knowing if she be the phantom
Beyond the distant ship, a line of black clouds
143
- and  slide to the deck on parallel back-stays, as careless as a couple of midshipmen
144
- shouting - Set studdingsails and top gallants
Then wet the sails and have the idlers placed along the rail
and  bark out their orders
Men race to obey
steps up on the gunwale, spying out the distant ship
, nearby, rests his telescope on 's shoulder, focussing with his left hand
Is it him, Sir
Touch wood, Mr
Blakeney
And  fancy she plans to out-run us
Ask Dr
Maturin to join us, he loves a good chase
goes below
Above, the topmen release more sail which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables
Those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale, like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance the pull of the sails
145
- - Their speed is so great green seas are now sweeping the forecastle
man falls and rolls into the scuppers
Lifelines fore and aft
Speed, Mr
Calamy
heaves the lead and reads the log line, then shouts back to  - Twelve knots, Sir
146
- Heeled over under a great press of sail, her copper showing as she clefts the waves
147
- Lined up along the starboard rails, the crew look back at their captain riding the ship like a charioteer, one eye aloft on the creaking topmost spar
We're cracking on, eh
We'll be cracking off presently if he doesn't watch it
No, he knows this ship
He knows what she can take
He touches wood, just the same and looks at Joe Plaice who gives a meaningful roll of his eyes
Ahead, the bank of storm clouds loom gunmetal grey
148
- knocks and enters, with an anxious looking
, with whom he has been arguing a point
We can just see her topsails
She's made her turn westwards
can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not round Cape Horn
'll not lose her now
Set a course westwards
Both men accept this and leave
149
() - The wind has increased considerably, the deck sloping like the roof of a house, the masts bending like coach-whips
and  are looking up at the mizzenmast which is making ominous creaks and groans
Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays
Warps and light hawsers to the mastheads
stares ahead to the darkening sky as they move across a switchback landscape of massive rolling waves
(') Better get below, Mr
Pullings
What, Sir
() Better get some food in you
Before it turns nasty
150
- Wide to see the two ships
The Surprise and the Acheron with a mile of sea between them
It's like some great ocean race, with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling conditions
151
- , They are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying motion
The forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from her scuppers
comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk
wild unruly part of him is loving this
Above him, more top-men struggle up the rigging, with the mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky
152 The dog watch are wolfing their food, mugs and dinner plates sliding over the table
Crewmen walk up hill to the grog barrel, down their ration and head up top again
You reckon Captain will keep chasing him 'round the Horn with every stitch of canvas flying
reckon he'd chase him to the gates of hell if he has to
And that's where we're all going if he doesn't take in sail
Since his injury, Joe Plaice's startlingly random pronouncements have acquired the quality of an oracle
153 The wind rising from yell to shriek
Waves blown flat by it, the ship travelling at a drunken sideways angle across a raging expanse of white foam
Four men on the wheel, lashed to it, with the air around them full of water
In the distance a tower of black rock on the rim of the sea, distant rollers breaking against it and surging up to a preposterous height
looks up at the great press of canvas as he paces the quarterdeck, the officers glancing from the sails back to Strike the topgallants
Men gratefully rush to the ratlines and begin climbing to the masts
staggers up onto deck
calls to him, pointing at the black rock
(') Cape Horn, Doctor
stares across at the legendary Cape
He's struggling with his pocket-glass when a lurch of the ship sends him tumbling
As men help him below, , the maintop captain reports to the bosun
(to ) Help them with that mizzen topgallant
You go too, Mr
Hollom
looks desperate as he follows  up the ratlines of the mizzen
154
TOPgallant works frantically
He's out on the yardarm high above the raging sea
He shouts for  to join him, but is still in the top, some twenty feet below, unable or unwilling to climb any higher
155
- Wide to see the ship
working on the swaying mizzen
The bow swinging a couple of points further south
156
- Wood and rope straining as they wrestle to turn
Then a tremendous crack as the mizzen-topmast splits and flies backward into the sea, carrying  along with it
Man overboard
Sail and cordage falling over the men at the wheel
loose block and tackle swinging murderously in the gale
fights free from the tangle of ropes as  vanishes in the foam
The mizzenmast is acting as a sea-anchor dragging the ship's head northwards toward the black rocks
grabs a speaking-trumpet as  briefly reappears
Swim for the wreckage, man
Then to
(') Reduce sail
As crewmen scramble frantically into the rigging,  turns back to see  desperately swimming toward the trailing wreckage, his mates shouting encouragement over the howling wind
With sails reduced the ship perceptibly slows, but the dragging wreckage is swinging the ship broadside on to the waves
She's broaching
runs to , pointing to the trailing mass of ropes and mast
It's acting as a sea-anchor
We must cut it loose, Sir
still struggling to reach the wreckage but going under with each wave
, agonized, makes his decision
Axes
scrambles up the ladder with an axe, but loses his footing and falls sprawling over the quarterdeck
grabs the axe and attacks the ropes
He's joined by who has run to assist before realizing that the man overboard is his friend Warley
(') Set to then
Set to
's face is a mask of horror, but he obeys Jacks orders and starts chopping
He and Jack work shoulder to shoulder, matching blow for blow [   ] The prow keeps turning, wave after wave coming at right angles to the ship
157
- - hatch cover is torn off by the force of water, a sudden mighty deluge pouring down into the lower levels drenching the men and swamping the guns
(yells below) All hands to the pumps
158
- and  [   ] keep hacking at the tangle of ropes
Knocking chips off the railing in their urgency to cut free the dragging mast
Finally they succeed
The last of the ropes [ ] whips away, the broken mizzen disappears aft and the ship swings southward, away from the rocks
The wreckage is swept away by the next wave, leaving struggling, his last chance of getting back to the ship gone
Then another wave breaks over him and he is gone
is bereft
lowers his head
159
- and
He's been at it again
Who's that then
The Jonah
What Jonah
160
- sits at his desk
The model of the Acheron that helped make sits accusingly in front of him
pours him a glass on wine, and one for himself
The deaths in actual battle are the easiest
(beat) For my own part - those who die under the knife or from some consequent infection: have to remind myself that it is the enemy who killed them, and not me
(beat) Warley was a casualty of war, as surely as if a French ball had taken him
nods
Obviously the death still weighs on his conscience
[ ] (') (offering the wine) At the same time
He breaks off Jack At the same time, what
Stephen hesitates, aware that he has to proceed carefully You know that  wear two hats on every voyage
am the captains particular friend and supporter, but also  am the ships doctor in which later capacity  am party to
He catches a steely glint in Jacks eye and breaks off
(') You don't want me to continue
(stiffly) On the contrary
insist on it
There is talk below decks of turning back
Or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago
Of course the men would follow "Lucky Jack" anywhere, and usually in the confident expectation of victory
But that of course is the problem
What is the problem
That you are not accustomed to defeat Jack
That you have taken it too personally
That chasing this larger, faster ship, with its long guns, is beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth before destruction'
It's not pride nor anything like it, it's a question of duty
'Duty', ah yes
The naval signal for end of discussion
You can be as 'satiric' as you like, Stephen, but  have my orders
She is attacking our whalers
For why
Without whales we have no boot polish, nor any soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil our sabres and muskets
Destroying our whalers could win the war for Napoleon
Which is why we must catch this Acheron
As a man of learning surely you can see that
At whatever the cost
Any whatever cost  choose to pay
And will calculate that myself, Stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room
160A - An icy wind whips at the men working on the temporary mizzen mast
Hollom, half way up the rigging is relaying instructions between the men in the rigging and the men on deck Cast off
The new yard flails around on its pulley, bashing dangerously against the mast
Almost claiming Nagel (') Belay
Sorry
Sorry
161 craning upwards
The topmen's shouted commands are whipped away by the gale
joins him, still smarting from the conversation with Stephen We'll have to go further south, get around this bloody west wind
How far south
As far as is necessary, Mr
Pullings
The sixtieth parallel if need be
162
- Tacking southwards
The sun, a pale anaemic disc, gradually disappearing behind layers of cloud
The wind is a constant shrill whistle through the rigging, a sound like some infernal drill which rises and falls but never ceases
- 163
- The sun rising in a clear sky which turns a sapphire blue
White ice-islands lie all around them, some a pure, rosy pink
Others bright ultramarine
And still the wind howls, driving them further south
passes his telescope to
As studies some seals on an ice-beach,  launches into verse, shouting against the wind - Then we upon the globes last verge shall go to view the ocean leaning on the sky from thence our rolling neighbours we shall know and on the hidden world securely pry
He is interrupted by a bundle of guns clattering on board from one of the small boats
They are followed by Mr Howard clad in several thicknesses of sealskin and carrying a brace of dead penguin
164 The ship scudding onwards, soundless at this distance, but for the chilling high pitched whistle of the wind
An iceberg passes in foreground, fantastic shapes of ice, like a Gothic cathedral, sculpted by the elements
165
- Hanging stoves provide some feeble warmth
Men huddle close to them, their breath condensing, or lie shivering in their bunks, unable to sleep for the cold
appears with a lantern
Rise and shine
Show a leg there, tumble up, tumble up - sleepers awake
As the previous watch arrive downstairs, numb and dazed from the cold, the next watch emerge from their hammocks and dress
No-one speaks
166
- The officers take their places at dinner
Once again it's penguin stew
comes in, with an unexpected smile on his face and whispers something to
Praise be
At last
The others seem to know what's going on, all except who looks baffled
Pray what is there to celebrate
holds up his hand for silence
series of creaks and groans from the ship
The coffee pot tilts on its gimbals
We have made our turn northward, Doctor
We are headed back toward the sun
The officers give a slightly ragged cheer
(') in anticipation of which
asked Killick to prepare something special
(shouts off) Killick
Killick there
comes in with his usual exasperated expression, bearing a tray with a silver tureen lid on it
Which  was just coming
He lays it on the table
Gentlemen,  give you
our destination
He whips off the lid to reveal a strange glutinous mass, a pudding cut in the oddest of shapes
Everyone stands to get a better look
The Galapagos Islands
'Pon my word so it is
Look: here's Narborough, Chatham and Hood
That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr Allen
So that's where the Acheron will be headed
The mood is now taken over by the glee of recognition, as the officers marvel over the pudding
(') Mr
Pullings, if you'll permit me, a slice of Albermale
For you Doctor, Redondo Rock
There's a tiny man-of-war made of icing, between the islands

(') And, with a fair wind behind us the Acheron for me
167
,  - Slow pan over a glassy expanse of water
's head suddenly breaks the surface, close to camera
As he swims he brings the Surprise into view
The ship is utterly becalmed, wallowing in the swell, her sails hanging limp
'painted ship upon a painted ocean'
swims around the ship, which currently presents a less than warlike picture with washing hanging from every part of the rigging
He calls up to  - Best bowers chipped
Lot of rust on these forechains
black strake needs another coat

The men are holystoning the deck and polishing the brightwork

Stephen
Will we never make a sailor of you
The doldrums is a condition, not a region
But you tend to strike 'em here
(pointing) between the trades, and the sou'easterlies
hope the Acheron is having it as bad as we are
considers their current position on the chart, the tiny Galapagos Islands to the north and the vast emptiness to the west of them
Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos, and not some other point in all this vastness
Come
'd have thought you'd be delighted to go there
It is said to be a natural paradise In truth 'd be delighted with the merest guano stained rock provided it didn't sway beneath my feet Well, we'll take on food and water once we're there, and as compensation for not having put ashore in Brazil  pledge that during that time, several days at least, you can wander at will, catching bugs and beetles to your heart's delight
You will be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands
That is my solemn promise accept, provided the men have not mutinied and thrown us all overboard before we get there
Mutiny
No
They are already counting their share of the prize money
Another week of this and they shall gladly give it up for a glass of clean water
Ach, Stephen
Stephen
Pray stop your bellyacheing
We shall have rain presently, and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this

As struggles to decipher it there's the sound of a musket shot and a seabird falls out of the sky
, the captain of marines, reloads his smoking musket laughing aloud
Is that man completely mad
(shouts down) Mr
Howard, a petrel is not good eating
looks up towards them, a broad smile on his red moon of a face
Were you never a man for sporting, Doctor
Why you could shoot all day in these waters with two men loading

- - The midshipmen and powder-monkeys have assembled for weapons practise, armed with cutlasses
and  divide the group into two teams, choosing sides as for school-yard football
Blakeney

It's tails
We attack

From here they are suddenly aware of Jack idly watching their mock-fight from the quarter-deck 's team give a yell and charge at them
It's serious fighting
Heads are struck, fingers are rapped
, trying gamely with his left arm but frustrated by his own ineptitude, goes down under the rush of attackers
Ow ow ow
Yield
Let go of him
Yield

He whips a pistol out of his belt and fires it at 's head

The other boys separate, horrified
It's just powder
There wasn't a ball in it, just powder
He helps  to his feet
(') Are you all right
No
Angrily shaking free of him, he looks to where Jack stood, but the captain is no longer watching
What's wrong
saved you
didn't need to be saved
179
- Tar bubbling under the heat of the sun
Cannons fizzing and steaming as they are washed
There's been a change of crews in the long-boats, and and his men are now back on board

Pullings, defaulters at six bells

From outside the sounds of the muster
stands in front of him, twisting his hat between his hands
The man pushed past you without making his obedience
And yet you said nothing
No, Sir,  intended to but the right words just didn't
'The right words'
He failed to salute you
It's deliberate insubordination

Speak up, man

Always whispering when go past, giving me looks
But, 'll set that to rights, be tougher on them from now on
You can't make 'friends' with the foremast jacks, they'll despise you in the end
Nor do you need be a tyrant
It's leadership they want, strength, respect

You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice
You can't spend the rest of your life as a midshipman

Well, it's an unfortunate business, Hollom
Damned unfortunate
seems to endorse this by placing the captain's hat emphatically on 's head
Jack turns and strides out of the cabin,  following slowly after him

,  - The entire crew has been mustered
The uniformed officers line the quarterdeck as  reads from the Articles of War
'Article Thirty-Six
All other crimes not capital, committed by any person or persons in the fleet
shall be punished according to the laws, and customs, of the sea
' (then, to ) Mr
Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man and yet you failed to salute an officer
You knew what you were doing

No matter how much he turns the peg the top string always sounds flat
He tunes some more and breaks it
Red hell

Every word is plainly audible to the men on watch, who pretend to hear nothing

Widen to reveal  sitting opposite with his cello

am not a "flogging captain"

Besides,  wager you will find a deal more brutality on land
Tightening the new string
The note escalating as he turns
'm not a party to it on land
Well you are party to it on my ship
Men must be governed
Often not wisely grant you, but there are hierarchies even in nature, as you've often said yourself
Hierarchies
That is the excuse of every tyrant in history
Of Nero
Of Boneparte
(trying to call a halt) Yes
Fine words 'm sure (continues regardless) We are not animals and  for one am opposed to authority, that egg of misery and oppression
Very fine words Stephen, but In these current circumstances, hard-work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together
And grog  suppose
Of course
What of it
Of course they have their grog
(sits) (') You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted Hollom
And Higgins is never sober
Even the midshipmen
The men will have their grog Stephen
It is part of the immemorial tradition of the service Well a shameful tradition it is too
To have them pressed from their homes, kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation
Stephen
confined for months in a wooden prison, Never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to
(forcefully) Stephen
warn you that friend or no will not have you talk of the service like that
am stating plain facts (finally explodes) Well  will not hear them
From you or anyone
You understand
Things are as they are for good or bad whether or not they have a place in your damned papist philosophy
If you are here to make music then sit down and play
If not be gone, for you have come to the wrong shop for anarchy
In stony silence Stephen puts down his cello bow and leaves past Killick, who is lurking as always by the door
186
- Something disturbs the dark surface of the water as dips the ladle and fills his cup
sense of someone moving up behind him
turns abruptly
It's the marine sentry, moving in the shadows
He stares at  as he backs away toward the ladder and hurries below
187
- To reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the berth deck, past  obsessively cleaning his pistol, another man whittling with a knife,  adding another link in the tattooed chain about 's middle
No-one speaks as  runs the gauntlet of their stares, acutely aware of his own breathing
It now seems universally to be held that he is the author of all the ship's misfortune
Nagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging gleaming wetly in the lamplight Hollom's breath quickens
He stumbles on someone's dunnage, almost trips but is caught before he falls
It's one of 's mates
's Careful, sir
188
'  - comes in, wild-eyed and goes to his berth, breathing hard
,  &  look up from a tense game of cards
Are you all right, Hollom
shakes his head miserably, hyperventilating
He's not sick
He's useless
He's just dodging work
(angrily) Oh shut up Calamay
What do you know about anything

189
'  - shot from the deck above
looks up from his book "Di Consolazione Philosophae"
Then the sound of bare feet approaching, followed by a knock at the door
Its Joe Plaice, looking agitated
Beg your pardon, your honour, but Mr
Howard just shot a sea-monster
190
- and  stride along to where the marine captain, , peers down into the water with one of his men
Doctor
The very man
moves to the rail, looks out
(') [   ]  wished you'd seen it for yourself, Doctor
The crew never seen anything like it
On the glassy sea, a smudge of blood and some ripples (') It was prodigious like a human, though bigger, might have been a sea-elephant, it had a calf with it -  didn't mean to hit the calf,  missed my mark
Mr
Howard, let me beg you, if the men can't eat it or  can't dissect it, please do not shoot every creature you see
stares back down at the ripples spreading over the glassy sea
191
- Wide, on the troubled ship, small yellow patches of light visible from the gun-ports
192
- The men are lying in their hammocks when, from somewhere outside, there comes an ungodly howling
It stops, then comes again, exactly human in its pitch
The crew look at one another
This is like no sound they've ever heard
The howling stops then comes again, from another direction
193
,  - and   listening
What did  tell you
The ship's accursed
194
- comes up from below
What is that abominable noise, for God's sake
have no idea, Sir
You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir
(untypically cutting) The enemy cannot come on us without a wind, Mr
Mowett
He looks about at the terrified faces of the crew
The wailing sound now rises to a shriek, as  joins the group
(') What do you make of it, Doctor
'm sure 've never heard the like
The crew overhear this and pass it among themselves as another anguished howl fills the night
(') Perhaps it's the mother of the creature Mr
Howard shot
[    ] Creature
[ ]  manatee
sea-elephant possibly
Though  have never known one with a cry like this
glance along at  on the gangway, as terrified as anyone
Bosun
Fire off some flares
195
- Three flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow, making a pool of blue light around the ship, the sound continuing to echo and re-echo from somewhere beyond
196
- The light illuminates the half-hour glass, its top-half empty of sand
Like everyone else, the duty sergeant stands frozen to the spot
Jack rounds on him
Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking of
Turn the glass and strike the bell
Roused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes its flow
Two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear
And when the sound comes once more they all freeze
joins  at the taffrail
The thing is somewhere out there, whatever it is
Perhaps some poor shipwreck
He shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice
(') Ahoy
Is anyone there
Part of him knows it's crazy and of course there's no reply
The sound constantly shifting position, now in the water, now in the sky
turns to see a white face, frighteningly close to his own
It's , mouth agape, face unnaturally white, staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror lies out there
Padeen
What are you doing on the quarterdeck
He looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the bottom of the ladder, some with weapons
(') Below
All of you men below

- Several crewmen huddle close together their faces lit by a battle-lantern
Joe Plaice grim
Doudle wide-eyed
Higgins with his alcoholic tremor more pronounced than ever
Duppies make that noise
(indicating ) See
They know all about this in Africa
What's a duppie
That Warley
Swallow by a fish
Spirit can't get out
Him duppie now
Captain don't even know what that noise be
General nods of agreement
Doctor neither, and he knows everything
Joe here's got the most experience in these matters, and new brains to boot, let's hear it from Joe
All eyes on
He speaks from the shadows
It's the Jonah causing it
That howling thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship
He's calling it up, don't you see
Every time he's on watch the ship appears
You wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear any time tonight, and take us all straight to the hot-place
Another shriek, closer now, seems to confirm 's bizarre theory
198
'  - The boys sit together
None of them look at , who sits pale and wretched in a corner of the room, clutching his stomach
199
'  - As the howling continues,  looks through a number of books on sea-creatures searching for a reference to what they're experiencing
As  looks over his shoulder, his eye is caught by a picture in one of 's books
He picks it up
Close on the picture - it's an engraving of a giant squid, its tentacles wrapped around a ship
Back on  holding the picture up to
You don't think
There is a knock on the cabin door and  enters, agitated
(to ) It's Mr
Hollom, sir, you better come quick

Mr Hollom

Stephen is writing some case notes in his journal, when Jack puts his head around the door
Stephens : The lamp, lighting his face from below and to one side, gives a strange lopsided twist to Jacks smile Well
There's nothing physically wrong with him
He thinks he's been cursed by the 0men
Then he probably has been
Sailors will abide a great deal, but never a Jonah
It's like a white crow - the others peck it to death
'Jonah'
My God, you believe it too

No doubt it will all be sorted by the morning

nearly jumps out of his skin
Mr
Hollom
You gave me such a start
Are you better now
's breathing does indeed seem easier
Much better, thank you
think the creature is going away
am sure of it
He reaches down, picks up a 12 pound cannonball
(') You've always been very kind to me
Goodbye, Blakeney
With a sudden movement he's on the gunwale, then he jumps over the side the cannonball in his arms
looks down with shock to see 's pale face receding from him into the depths
It's a moment before he gathers his wits to shout - Man overboard
203
- The ship's company are mustered on deck
stands at the sword rack lectern
hands him a Bible open at the story of Jonah
looks, then hands it back to
The fact is, [   ] not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be
But we are all God's creatures
If some of us thought ill of Mr
Hollom, or spoke ill of him, or failed him in respect of fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness, Lord, and we ask for his
Close on the faces of the crew - , , , ,  and finally Stephen who is staring oddly at Jack, as though holding him partly responsible for this latest tragedy
(') Amen
(mumble ashamedly) Amen
The men on deck remain standing, heads bowed, observing a minute's silence, as the sky begins to pale, and the white disc of the sun appears above them

204 The sand runs out of the half-hour glass
Strike eight bells
(to the marine sentry) Turn the glass and strike the bell
The glass is inverted
The bell tolls

Men rig a sail to catch the water, others appear with barrels and tubs, anything to catch the precious rain

) Land-ho

- runs along the gangway, past , en route to the quarterdeck
Give you joy, sir
We have raised the Galapagos
208
oF  ,  - There's a primeval quality to the landscape, a feeling of a world just born
The wild creatures that inhabit the lava flows and coral beaches confirm this - the giant tortoises, iguanas, sea-lions and penguins, a teeming profusion of exotic animals and plants
209
// - The ship fairly bristles with telescopes
210 small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope

Just lots of ducks and lizards

Wot
There must be wimmun
'ain't natural
211 and  side by side
From both their faces we sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for the first time
How extraordinary
What, sir
Those birds
He's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings

But apparently flightless, by all that's Holy

The dragons don't seem to bother 'em
They are a type of iguana  should think, and therefore vegetarian
His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants
is wholly absorbed in the iguanas
Will you catch one
Yes
Most certainly
And if we can, some eggs
mean the great lizards
Oh
Recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to 's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards
(') should think a pair of them
Then you can present one of their offspring to the king
Ha
There's one going for a swim
No
Iguanas are land animals
Not these ones
The prehistoric-looking creatures, as if suddenly awakened, begin diving into the water
(
) By Jove Bonden you are right
Two new species in as many minutes
He breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between the lookout and the quarterdeck
(') What is all that confounded bellowing
All hands about ship
dashes off and  is elbowed out of the way by hands rushing to get at the sails
By your leave sir, by your leave
(distant) Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets - mainsail haul
As the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men aboard, pulling out from one of the neighboring islands
212
'  (-) - The whaleboat has come alongside
Men swarm down the boarding nets and the whalers are helped aboard, hoarse and exhausted from rowing and shouting
God bless you
Thank you, shipmates

- , , the senior whaler, sits with his mates, relating his story to  and the officers
We was coming back for fresh lines, hid in that inlet, yonder
Black-three master
Bit beamy and raised in the stern
Meaningful looks among Jack and his men
Its definitely the Acheron he's describing [   ] Hogg meanwhile takes a pint mug of water, gulps it down, and passes it back to  for a refill
(') Hundred thousand pound of good whale oil they stole
Then the bastards
(cuffs him) No swearing on the quarterdeck

Then they burnt our bloody ship and headed off, bunch of fugging pirates
Looking pointedly at Allen [      ] And her course
Maybe a point south of west
Following the rest of the whaling fleet

Mowett, these men to be entered on the ship's books
Mr
Allen, lay a course west sou'west
As  hurries away shouting orders - Should we not take on fresh supplies, Sir
Those tortoises

Pullings
He leaves the quarterdeck and goes below,  following

hurries in
Have you forgotten your promise
(not looking up) Subject to the requirements of the service, Stephen
could not in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguano or a
giant peccary - interesting no doubt, but of no immediate application
(overlap) How can you dismiss, out of hand, the bounty of nature
Knowledge that
that will help to progress

(overlap) But how can we possibly know what lies [ ] on these islands, perhaps some knowledge that may save life, that
(overlap) will tell you how to save lives Stephen
Inform me how to guide this ship, undetected, under the nose of a 40 gun frigate
That is the job in hand sir
swallows his indignation and tries for a compromise
Well perhaps there's an opportunity to serve both our objectives
As understand it you mean to go round the end of this long island, then start your voyage

shakes his head
(') would walk briskly, pausing only for important measurements and almost certainly making valuable discoveries
(interrupts) If wind and tide had been against us should have said yes
They are not and am obliged to say no
(with finality) No
is livid
Betrayed

So after all this time in your service  must simply be content to form part of this belligerent expedition, hurry past inestimable wonders, bent solely on destruction
you forget yourself, sir
No Jack, You have forgotten your self
You once believed in the rights of each individual man no matter how useless or lowly
But it seems to me now that the long exercise of power has brought you to the point where even a solemn promise
The promise was conditional
a promise to a friend of ten years standing who has stood by you and supported you
(overlapping) command a King's ship, not a private yacht
across half the worlds oceans often at risk to his own life and we have no time for your damned hobbies, sir
"Hobbies"
So that is 's honest view of 's lifetime of work in science
He bows slightly, then leaves
215          - stands alone at the taffrail watching as the islands recede in the distance
News of the violent argument has spread and there is many a sympathetic glance, which further humiliates
approaches him carrying something carefully in the palm of his hand
Sir,  found a curious beetle walking on the deck
He opens his hand - close, on a very plain little brown beetle
(') think it's a Galapagos Beetle, sir
'm sure of it
Were you to have walked all day on the island, you might never have come across it
That is more than likely, sure
passes it to
You can have it
Thank you, Mr
Blakeney
hovers for a moment, unsure of further conversation, then retreats

No music
That's a shame He sets down the toasted cheese

Yes, Killick
Just the one

Others gather round, including  the whaler, inspecting the stencilled markings
Martha's vineyard
No, this here's from Boston

Any road, it's a Yankee barrel
What they call a Bedford Hog in New England
(to ) The Acheron touched at Boston
And it's not been in the water more than a week
One can't say with any accuracy but
Yes you can
There's no sea chummer on it, and the dowels is sound
221
- returns to his post
Continue due west, Mr
Bonden
watches him
There has been a change amongst the officers and crew toward
His relentless driving after the Acheron has reached the point of obsession, an obsession not shared by his exhausted men
He is a lonely, haunted figure as he now steps up on the gunwale, one hand on the ratlines, scanning the empty sea, sensing his enemy is out there, just beyond the curve of the earth
- 222
( ) - wild wind humming through the rigging as  goes topside
223
- He finds various hands making the boats secure
Have you seen the bird, doctor
have not - no bird these many days
What kind of a bird
sort of albatross  believe, or perhaps a prodigious great mew
He has been following the ship since
there he is, crossing our wake
224
- runs along the gangway to get a clearer view, checking himself when he sees  on the quarterdeck
Their eyes meet
The quarterdeck is 's domain now, and avoids it
Then, behind , the great bird suddenly appears
It's huge, with at least a fourteen foot wing-span, and flying very close to the ship, drifting and soaring on the gusting wind, appearing and disappearing between the sails
is mesmerized by it
He lets go of the rail, leaning forward to get a better view
At the same time across from  on the opposite gangway, and two or three marines open fire on the bird
The bird drops low, flying right by
Again a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently uninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the water
sags to the deck
shout
People running
Blood spreading across the white of his shirt
there by his side
My God, man
'm so sorry
The bird dropped low
didn't see you there
is there, shouting - Calamy
Get Higgins
(then turning to ) Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below
gets slowly up, hands reaching to help him,  in the background distraught, explaining to anyone who'll listen what happened
It's all right,  am quite capable of walking
He tries to stand, crumples

's  - presses clumsily around the wound as  lies on the bed, his abdomen rigid, his breathing laboured watches from the door
You will just make it worse
by prodding, Mr
Higgins, it cannot be got at
except by opening me up
violent pitching of the ship makes it obvious how impossible this will be under sail
As  lapses into unconsciousness,  looking alarmed, approaches
(a whisper) The bullet took a piece of shirt in with it
Unless it is removed it will suppurate and fester
Are you equal to the task
'll need to read up on the Doctor's books, like
Study some pictures he has, get my bearings
Be better on land, but 'll manage somehow
looks away from the alcoholic  back to

You men get about your business
There are dark looks in 's direction as he retreats to his cabin
227
- throws a chart on the table
With his protractor he marches out great strides west into the Pacific from the Galapagos Islands and marks the ship's position - they are maybe a hundred miles from the Galapagos, ahead, open sea until the Marquesas
228
'  - Lying on his bed, in some pain,  hears thudding feet, shouted orders
In his weakened state, the sounds tend to merge
His pitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus
There's a knock on the door and   appears with a mug of soup and some biscuit
sail on the horizon, sir
Hull down, running west
It may be a couple of days before we can catch her
nods, all he wants is quiet
retreats, as  swigs from a little bottle of laudanum, which for a moment brings peace, effectively blocking out the noise from above
smile to , like a farewell, and he closes his eyes
229

It might be the Acheron
If we put on more sail we'd come up with her before nightfall

Can we move you onto a stretcher

- giant iguana watches as a small procession trudges up the stony beach
At its head,  is carried in a litter up to where a tent has been set up above the high-water mark
His
as  appears in the blue sky above him
Tell me this wasn't on my account
(dead pan) No
It was because of Higgins
(beat) Can't have him poking around in your belly without a solid platform to work on
He ducks as they enter - 232
- In the creamy light, they lay  down on a recently- constructed wooden operating table
squats on the ground, rummaging through various large sharp surgical instruments which he has emptied onto a piece of Hessian
All set, Higgins
grabs 's sleeve
Not Higgins
do this with my own hand
Jack frowns, unsure what he means by this
- stands, arms crossed at the closed tent-flap, keeping at bay a crowd of well-wishers, and the merely curious
- sits pale and sweaty, propped up on a series of chests, his back against a coil of rope
In front of him, suspended by pulleys,  and  have set up a large gilt-framed mirror
Beside him, on a white tablecloth, some small scissors and scalpels
(To Jack) [ ] You are sure you have a head and a stomach for this kind of thing
(smiles) My dear Doctor,  have seen blood and wounds since  was a little boy
Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when give the word
begins first with the knife, then the probe - the grind of metal on living bone
(') You will have to raise the rib, Higgins
Take a good grip with the square retractor
Up
Harder, harder
(to himself) Snip the cartilage
The metallic clash of instruments, perpetual swabbing
(') Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure
Good
Keep it so
Give me the davier
Swab, Higgins
Press, Jack, press
closes his eyes
draws in his breath, arches his back, and it's done
(') There she is
He pulls out the bullet, and with it, a fragment of his shirt
(') Is that all of it
The bloody piece of shirt is handed to  who matches it to the hole in 's old shirt
Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir
Easy away, Jack
Handsomely with the retractor
Higgins, look to the Captain, while  swab
helps  into a chair, pressing his head down between his knees
After a moment, and a few deep breaths, looks up
smiles at him
hint of surly triumph
- 235
'  - Through a gap in the door of his tent  can see the distant ship at anchor
Repairs are underway, guns being unloaded, stores and fresh water being ferried aboard
comes in, followed by  with a some numbered boxes hung round his neck
My goodness, what is this
starts rolling up the sides of the tent as unloads his boxes, each with a beetle and a piece of vegetation in it
Well sir, Padeen and  have been doing some collecting for you
The beetles each come with a specimen of plant they were found on
Ooops
Catch him, Padeen
There he goes
He finishes rolling up the tent sides to reveal a collection of cages, with native wildfowl in them, being fed by the poulterer,
(') The birds were snared by Jemmy Ducks
Captain says we can keep them in the chicken coop
Then, producing a notebook - (') And  made a few notes if you want to see them
flips the pages: No 22
Large square black beetle with pincers
Found under rock
Eats earthworms
'Pon my word you have the makings of a true naturalist
is flattered but unsure
Well sir, perhaps  could combine them, and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist, like yourself
[   ] Stephen smiles at this description as he levers himself into a sitting position
Shall we take a tour of your aviary
looks doubtfully at the doctor's bandaged abdomen
Should you really be up
Yes
Padeen
puts the escaped beetle in his mouth for safe keeping and offers  a hand
pulls himself painfully to his feet and starts buttoning his shirt
(') (To Blakeney) How long does the Captain intend that we stay here, do you know
- is watching those of the crew not on duty play cricket on the shore, with a canvas ball and stumps made of driftwood
Oh, a week perhaps
There is no great hurry
But surely, we must make haste for the Marquesas
It may not have been the Acheron that we sighted
Nor can we be sure of her destination
(looks away) No,  think we shall go home now, before peace breaks out with France, God forbid
He's making light of what has been a huge and far-reaching decision
But how will it sit with the Admiralty
To have spent six months in a fruitless pursuit and then come home empty-handed
"Empty-handed"
Not a bit of it
What about these plants and animals which Blakeney has been collecting
The British museum will need an entire new wing for 'em
regards him gravely, shaking his head
fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a debt  can never repay
He is absolutely sincere about this, to 's great embarrassment
Tosh
Name a shrub after me
Something prickly and hard to eradicate
shrub
shall name a giant tortoise: Testudo Aubreii

- ,  and  leave the camp on 's first day of exploration
They are armed with nets, baskets and a day's supply of food and water
walks slightly stooped, leaning on a walking stick
238
- strange and wonderful landscape lies before them, with its organically-shaped lava flows and alien-looking flora and fauna
Everywhere  looks there are creatures unique to the islands
He is in his element, collecting specimens which carefully stores in the baskets
has his telescope trained on some distant humps
Doctor, would you think it very unscientific of me to ride on the back of one of those tortoises
No, Mr
Blakeney
would think it an experiment of absolutely vital importance
But afterwards,  do desire to find that flightless cormorant, assuming that is what it is, and that still have strength enough to catch it
239
- gets astride a giant tortoise and burns his bottom on its scorching hot shell
240
- with his telescope taking notes on bird-life
241
- The huge, strangely balletic figure of  chasing after a butterfly in evening light
242
- Wide to see another aspect of the countryside - a hint of distant sea, a rocky headland rising from the plain
The group is widely scattered
at the base of the headland,  half a mile further inland
coming up slowly behind, laden with the fruits of their expedition
243
- rests a moment
Some stones rattle down from the hillside
He looks up to see a flash of black feathers near the crest - the cormorant
On his shirt a red smudge has appeared
His wound has begun to bleed again
Ignoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry
244 Near the top,  pauses to catch his breath and glances above him
Again the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on
gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the crest just above him
245 clearing
There is movement in the bushes
slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and enters a clearing
He searches amongst the bushes
Nothing
He turns and looks back down the hillside to see  and far below, then sits to get his breath back again
'
: on the ground between his feet, a beetle
He picks it up
Close, on his hand
It is the same type of beetle gave him aboard the Surprise
Smiling at the coincidence  raises the tiny creature to eye level
His
: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape
The focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a bay
The beetle flies away as  stares out at the ship
It's the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor
246
- urging  to hurry as they make their way through the darkening landscape
All kinds of creatures are appearing around them, and every few yards  pauses to examine something
Sir, you must hurry
moment
You're a worse tyrant than any ship's captain
He's breathing hard, exhausted
You must carry him, Padeen
looks at the collection of baskets he carries
(') Leave them
We must get back to the ship
raises his hand in protest, but  is already divesting  of his load
247
- carrying  'piggy-back',  out ahead urging them on
247a variety of small bugs and animals crawling free 248      '  - gingerly lowers himself into his 'elbow-chair', gripping the table and 's good arm for support
Sighing, he begins emptying his pockets of various small items collected during the day - some leaves, rocks and insects - and places them in ordered piles around his microscope
All about them can be heard the urgent sounds of departure - the anchor rattling up, shouted orders and the drumming of bare feet on the deck above
He holds up a stick in a specimen-jar, and is examining it with his magnifying glass when  enters
forgot to ask you - did you see your bird
's eye grossly enlarged through the lens
did not
My greatest discovery was your phantom
Indeed it was, 'm sorry
(waving the magnifying glass) Not a bit of it
William and  made a unique discovery
Handing  the jar and magnifying glass
(') Tell him, Mr
Blakeney
(beaming) It's a rare phasmid, Sir
inspects the stick
It winks at him
phasmid
It's an insect disguised as a stick
stares at the creature
(') In order to confuse a predator
looks up at
249
,  - The Surprise alive with crewmen on the deck and in the rigging
Shouts and commands drift across the water as she turns and heads out from the bay
249a          - strides along the quarterdeck towards the forecastle issuing a stream of orders - Mr
Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint we have
want six men with brushes slung over the side
(moving on) Doudle
Yessir
hands him a piece of paper with a sketch on it
Get your sail makers working on this
Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet every seven feet
Aye, Sir
He shouts to  who, with a few men, is manhandling a large metal cauldron from the ballast to the gun-deck
(to ) Have Nagel patch it up and light a fire in it
(shouts) Mr
Calamy
Aye, Sir
Once we're underway, replace some of the sails with the oldest, most patched set we have
They'll be in the afterhold, Sir
'll need some men to move all the clutter
Good
Spread it around the foredeck
The more mess the better
249B
, The ship powers ahead as men swing in harnesses above the racing water, painting out the Nelson chequer
249C positions the great cauldron amidships as men come up from below with old barrels and bits of rope
Haul away
On the gangway, Men under 's instructions haul on ropes, pulling up the old patched sails
The sails lead us up to 250
- ,  and the whaler  scan the dark horizon
There, Sir
mainmast toplight
has to use a telescope
You've got good eyes, Hogg
Shouts down to the helm - (') Mr
Bonden, set a course west-south-west
(to ) We'll drop below the horizon and come up on the other side of him, let him think he's seen us first
251
- First light reveals the results of an overnight transformation - from a naval warship to a shambolic-looking Portuguese whaler
The gunwales are painted an untidy ochre and the gun-ports hidden behind broad strips of canvas
The sails are patched and ragged, the forecastle cluttered with barrels
Smoke billows from a cauldron amidships
On deck and in the rigging, there's a quarter of the normal complement of men, all of them dressed in purser's slops
252
- bemused  looks about him as he approaches
see
wolf in sheep in sheep's clothing phasmid, doctor
It was you what gave me the idea
'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator
No
Well this one is
253
- and his marines change out of their smart uniforms, into the oldest most ragged clothes on board the ship, much to the amusement of the passing sailors
Very fancy
Blue to match your eyes
Is there a skirt comes with it
254
- - Men are checking the breechings of the great guns and chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical, more deadly
The armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of sparks, a group of seamen round him relaying one another at the crank, stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes at their feet
Another team check and load pistols by the score
254
'  - Alone,  awkwardly draws his dirk, left-handed from its scabbard
It glints momentarily in the lamp-light
enters, face aglow, abruptly trying to cover his joy when he sees
[ ] It's all right
Permission to boast
You're to lead the boarders from the forecastle
Congratulations
Thank you
You'll make lieutenant out of this
The others come in
He already has
'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant Peter Calamy
Oohs and aahs from all
[       ] Then 'll see you at the forecastle, 'Lieutenant'
That's not your station
looks from  to the others, who avoid his eye
But naturally 'll board with you
'm sorry, Will
Captain's orders
is devastated
Rye bursts in, in a state of high excitement
She's seen us
256
- raises his glass, focuses on the Acheron, plainly visible in the distance, with a line of signal flags running up her backstay
She's asking us to heave to
Shall  give the order
No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but panicky and disorganized, like a whaler might do
Allen smiles at this unintended slight (') No offence, Mr
Hogg
257
- show of chaos on deck as the Surprise veers upwind, away from the Acheron
As she presents her stern we see her new name: Malacca
258
- Through his telescope,  looks back at the Acheron in pursuit, a dark figure on her foredeck
(to Mowett) Run up Portuguese colours
(then down to the gun-deck) Load, Mr
Pullings
Triple shot 'em
comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes, looking flushed and angry
May  speak with you, Sir
No saluting, Mr
Blakeney, we're whalers here
Mr
Calamy says  am not in the boarding party,  wanted to say - (interrupts) know what you want to say and my answer is no
promised your mother  would return you in one piece and  have already failed her on that score
You will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with Dr
Maturin
But sir - (cutting in) Go to your station, Mr
Blakeney
begins to salute, doesn't, and retires, tears burning his eyes
moment later there's a flash of orange astern as the Acheron opens up with her bow-chasers
An 18 pound shot screams past the side of the Surprise to land with a column of spray just off their bows
(') Good shooting
Remind me to press her bow gunner, Mr
Pullings
The second ball takes down some rigging
(') Start the water and throw some barrels overboard
He goes below
259
- Barrels go overboard and pumps spout streams of water over the side as  runs down to 260
- The great majority of men are gathered here, more than a hundred of them crammed together with their muskets and sabres, listening to the odd thump from topsides as another ball from the Acheron hits home
and his gang of young tykes are squashed in there somewhere, , ,  and the rest, eyes shining with nervousness and wild anticipation, as addresses his men, who shout encouragement, ad lib, in every pause
(plus the men ad lib) We're a long way from home
(Right you are, Captain
)  long way from anywhere, (Too true
) But if Britain rules the waves she rules these waves too
(Right she does
) And the blow we shall deal for his Majesty here will be felt just as keenly ('ll say it will) aye - and cheered just as loudly ('specially by the wimmin
) - as any dealt at Trafalgar or Cape St
Vincent
The camera moves over the upturned faces, , , , , the midshipmen, the powder-monkeys, the whole fellowship of the ship
And finally  watching doing what he does best: transmitting his own fearlessness into other men - the total warrior, the consummate leader
(') don't say it will be easy
She's twice the men we have and they'll sell their lives dearly
But every man here is worth three of Boney's privateers, and  know there's not a faint heart among you
pipes up - Three cheers for the Captain
(deafening) Huzzah huzzah huzzah
On , cheering like a kid at a football match as
261
- Another well-placed shot from the Acheron smashes through the rigging, sending down a shower of rope and cordage
is back at his station by the wheel, the Acheron little more than a half a mile astern, the figure of the captain in his black coat clearly visible
studies the looming black vessel, then turns and crosses to  at the helm
nods, lifting his hands from the wheel as  grips the curved timber decisively, taking the strain
He feels the pulse of the ship through his fingers, looks up to the sails then back to the Acheron
appears beside him, casually smoking a cigar
He offers one to Jack, who declines [   ] Another shot pierces the mizzen foresail above them, but neither man flinches
appears with two cups of coffee, and in his belt a brace of pistols
took the liberty, Doctor
[    ] Thank you, Killick
steers one-handed as he sips his coffee
Mr
Mowett
[  ]  poem might be in order
Another shot through the sails
poem, Sir
[   ] (after a moment's reflection) 'Oh were it mine with sacred Maro's art, To wake to sympathy the feeling heart, ball goes howling past the ship,  winces

We have her Mr
Mowett
Strike the Portuguese colours and run up the Jack

Pullings
Canvas off the gun-ports, and run 'em out

Howard
Marines away aloft
The British Jack rises to the masthead replacing the Portuguese colours, as  descends to the gun-deck
264
'  - The black muzzles appear with a low rumbling sound, as 265 , with a wink to , yells at the top of his voice Helm's a lee
and spins the wheel hard to starboard
266 Wide, to see her swinging broadside on, across the path of the oncoming Acheron
267 Confused shouts from the enemy's deck, chaos on her forecastle, somewhere a drum beating
268 + 269 270
- hands the wheel to
Run us down her larboard side then cut across her wake
(shouts down to the gun deck) Hold fire Mr Pullings
Hold till we're broadside on

272
/ -, Through a furious exchange of musket fire  runs down the ladder to the gun-deck- Fire as she bears
Every gun to concentrate on her mainmast
Through the gunports the Acheron's great hull becomes visible
Some of the Acheron's guns have run out, but the crews are unprepared and disorganized
On the uproll
Fire for the mainmast as you sight her
As the Surprise rolls and the upper deck of the Acheron becomes visible
273 Barking, leaping back one by one, great tongues of flame spitting from their barrels, dense clouds of smoke rising
274 With an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls, dragging yards and rigging with it, the whole mass falling over their side, obscuring many of their gun-ports
275
/,  - Cheers from the crew
Jack yelling up the companionway Now Mr Bonden
Hard a'starboard
276 The Acheron wallows, bought to a standstill by the enormous dragging weight of their mainmast
wheels the ship across the enemy's wake, past the exposed, vulnerable stern
277 277A
, Fire at will
278
-, In random sequence the Surprise's gunners pound it into the Acheron's stern
Casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood and glass, exposing the Acheron's terrified gun-crews, now open to devastating fire as the Surprise glides past
279 climbs up on the gunwales, shouting to  - Lay me alongside
280 The bow of the Surprise lurches into the Acheron mid-ships, spars interlocking, the Surprise guns firing into her at point-blank range
The crew throw grappling hooks
281 Boarders away
And he leaps to the enemy deck, a great tide of men following after him
282 leads his own children's crusade from the bows and forecastle: youthful but terrifying, screaming and swinging their blades
283 An agonized  watches from where he stands beside is close by with some of the older men, ready to ferry the wounded below
284 As the Surprises pour onto the quarterdeck they face withering fire from the enemy
dozen men go down, some of them fatally wounded
Among them are , ,  and in quick succession
The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back at them

, enraged, surges past 's body, swinging his axe to devastating effect, with  by his side and protecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the hip
keeps pushing onwards, the centre of the milling, swirling, hacking crowd, stabbing and pistolling each other with barely room to fall
The Acherons are gradually forced back across their quarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship
285 crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy pikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through the sleeve
fires a pistol by his ear, deafening and killing the pikeman
To either side, privateers are trying to reach them, shouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish
Bullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and foe alike
is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and from his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream
is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat- cleaver right and left

Look to our quarter-deck

The gunner is about to fire when a perfectly-aimed musket ball hits him, again fired by

The two boys fight as a team as they move toward the stern
292 Some Acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack
Others are thrown, grasping at woodwork as they fall

Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat, clinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull

He smashes the chain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners
Everywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's stern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers

They have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of them are too drunk to be scared
Where is your captain
Ou est votre capitaine
One man leaps out through the shattered windows
couple of others raise their hands and start jabbering in French and Spanish

He's [ ] somewhere about 's age, fine-featured, with his black coat draped over his body

He's dead, sir
Gently,  picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back down the quarterdeck, the boy draped across his arms
Friend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses the gangway to
301
, then with  following, he goes below
302
- in wide shot, sitting alone on the bench running under the stern windows
His hunched posture and red tear-stained eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post-battle mood - a mix of grief and depression, the old question, "Was it worth the price
"

- The two ships anchored close together on the ocean
304

and  stitch the bodies into their hammocks, the last body in the line
As the men approach - 'll do it

As  sews up the hammock, 's voice is heard distinctly from below

Amen
The bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea

He waves across to  as the Acheron makes a sharp turn away from the Surprise

While   works further on the tattoo about 's waist
The chain begun off  now winds its way around most of his torso

There was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it

Rolling, undeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through the great ship and filling the night

It will still be there when we come back And he breaks into a merry jig 313

Through the casement windows the two men can be seen playing
Wider, to the vast dark sky and the heaving ocean all around, with the stern cabin, a tiny orange light, still faintly visible in the darkness

Until we see the curve of the earth, and the planet spinning on its journey through space
