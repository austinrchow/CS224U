2004 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- : 1	:  - soaring
The sky is a glorious explosion of blue and mauve and lavender
The setting sun washes the clouds with a delicate pink tint
The bird swoops and spirals and we are right there with him
Then suddenly, below us, an extraordinary sight appears
2	:  - It is the labyrinth, an enormous maze of incredible mandala like intricacy
From our magnificent vantage point, its details: the twisting walls interrupted here and there by lush forest, the complex web of waterways, the forbidding castle at the core
It is vast and magical, frightening and compelling at the same time
We would love to linger, perhaps fly lower and get a better look at this wondrous place, but the bird flies on 3	:  - It is an idyllic setting, warm and inviting
The late afternoon sun washes everything with a pink glow
Between the water and a line of lush fruit trees is a flower-strewn glade
emerges from the trees and walks toward the water
It is a   dressed in a flowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze
The pink light burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on her head to glow
She is breathtaking, a vision of innocence and grace
She stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she has heard something
: Is it you
She takes a few hurried steps and then stops, smiling shyly : Your Highness
The  curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes, the shy smile still dancing on her lips
And then a crown perched on a head of tight curls the crown at the girl as she rises slowly, then looks boldly at the
: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord
For though my father, the Duke, has promised you my hand,  cannot consent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highest hill to deepest dale is
Suddenly the  stops speaking, a look of stunned confusion on her face
:
from highest hill to deepest dale
(her brow furrows in concentration and then) Damn
She burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out a rolled-up soft-cover book
She rifles through the pages
The  is not a prince at all, but a  wearing a tin foil crown
He thinks his work is over and it's time to play and he lunges happily towards the  who isn't a princess or even a duchess, but 15-year-old
is knocked over by the playful
Beneath the gown which is homemade and not very grand at all,   faded jeans and running shoes
: Get off me, you monster
The  grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it, hoping to be chased
doesn't follow, she just sits up and pulls the grass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration
The comes back over to , its tail wagging hopefully
: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, you'll hand it over
The  obediently drops the book
On the cover it says, _MEANDER'  a play in three acts by Robin Zakar_
reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime
leaps to her feet
: Oh no, Merlin
We're really late
Why does everything have to happen to me
prances around her happily, his foil crown in his mouth pulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket
He rushes after it and peers into the basket, wanting to fetch
: It's all your fault, you miserable mutt
She hikes up her dress and runs into the trees
whimpers and tags along behind her
4	:       - comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward the street
and    an enormous steel mill on the other side of the river
And now   that the light isn't pink any more but sort of dull and hazy, and the idyllic glade is barely a suburban park, and this is just an ordinary day in a very ordinary place
5	:     - runs up a path to an older, rambling house
She goes through the front door,  hot on her heels, and neither one of them sees the beautiful -  that lands in a tree beside the path
6	:    - bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the stairs
She almost makes it
'  appears in the hallway
: _Sarah_, where have you been
abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension of the stairs
(in an affected voice):  can't talk to you now
'm in rehearsal
She continues grandly on and heads for her room
: You were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby-sit for Freddie
Don't we at least deserve an explanation
stops and leans over the railing
She speaks with a melodramatic solemnity
: As Meander's Queen, 've been
meandering
Dither me not about explanations
With that she turns and heads for her room
On the door is a sign that says: "Admittance by Invitation Only
" '  comes into the hall
: What's that all about
: It's a part in a play, (raising her voice) but that's no reason to
turns in her doorway
She calls down
: Chasten not your Queen, _Peasant_
She dramatically sweeps into her room
7	: '  - slams the door and leans against it, playing the scene
(): _Sarah_, that's no way to talk to your mother
(mumbles to herself): She's not my mother
takes a deep breath and closes her eyes
She can hear footsteps and  comes to the other side of the door
ignores her  and kicks off her running shoes
With a practiced gesture  removes her jeans while leaving her gown in place
(): _Sarah_, when  tell you to be home at five, expect you to be home at five
quickly shifts to her 's attitude -- hands on hips, and silently mimes her words
: Yes, Madame
7A	: : And don't "Yes Madame" me
: Is she all right
(frustrated): Of course she's all right
left the Bernsteins' number on the kitchen table
Freddie might be coming down with a cold so call us if he seems even the least bit uncomfortable
() (sighs): Yes, Mother
: Oh
give up
She hurries down the stairs
: We'll see you later, baby
And remember
7B	: '  - speaks along with him, mimicking
&  (): Don't open the door to strangers
We hear him leave
waits a beat and then turns and opens her bedroom door
: And don't call me baby
(she slams the door shut; mimicking her parents) Precious little Freddie might be coming down with a cold She sighs and looks around
This is really her world, her retreat, and she knows and controls every inch of it
The shelves are filled with an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys
The books are lined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we would see that they were placed in alphabetical order -- and according to the year they were acquired
She walks over to her dresser
She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of drawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew by her run
She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs on the dresser
One of her , her  and herself as a Another picture of her  in a newspaper clipping is taped to the mirror
The headline says, "Linda Williams a Smash in New Play
"  cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror
It says _Best of Both Worlds_ starring Linda Williams
then reverently opens a music box -- the kind with a twirling dancer inside -- and to the strains of an unbearably tinny version of "Greensleeves" she begins to rehearse
: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my Lord Suddenly, something stops her cold
(yelling angrily): Someone has been in my room
Through the mirror   what she sees: an empty space on one of the shelves
She swirls around and rushes out the door
8	:   - bursts out of her room
: Where's Lancelot
She stomps down the hallway
: Where's my bear
9	:  - enters 's room
She searches the nursery
: Nobody listens to a thing  say
She opens a toy box and rifles through it
: How many times have  told them to stay out of my room
She gets to the crib and looks down
is wide awake, gurgling at Lancelot, 's tattered old teddy bear
: And you, you can just give me back my bear
She yanks it out of the crib and leaves
looks hurt and his face starts to cloud up
10	:  '  - is curled up on her bed, cuddling her bear
sits beside her
She looks at the
: You're the only one who understands me, Merlin
He licks her face
She gets up and holds the bear out in front of her
: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord She is interrupted by 's cries
: Go to sleep, Freddie
The cries get louder
sighs and repeats her favorite litany
: Why does everything have to happen to me
11	:  - enters and approaches the howling
:  don't need this
She pulls the blanket up over him and attempts to tuck him in
: There, isn't that nice
But  doesn't think so
He pushes the blanket off and howls even louder
sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it up and gives it to him
She speaks through gritted teeth
: Want your nice toy
But  doesn't
He flings the toy across the room
bends over the crib and speaks softly
: You know, Freddie,  heard that the only thing to do with a baby who won't stop crying is to get some goblins to come over and teach him a lesson
lowers his screams to a whimper, but a loud whimper
: How would you like that, kid
nasty evil goblin
is quiet for a moment, almost as if he is considering
Then he really howls
sighs and picks him up
She begins to pace back and forth, and starts to hum
goes back to a mere whimper
: Oh, you like that, do you
She begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places the back into the crib
She then begins one of the moat macabre lullabies you could ever imagine
She sings of how scary the dark is, how "the shadows on the wall like to eat you when you're small" and how "a baby doesn't stand a chance when the Goblins start their dance
" She throws herself into her performance; adding to it a wild dance that has her whirling around the room, leaping into the air, making strange shadows on the wall
Finally, the dance ends when too many crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against 's dresser
She staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack of thunder is heard, followed by a flash of lightning
Little  is wailing
He hasn't understood a thing that has sung but he can sense that something is wrong
: Ah, c'mon, Freddie
It was just a song
They are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell
reacts with a gasp of surprise
, for some inexplicable reason, is suddenly quiet
12	:  - approaches the front door with some trepidation
She starts to open it, then realizes what she is doing
She fastens the chain and only then opens the door
13	:  - ' Through the door opening  can see a very elegantly dressed, quite good-looking  of an indeterminate age
He has a worldly air, or is it other-worldly
Before he can speak a flash of lightning illuminates his face
He is a mesmerizing sight and  can't help but gawk
: Excuse me, is this the home of Sarah Williams
Sarah Williams, the actress
's jaw drops
: That's me
: Allow me to introduce myself
(he holds out his hand) 'm Robin Zaker
squeals with delight
: You wrote the play
He smiles
: Just a second
14	:  - 's hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment, and then she unfastens it and opens the door
enters and extends his hand
: It is an honour, Miss Williams
understand you make a delightful Queen Meander
: Well, we've just started rehearsal, but how did you know
:  was passing through this part of the country and heard that it was going to be done here
This is the first amateur production of the play, which of course is delightful for me
: You know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed
The firemen had to use the hall
: Yes,  know, that's why  wanted to stop by to see you
They are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs
And then  begins to howl
: That's my brother
There is another crash and  starts up the stairs
: 'll be right back
watches her run up the stairs
He glances around and then walks right to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle
15	:  - in standing in his crib crying his eyes out
rushes in and sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is crashing against the wall
She rushes to close it
's screams are piteous
: Oh, Freddie
There is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkened room
(): Perhaps  can soothe him
gasps and whirls around
is framed in the doorway
He has a drink in his hand
holds the  close
: You shouldn't be up here
(smoothly):  just wanted to help
rushes by him, still clutching the
16	:  - comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs follows
is still crying
: Maybe you'd better leave
She gets to the bottom of the stairs
whimpers
is making her very nervous
:
, uh, don't think  care to talk to you about the play
He is right behind her, almost too close
: Neither do
is shocked and disturbed by this
: What
reaches over and smoothes 's hair
: 'm more concerned about the baby, of course
pulls  out of his reach
: Freddie's just fine
But he isn't
He's still crying
reaches into his pocket and pulls out a coin
Be runs it over his fingers right in front of 's face
The  stops crying
: There, isn't that better
(nervously): Uh, sure
but you really have to leave
ignores her and heads into the living room
: 'm not just a playwright, as you can see
bring him in here and 'll do some other tricks for him
: No
You've got to
But he is already in the living room
She follows, still holding the 17	:   - is sitting on the sofa, looking very comfortable
stands in the doorway, not sure what to do
Reluctantly, she goes and sits down across from him
: Now watch this, Freddie
He reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there
It comes out followed by many others, all different colours rolls her eyes
This is not that exciting a trick
isn't impressed, either
In fact he starts to cry again
: So you're going to be like that, are you, Freddie
Well, you know what that means
He leans across the table and  pulls the  closer
: It's time to call the goblins
: What
is surprised to hear this, to say the least
It echoes her silly threat to  earlier
: Yes
That's what we do with bad babies
we send for the goblins
And with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a poorly made, very silly-looking goblin hand puppet
laughs with relief
, his hand in the puppet, talks in a high-pitched, unconvincing goblin voice
: You like goblins, don't'cha, Freddie
(singsong) but  bet your sister doesn't
rolls her eyes at this, and then gasps
Because for one very strange moment, the puppet keeps bouncing, but both of 's hands are visible
And then the puppet seems to move away from the table, and disappear
claps his hands with delight
jumps out of her chair
: Where is it
points to a large cabinet against the wall
: It's in there
: Impossible
: See for yourself
hesitates for a moment, and then places  carefully on the rug
She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the door
the puppet, grinning wildly from inside the cabinet
gasps and involuntarily slams the door
She whirls around to face
: How did you do that
leans back into the sofa
: Magic
: Oh sure
She nods, skeptically
She can't see -- but     -- the cabinet door slowly open behind her, and out of it comes a tiny, fierce-looking
This is not a puppet, but a living creature that moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe
is busy with another problem
She doesn't see
: Where's Freddie
shrugs
In a panic,  begins to look around this room
She calls for  and, as she passes in front of the living room doorway,    something scurry across the hallway
stops and listens
: Freddie
But it wasn't a  she heard
Behind her there is more scurrying as begin to appear from various parts of the room
We hear faint snickering
She turns to , terrified
: Where is he
points to the chair  was sitting in
She is behind the chair and can't see anything
But when she comes around in front of it she sees  comfortably ensconced in the cushions
And he's playing with the goblin puppet
reaches over and grabs the puppet out of his hands
She flings it across the room and scoops up the
: Who are you
throws back his head and laughs, then suddenly leaps off the sofa and lands very close to her
: 've been known by many names
but the one  prefer is _Jareth, King of the Goblins_
holds  close and backs away
:  don't believe this
Amidst thunder and lightning  flings his arms up into the air, and he is suddenly dressed in strange, medieval garb, a cloak swirling around him
And what's worse, much, much worse, is that suddenly  are everywhere
Popping out of drawers, from under chairs, swinging off the chandeliers
turns and runs out of the room
18	:  - It's worse in here
The  are pouring down the stairs, slide down the bannister
tries running into another room, but is soon back, followed by a
She barely makes it to the front door and struggles to open it with the  in her arms
The pull her back and laugh wildly
They fling her right into 's arms
He scoops  up and whirls away from her tries to grab the  back but the  get between them
(hysterical): Give him back, you monster
Give him back
only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully
laughs with delight and  struggles to reach him
With a superhuman effort she pushes through the    and grabs onto 's fluttering cloak
It's like being caught up in a whirlwind of incredible force
(screaming):
won't
let
you
take
him
But it's too late
's feet leave the ground and she is pulled with them and the whole
and  swirl up through where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness
There's a    : 's laughing face; , desperate as her fingers are losing their grip; , who's having a great time; ,  gleeful; then -- 's garment pulls out of 's grip
She falls   , a silent scream on her face
19	:  - The sky is pink, and the   swoops by us as the exterior wall of the labyrinth
It is a high masonry wall that extends off in either direction
Along the wall are various ornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf, his back to us, peeing into a tiny pond
It looks for all the world like one of those ornamental garden sculptures
But it isn't
This is
In a  , which is quite discreet,  finishes peeing, and goes over to a particularly lush shrub
few butterfly-like creatures, flower fairies, flit around the bushes
: An' how's me pride an' joy
He leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms, sighing with pleasure as he does
But before he can indulge he is stopped by the whistling sound of a falling object
falls from the sky and lands right on his prize shrub
Incensed, he screams with fury
: What is this
Look what you done
You murderer
struggles out of the broken shrub
: What are you saying, you horrible little man
:  ain't horrible, 'm _Hoggle_
And just look
You've destroyed me prize blossoms
He realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen
: 'll get ya for it, you big oaf
And he picks up a spray can and goes after
But she's had enough
After the nightmarish kidnapping of  and a drop from the deepest space, this guy is child's play
She reaches out and pulls the can from 's hands
She then grabs him by the shirt-front and practically lifts him off the ground
: Oh no you don't
If anyone's getting anything around here, it's me
now where' my brother
:  ain't sayin' nothin' 'til ye let me go
sighs and lets go
: 'm sorry
But this just hasn't been my day
looks at his crushed shrub again
: Ye ain't the only one
ignores him and stares at the massive wall behind them
: And  don't understand any of this
shakes his head and sighs
: Now where have  heard that before
: What do you mean
:  mean, everyone who comes here thinkin' they can make it through the labyrinth says sumthin' like (mimicking Sarah in a whiny, high pitch)
don't understand this, whatever am  doing here, how will  ever get home
: What makes you think 'm here to get through a labyrinth
shakes his head again
: Can't think of any reason why you'd be standin' here in front o' this gate if you weren't
doesn't understand what he is talking about but when she looks up she can't believe her eyes
huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth, endless wall
gulps in disbelief
Then the huge wooden doors fly open and a terrified  runs out, full speed, screaming for his life
Right behind him come    riding on strange They are armed and dangerous looking
They quickly catch up with the  and drag him, screaming piteously, back through the gate
Before the gates close  can see  , what seems like hundreds of them
are mounted,  of them are armed
And beyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever
Then the wooden doors slam shut
: Oh, no
Not more goblins
: That's Jareth's goblin army, and that other poor fool musta been caught meanderin' where he had no business
: What will they do to him
:  don't like to think about things like that
shudders
:  wonder if things can get any worse
sighs knowingly
: He's taken sumthin' o' yours, ain't he
is clearly surprised
: Jareth, our high an' mighty king
nods, excited that someone has a grasp of the situation
: Bet he's gone and taken sumthin' you love
(shrugging): Close
He's got my baby brother
laughs derisively
: Baby snatchin'
That's low
: So 've just got to do something
: Like what
: Get Freddie back, of course
: Then ya'd have ta make it through the labyrinth, 'cause Jareth's castle is at its very center
looks at the gates and gulps
: Is it difficult
snorts with derision
: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion
is reaching the breaking point
: Look, 'm sorry about your bush
But it's not like  asked to have some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me out of the sky
: Well,  didn't ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop on me prized possession, neither
: Oh, this is ridiculous
And she stalks off to the gate, mumbling all the way
(to herself):
standing here wasting time talking to some weird guy who should be living under a bridge
She is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear
Through the gate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the , and what might be the wailing of their poor
There's no way she wants to risk facing that horrific
has come up behind her and as she backs away from the gate she bumps into him
She shrieks and whirls around
: That ain't the only way in, ya know
is very relieved to hear this
: It's not
: Course it ain't
There's many a route in
just only one way out
: Well show me one
've got to find my brother
sighs impatiently
Be fingers a belt that he wears, rattling it in an obvious manner
It in hung with every kind of watch and bracelet and ring you can imagine
: Information like that has a price
, taken aback by the amount of loot he's acquired
:  could give you this
She takes the gold circlet off her head
isn't interested
:  had sumthin' o' this caliber in mind
He takes her hand and   that she is wearing a beautiful ruby ring
shakes her head vehemently
: No
My mother gave me that
eyes it greedily
: She could give ya another
: No, she couldn't
(sadness crosses her face suddenly) She lives real far away
The sadness disappears just as suddenly
She holds out the circlet
: This is all you get
He grabs the circlet and bites it
: Bah
It's paste
Something catches 's eye
It is one of the tiny
She leans over for a better look
: No it's not, it's plastic
's eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he strings the circlet onto his belt
reaches out her hand to the : What a beautiful little thing
reaches for the spray can
: Let me at it
is enraged
: You murderer
How can you kill such beautiful creatures
Just then the  gives  a vicious bite
She shakes it off her hand and cries out in pain
: It bit me
quickly sprays the offending  and it falls to the earth, screaming all the way
: Of course it bit ya
There's nuthin' more vicious than a flower fairy
Any fool knows that
sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry
(sighs): But you don't know nuthin', do ya
tear trickles down 's cheek
sighs
:  got a feelin' 'm gonna regret this
(he stalks off) Come with me an' 'll show ya a way in
hurries after him
As they walk along the endless wall looks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve
(thrilled): Plastic
20	:  - Another part of the wall
pushes a bush aside and shows a tiny door
She looks at it dubiously
: This'll take ya into the maze, that's the first part of the labyrinth
: The first part
What comes after that
gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door
: Then there's the Garden Maze, then the Forbidden Forest
: That sounds inviting
He is through the door
He is still talking but  can't hear him
She quickly tries to follow
: Wait
Wait
can't hear you
21	:  - is through the door
:
then comes the castle
's head appears
:
that's surely where Jareth's keepin' the babe
He looks down at , she is through the door to her waist and straining to get the rest of herself through
sighs and grabs her hand
With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the doorway
She lands flat on her face
: Ya don't seem ta be able ta do nuthin' without my help, do ya
He chuckles and  gives him a look that could kill as she gets up and dusts herself off
She looks around and the environment seems rather benign
The brick walls are open to the sky, here and there a flower peeks through a crack
: Oh,  think  can handle it
In fact, this place doesn't seem so bad at all
And with that, she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor
22	:  1 - turns a corner and comes face to face with a
It is huge and grotesque and protrudes out of the wall
: Go back
Go back before it's too late
screams and backs away from it, moving further down the corridor
She backs into something and whirls around
It is 2: Turn back while you still can
turns and runs back the way she came
: Hoggle
23	:  - is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face
comes rushing toward him
: Oh, 'm so glad you're still here
They were horrible
: You don't mean the False Alarms, do ya
He shakes his head and goes off in the direction that  just came from
: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, ya haven't a hope o' makin' it to the castle
quickly follows
: False Alarms
24	:  1 - The corridor of faces
enters and the  start in on their routine
comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight
1: This is the path of no return
2: Beware
Beware
: Just ignore 'em
: Are you sure
sighs and turns to the
3: Abandon all hope
: Oh, shut up, will ya
is wide-eyed at 's defiance
3: But  was just getting to the best part
: All right
But don't expect us to pay any attention
3 (winks at Sarah): You're going to love this
Abandon all hope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction
(bored): Very nice
is dumbstruck
takes her hand and yanks her along
3: Come back any time
mean, you're doomed, doomed
25	:  2 - and  continuing down a similar corridor
: Ya see, things aren't always what they appear to be around here, Missy
(shrugging): Whatever
All 'm interested in is getting my brother back from that creep
She starts to look around for something
:  admire yer determination, but it takes more'n that to beat Jareth
picks up a rock
: Well, maybe 'm beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth business
She takes the rock and uses it to mark an  on the floor
: See, now 'll know which way we came in case  get lost
(sighs): Missy, goin' back the way ya came is par fer the course around here, what ya want to do is go forward
: Look, Hoggle
've got to find Freddie and  don't need you to discourage me
: And  don't need to be wastin' me time goin' around in circles with you
: That's fine with me
(she starts off)  know you're only after my ring, anyway
She turns a corner and  looks after her, hurt and pity crossing his face
He takes a few steps in her direction and an officious little creature, a , emerges from the brickwork of the floor, takes out the cobblestone that  marked, and replaces it with the marked side hidden
It looks up at
: Some people got no respect for property
sticks his tongue out at the  just as it goes back into its hole
26	:   - The   flies over the maze and    marching along
She thinks she's going forward but she's heading right for
27	:  2 - emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with
: But
She whirls around to look behind her, then back at  again
:
but you were just behind me
'm sure of it
shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the floor
: My mark
It was right here
comes up beside her
:  told ya, Missy
Things aren't what they appear to be around here
(): Except when they are
, in all his glory
and  whirl around and  gasp with surprise and fear
: We meet again
Sarah
: Where's Freddie
What have you done with him
She starts to rush toward  but  holds her back
: Nothing
yet
He walks toward them and they automatically step backwards
He looks down at
: And what have we here
Hoghead, isn't it
is humiliated
: Me name's Hoggle
: Ah, yes
Now  remember
(he moves closer to Hoggle) You're the greedy little coward who lives outside the gate
Shouldn't you be back there minding your own business
Hedgehog
He chucks  under the chin, and is quite rough about it fumes silently
doesn't like this
: Why, why don't you pick on someone your own size
He looks her up and down
: Whom did you have in mind
tries to brazen it out
:  don't have time for any games
want Freddie, and  want him now
throws back his head and laughs
: Ah, Freddie
An adorable little imp
'm really growing rather fond of him
: Where is he
: He's in my castle, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely
He ambles toward them and they can't help themselves, they  step backwards
: In fact, he likes being with goblins so much, 'm considering turning him into one
thinks this is crazy
: You can't do that
(grinning): Oh yes  can
looks down at  and speaks under her breath
: Can he
nods glumly
: But let's make it interesting
won't do it for
thirteen hours
If you make it to the castle before then you might be able to save him
If not, well,  think little Freddie will mike an adorable goblin prince, don't you
He laughs and holds up both hands and   that they are empty
He then closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch in one hand
He throws it to , but  intercepts it and eyes it greedily
Annoyed,  snatches it out of his hand
She looks at it and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it
When she looks up again,  is gone
(): Well, good riddance to bad rubbish
and   jump and then look at where the voice is coming from
It is a little , poking its head out of a hole in the brickwork
: That's what the missus always says, she does
Why the last time she found that one around here she sent him packing
: Jareth
: She don't take to his kind of nonsense, that's for sure
Now, how about a nice cup of tea
The missus has a kettle on
looks down at , who shrugs
She then looks up at the and gives him a beaming smile
28	:  2 - and  are sitting on the floor
: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if  make it on time
: It's hard to say, Missy
But if  were you, 'd worry 'bout first things first
: What do you mean
:  means ya got ta find the castle before ya can go savin' the babe and  mean ta see that ya do
is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek
: Oh, Hoggle
Thank you, thank you so much
gets all flustered and tries to act gruff
: Seems to me  could be gettin' that ring from ya after all if plays me cards right
regards him affectionately
:  know you don't mean that
You're helping me because you're really nice
:  ain't nice
just likes the way ya stood up ta him is all
(he is thoughtful for a moment; almost to himself) Too bad more've us haven't had the guts to do the same
The  reappears
: How about a biscuit
The missus just took a fresh batch out of the oven
: Thanks, but we really don't have any time
We've got to get to the castle
: Ya wouldn't happen to know a shortcut, would ya
: Well, you might try taking that first left
and  look down the corridor
: But there isn't any left turn
Just then a strange  seems to come through the left wall and walks toward them
He is dressed in long flowing robes and wears a hat shaped like a bird
: See, there's a left turn right there, where that Wise One just came in
:  Wise One
Maybe he knows the best way to the castle
:  wouldn't bet on it
But  is excited about the possibility of getting more help
: Excuse me, Sir
Could you tell us the best way to get to the castle
: The best way to the castle, hmmm
'm glad you asked that question
To 's and 's surprise, the  joins into the conversation
: Now you've done it, gone and asked him a question
We'll be here all day
:  castle, or fortress, or as it is sometimes known, a stronghold or citadel -- or, that which has a turret and barbican, but usually not a portcullis
: What did  tell you
There's no stopping him now
:
often there is a rampart or bulwark, and then a parapet -- perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp
: Shut up down there
:
and for entrenchment; a moat, drawbridge and sally-port looks at
: This was not one of my better ideas
: Well,  told you that, didn't
But nobody ever listens to me
He looks down at the still mumbling
: Enough
Nobody cares
The   blinks and looks at  and
: Did one of you say something
thinks quickly
: Oh, no
We never talk to strangers
: That's very wise
An idea worth savoring
nudges him
: Yeah, but keep it under your hat
thinks this is hilarious
The  doesn't
: Ve-ry funny
The   continues on his way
: The stranger, hmm
'm glad you brought that up
The stranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or one from beyond the sea
(hysterical):  quit
can't take it anymore
And then they are gone, passing through the righthand wall as if it wasn't there
watches after them, stunned
: How did he do that
: And how can we make sure he doesn't come back
gives him a look and turns to the
: Just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right through it
The important thing is to forget what you think you know
It doesn't apply around here
and  walk down to the part of the wall where the entered
Once there, they can see that a section of the wall is actually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall
yells back to the
: Thank you
And tell the missus we're sorry we missed her biscuits
And then they walk through the wall and are gone
29	:  3 - and  appear through the wall and  laughs with delight
wasn't as pleased with the experience and feels the wall as if testing to see if it really happened
sees that they are in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to the top of one and looks over
'  - (excited):  can see the castle
It doesn't look far at all
is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out how they got there
jumps down and starts to run down the corridor
: Come on, Hoggle
Let's go
sees her retreating figure and hurries after her
30	:  - 's great hall
He stands by a window and looks out over the labyrinth -- from this vantage point he can see clear across it: the hovels that surround the castle walls, the arid plain that leads to the dense forest, encircling that, the complex maze
He seems lost in thought
The   enters the window and lands on his shoulder
Behind him  is having a grand time
His slippery crawl is too much for the  that scurry about, trying to mind him
Meanwhile, a particularly stupid looking  begins to approach He saunters across the room and is stopped short by a She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning
: Remember
It's bow and scrape
bow and scrape
The   nods and she lets him go
He then continues his approach to , only this time he does a little bow and then scrapes his foot across the floor, then repeats the action
(to himself): Bow 'n scrape
bow 'n scrape
turns and sees the
: Well, what is it
The  can't answer and do his bow-and-scrape at the same time so continues his painfully slow approach
:
bow 'n scrape
bow 'n scrape
Annoyed,  walks over to the  and lifts him up by his shirt front
The  is still bowing
:  said, what is it
: Th
the girl and Hoggle, sire
Th
they're halfway th
through th
the maze
drops the  hard on the floor
sees this and laughs with delight
walks over and scoops the  up in his arms
He then carries him over to the window
He calls over to an by the door
:  think it's time they had some company
: Yes, Sir
Be then salutes, causing his visor to close on his face, then stumbles around looking for the door
shakes his head
: You'll make a much better goblin than that, won't you, Freddie
's response is to clap his sticky baby's hand on to 's face
, pretending he doesn't mind, carefully removes it
He then looks down to the courtyard below
31	:  - ' are pouring out of the castle
32	:  4 - and  are striding down a corridor
They are about to come to a corner
: Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a goblin
mean, that's really weird
They turn the corner and  stops short
becomes alarmed
: What is it
gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he hears -- marching
They look back the way they came
'  '  -     , marching right towards them
They look at each other, then turn and run
tries to get through the wall the way the  showed them
(quoting the worm): Just forget what you think you know and
He smacks headlong into the wall
He stops to rub his nose and flies by him
: Come on
33	:  - is now sitting on the lap of a , happily bopping it on the nose
snaps his fingers and a  of sleepy  in the corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments
They begin to play and  looks out the window and begins a song
He sings about the labyrinth; what it is -- his domain, and what it is to  -- a test, a proving-ground, not for the faint of heart
34	:   - While  sings,  and  try to escape from the
They get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor with crumbling walls
They scamper up to get a look at their position and see dust rising from several parts of the maze
The  are everywhere
In another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by who scurry towards them out of the way of the oncoming
They turn and run back the way they came and as they do   chatter nervously and then disappear into the cracks between the bricks
In a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of spears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction
They enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, forming small, intermittent bridges
Thinking they are safe, they stop for a breath, and soon realize that a  is right behind them
They scurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lie across an arch hopefully out of sight of the  below
35	:   - and  huddle above the corridor on their arches as bring up the rear
1:  can kill better than you can
2: But 'm better at maiming
Everybody says so
And they are gone
Shaken,  and  slide down from their hiding places
: Do you think they're gone
: Sure they are
Goblins ain't known fer their intelligence, ya know
They has as much trouble findin' their way through the maze as you do
He folds his arms and leans against the wall
: 'm not sure, but  think you just called me stupid
Suddenly  yells and disappears
He has accidentally leaned on another secret wall opening
quickly follows
36	:  5 - and  are now in the long circular corridor that divides the maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth -- the Garden Maze
(excited):  think  know where we are
: That'll be a nice change
He ignores her and looks around excitedly
: This place is the end o' the maze
That means we're near the entrance ta the second ring o' the labyrinth
: The second ring
What's that
starts down the corridor
(happily): The Garden Maze
(gloomy): Sounds like a great place
what's it like
: Don't know,  ain't never made it this far before
He is skipping happily down the corridor when  hears something
It is a strange clanking sound
(frightened): Hoggle
What's that sound
stops skipping and sighs
: Now don't go gettin' all girly on me, Missy, now that we's finally safe
: So you think we're safe, do you
(annoyed): Didn't  just say so
: Then tell me what you think of that
points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from
It is now much louder
comes over to her and takes a better look
He screams
-    is coming right towards them
( slashing wall is made up of rows of furiously spinning knives, and chopping cleavers, and has brushes along the bottom to clean up whatever it encounters in its path
) And there is no way around it because it completely fills the corridor
desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they came in, but it is to no avail
He just keeps smashing his face starts to run for it
: Come on
follows, every so often trying, and failing, to get through the wall
, who is far ahead of , comes to a door
And hanging on a hook next to it is a bunch of keys
She looks back at
: Hoggle, hurry
'  -  running toward her, and making slow but steady progress toward them  -- the slashing machine
fumbles with the keys, furiously trying key after key in the door but to no avail
She is terrified
: None of the keys work
Desperate, she starts banging on the door
is just a few yards away from her
: Why don't you just try it
He then tries once more to walk through the wall
tries the knob and sure enough, it opens
She is delighted
What she doesn't see is  suddenly disappearing through the floor
: It's open
Hog
She turns around and he is gone
And the slashing machine is just a few yards away
She screams and, in her terror, falls backwards through the door
It slams shut just as the slashing machine reaches it    that   in sanitation workers' uniforms have been pushing the machine all along
They grunt and strain, cranking the wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time
37	:   - emerges into a large room
The walls are covered with large paintings in ornate gilt frames
She is a bit stunned by the clone call with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting
(to herself): What in the world
She stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe her eyes
It is a painting of the watch with 13 hours on it
The hour hand is on the 9
fumbles into her pocket and finds the watch that Jareth gave her
It also has the hour hand on the 9
: Only 9 hours left
The next picture is of a  surrounded by gruesome
On closer inspection, the  is obviously
She chokes back a sob and runs over to the next one, it is a picture of a rotunda with staircases going off in all different directions on different planes of gravity
It is an Escher room, and a closer look shows a happily standing on the ceiling
She shakes her head and goes by the next painting and gasps involuntarily
It is a compelling portrait of , and she moves even closer
Then she shakes herself out of it
'  -  wills herself away and moves on, and we hear the sound of 's breathing
is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out
She rushes by another painting, giving it merely a glance
But something makes her go back for a better look
It is of a lovely, manicured hedge maze
In the distance    the turrets of 's castle
And in the sky nearby flies a beautiful
And then  is amazed by what she sees
closer look at the painting reveals that the is flying
It moves over the hedges and   a  waving
: Hoggle
, disturbed, backs away from the painting
And then, because it really is as wonderful as it is scary, she goes back for another look and over her shoulder     waving and we hear his tiny voice
: Missy
Over here
This is the way to the castle
And  strains to hear, and leans toward the painting, stretching her hand out and touching the painting, which makes it turn into a shimmering wall that her hand goes right through
And then she disappears right through the painting
And 's portrait is now blank
38	:   - rushes up to  and throws her arms around him
: What happened to you
was afraid 'd never see you again
: Ya know that trick with the wall
Damn, if it don't work with the floor, as well
laughs and hugs him again
39	 :   - and  have been walking through the maze a long time
They are tired and bedraggled
pulls the watch out of her pocket and sighs
: An hour's gone by and  don't think we're more than four feet from where we started
: That's 'cause ya won't do what  tells ya
It's clear as day we should be goin' this way
He turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end
He howls in pain and  sighs and follows him
disentangling himself from the hedge
: Got any more suggestions
Before  can answer they are interrupted by a terrible gut-wrenching scream
It is positively unearthly
whirls around
: It sounds like it came from over there
points in the opposite direction
: Then let's go this way
frowns at him as the scream begins again
: Hoggle
It sounds like someone's being hurt
: Exactly why we should be headin' in the othermost direction
shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become more unbearable
, running through the hedge maze
Driven by the sound of the screams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through
, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends
emerging from the maze
She is stopped in her tracks by what she sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from screaming
emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he heads right back into the maze
40	:  - '  -   are torturing a huge creature () that they have hung by his ankle from a tree limb
They have also taken pains to bind the , who it is obvious could take an most of them and win in a fairer fight
He is about nine feet tall, powerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are truly unbearable
The  have devised a unique method of harassing him
They  carry long sticks which have small, fierce, biting on the end of them
The  bat their sticks at , who bellows and tries to swat back
Since he is tied, the  are free to bite him whenever they get near
, distraught, peeking out from behind a hedge
: The poor thing
peeks out from behind , then quickly ducks back looks for a way to stop the torture
She picks up a rock and carefully aims it at the nearest
It hits his head and knocks his helmet visor over his eyes
Blinded, the  lurches around, swinging his nipper stick at the
: Hey
Who turned out the lights
The   see a new target and poke their nipper sticks towards him
He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze
The chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that their progress in the
desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds suspended upside down
She can't undo it and yells for : Get out here, you coward
appears from behind his hedge
He hesitates, then pulls a dagger from his belt and joins
He cuts through the rope in one hack, and  falls to the ground with a thud
The nipper sticks start yammering away as they see  and freeing  over the top of the hedge
The  chase stops and they head back to the clearing
dives for the bushes but a determined  stays and pulls off the ropes
When  is free, he picks up a huge log
As the   come roaring back into the clearing,  waves the log over his head
The  charge immediately shifts into a  retreat, the nipper sticks yipping in fear
puts down the log and sits, his big shaggy head hanging down
He taken one hand and wipes away a tear
: Ludo
hurt
's heart breaks
This thing is the ultimate stuffed animal
: Is that your name
Ludo
He nods and wipes away another tear
: Goblins
mean to Ludo
: Oh,  know
They were terribly mean to you
(she moves closer and pats his arm) But it's all right now
sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile you have ever seen
: Friend
: That's right, Ludo
'm your friend
'm Sarah
: Sarah
friend
has come out from hiding during this exchange
He finds the whole scene a bit nauseating
And an unnecessary nuisance
If there's one thing he doesn't want, it's competition for
:  think 'm about ta be sick
They ignore him and  grins for all he's worth as  beams up at him
pulls her over to one side
:  hope yer not thinkin' o' lettin' the beast traipse along, Missy
He'll just slow us up
: Are you kidding
He'll be a great help
The goblins are scared of him because he's so fierce
Just then  shyly offers  a flower that he has just picked for her
She takes it and smiles at him
(sarcastically):  sees what ya mean
shrugs and gives  a pat
sighs with frustration
:  just thinks we was doin' fine on our own
: And we can do even better with Ludo
(turns to Ludo) You want to help me save my baby brother, don't you, Ludo
: Save
baby
Good
nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze right behind her
follows, clearly unhappy
41	:   - ,  and  come out of the hedge maze and see a wall with two -sized doors in it
: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden Forest
All we gotta do is pick a door
: What difference does it make
Let's just go
quickly steps between  and the doors
: One door
good
One door
bad
: Well, that's great news
(to Ludo) Don't suppose ya know which is which
skirts around  and goes up to the doors for a closer look at them
: One door
good
One door
: All right, ya walkin' mountain
Ya made ya point
ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors
Each one has a door knocker on it
Both knockers are carved into faces, except one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it stuck in its mouth
(to herself):  guess once you choose a door
all you have to do is knock
The  with the ring through its ears speaks
1: Are you addressing me
jumps back, stunned
: You can talk
1: What
What
You'll have to speak up
2: mmffn
grnth
sminvl
turns to the
: You too
2:
gmft
bmble
shakes her head in amazement
The  are still at it
: If yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest
: Ludo
not
know
: That figures, don't it
(he turns his back on Ludo, fuming) Why the Missy wants an overgrown hill o' hair fer a friend is beyond me
tries to make  feel better and pats him on the shoulder
shakes his hand off with a growl
is excited
:  love it
Talking doors
(to Knocker 1) Are you the right door to the forest
1: It doesn't do to ask me
For some reason  can't hear a thing
turns to  1
1: No use asking him, either
All he does is mumble
2 gets very excited
2: thgt
vrnf
lcl
:  get it
You can't talk with that ring in your mouth
She removes the ring and looks at the  triumphantly
: Now, tell me which one of you is the right door to the forest
2: Oh,  am
No question about it
: Great
How do we get you to open up
2: One merely has to knock
: Of course, why didn't  think of that
She tries to get the ring back in its mouth
2: Oh no you don't, young lady
've had just about enough of that awful thing, thank you very much
: But how are we supposed to get through this door if you won't let me knock on it
2: Well,  really couldn't say now, could
throws up her hands in disgust
1: Oh do speak up, both of you
can't hear a thing
and  are still at it
(conspiratorially): Ya know
even if she does get the door open, ya won't be able ta fit through
Why not make it easy on us all and take a hike
: Ludo
Stay
is disgusted
: Yer quite the speechifier, ain't ya
suddenly gives  2 an evil grin
: Are you sure there isn't anything  can do to change your mind
2: Absolutely not
My lips are sealed
: That's what  thought
The  presses its lips firmly together
deftly squeezes its nose shut
It sputters for air and finally has to open its mouth before it suffocates
shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry of triumph
She knocks, and the door swings open
: Let's go
She goes through the door and  and  race to follow
They try to get through the door at the same time and get into such a tangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves out
: Now you've done it
In a frenzy,  starts banging on both doors
: Missy
Missy, wait
42	:   - on the other side of the door
Except on this side, there is no door, just a long expanse of wall
The forest is very dark, and as its name suggests, very forbidding
can hear  calling, but it is very faint
(scared): Hoggle
43	:   - is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door swings open
: 'm coming
He rushes through the door and disappears
We can tell from his voice that he is falling down a deep hole
(echoed):
Miiiiiiiiissy
We hear a huge splash
Then that door shuts and  is all alone
: Sarah
gone
Hoggle
gone
He is sad and confused
emerges from the hedge maze and begins to walk along the wall, away from
It is the
brightens and chases after them
: Wait
The   stops and the  looks  up and down
: This ought to be a good one
: Ludo
need
door
: You have need of a door, do you
Ah, yes
very useful thing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and that which gives access, a gate or gangway
He continues walking and  walks with him, listening intently
:
also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by a propylaeum
(sighs): If only  had hands  could cover my ears
that is, if  had ears
:
not to be confused with a window, or fenestration
44	:  - has waited long enough
: Hoggle, Ludo
where are you
She reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch
The hour hand is on the 7
: (whispers) Oh, Freddie
(she shoves the watch back into her pocket) Well, you guys are going to have to catch up with me 'cause can't wait
Then determined, she strides off
45
:  - is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground
There is a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it
: Somebody help me
can't swim
46	:  - is in a very thick, creepy part of the woods
She is clearly lost
She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush, and struggles with it to get herself free
Finally she does, and then, frustrated, sits down on the ground
: Why does everything have to happen to me
But there's no time to think about that because she hears the sound of a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking, spindly, leering comes scampering through the trees and into the clearing; and then , and  and
is terrified as they approach her, but then not so terrified because the aren't doing anything except dancing; wild, loose-limbed, frenzied dancing
laughs, and can't help but be taken in by the wild spectacle
And then they begin to encircle her, still moving to the wild rhythm
(laughing, moving): What are you
1: We're Wild Things, baby
Wild
2: Wild and free
3: Get down
And then more   appear, and these produce instruments
As and turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number
1: You call that wild
'll show you wild
And then he does an amazing thing, to say the least
He takes his head off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like a juggler, then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on his shoulders
gasps and tries to get sway but another pushes her back into the middle of the melee
2: Cut me some slack and move on back
And they do, and, moving to the pounding rhythm, he takes his eyes out of his head and waves them at
He then tosses them on the ground as if they were a pair of dice
They land at 's feet looking straight up
2: Snake eyes
is fascinated and repelled
And the beat gets hotter and the frenzy more frenzied and she can't help getting a little wild herself
She begins to really dance
3: That's it, baby, get wild and free
But you'll never be as wild as me
And to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like a basketball
1 leans over to  and whispers conspiratorily
1:  wouldn't call that really _wild_, would you
: Well, it's
uh
sort of
1: 'd call _this_ wild
And he takes off his head, puts it on the ground as if it were a golf ball, and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club
The head goes flying, right to
catches the head, then tries to get it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of all the other   and she can't find it
So there's , running around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the ears start to flap and the head flies out of her hand
grabs her hand and turns her around
2: That was _wild_, baby
(he starts to dance) Now how 'bout gettin' wild with me
But  has had enough
:  think 'll sit this one out
1: Not with us you don't
2: 'Cause we're _wild_
And then they're all over her, like a bunch of hyper puppies, and it's really too much
: Enough
've got to find the castle
2: Well, why didn't you say so, baby
3: That's a _wild_ idea
And then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put it back and meanwhile the  start pushing and pulling on  and propel her into the woods
1: They got some wild goings on at the castle, baby
47	:  - is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips
He doesn't have the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at the water in mortal terror
He begins to slip just as a door opens in the sheer rock and  enters, accompanied by
: Well, what have we here
if it isn't little _Piggle_
screams and slips into the water
He tries to struggle back to the ledge but the  push at him with poles, laughing maniacally
: Did the girl decide she doesn't need you, now that she has that beast
(angry): She wouldn't do nuthin' like that
leans over the water, laughing
: Don't you know she could never care for a repulsive thing like you
splashes and tries to stay afloat
: She does care
Me 'n Sarah is friends
: Only until something better comes along
and 've definitely got something better in mind
: Don't you hurt her
grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful  push him back down into the water
: What  do to her is my business
and it is _inevitable_
He grabs  by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water
: You can be with me or against me
(terrified): Wh
what do  gotta do
:  doubt if she can make it to the castle in time
He leans down and speaks directly into 's face
: But just in case,  want you to deliver her to me
: Never
'd rather die
sneers scornfully
: Then so you shall
He drops  back into the water
The  shriek with delight
goes under and comes up sputtering
: Wait
was about to leave
He turns back to , a look of amusement on his face
:  gotta know what
what you'll do to her
He splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water
:  will do what ever amuses me
He reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach
: All _you_ have to do is give her this
He tosses  the peach
catches it and immediately the water starts to recede
: You've made a very wise decision
He leaves, followed by the
:  didn't decide nuthin'
stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone and he is sitting on cold, damp ground
48	:  - The   are leading  on a rocky path
She stumbles along but they couldn't care less
: Are you sure this is the way to the castle
1: Oh, did you say "the castle"
2:  thought she said hassle
3:  thought she said rassle
1: Rassle
That's a _wild_ idea
He leaps on  and she flings him off
: , guys, fun's over
She starts to leave and they pull her back
2: Over
It's just begun
And then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than ever
The   totally surround , and though they aren't hurting her, they are definitely not letting her out
What they do is start throwing their heads at each other and switching them
1, 2 & 3: Now this is _really_ wild
door opens in a nearby boulder and  appears
In the background and hear the   as he wanders off
:
very often preceded by a porch, or portico, also verandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as an antechamber or foyer
: Why me
The door closes
sees  in the middle of this weirdness and is just a bit confused
sees him amidst the flying heads and cries out in relief
: Ludo
: Sarah
not
want
castle
: Are you kidding
Get me out of here
approaches the   and grabs a head before it reaches its target and calmly tosses it into the trees
3: Hey, big fella
That's a little _too_ wild
But there's no time to talk because  calmly catches the other heads and tosses them away
The bodies go scurrying after their heads, followed by the
is free
: Oh, Ludo
'm so glad you're here
She gives him a kiss and he beams
: Where's Hoggle
: Hoggle
in
bad
door
: We've got to find him
Do you think we can
is very confident
He spent a lot of time with the
: Ludo
knows
doors
He ambles off with  following
: also
portal
or entrance
49	:  - is more depressed than ever
The peach is nowhere to be seen
Suddenly 's head appears above
: Hoggle
all
wet
almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged
: Ain't that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer a thinkin' creature
appears from behind
: Be nice, Hoggle
Or we won't get you out
's face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten
: Missy
50	:  - ,  and  march through thick, overgrown forest
They do not know that they are being spied on by '
51	:  - The  emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to a wide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye can see
It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden posts on either side of the gap
eyes the bridge warily
: It doesn't look too strong but we don't have much choice
Suddenly they are interrupted by a high-pitched, but powerful voice
(): Halt
Halt or be slain forthwith
At first they don't see a thing and look around for the source of the voice
Then, the imposing 18 inch high figure of , resplendent in rakish hat and swashbuckling sword, emerges from behind one of the posts and stands in front of the bridge
and  are dumbstruck
, however, is not at a loss for words
: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent
looks directly at
: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the point of my sword
snorts with derision and  tries a more sensible approach
: Please, we really have to cross this bridge
It's a matter of life and death
shrugs elegantly
: Under any other circumstances  would hasten to oblige you, fair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy one
: Oh, it is
: But  am sworn
Without my permission, none may pass
throws up her hands and  mumbles under his breath
It appears to be up to  to break the deadlock
He lifts  up into the air and moves him to one side
They then start to walk toward the bridge and  chases them, brandishing his sword
: You dishonor me, varlets
En garde
To his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking
: Rapscallions
Duel
or _die_
This gets their attention and they turn to look at him, annoyed
: What _is_ this weasel babblin' about
It is too much for
He flings himself at  with a mighty war cry
tries to run for it but  is right behind him, administering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places
dives behind a bush and  sniffs at his cowardice
He comes back and faces
: It is you  want, rogue of rogues
You who dealt me the gravest affront
And with that he jabs  in the foot
is stunned, and howling, begins to hop on his good foot
, his head thrown back for a triumphant yell, goes after  with his sword flashing and there is nothing for  to do but pick up a branch and defend himself
It is the most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdity moving at an incredible speed, parrying the mighty swipes of 's branch with great skill -- and no small amount of difficulty
And  fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword, leaping about with surprising agility -- and at a rate that exhausts him totally
Finally, the two of them, breathing heavily, lower their weapons
And, to everyone's surprise,  throws down his sword
:  no longer wish to slay you, for you are a truly noble knight
Then  strides up to him and, craning his neck, attempts to look  in the eyes
: Destroy me if you will
quickly drops his branch in response
The whole thing has upset his gentle nature terribly
then holds out a tiny paw
: Never have  met my match in battle, yet you, noble knight, have fought me to a standstill
kneels and tentatively takes ' paw into his own huge hand
: Let us be brothers henceforth, and fight for the right as one
cheers and , unimpressed, rubs his sore rear smiles from ear to ear
: Ludo
get
brother
Then he and  exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek, which in their case is not easily accomplished
then turns practical
: Well, now that that's settled let's get going
She heads for the bridge but  blocks her way
: You forget my sacred vow, my lady
cannot let you pass
is incensed
: But you said Ludo was your brother
How can you refuse him
:  have taken an oath
must defend it to the death
, enraged, turns on
: Some brother he turned out ta be
: Brother
good
: Well, if he's so good, why won't he let us get on with our business
scratches his head
He has no idea
sits down beside the crestfallen
: , let's handle this thing logically
What exactly have you sworn
brandishes his sword
:  have sworn with my life-blood, no one shall pass this way without my permission
: Then may we
_have your permission_
is stunned
and  barely breathe
Slowly looks all around and then, with a courage greater than any he has ever had to call on before, he says it
: Yes
And the sky doesn't fall, and the earth doesn't heave, and everything is exactly as it should be
: Thank you
breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass
is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate
Because the rickety bridge collapses under his weight
and  jump back on the ground near  just in time and poor  swings over the deep fissure, hanging on to one of the ropes that held the bridge
With a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite side and looks forlornly over at the others
: Oh no
crumples to the ground, and stares miserably at the broken bridge
: Now see what ya done, ya mush-brained mammoth
: , Sir Didymus, take responsibility for the actions of my brother, my lady
Lash out at me if you must
: 'm not mad at Ludo, Sir Didymus
'm just upset because time is running out and  have to rescue my baby brother
is struck to the very roots of his chivalry
: You mean to rescue _a child_
: The goblin king took him, and 've only got
She takes out the watch
The hour hand is on the 5
:
five hours to get him back
yells across to
: Is this your quest, too, my brother
: Save
baby
is overwhelmed
: Then  shall join you, lady
am at your service, upon my sword
He bows low before  and she smiles
:  happily accept your fealty, Sir Didymus
frowns with displeasure at this latest development
: This is all well an' good, Missy
But we still got one little problem
They all look across the fissure at
: Ludo
friends
: Yes, yes
We're friends
Very nice
What's that got ta do with us gettin' over there without a bridge
: Rocks
friends
: We're wastin' our time, Missy
Let's you an' me go find another
He is interrupted by  bellowing, which is followed by a sympathetic rumbling
Suddenly rocks pile in from both directions until there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk across
: Rocks
friends
(laughing): They sure are, Ludo
She skips happily across followed by a sullen whistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging gasps, he is the spitting image of her own
: It's
: Ambrosius
My noble steed
laughs and shrugs
Nothing surprises her in the labyrinth
52	:  - The edge of the forest
From here you can see the castle in the distance, just across the dry, cracked plain
The sky is full of stars
, ,  and  are sitting around a fire
: What will you do after we save the child, my lady
: Take him home, of course
That is, if  can figure out how
: What is your kingdom like
Do you have many knights to defend your honor
: Not even one
: It cannot be
What bitter place is this that does such dishonor to my lady
: It's a place where
where nobody really sees me
: Ludo
see
Sarah
: (laughs)  know you do, Ludo
(she turns to Didymus) And thanks to you, Sir Didymus,  finally have a knight
He bows graciously
, who has been watching this scene, feels rejected and miserable
He gets up and wanders away from the fire
After a moment,  follows him
: Don't you feel like resting
:  ain't tired
: Me neither
What  am is hungry
winces but  doesn't notice
looks back at  and lies on his back snoring loudly
dozes against ' side
: They're both wonderful, aren't they
: They're alright
: They're more than that
They're loyal and strong
and with their help 'm going to beat Jareth
shakes his head sadly
speaks as an afterthought
: And yours, too, of course
:  ain't no fighter
She shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle
goes through agony for a moment, and then makes a decision
: Missy
if you're hungry
He holds out the peach that  gave him: the world's most delicious looking peach
: Oh, great
She happily taken the peach and bites
It takes everything  has to not put his hands over his ears
She takes another bite and then stumbles
(laughing): Everything's dancing
She looks up at the sky, exhilarated
: Even the stars are dancing
turns and walks back to the fire
stumbles about as she gazes happily at the sky
53	:  - is leading the  on a merry chase
He crawls around the room, pulling things off shelves
is on his hands and knees in front of  polishing his boots
kicks the  and sends him flying across the room
This makes  laugh and he pulls a book off the shelf and throws it
It hits a  on the head
scoops up  and puts him in his cradle
He sits down next to him
: Little goblin-to-be,  have something to amuse you
He waves his hands in front of  and suddenly beautiful crystalline balls appear in them
He runs them over his fingers like so many coins, their molten light so dazzling that  kicks up his legs with excitement
And    that at the end of his pajamas are two wizened goblin feet
laughs and flings the balls into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizing bubbles
: Soon, little one
Very, very soon
And they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over the labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky
54	:  - 's hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the ground
She stares out into the sky, mesmerized
The bubbles are approaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles
And then she hears music, haunting, spell-casting music
The bubbles come closer and that each one contains a  , a  just like the one in 's music box
She gets up and follows them
watching from the woods
: Damn you, Jareth
(He turns and begins to walk away) And damn me too
bubble, with  inside it, floating through the sky
She appears enchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the
55	:  - giant bubble, with a magnificent ballroom inside it
Tiny bubbles rush to join it
In one of them is
56	:  - The music changes and now  is inside the ballroom
It is a magnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 18th Century Venetian ball
Magnificently dressed  swirl to the music in an incredibly opulent setting
But when you look closer you sense decay just beneath the surface; things are threadbare, faded
The  wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces, giving them all a slightly sinister look
And there is something very provocative about all of them; the  have bare shoulders and daring decolletage, many of the  have their shirts open to the waist
Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there is the feeling that the party has been going on all night
In this setting  is the picture of innocence
snickering behind their fans as  approaches, and she is suddenly terribly self-conscious
How plain She feels amidst all this
She looks into one of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her image
Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her gasp
The mirror, and in it the reflection of a resplendent  dancing with a particularly exotic-looking
whirls around, trying to get another glimpse of
She is so intent on trying to see him that she doesn't notice that she is being stared at brazenly by a leaning against the wall
He moves next to her and whispers something into her ear
She hurries away, shocked; and the throws back his head and laughs
And  sees the whole thing
is approached by a -  who has a box hanging at waist height from a ribbon around his neck
It looks like 's music box
She looks down at it with interest and he throws open the cover
But there is no dancer inside, instead there is a stick carved like a snake
It shoots out at  and she cries out and backs away
around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on
, who is dancing with an even more beautiful  than before, watches
is looking for
She spots him and sees him whisper something to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask and licks her lips
blushes and turns away and finds herself looking into another mirror
But in the reflection,  isn't with a partner
He is standing alone, the  a whirling blur around him, and he is looking straight at her
, whirling around to face the crowd and she sees  with yet a third
And then she realizes that it is herself
In a trance-like state she moves through the  to get a better look
'  - She is whirling in 's arms, and she is the most beautiful woman at the ball
smiles down at her and the attraction between them is palpable
: You look like a queen
looks up at him, thrilled by his words
:
feel like
don't know what  feel
(smiling): Don't you
And he whirls her around dizzyingly, so dizzyingly that she swoons in his arms
He catches her before she can fall very far, tightening his grip around her waist
: Are we
are we in a bubble
: Yes, we are
dream bubble
where your dreams can come true
is being jostled by the crowd
She stumbles and almost falls on top of a  on a bench
The  is sprawled across the lap of the  who wears a mask with a very phallic nose
backs away from them, frightened
and , dancing
She is smiling up at him, he has never looked more handsome
There is something more open about him, as if he, too, is caught up in the moment
He nuzzles her hair with his lips and whispers in her ear
(whispering): My Queen
Then he begins a song
song that tells  he will give her everything she wants, even things she doesn't know she wants
song that says forget it all; all the restrictions, all the powerlessness
Forget and stay in the dream
watches, mesmerized
But every time she tries to get closer to  and  she in jostled by a lascivious , pushed out of the way by  laughingly being chased by
She stumbles against a wall and a door opens
Inside, pillow feathers are flying and she can't make out what the   are doing comes up to the doorway, winks at , and closes the door
finishes the song and  looks up at him, smiling
He moves his face closer to hers and she closes her eyes
His face comes closer, and closer
shrinks back from what she is seeing
She turns and runs, pushing herself though the languid , right into the bubble itself
57	:  - comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom crumbles
In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard
58	   - runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard
There are piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tents from which  hawk objects of all kinds
Some of them approach and she pushes them away, sobbing
'  -   , and standing in front of it is an stooped over from the objects piled high on her back
She beckons to and pulls the tent flap aside
: 'Ere it is, Dearie
All the fings you want, all the fings you need
The flap opens wider and inside the tent    's room
gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent
She trips over the threshold and lands face down on her bed
59	: '  - sits up on the bed and looks around the room
She shakes her head and laughs
: What a dream
She gets up and stretches, then walks over to the mirror
She smiles at her reflection
: Yep, you've got quite an imagination, kid, Just what a great actress needs
She walks over to the bed and picks up Lancelot the bear
: How about a midnight snack, Sir Lance
She goes over to the door and opens it
60	:   - '  -  /
The   peers in
: 'Aven't you got everythin' you need, Dearie
61	: '  - screams and slams the door
She buries her face in the bear
: It _is_ just a dream
She takes a deep breath and goes to the door again
She opens it very slowly
62	:   - '  -
The   peers in again
: Best to stay in there, where it's safe, Dearie
Don't know what might 'appen to you out 'ere
63	: '  - clams the door again and rushes over to the window peer in at her and laugh
She quickly pulls the curtains closed and walks back to the center of the room
She stands clutching the bear, then looks up at her reflection in the mirror
' reflection
Herself as a very old woman, clutching a teddy bear
: Best to stay in here where it's safe
Don't know what might happen to you out there
steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a sea of mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her
As she tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around her and pull her down
: Help
Somebody help me
64	:   - and  desperately searching for ,  riding his 65	:   - sits at a bar, drowning his sorrows
/ works behind the bar
slams his cup down
: Another
The  holds out his hand greedily
pulls a treasure off his belt and slams it on the bar
The  pours
66	:   - and  approach the red tent
They spy the
: Did you see a noble maiden pass this way
:  noble maiden, eh
What would she be doin' in a place like this
: She's on a rescue mission
The   finds this hilarious
:  rescue mission, ha
You're in the wrong place, for sure
The only fings we cares about rescuin' around 'ere is our worldly goods
She takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for emphasis
67	: '  - is drowning in a sea of junk
She hears  and cries out hopefully
: Didymus, in here
Help me
The door opens and the   peers inside
: Don't worry, Dearie
sent 'im away
groans
: Knew you wouldn't want to be leavin' your nice fings for no rescue mission
: Oh my god
Freddie
: Freddie
Is that one of them dolls over there
or that nice teddy
struggles for the door in the sea of junk
: No
He's my brother
And 've got to save him
She continues pushing through the junk
: No you don't, Dearie
You can stay right 'ere with all your pretty fings
knows what her choice has to be
:  know  can
(joyous) But  don't want to
She lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in the doorway
She looks down at the   triumphantly
: Now get out of my way
68	:   - runs out of the tent, a look of triumph on her face
The   pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to : Wait, Dearie
Look at this
She holds out 's music box, opens it, and the little twirls inside
(grinning): Keep it
And she is off
As  goes the   on the
And we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had just seen her from all sides, we now see something very, very different
Where the other side of the woman should be   a cross-section of her, with  inside
His head is beneath the pile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh
He is the puppeteer operating the  , as indeed, she has been operated
is mad
: Damn
69	:   - and  sit forlornly at the gate
appears out of the night
: My lady
leaps to his feet
: Sarah
safe
rushes into his arms
: Is Hoggle not with you
pulls away from
: Hoggle made his choice, he's
not part of the mission anymore
(angry): The coward
: Hoggle
good
shrugs, and smiles at him
: Maybe
But there's no time to discuss it
We've got a baby to rescue, remember
She leads them through the gates
70	:   - Streets full of hovels encircle the castle
This is where the live
As ,  and  walk through the dark, eerie streets they are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of lights
: Methinks they are expecting us, my lady
peers at them from an open doorway sees him and drags him inside and slams the door
(grimly): Methinks you're right
71	:  - is still at it
He pulls his belt off his body and   that the only treasure left is 's plastic circlet
He slowly pulls it off and stares at it
The  approaches, his eyes lighting up at the eight of this treasure
: Another
hesitates, then hands the circlet over
The  bites it and his face lights up with glee
: Plastic
He goes to get the drink and  puts his face down on the bar and sobs
At the other end of the bar sits the
The  looks over at and shakes his head knowingly
: Drinkin' to forget, eh, buddy
looks up
: To forget, ah yes
To suffer a mental lapse, to obliterate from one's consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a blank or fugue, to drink the waters of Lethe
(drunkenly): What's Lethe
: The waters of forgetfulness
They remove from our minds what is too painful to remember
looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand
:
but with the memory goes our wisdom, or knowledge, that which brings us understanding, also enlightenment
But there is no one to continue benefitting from the  's pearls
is gone
: You can cool it down there
he's gone
:
a grasp of things, a depth or profundity of thought
The  sighs and looks over at the  who is still admiring his plastic treasure
: Another one over here
and make it a double
72	:   - ,  and  emerge into the vast courtyard outside the castle
It in eerily quiet
Too quiet
: We're going to make it
sniffs the air
:  am less than sure
They are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a  jumps on 's back
Then the courtyard is filled with , what seems like the whole army, coming right at them
fends off the with his sword and  punches out the ones that get by him
unswords a  and his weapon goes flying picks it up and does some parrying of her own
But there are too many of them
The threesome turn and run
73	:  - stands by the window, watching the battle
The   sits on his shoulder
looks over at  who stands holding on to the side of the cradle
smiles and turns back to the melee below
The  flies out the window
74	:   - ,  and  race down the streets
The  are in hot pursuit
75	:  - They come careening around a corner and it seems that they have escaped their pursuers
The sound of the  seems to be getting farther away
:  think we lost them
They turn and see that, unfortunately they have come full circle and are right back in the courtyard
climbs part way up a wall and looks over the streets
: What do you see, my brother
gulps
What he sees is the   coming down every street right towards them
: Ludo
see
trouble
And then the trouble arrives and  and  are heavily into swordplay
tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by who prick at him with their spears
looks up and sees his predicament
She gets an idea
: Call the rocks, Ludo
Call the rocks
makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall
He then throws his head back and bellows
76	:   - An enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with boulders, all careening towards
They knock  out of their path like so many bowling pins
77	:  - and  fight bravely
keeps bellowing and throwing off the occasional  that is stupid enough to jump on him
Soon the rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the and their
reaches down and lifts  and on to the wall
They jump and disappear into the castle enclave
78	:  - door opens in a dark part of the castle
,  and enter
They look around and quickly tip-toe down a dark corridor
They turn a corner and see some  marching their way
They duck out of sight
79	:  - The main entrance to the castle
-  stand outside the large wooden doors
The results of the 's escape can be heard in the distance
staggers out of the dark, singing drunkenly
It is
: "
it's so cold in the night with no gold to keep me warm " He trips over his feet as he approaches the
: Who goes there
"
so cold, oh so cold
" 2: Don't worry about him
He's on Jareth's payroll now
falls to the ground, then picks himself up
: Thash right
Jareth owes me sumthin'
an' 'm here ta collect
They laugh at him, then step aside and let him enter
80	:  - stand in a circle in a corridor
They torment a tiny, fuzzy yapping  with their nipper sticks
The gets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor
The laugh
It turns a corner and starts yapping for all it's worth
,  and  pressed against the wall, trying to not be noticed
Unfortunately the little  has no sympathy for their plight
It stands at their feet, making a ruckus
(whispering): Shut up, you little monster
bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it
: Nice
thing
But the  doesn't want a pet
It sinks its teeth into 's hand
howls
:  fear that this means trouble
The  yell and start running down the corridor
: Run for it
They are off, the  and the  at their heels
81	:  - The  are running for all they're worth
pulls the watch out of her pocket
It is on the 12:30
: Only a half hour left
We've got to find Freddie
Yet another    running right toward them
They stop in their tracks and start running in the opposite direction
82	:   - The  come careening into the long narrow inner courtyard
Balconies look down on it from the floor above
Opposite them is a large ornate door
They have a lead on the  chasing them, but not for long
On one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little  laughs sadistically
The  look up and see the  with his hands on a huge lever
He pushes it down gleefully and the floor opens up in front of the
It appears to be a bottomless pit, too wide to leap across
Horrified they look behind them and see the gaining on them
And they're throwing spears
Suddenly there is a triumphant yell from the balcony opposite the repulsive , and then a  leaps off it swinging on a rope
: Hoggle
It certainly is
He wrestles with the hideous  and in the struggle it falls screaming into the pit
then grabs the lever and it is not a second too soon
The pursuing  are entering the courtyard
The floor closes and the  run to the door
An enraged aims a spear at
He is hit
screams as  struggles with the door
It won't budge and he begins to smash his body against it
seemingly half-dead  staggers to his feet and throws his body on the lever
He appears to faint from the strain but the weight of his body pushes the lever and the floor opens again
The enraged  are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit
They hurl spears at the  but it is to no avail
smashes down the door and they run in
83	: '  - , , and  carrying  enter the room where we have seen  and
They lock the door behind them
No one is there and 's cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed him only moments before
places  down and  looks feverishly around the room
She spots a door
: That's the only way he could have gone
She runs to the door and  and  follow
: No
have to face him alone
: But, my lady
He is interrupted by the sound of  in pursuit
They start trying to smash down the door
runs to it and presses his body against it
moans and  and  run to his side
:  don't expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but
She puts her finger to his lips
: Forgive you for what
Saving our lives
: But,  betrayed ya,  gave ya that damned peach
: Ssh
You did the only thing you could do
She looks down at his empty belt
:
and  see you lost all your treasures in the process
:  don't care if  never sees another treasure again
(smiles): Here
Just in case you change your mind
She slips off her mother's ring and presses it into 's hand
He is overwhelmed and  smiles at his pleasure
: And Jareth said ya could never love me
: Jareth doesn't know everything
She leaps to her feet and  moans
: Take care of him, Didymus
: 'll guard the valiant Hoggle with my life
The  give the door a particularly loud smash and  presses against the door even harder
: Ludo
too
She runs to the other door and stops to look back at them
: No maiden could have wished for nobler knights
And she is gone
84	  - enters an overwhelming room with many staircases, balconies and doorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles that obviously have no relation to what we know as gravity
Her knees buckling from vertigo
Then she gasps
is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly
: 've been expecting you
stumbles and falls into the room, ending up on the ceiling
She tries to adjust to being upside down
: Where's Freddie
She has to look down and sideways to see  and it is clearly grueling
: He's right there
And he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle from the wall
is climbing up the stairs happily, but from 's point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the top
(screaming): Freddie
No
gets to the top but doesn't fall, instead he ends up crawling up the wall
sighs with relief and closes her eyes
This sends her reeling and she ends up in one of the archways
She tries to orient herself but there is no up, no down, no sideways
And the is about to crawl off a balcony
screams and  laughs
He begins a song that tells  she never really understood what was gain on
Nothing is what it appears to be, not even things like "up" and "down
" in the most precarious-looking situation yet, at the top of a staircase
He hesitates to crawl down, and to lure him, creates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the
Of course, it bounces up
And all the while his song is taunting
She turns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the archway
She sees endless
And while she's looking, the first reflection runs to the left, the reflection behind that to the right, and so on all the way down the line
And 's still standing there
She falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor, watching  chase his ball across the ceiling
dances on the wall now as he is about to finish his song
And there is on one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda
If he falls off that, he'll really fall
runs up the opposite wall and finds that there is sheer space between her and the
The only way to reach him is to jump
She looks at  who grins at her, then at who is teetering on the edge
As  comes to the end of the song there is nothing to do but jump
She looks at  and can't repress a grin of her own
: Like the man said, "nothing is what it appears to be
" She jumps
85	: '  - falls right on to a magnificent huge bed
Opposite her sits in a chair
, wrapped in a blanket, is gurgling on his lap
reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch
It is a few minutes before 13
stands up
: There's still time
He gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her watch
He places  into a cradle and comes over to the bed
He looks down at her
: Besides, 'm no longer interested in having a little goblin prince
've decided 'd much rather have a queen
He looks into her eyes for a moment
doesn't look away
Instead, she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him
(archly):  queen
Have you chosen anyone  know
She glides by him and walks to the window
chuckles appreciatively
: You've come a long way, little girl
looks out at the labyrinth
:  certainly have
She turns to face him
: Yes,  can see it in your eyes
(he moves closer to her) No one else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else has ever been worthy
He takes her hand and brings it to his lips
She smiles down at him
: What's your offer
stands quickly and looks at her
She certainly has come a long way
: Why, everything
you'll rule by my side
: Everything
The chance to spend my life surrounded by repulsive goblins
the chance to torment innocent creatures
(shaking his head):
the chance to never have a care in the world, to never have to do anything that you don't want to do
looks at him
: Anything else
(smiling): Why, me
Of course
surreptitiously eyes the clock
There is about a minute left
She glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer to
: And what if 'm not interested
reacts with surprise for a moment, then shakes his head
: Impossible
know you,  know what you want
: Well, 've got news for you, Jareth
She makes a beeline for the cradle
:  don't want _you_
She's almost at the cradle but  grabs her arm and stops her
(shocked, enraged): Why, you miserable creep
has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and punches him in the jaw
steps back, stunned
scoops up the screaming
: How could you do this to an innocent baby
stands rubbing his jaw, snivelling, stunned
: You hit me
,  in her arms, goes right up to him
: And 'd like to do more
you, you
She is furious and wants to hit him again badly
Since she has the in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin
howls and grabs his leg
:  wouldn't want you if you were the last
_goblin_ on earth
The   flies through the window and lands on 's shoulder
puts his hands on his ears
: Don't say that
But it is too late, he starts shrinking
: Look at me
(whining) How could you do this to me
Before 's eyes  turns into an undersized, ineffective, snivelling little
The features are those of a goblin, but still recognizably
86	:  - 's quarters, where  tends  and  still blocks the door
() (whiney scream): Why does everything have to happen to me
They look at each other and suddenly  realizes that the are no longer trying to break down the door
The  start to laugh
(proudly): She did it
They cheer
87	: '  - , the bratty little , is throwing a tantrum
: Nobody ever cares about what  want
The walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a crack opens up right in front of 's feet
She looks at the clock and the minute hand moves to the 13
She looks at
There's nothing to do but jump into the void
The clock begins to strike
: , Freddie
Time to go bye-bye
She jumps
88	:  - and  spinning through the dark, starry sky
The striking of the clock continues
pulls him closer, lovingly
And they go on spinning
89	:  - is lying face down on the floor
She comes to slowly and tries to sit up
Groaning, she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner of the open drawer
She tries to focus, blinking her eyes
'  - Her eyes slowly focus on 's crib
When she can see, she gasps
's not there
The side of the crib is down and the  is nowhere to be seen
: Freddie
She leaps to her feet woozily
Still rubbing her head she staggers out into the hallway
90	:  - looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a delighted grin
'  -   is crawling slowly, but determinedly, into 's room
When he gets to her bed he uses all his strength to pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread
Be then holds his hand out, trying to reach something
makes her way toward her room, delight and wonder on her face
91	: '  - stands in the doorway looking down at
(softly): That's quite a journey you took, Freddie
looks up at her and makes a sound
He continues straining, and   that what he is reaching for is Lancelot, 's bear
smiles, and lifts  up
She sits on the bed,  on her lap, and hands him the bear
: Here
It's yours
takes it happily
(smiling): You earned it
She kisses his head and rocks him gently
Then she gazes out the window at the stars
92	:  - The light shines from 's window
The   flutters down from the starry sky
It perches in the tree beside the path
