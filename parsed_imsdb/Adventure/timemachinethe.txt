Only the laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak
two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of the century, lingers in the driveway
Beyond all this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve
lonely figure hurries up to the front door and on it impatiently
2 The knock is answered by
, the house- keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair
The   the  with  , an amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes toward: 3 pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient Vintage
Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless, obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the two empty chairs
The silence is accentuated by the merry  of logs in the fireplace and the capricious  of innumerable timepieces about the room
Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly takes his chair
4 is an imposing            (a) businessman, wearing full sideburns
He stares stonily at the last empty chair, then at Filby with annoyance
, a man of the world,       (b) impeccably attired in the latest fashion, welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by lifting his glass of whiskey
, a middle aged man with keen     (c) black piercing eyes, angrily chews on his Havana
Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     (d) as Hillyer glances impatiently at his           (e) watch, comparing time with a - behind him, then snaps it shut and glares at: -

7 The men look at each other until the , away
Dr
Hillyer angrily slaps on the arm of his leather chair
say, this is outright rude of the man
He's undoubtedly been detained
That's all
Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some- thing but is interrupted by (unscrews the cigar from his tight lips) This is such a confounded waste of time
If he's not coming, 've any number of more important things to do
All heads turn as Mrs
Watchett enters, closing the door quietly behind her
With an envelope in her hand she stands there, hesitating
Speak up -- what is it, woman
She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over to Filby and hands him the open envelope
He takes his time in extracting the note
Well
are we or are we not invited to dinner
(reading) Apparently we are
(to Mrs
Watchett) How long has he been gone
(nervously) can't rightly say, sir
- Several days
hardly catch a glimpse of him lately
He never leaves the laboratory and comes out only to nibble at his meals
but he did tell me days ago about dinner tonight and left these instructions
(pointing to note) Thank you, Mrs
Watchett
faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and with that she retreats toward the door
(indicating the note) What does it say, Filby
What's wrong
Nothing really
- George merely says that if he is not here by eight we're to begin without him
Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it hurriedly
Meanwhile, Mrs
Watchett swings the door open and turns around
Dinner is served, gentlemen
(puts his glass down) First sensible thing 've heard all evening
He rises and starts for the dining room
The others follow
,  &  -                      8 As they walk toward the
This is peculiar
He is usually very prompt, precise and punctual
He's making fools of us by inviting us here and then not showing up
It's not the behavior of a gentleman
To say nothing of the waste of time
(agreeing) To say nothing of the waste of time
Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the others settle down
This time the chair at the head of the table is conspicuously unoccupied
(arises, lifting his glass) One thing  will say for George, he keeps the best cellar in the south of England
and Mrs
Watchett is the finest cook in the world
-  think 'll drink to that
The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at the     and a
All look in the direction of another door across the room
-                                     9 It bursts inward and Mrs
Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room
The   with her to the table where the men have come to their feet
Clutching Filby's arm, she points toward the long corridor now revealed by the open door
(frightened) There
there
All stare o
s
, Hillyer with the carving knife clasped in his hand
-                     10 We see the figure of a man approaching, a black silhouette against the pale glow at the end of the passage
He is bent with exhaustion and sways as he moves forward, limping
The man comes closer, his features still blacked out by shadows, but as he nears the doorway, the light from the room strikes first his legs, then his body and finally his face
Here he stops
This is our first meeting with the (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)
At this instant he is in a sorry state
His clothing is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue
For a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light and then takes another swaying step into the room
-                        11 They come to life
Bridewell, noticing the glass of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller
Good lord
- What's happened
Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him
Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr
Hillyer back at the table
The Time Traveller, however, moves forward under his own power
'm all right
just some food
a drink
He reaches the table and sinks into his chair
With trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth
The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile
Are you all right
stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time Traveller empties his glass
(a delayed answer) Of course
'm
all right
Meanwhile, Mrs
Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller like a mother hen
(half apology, half concern) didn't recognize you
it was so dark
The    as she dishes up a bowl of soup for him, but he pushes it away
Meat
'm hungry for meat
Mrs
Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr
Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge portion of beef and loads it onto his plate
12 The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him curiously
Finally Dr
Hillyer leans forward
Well, can't you speak, man
What happened to you
Aren't you going to tell us
Leave him alone, can't you
(swallowing) It's all right
-  want to tell
It will keep, George
Eat, rest a little
No
must tell it now
while still remember
Relax, try to relax a bit
You've all the time in the world
13 As he looks up, amused
You're right, David
(almost to himself) That's exactly what  have
- All the time in the world
ever since we were all together five days ago, the last day of Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine
Slowly the     while everyone listens so intensely that, aside from the Time Traveller's , only the  of a pendulum is heard
: -     -   ()     14 (:  The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot should give the effect of the Ebony Box emerging from the Time Traveller's brain
) ' There in that box rests the result of two years' labor
The    to reveal the
The Time Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe, sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box
Across from him in another chair sits Dr
Hillyer puffing his cigar
Bridewell and Filby have glasses in their hands -- Kemp nothing
All are looking at the box
(continues) wanted to finish the job before the new century began
-  barely made it
Marvelous
(stands up) What is it
Well, it has to do with time
(steps to box) 've always maintained what this nation needs is a reliable timepiece
The Navy needs one
The Army needs one
- For the artillery you know
(leaning forward) Couldn't do better, George
So that's why you've been in hiding
- Clever of you, indeed
(studying the Time Traveller's reaction) don't believe George is referring to a new kind of timepiece
When  speak of time, 'm referring to the fourth dimension
perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face
Dr
Hillyer registers concern
Kemp looks troubled
Only Filby expresses avid interest
Go on, George
Now, as you know, the difficulty in explaining the fourth dimension is that it cannot be seen or felt - it must be thought of
If you don't mind, George, would you refresh me on the first three dimensions
Really, Filby, they must have taught you something at school
(baiting Dr
Hillyer) Suppose you explain it, Doctor
Certainly
(he demonstrates pompously) When  move in a straight line, forward or backward, that's one dimension
- When  move to the left or right, two dimensions
- When  move up and down, three dimensions
(a bright idea lights up his face
At last he can get ahold of the box, but Filby interferes before Dr
Hillyer can get his fingers on it and he has to be satisfied with merely pointing) For instance, this box has three dimensions:  length, breadth, and height
(amazed) Well, then, what's the fourth dimension
Well, that's
that's mere theory
No one can really say what the fourth dimension is or even that it exists
-
15 Leaning forward in his chair
On the contrary, Doctor
The fourth dimension is as true and as real a dimension as any of the other three
In fact, they couldn't exist without it
(enters the ) How do you mean
Well, take that box
It has the first three dimensions, as you said
But what if it didn't exist in Time
It wouldn't exist at all, would it
No
So - for an object to exist at all, it must exist in the fourth dimen- sion
and that fourth dimension is duration
Time
(impatiently) All right
But what's in that box
'm coming to that
But first, consider
Why is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension
Because we have no freedom to move in it
We can move in the other three -- up, down, forward, backward, sideways
But when it comes to Time, we are prisoners
Do you follow me, Anthony
16 In the f
g
, Bridewell who has been sitting with a glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps
George
You've given a most lucid explanation and all that
But don't think  entirely understand
Look
There are a lot of things in the world you don't understand, aren't there
Of course
Quite a number
But you don't refuse to believe in them because of that
Not if  can see the proof with my own eyes
Good
All 'm asking you to do now is to witness a demonstration of the possibility of movement in the fourth dimension
(to Dr
Hillyer) Philip, will you please hand me that box
All eyes turn to Dr
Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness, and takes it to the Time Traveller
George opens it with great care and brings forth a mechanical device [ 13    ] 've told you
The larger model can carry a passenger on a journey through Time
- Not through Space, mind you, but through Time
Oh,  say George
If you start floating around in the future, aren't you likely to mess things up for the rest of us
The future is already there
It's irrevocable and cannot be changed
19 He answers thoughtfully
That's the most important question to which  hope to find an answer
Can Man control his destiny
Can he change the shape of things to come
[ 16    ] ' Imagine that this cigar is the Time Traveller
Now, this lever in front of him controls movement
Forward pressure sends the Machine into the future, backward pressure into the past
And the harder the pressure the faster the Machine travels
-                                    24 All eyebrows are raised
This experiment can be performed only once
If it succeeds,  lose my model forever
That is why need witnesses
They look at each other, uncertain whether he is joking or not
Bridewell stoops with difficulty to examine the table
Go ahead
You're ready then
Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts his finger on the lever
Then he pauses
Doctor Hillyer, would you care to lend me your hand
Dr
Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling weakly
25 Using Dr
Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller presses the lever forward
-  is heard

-                         29 The sudden silence is almost unbearable
They stare at the empty table
The
(touches his cigar pocket) 'll be damned
(almost to himself) It worked
Filby swallows
Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table
Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of reach as he can
Then, suddenly reversing his decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down
30 31 Dr
Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller
Where did it go
(recovering) Go
Nowhere in the usual sense
It's still here
(indicating space where the Machine stood) But it's no longer in the present
It's traveling through time - to the future, to be precise
Do you seriously expect us to believe that
Certainly
But you just said it hasn't really moved
That's correct
Then why can't we see it
Because we're in this room on December 31st, 1899, while the model you saw is perhaps a hundred years away
This room, or even this house, may no longer exist a hundred years from now
But the Time Machine is occupying the same space it did a moment before it went off on its journey
Dr
Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table
(exasperated) If it occupies the same space, should be able to feel it
You must remember that the space you've just put your hand through is today's space
You can't put your hand into the space of tomorrow
(getting angry) Space is space
It doesn't change
The same space that is here now should be here a hundred or even a thousand years from now
No
Time changes space
This flat ground we're standing on now could have been at the bottom of the sea a million years ago
And a million years from now it could be the interior of a huge mountain
Dr
Hillyer turns away, speechless
32 Kemp steps forward
Suppose what you say is true
Exactly what do you suggest we do with such a contraption
For my part,  intend to take a journey into the future
- Unless someone else prefers to volunteer
There is no response
(chuckling) say, George
Suppose you go off and get lost in the fiftieth century
How will you find your way back
(quite serious) That's a calculated risk 'm prepared to take
Dr
Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an air of reasonableness
Now listen, George
don't know what you take us for, but we're not fools
There are a number of ways of doing a disappearing trick
But a man of your ability should not bother with such nonsense
-                       33 He gets up from his chair
(unable to resist the temptation for sarcasm) There's a war on, you know
The Boers are putting up a pretty stiff fight in South Africa and our country needs inventors like you
can put you in touch with the War Office if you wish
He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box with its lid open
Filby is in the b
g
(looks up at Filby) What do you think
(hesitating slightly, and then) think Dr
Hillyer has a point, George
Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the Ebony Box, then closes it with a
He looks up and nods
Now you're being sensible
'll take care of it first thing in the New Year
34 Everyone rises
Well, time to go
Yes, we all have our plans for tonight
Dr
Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door
Bridewell lingers at the table where the model of the Time Machine disappeared
(concerned) Are you all right, George
Of course,  am
' Coming, Bridewell
Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed by the Time Traveller
-                           35 While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs, gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and grasps the handle
Thanks for coming
He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell at the rear
Happy New Year
- Goodbye, George - Happy Twentieth Century
- Etc
Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder, reassuringly
-   - () - ()            36 In contrast to the previous  (Sc
l) this is a snow- less wintery day
The visitors are boarding the carriage that awaits them in the drive
Come on, Bridewell
Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then submits and, with a    , the carriage moves off
-                                37 The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door- way, waves to them
38 As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving
From the opposite direction another carriage full of by
In early New Year's Eve they  their toy  at the Time Traveller
39 Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the cottage
-                            40 The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his back against it, staring into space
Thinking
- He spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by one of his guests, and picks it up
:                                       40- in military fashion  the headline that the Boer Army has won another victory

He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution strides toward: 41-56 -                                 57 The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in the f

He stands there and even in the darkness that he is an angry man
He strikes a match and lights the overhead gas fixture
The light comes up and the   as he stares across the room to see: -

thought 'd better stay
' You needn't have troubled yourself
'm all right
No you're not
- You've been behaving oddly for over a month now
(and then) 'm not leaving until you tell me what's on your mind
-
59 Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs the coals
The
appreciate your gesture, David, but if you don't mind 'd rather you left me alone
You have changed, George
Enormously
'm sorry
(looks up to him directly) Will you answer me one question honestly
'll try
Why this preoccupation with Time
(sharply) Why not
Don't go simple on me, George
(a beat, then calmly) If you want to know the truth, don't much care for the time  was born into
- It seems people aren't dying fast enough these days
They call upon science to invent new, more efficient weapons to depopulate the earth
quite agree with you
But here we are and we have to make the best of it
You may have to
don't
(making a half- hearted attempt at levity) All right
Take a journey on your contraption
What would you become
Greek
Roman
One of the Pharaohs
prefer the future
You're not seriously saying you can do it
You saw the experiment this afternoon, didn't you
saw a toy machine vanish
But 'm certain there are a number of ways of doing that trick
Any magician at the Hippodrome could probably do it
(angrily) It was no trick
- Would you care to see the full-scale model
No,  would not
have no desire to tempt the laws of Providence and don't think you should
It's not for man to trifle with
Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp
There is something in their common sense attitude to life
(and then) George,  speak to you as a friend
More, as a brother
If that machine can do what you say it can
destroy it
Destroy it, George, before it destroys you
Distant  of  '  are
You must have plans for New Year's Eve
Don't let me keep you
Mary isn't well
We decided to stay home with the baby
But why don't you come home with me
You haven't seen little Jaime for a long time
can't
What's stopping you
just want to see the old century out by myself
(rising) Have it your own way
He goes to the door
60 Filby stops, then turns around
Will you promise me that you won't leave the house tonight
promise you,  won't walk out of the door
Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and steps up to him
David
Please don't think me un- friendly
- Come over to dinner - next Friday
Won't you
Very well
Fine
and will you bring the others with you
(with a warm smile) Whatever you say, George
- Happy New Year
(shaking hands) And a very happy New Year to you, David
Filby pats his arm before he leaves
The Time Traveller stands there until he hears the
Then, , he goes to the writing table and sits down
61 The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century
" He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots down the dinner engagement
At this point Mrs
Watchett, with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears in the doorway and walks up to him
Will you be having supper in this evening, sir
(while ex- changing jackets with Mrs
Watchett's help) don't think so, Mrs
Watchett
Why don't you take the evening off and celebrate
Thank you, sir, but if you won't be needing me  think 'll turn in early and get some sleep
(indicating revelers outside) it  can
- Goodnight, sir
Goodnight
She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her
Oh, Mrs
Watchett
(as she responds) 've invited Mr
Filby and the others to dinner next Friday
(and then) Happy New Year, Mrs
Watchett
Happy New Year, sir
Mrs
Watchett exits, closing the door after her
Once again the Time Traveller is alone
He looks at the old calendar that reads:  "December 3l
1899," rips the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it burns
With slow and deliberate movements he replaces the old calendar with the new one
Then, he hastily scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and places it prominently on the table
He rises and mounts the steps that lead to: -                              62 The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door at the end of the passageway
Here he pauses momentarily, removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then slowly swings it open as the   the  of the picture
-   - ()                  63 The laboratory has the appearance of having once been a greenhouse
Only a few potted plants remain
The glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by rows of tall growing plants
Only the glass skylight is clear
Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass- ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving the interior a maze of dark shadows
As the slow mov- ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps through and we  workbenches, numerous tools, sheets of drawings and scientific instruments situated around the perimeter
But the most conspicuous object in the room is the Time Machine
It is a duplicate of the miniature model already seen
However, its size gives it a majestic quality
Nickel, ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle
While the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the full size Machine has an ominous look
The wavering moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the power of movement
-                    64 Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts- manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement, then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle
Here a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer
The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it sparkles like a fine cut diamond
As he works, his lips purse and he softly    the melancholy strains of "The Land Of The Leal
"   clock near him on the workbench reads:  "9:30
" Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming handle and crosses to the Machine
He settles into the saddle and affixes the crystalline lever
There is no sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his settling himself into the saddle is any more than a routine position he has taken before to work on the Machine
Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at: :   - (   )         65 Passing clouds
66 He looks upwards for several moments
Then his hand slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the lever
- Gently he urges it forward
, similar to the one made by the model, but   starts and a soft glow wells up from within the Machine
:                                 67 The luminous dials show:  "31 December 1899
"  The meters and indicators start to  and whirl
The glow increases
68 His expression is taut as he looks around, then down to the control panel
' started
and the laboratory grew faint around me
69 The figures spin, the needles vibrate
Then almost at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine

'  (excited) The clock said 9:31 when  started and now it was 11:O9
and the candle, shorter by inches
72 He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch from his pocket by its gold chain
It flips open showing almost "9:32
" ' And yet by my watch which was in the machine with me, only a few seconds had passed
Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the lever, looking off toward the: - ()                                73 The    again and, while the hands of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the candle down
The   to the window where the frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow
Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like gems and the sun starts to rise

trace of a smile -- and then, he looks up and squints

Dust falls as he opens it and enters the corridor

Everything is overgrown with vines and flowers
The house is boarded up
He starts to wander around, thinking, investigating
(:  The house is situated upon a site with distinctive landmarks that will stay recognizable during his journey into the future, thereby giving a clear conception that time-travelling does not involve geographical movement
For instance, the sharp curve of the River Thames in the distance will remain even after the house itself has disappeared

The sign above the entrance reads: "Filby's Department Store"

The driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of the First World War, steps out of the car
The Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend, sans moustache
96 (glibly) Going to a masquerade, David
You look rather silly without your moustache, old man
(puzzled) Were you addressing me, sir
(positively) Filby
expected more of an enthusiastic greeting from

There was a remarkable resemblance

Were you a friend of father's
Yes

Oh, him
Some inventor who disappeared around the turn of the century
- If you're interested in that house, forget it
You can't buy it or even go inside
Why is that
My father was executor of the inventor's estate and he refused to liquidate it
(adds with a smile) often chided him on that account, but he felt positive that the owner would return some day
- Some people hereabouts think it's haunted
(stares at Time Traveller curiously, studying the strange cut of his clothes) Who are you, sir
Just a stranger who once knew your father
see
(still curious at the Time Traveller's abstract attitude) Have you been at the front, sir
Front
What front
Why the war, of course
What war
Great heavens, man, don't you know we've been at war with Germany since nineteen fourteen
thought perhaps you had seen action in France
or maybe
(noticing confusion, adds with a note of compassion) Perhaps a cup of tea would make you feel better
Won't you come in
No
no, thank you
You're sure you're alright, sir
Yes, 'm quite alright
(hesitantly) Then
goodbye, sir
The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the Department Store
97 He speaks almost to himself
Goodbye, Jaime
With the bitter taste of death for his old friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the street and returns to the cottage
-                              98 The Time Traveller approaches the Machine, steps up into the seat, throws his head back and grimly shoves the lever forward

During this: ' began to grow fond of that mannequin

He looks down at the instruments

The instruments vibrate erratically
108 He stares at the dials with much concern as he is  back and forth in his Machine

The sky is pierced with ack ack
Then, following the sound
, a dog fight ensues
Several of the planes are hit and plummet earthward, balls of streaking flame and fire

' The last time  had stopped was in nineteen seventeen, twenty three years ago

The dials spin from 1940 to 1959 where the and the dials again come to a stop

115 Dressed in the sleek dress of the future
First a distant, then a close    , menacingly

Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder
The running is purposive, however
All are entering particular buildings or, like those closest to the Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the sidewalk down below street level

He gathers her up in his arms and rushes back to safety
In a few seconds the streets are deserted

' At first  wondered if my Machine and were the cause of the panic

The Time Traveller pulls himself free
Listen to me

That's important
The Warden runs, looks back over shoulder, calling

The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the Alarmed, he runs across the street directly in the path of the ambulance that threads its way between the cars left in disorder on the road
The driver spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller

The ground shudders with an  sound and sudden a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as though the earth were being torn apart

The lower parts of the struct- ures in the f

dissolve into smoke and flame and the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising red flood
Then the incoming rush of the river meets the flowing tide of lava
The two opposite elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and meet with explosive fury
The air is rent with the of water and the  of cooling rock
Steam whitens the sky

134 The interior of the Machine is permeated with a dull red glow which seems to flow like mist all about the Time Traveller
' Only my speed through time saved me from being roasted alive and encased in stone forever

His eyes search the growing darkness

Then he looks up
-   -   - ()      145 The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon clawed feet support the white marble figure of an immense Sphinx
The figure has the face of a woman, the body of a huge cat and the tail of a serpent
weeping birch tree barely touches its outspread wings

146 He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, , rises with difficulty
Still half- dazed he presses a handkerchief to his temple, as he loosens his collar, then reaches into the Machine, pockets the lever and surveys his surroundings
-   - ()                        147 It looks like a garden untended for centuries
The trees and shrubs are laden with strange blossoms or exotic fruits
In the distance there is a building that might once have been a temple
Vines mat the ancient walls, seemingly holding them together

153 Shooting through the  we see the Time Traveller mount the steps and enter the building
-   - () - ()      154 In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller halts
He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted ceiling
Although ancient in appearance, everything is ultra modern in design
Sunlight streams through windows where half the panes of stained glass are broken
Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along the walls, and at random about the floor are low tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls of fruit
His   through the great hall as the Time Traveller crosses to: -
155 The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of exotic fruit
Everything looks fresh and clean as though newly prepared
Yet there is no indication of life or sound, either human or animal
The air hangs in a deathlike stillness
Slowly the Time Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to this strange place
There is none
Then he picks up an empty marble plate and with it on the top of the table
(shouting) Anyone here
But an  is his only answer
Curiously he re- traces his steps and leaves the great hall
-   - ()                     156 Pick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along
Every sense he possesses is on the alert
His eyes probe every bush and tree and object that could possibly conceal some person or thing
157-161 As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk, of the various innocent objects he looks at with  of Time Traveller as he reacts to the bewildering  and lack of life or movement
The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows as he moves along
The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum
-                             162 As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees, he hesitates, then moves into the forest
163-166 The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles to penetrate the maze
The Time Traveller walks with continued wariness through the trees, glancing from left to right and occasionally stopping dead still and quickly darting a glance behind him at what he imagines to be some sound of movement
But all this is imaginary on his part
There is nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite  combination of
The and
He hurries to some dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out

At considerable distance upstream, the are swimming in a natural pool and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand
They are small, but delicately formed
Their grace and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new world
The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it from a high waterfall
Below the pool the stream emerges in a swift torrent
,                                     168 beautiful , dressed in a silken robe of white and gold, starts running
As she runs, she loosens her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep into the crystal water
169 He smiles philosophically and leans back against a tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured
(musingly, to himself) So this is man's future
170 The people, apparently without any cares of the world, play, romp and swim
(o
s
) to bask in the sunlight, bathe in the clear streams and eat the fruits of earth with all knowledge of work and hardship forgotten
171 He pauses, thinking back on what he has just said
Well, and why not
Suddenly a     from the pool
He turns

The other people turn their heads toward her, but make no move to help
173 She has caught a ledge of rock and clings
Two little men, their bare feet dangling in the water, sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight
-                             174 He jumps out from the foliage, rushes to the bank, points toward the Girl and tries to attract the attention of those near her on the bank
Help her
No one moves
He runs toward the ledge
175 Her grasp on the ledge grows weaker
She is at the point of letting go
-                             176 Reaching the ledge, he pushes past the people nearby and grasps the Girl's wrist just as her fingers slip
Quickly, he pulls her out of the river's turbulent current and lifts her up in his arms
-                                   177 Looking up at the Time Traveller bewildered, she shows neither fear nor gratitude
-                         178 Gazing back at the Girl thoroughly puzzled
He turns and glances down at the two little people on the ledge
179 These two men will later be known as the and the
They return the Time Travel- ler's look of scorn with pleasant smiles as if they do not know the meaning of a mean look

He looks at her for the first time sees the almost ultimate in feminine beauty
Are you all right
&  -                        181 Wearing his velvet jacket very appealingly, she calmly rises, turns and, without a word, walks away
The Time Traveller stares after her in astonishment
The disconcerned people, now all dressed in multi- colored robes, are leaving the pool
They walk past the Time Traveller as though he was a part of the scenery, merely adding to his confusion
182 Perplexed

The sun is sinking as the last stragglers of the little people enter the great hall
The Time Traveller slowly follows them
He pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back to either welcome him or resent his intrusion, but they move on with lack of interest, completely
He sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this utter indifference
-
184 Seated on the steps leaning against a column
He senses another's presence, looks about, sees no one, then turns to glance over his shoulder
The Girl, now wearing her robe and holding his jacket over her arm, appears from behind the column
He looks at her and smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her
- She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and returns his jacket
While he slowly slips it on, she slides down a step to sit alongside him
Why did you
Why did  what
Come after me
(ironic) did it to save your life, young lady, which 'm afraid doesn't hold much meaning for you or anyone else
(simply) It doesn't
Must have been fifty of your friends watching you drown
Not one of them so much as lifted a finger
- (shakes his head) curious attitude - in a curious world
(a pause, then a smile) Aren't you the least bit interested in what  am
where  come from
(innocently) Should  be
(smiles) Perhaps you'd better take me to someone a bit older  can talk to
There is no one older
The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth of her words
All of the little people seem to be of the Girl's age or younger
Doesn't anyone age in this land of yours
The Girl makes no reply
Instead she gazes off at the sun which is low in the heavens
Shadows have already fallen over the distant hills
What's your name
Weena
How do you spell that
Spell
Write
- Can't you write
Look
He bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw on the ground
:                                            185 As the stick writes out: "      " 186 She shows little interest
And what are your people called
(as if he ought to know) Eloi
187 The stick now writes in the dust: "     " 188 shadow crosses her face
Suddenly she springs to her feet, concerned
Come
We must go in

What's wrong
(anxiously) It is getting dark
She grabs his hand and pulls him toward: -   - (
) - ()     189 Crowded now
The people of the future are sitting on cushions around the tables, having their evening meal
The glowing orange light of the setting sun pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at- mosphere to the place
No one pays attention to Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the b
g
-
190 score of attractive young men and young women are enjoying their dinner
There is a general atmos- phere of bubbling good humor
They don't even look up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the table
She hands him an orange-sized raspberry
He takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White who sit across the table from him and tries to engage them in conversation
(directed to Young Man, but meant for the entire group) don't mind telling you, 'm quite hungry
've come a long, long way
Looks around for some kind of a reaction
There is none
191 He bites into the fruit
It's good
While he is eating he searches for another way to bring up the subject
In my time a berry this size would have made news in every civilized country
192 There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man again
Sir, perhaps curiosity has died
Perhaps even courtesy has died, but have come a long way and there are things  would like to know
(considers a moment, then) Why
Because  shall return to my time and they will ask questions such as what kind of government rules your world
We have no government
(speaking as though to a child) You must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws
There are no laws
(taken aback, then) How do you get your food and clothing
The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him
They both shrug their shoulders
Doesn't anyone work
No
(picks up fruit) Then where does this come from
It grows
It always grows
But it must be planted, cultivated, nurtured
unless
(with mistaken insight as he observes no reaction to this last query) Unless you have an economy so well organized that you can devote all your time to study and experimentation
Am  right
You ask many questions
(annoyed) Yes
And 'm not ashamed of it
That is how man has learned and bettered himself
must learn about you and your civilization
You have books, don't you
(recognizing a half-forgotten word) Books
- Books
Yes, we have books
He rises and beckons
The Time Traveller's brow clears
Books will tell me what  want to know
Books will tell me all about you
He too gets up and follows the Young Man
-                                  193 The Young Man leading
He reaches the wall and seizes an ancient curtain which covers it cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the curtain falls, almost crumbling
Shelves and shelves of books are disclosed
The books are old even though many of them have futuristic de- signs
The bindings of once proud volumes hang in brown tatters
The Time Traveller steps to the books
194 The realization of the true state of affairs shows on his face
He is appalled
Carefully he pulls a volume from the shelf
Its binding breaks as he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages, they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor
He drops the book
His voice is a shocked
Yes
they do tell me all about you
With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole shelf of books
His hand plows through them and the dust swirls into the air
He turns back in anger
What have you done
Thousands of years of building and rebuilding creating and re-creating so that you can let it crumble to dust
With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him
million yesterdays of sensitive men dying for their dreams
For what
So you can swim and dance and play
He releases him and leaves
-                                   195 The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating them for their dissipation
Without emotion they watch him walk toward the entrance
Only Weena jumps to her feet
Her former indifference is gone
196 From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down at them
am returning to my time
Not to tell of the uselessness of the struggle - not to tell of the hopeless future - but only so that can die among men
He turns and strides toward the door
-
- ()                     197 The Time Traveller bursts out of the building moment later Weena appears in the archway
She stands there, looking after him
: -   - ()                      198 There are patches of mist and haze between the trees
With a blazing torch the Time Traveller strides across
- ()              199 Coming from the distance the , where he stops short, jerking the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con- sternation
He raises the torch high to see: -   - ()                    200 There is no Time Machine
201 In stunned shock
-                                     202 Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn looking for his Machine, beating the branches with his free hand
After he passes one of the bushes, a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and disappears in the darkness
Unaware of this, the Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn where the Machine was last seen
(:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot where the Time Traveller's house once stood
) He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle
Meanwhile the
Then, sud- denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he had removed and looks at it with self-assurance
Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes the grass
-  '
203 The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as though some heavy object had been dragged across
following these grooves and  where small misshapen, half-human foot- prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned earth
-                             204 He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed
Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow- ing the grooves
205 the grooves straight across the lawn to the flagstones around the white sphinx
There are dark scratches on the stones leading to the wide panel in the base of the pedestal
Here the marks end
-
206 The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an exploratory
It responds with a
The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the claws of the sphinx
With both hands now free, he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either to right or left or up or down
Taking a penknife from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's edge hunting for a secret latch
No success
Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a loosened flagstone
He picks it up
With this heavy weight he batters the panel
At each blow it  , not unlike a gong
Four times he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock shatters in his hands
He stops in despair
207 He senses he is under observation by an unseen presence
Alarmed, he whips around then looks up to: -   - (  )          208 The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in the torch light
209 He turns and peers toward: 210 In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the flame of the torch
-                               211-213 He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly paces toward the nearest bush
But as he ap- proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze, followed by a ghostly impression of pale, fleeing creatures
The Time Traveller halts and turns in another direction
The same thing happens
Then he has an idea
Bending, he beats the torch against the moist soil and extinguishes it
Now in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering around until he hears a twig , then moves into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off
214 Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure approaches slowly
It emerges onto the lawn
-
215 The   as he leaps forward, grapples the other figure and bears it to earth
For a moment there is a struggle and then the other figure lies perfectly still
The Time Traveller rears back to get a look at it
-             216 It is Weena
The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror
She appears to be waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does not come, she slowly opens her eyes
She sees the Time Traveller and her face records a wave of relief
The      as the Time Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up
heard you pounding
came to tell you
How do you open that panel
No one opens it
Only the Morlocks
Morlocks
- Who are the Morlocks
look of fear comes into her eyes
She drifts her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer
Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns her to face him
Why are you afraid of the Morlocks
Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her head back so that her eyes meet his
Tell me
When they call, we must go below
Do the Morlocks live beneath the earth
(Weena nods) Why must you obey their command
They give us the food we eat, the clothes we wear
We must do as they command
What happens to your people when they go below
(repressing an in- voluntary shudder) No one knows
No one has ever returned
(smiling at her warmly, reassuringly) It won't happen to you
Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find- ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot understand
Then she glances high into the dark sky and the old fear returns
It is night
Only children are frightened by the dark
- But then you are a child, aren't you
(Weena glances around warily into the shadows, her anxiety mounting) 'll build a fire
(taking his hand, rises) Let us go from here
(getting up) can't, child
(walking toward the sphinx) My Machine is inside there, intend to wait here 'til morning, then find some way of getting inside
(catching up) No, you must not
(stops, then) Help me gather some wood
-                        217 Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which she hands over to him
Where are you from
(picks up dry branches) As a matter of fact, 'm from right here
(gesturing) There's where my house stood many thousands of years ago
Here - to that monument, was my laboratory
About there was my library where once sat talking with friends about my Time Machine
Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the bushes in the f
g
218 She watches every move he makes
' (continuing) hoped to learn a great deal hoped to take back the knowledge, the advancement, mankind made
instead what do  find
Vegetables
Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly from behind her
-
219 With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks
(continuing) The human race reduced to living vegetables
220 The hairy hands grab her shoulders
The fear paralyzes her
She is unable to scream
221 He is about to light a match, but finds he needs more wood
Without turning he calls back to Weena
Get me a few more twigs
When there is no answer he turns and looks
222 Weena is gone
The    , then to and finally  on the limp legs of Weena slowly disappearing under the brush
-                             223 We hear the    and quick as the   with the Time Traveller toward the bush
He helps Weena to her feet and draws her to the pile of dry branches
(after calming her) What was it
(low) Morlocks
(strikes match and holds it to twigs) This seems to keep them away
224 She gazes into the fire, with fascination
Slowly she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the flame
225 The Time Traveller grabs her hand
It is almost too late
She looks at her burned hand with more amazement than pain
(while examining her hand) What ever made you put your hand in the fire
never saw it before
Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases her hand
He shakes his head in amazement and sits down beside her
(after a long silence) Do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of fire
(he looks at her) No,  suppose you don't
(pokes at fire) The next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel
(turns to her) Do you know what that is
(she shakes her head) 'm sorry  was angry with your people
had no right to be
No more than if  had visited the Island of Bali in my own time
You were safe inside your great house, yet you came out into the night to warn me
The one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice
You have that quality, Girl
'm sure all of your people have it
All it requires is someone to reawaken it
shall try if you'll let me
Will you
do not understand you, but believe you
That's a good start
- Now try to tell me
who or what are the Morlocks
(Weena looks at him blankly) Are they people or animals
(her expression remains unchanged) What do you know about yourself
The past
Don't your people ever speak of the past
There is no past
Don't you ever wonder about the future
There is no future
226 The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of the words
Man's past is mainly a grim struggle for survival, but there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up
These rare moments have made the history of man a glorious thing refuse to believe it is dead and gone
We've had our dark ages before and this is only another of them
All you need is for someone to show you the way out
- 'm only a tinkering mechanic, but there must be this hidden spark in one of your people
If  can only kindle that spark, my coming here will have some meaning
During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him, her cheek touching his knee
He looks down at her and sees he has made a friend
He places his hand gently on her hair
She looks up, her eyes no longer showing fear
Their faces are illuminated by the dancing flames
-                                    227 It  reassuringly
: -   - ()                          228 The ring of flames from the previous scene is seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from which comes the low  of some , pounding, beating monotonously
The to include the where more wells are visible in the distance, each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall
Their roofs are shining brass-like disks
Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx, approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena
' My efforts next morning to open the panel were fruitless
had to find another way to retrieve my Machine
Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller walks up to the well in the f

and peers down into: -                                   229 It descends into darkness, but near the top can be seen handholds in an irregular pattern

turns back to Weena
Listen

(fearfully) Yes
Machines
No
Morlocks
(straightening, amazed) You mean those animals run machines
They are Morlocks

231 She shakes her head
No, only heard of them
The    to include the Time Traveller as he reaches her
Who told you
The talking rings
(moves closer to her) What sort of rings
(with a shrug) Rings that talk
Can you show me these rings
Weena nods and starts off
He follows her
: -   - ()                    232 Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books that the Young Man had previously shown him
She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone corridor
He follows
-
233 Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor where it veers sharply to the right
They disappear around the corner
-   - () - ()        234 The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish colored porcelain-like substance
There are no windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course of day, illuminate the entire museum
It is evidently a place that no one bothers to visit
&  -                     235 Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still existent behind plastic
Some of the cases are broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos- phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust
We recognize objects and machines, some belonging to the early part of the twentieth century and still others take on the forms and shapes that the audience of today will recognize as contemporary
Then they pass cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond comprehension
Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken case which contains several boxes of golden rings a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined with minutely spaced grooves
He picks up the nearest box and examines its contents
(picking up a ring) Are these the talking rings
Yes
They speak
Yes
Of what
Things no one here understands
How do you get it to talk
Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top
:                                    236 emerges from the spinning ring as the current of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono- graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the surface of one of our records
Whomsoever chances upon these rings will probably hear the last recorded voice of civilized man
This is the year four thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine
237 The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and Weena in disinterested detachment
(cont'd) The war between the East and West, which is now in its three hundredth and twenty-sixth year has at last come to an end
There is nothing left to fight with and few of us left to fight
The atmosphere has become so polluted with deadly germs that it can no longer be breathed
There is no place on this planet that is immune
The last surviving factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed
Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing and when they are gone, we must die
The last few     and
The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for the second ring and spins it
This is the last day
We, the last to survive, have had our final meeting
We have decided to split into two groups
Each man and woman has made his own decision
Some have chosen to take refuge in the great caverns and find a new way of life far down below the earth's surface
The rest of us have decided to take our chances in the sunlight, small as those chances may be
The  from the ring  and is heard no more
The Time Traveller quickly picks up the third and last ring and spins it

238 As he watches the last ring spin to a standstill
Over this: ' From the talking rings  learned how the human race divided itself and how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks began

-                                 239 The Time Traveller paces across the hall
Weena hurries after him
' By some quirk of fate the Morlocks had become the masters and the Eloi their servants
The Morlocks main- tained them and bred them like cattle only to take them below when they reached maturity, which explained why there were no older people along them
They exit
-                                   240 The Time Traveller, followed by Weena, walks from the book shelves toward the entrance
' Now  knew  must go below
It was the only means of finding a way up into the sphinx to reach my Machine and to find out what happened to the little people when they went below
They leave the Great Hall
-   - ()                     241 The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells
Weena senses his intention and catches up with him to grasp his arm
No
don't go
please
He shakes her off
-
242 The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall
Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of sight by the current from the shaft
Then he looks around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and listens
After a  is heard he puts his arm down the shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts to descend
Weena rushes to his side to stop him
You will not come back
'll be back
Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his pocket
The Time Traveller smiles as he dis- appears
-                          243 Locking from below, the top of the well appears like a small blue disk with Weena peering down
The Time Traveller gropes his way
Suddenly from the far distance comes the  of but
Weena straightens
244 An expression of fear comes slowly over her face as the   is joined by  of The Two make a grating dissonance
Slowly she turns in the direction of the sound
245 He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent
246 As the    joins the other two, Weena's fear is gone
In its place is an expres- sion of utter resignation
Like someone in a trance she opens her eyes and stares straight ahead
Then, as though she is summoning all her strength to go through some ordeal, she starts walking away
The   and we see the breeze ripple her silken robe about her as she moves

She is nowhere to be seen
His face shows exasperation, bewilderment

)                      253-254 In the open country now, the forest behind them
In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly across the green landscape

There are little bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe organ behind the Sphinx
258 All of them walk in the same direction
The Time Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered
But the Eloi disregard him and march straight ahead, eyes forward
The Time Traveller breaks into a run
259 The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes his arm and jerks him to a halt
Around them pass the shadows of the marching Eloi
What's happening
Tell me
The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to free himself
His movements are almost mechanical
This unnerves the Time Traveller
He stares at him, releasing his grip
The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about and continues his march
The Time Traveller re- mains motionless, watching him go
The are now getting on his nerves

)  261 From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes are moving, singly and in long files
The impres- sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind is marching to some unknown doom
-                             262 He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind
But it is not Weena
Disappointed, he releases her, then goes on again, covering his ears with his palms, fighting to retain command of his own reason

But now the panel, upon which the Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open, revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal
And despite their previous repugnance to the Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across the lawn resolutely to it
-                              268 The Young Man is the first to reach it
He enters the wide opening and starts descending into sub- terranean darkness
Others follow, Weena among them

Without hearing him she passes through the entrance

The crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on

He spreads his palms against it in despair, then turns to face those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside
What he sees astonishes him
271 They no longer approach the sphinx
The ceasing of the sirens seems to have released them from their hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened, they are retreating
272 As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones and calls out angrily
Stop

) What are you running from
None of the Eloi answer
-                            274 Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in the shadow of the white sphinx
He steps slowly forward onto the lawn, looking around the big semi-circle of his audience
(sharply, gesturing back toward the panel) Where have they gone
(no answer) What happens to them
(no answer) Don't stand there like a fatted cattle grazing contentedly in lush pastures
- Answer me
What's wrong
(calmly) There is nothing wrong
It is all clear
What do you mean, all clear
(repeating) All clear
(thinking rapidly, talking to himself) Once
in the middle nineteen hundreds  heard a man
(it bursts upon him) The falling bombs
(to the Man in white and the crowd) That's over
Gone
Dead for hundreds of thousand of years
There are no more flying machines
No bombs
No wars
Yes, the rings have told us that story
-                                275 But you didn't listen
You didn't learn anything
All that is left is fear
a blind animal fear
Ages ago men were taught to hide in the ground when the sirens blew
taught to run from a raining death
but those men are dead
And so are the men who slaughtered them
Don't you understand
(looks around pleadingly) You are slaves of a dead past
You don't even own your souls
You're led to slaughter like sheep
(o
s
) But there is nothing to fear now, it's all clear
What about those who went below
How are they to come back
276 He looks ominously at the Time Traveller
They never come back
Nobody can bring them back
Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man in White following them
277 Calling after them
You can try
Won't any of you even try
He sees that the situation is hopeless
(almost to himself) Well, someone has to try
He runs off
278 The Time Traveller running through the forest
(a) He is laboring up the open hillside
(b) The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch
few       (c) of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller
-   - ()                      279 Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts to descend
Over this a faint    can be heard
-                         280 The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls with his hands and feet
The depth beneath him is dizzying
-                                  281 As the Time Traveller descends, the him, step after step
The deeper he goes, the darker it becomes and the     as well
Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight
He barely saves himself
Not without fear he pauses to rest, glancing upward
-                      282 couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching the Time Traveller's progress
283 metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally to the opening of a transverse passageway
In almost complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his belt, but decides not to light it
He bends and peers ahead
-                            283X1 The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b
g
, pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall
The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver- ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and grotesque shadows

pauses, then slowly enters
Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the
strikes a match
The sight that the
beholds fills him with revulsion and horror
-
'
283X4 This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks
In the flickering light we see stone tables and scattered around the floor far below the unmistak- able remains of human bones after the flesh has been carnivorously picked away
' So, this was the destiny of the Eloi
283X5 His features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match

The match dies between his fingers
Suppressing a shudder, the

Another in the b

does likewise
-                                     283X6 Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending the needs of their machinery
They look up toward the intruder as they  his  , then hide

slowly descends the slender stone stairway that hugs the sheer wall
Meanwhile at the base of the feasting room under the stairway on which the
is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals itself
It silently watches as another Morlock appears at the top of the stairs and follows
[ 89A    ] 283X15 Passing near the
's hiding place
Weena and the Young Man are side by side
283X16 The Morlocks who followed the
are closing in
-                               283X17 He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him
Hugging the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible point where he can still remain unobserved by the herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention
He reaches out
Weena
But she continues on with complete resignation to her fate
Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid- ing place and grasps her by the shoulders
(shaking her) Girl
(he turns and grasps the passing Young Man) Come to your senses
All of you
As the
pulls Weena toward the staircase, the Young Man follows

Suddenly a long lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils about the
's neck
He drops his unlit torch and whirls in pain
Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of horrors, while several other whips land on the
's shoulders
Finally he grabs the whip from around his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free
283X23 The
, wielding the whip fiercely, drives the Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him, knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip
On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles away leaving the

Once more the  , then still seeing through the Morlocks' eyes the and the scaley hand of a Morlock slaps all the matches except one to the floor

283X29 He lights his last match and moves forward, looking for his lost torch
283X30 The
leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the light of the match his only weapon in keeping the Morlocks away
Finally he spots his torch and picks it up hurriedly
283X31 His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre- hension while he applies the dying match to the intended torch
(muttering) Burn, will you
He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and lower without starting the wood
In despair he turns to Weena
Quick, something to burn
It's my last match
283X32 As they are closing in
283X33 With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds it out
283X34 As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the cloth
It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the dead match
He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and in this hotter flame it begins to burn
Once it starts he again attempts to make his way by blind- ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway
283X35 As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway, one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip strikes the torch out of the
's hand
283X36 The torch rolls in and begins to sputter
283X37 The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the As they face one another, the fight begins
[ 90    ] Eloi below him
Weena
Weena, get the torch
-                           351X5 Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then turns searching for the flickering torch
351X6 As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge
Morlock swings at him
He ducks and almost falls off ledge
He grabs Morlock, and hangs on until he can scramble up on ledge again
He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his head against the rock wall, finally throwing him off ledge
At the same time another Mor- lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he had previously kicked rises to menace him from the other side
The Time Traveller jumps across cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor, trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon against the Morlocks
-                           351X7 He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall
He sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently too confused to move
Weena
Go on
Go on the steps
-   -                 351X8 Weena spots the still flickering torch and starts toward it
351X9 Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock appears facing her
She screams and jumps back, watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward her
351X10 The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several Morlocks converging on him
He tries to fight his way past them
-                           351X11 Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting Cave
-                               351X12 up on ramp, kicks back at Morlocks - sees Morlock carrying Weena -  through Morlocks and runs toward her
351X13 The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away from Morlock, knocks him against rock
In the meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down
The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him
-                              351X14 Looks up toward   - silently appeals for help
-                                   351X15 Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the Time Traveller's silent plea for help
Slowly raises his right hand, stares at it as he gradually clenches it into a fist
Then, making up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor- lock hard on the back of his neck
351X16 As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs to get his torch
Several Morlocks try to herd Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the Eloi resist them
The Time Traveller runs back in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs
351X17 The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs pushing Weena ahead of him
They climb up past Cauldron
Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi, shielding their eyes from the light of the Time Traveller's torch
351X18 The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the Eloi are all on their way out
Then turns back and drops his torch into the oil flowing into the Cauldron
351X19 The burning torch catches the Cauldron on fire, which quickly spreads across the floor of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on the right, which explodes
The Time Traveller herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge
351X20 Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of burning Cauldron hiding his face from the flames
He bumps into the Pipe coming down the wall, loses his balance and falls into the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher
351X21 Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine at same time as fire - and it explodes
Morlock catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave
-                                   352 Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena run toward a circle of light on the floor far ahead
-                             353 Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light that comes straight down from above, and look up the shaft
Smoke belches from the passage- way as he helps her start up the ladder and then he, himself, follows, clambering out of sight
354 The   Weena and the Time Traveller climbing up,  from smoke
The light becomes slowly brighter and he looks up
-                          355 Gradually the top of the well becomes visible through the swirling smoke
The Young Man is peering down
He reaches to help Weena and the Time Traveller
-                         356 Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with soot, near exhaustion
Far below them red flames pierce through the smoke
They each in turn grasp the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out of the well
-
- ()                   357 As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake of approval
The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs, carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn- ing wood down in to the well
-                         358 The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well
359 The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to the other wells
The Young Man first, then the rest of the Eloi grasp the idea
They also light branches from the torch and dash for the various wells to duplicate the Time Traveller's action
360-362 Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of wells and dumping the fire below
363 With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on with approval at the Eloi's work
-   - ()                  364 It is dotted with wells, each of which has been turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the surface of the Earth

-   -          366 () Smoke drifts out of its windows
The Eloi hurry out, led by the Man in White
They stop and stare at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed below
- () - ()           367-368 The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through the smoke
Several trees fall over, blazing is heard

Suddenly a makes them pause and look o

The earth shudders and the blazing forest begins to collapse
It does not explode into the air
Rather, the solid earth seems to give way so that the entire surface of the ground begins to fall into the subterranean chambers

- ()                        373 Leveled off by the earthquake
There are no more flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or obelisks
There is no movement -- only the flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by the gentle breeze
374 Staring into the vast destruction
375 He holds her hand
The     and we begin to hear the ' (calmly) The underworld of the Morlocks was gone
and so was the life of leisure for the Eloi
He looks o

376 The Man in White, with others, approaches the group headed by the Young Man
The two men look at each other, their gestures and expressions showing their joy at release from centuries of fear
' From now on they would have to work to survive
And looking at their faces,  somehow knew that they could start over again
377 He looks down to Weena and we : ' Another night was coming, but this night no Eloi needed to fear
The       who looks up in concern
' But what of me
-  was imprisoned in a world in which  did not belong
: -   - ()                    378 This is the same pool where the Time Traveller saved Weena's life
The peaceful  of the is occasionally interrupted by a of  from the earth below
There is no sign in the sky of old constellations, only the face of the full moon looks familiar
The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket, relaxes on the white sand, playing with the blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and "The Land Of The Leal"
Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands
She glances over to the Time Traveller
Are you sorry
He  , but the
He turns
Sorry
- Sorry for what
That you have to stay
(gazing into the night) Yes
-  am sorry because  could tell so much to the people of my own time
could tell them about the happiness and sorrow the future has in store for them
They could learn from it
or would they
You don't want to stay, do you
It isn't that, but  don't fit here anymore than you would in my time
(a pause, and then) would like to see your time
No, Girl, you wouldn't be very happy there
Do you have someone like me - there
No
No one like you
But there are friends who will miss me
- As a matter of fact, 'm probably late already
(stealing a glance, then quietly) Women
No, men
(teasing) There is a woman too, of course
(noticing her disappointment, he relents) She looks after my house for me
She is sixty-two years old
- Much older than you are
Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair into a new arrangement
(suddenly) How do they wear their hair
Who
The women in your time
(after a thought) Up
Up
- How
(with awkward gesture) Like this
Show me
The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena
-
379 The Time Traveller appears behind her
He first hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair imitation of the upswept Edwardian style
She smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face toward him
(innocently) Would  be pretty
The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his
He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on his cheek
(slowly) Yes
you would be
More than pretty

They both look in the direction of the voices

The face is broken and the pedestal partly in shambles
The panel is open

It is left with only a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the remaining eye
The rest of the statue and the sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins of the pedestal
Beyond it the hill is gone and gray haze covers the once green world
The Time Traveller and Weena come through the charred bushes onto the lawn
Here they stop
-
384 The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling smoke
The flames, licking at the inside walls, have not yet reached the Machine
&  -
385 He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket and bring forth the lever without which the Machine will not function
(without looking at her) Come, Girl
He walk, toward the panel
Weena follow, hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to halt before the threshold
Unmindful of this, the Time Traveller enters
-                                386 Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her radiant features
Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and starts to fit the lever into place
387 The Time Traveller working eagerly
shadow starts sliding across his figure, moving more swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes with a
388 Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and  her fists vainly on the metal doors
-                          389 The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles to open them
From without he hears Weena's and
Suddenly he senses a living presence within the sphinx
For a moment there is silence
Then from the right comes a hacking, weak
Another from the left
Then some- thing  , down the stairway
He whirls around,  and , to see three of the enmaddened Morlocks rising before him
Avoiding them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into the saddle
The suffocating smoke blinds him as he gropes for the lever
Morlocks seize his legs and try to wrest him off the Machine
The fire and smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling bodies
:                                390 The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and finally grasps it
391-403 404 Spinning backwards
Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls over the instruments, followed by a burst of whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire
There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total darkness
-
405 Passing back in time through his captivity beneath the lava
He reels in the saddle, then coming from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene
As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the daylight returns, we can see that his face is covered with perspiration
He looks off to see: - (, , )        406 (:  These shots seen previously are now printed backward

In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain- fully from the Machine
Then,   , he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it
His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest on the clock
It is "8:04"
: -                              410 Now showing "9:22"
For a long while only its is heard

The   slowly to reveal the where the five men, their meal finished, are sitting silently around the table
Mrs
Watchett is quietly serving the liqueur
The Time Traveller is puffing on his pipe
Kemp is chewing on his cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation
It is ridiculous
Simply preposterous
Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly with the spoon which  loudly in the room's silence
Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp from his brandy
Well, there's one thing 'll say for you, George
You always could tell a good story
Best adventure yarn 've heard for years
(loudly) You're a truly fine inventor, George
He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a hiccup quickly puts a period to that
Mrs
Watchett steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of brandy
'll turn down your bed for you
As she exits Kemp looks up
Truthfully, where have you been for the past week
Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass
(voice of experience) Now, we shouldn't ask such questions, Walter
It's not hard for a man to lose a week now and then
(smiling) understand your doubt
Take it as a lie if you wish
Now that 'm back  scarcely believe it myself
(a flash of memory) Except that
(groping in pocket) here are the flowers Weena gave me
He places the blossoms on the table before Filby
They are actually less than a day old and fairly fresh
-                      411 As he picks them up to examine

s
) present for you, David
-
412 (to Filby) You were always interested in botany
- Try to match them with any species known today
413 As he looks up, puzzled
don't think  can
414 still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on the table, stands up, looks around and then down to Kemp
Are you coming, Kemp
Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller
It's getting late and you look exhausted
You had better get some rest
Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and starts to leave
-   - () - ()                415 The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down from the sky
The front door opens letting out the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats
They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping the staggering Bridewell
Filby is the last to leave
He pauses at the step of the carriage looking back to the Time Traveller who stands motionless in the doorway
Goodnight, George
416 The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves
Thank you, David, for being such a good friend - always
With this he turns and goes into the house, closing the door slowly
417 Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in, but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back
Kemp thrusts his head from the window
What do you think, Filby
(after a pause) One thing is certain
Those flowers couldn't have possibly bloomed in the winter-time
(in the b
g
) You don't really think that story was true
Filby reaches a decision
Look, you chaps go on
It's just a short walk home for me
(o
s
) Go on, driver

418 As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing in the falling snow
He waits until the carriage disappears, then retraces his steps to the front door and raps on it
He pauses a moment, then uses the heavy knocker
There is still no answer
He steps back and looks off toward the: - '
419 No light shines through its windows
420 He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the door
It is unlocked
He steps into the house
-                                 421 The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters the fully lit room, looking for his friend
Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at the doorway

422 The table is cleared, candles extinguished
The pendulum clock is  lazily
The time is "9:30"
-                                         423 He calls into the darkness
George
No answer
Then an odd  sound brings him to stiff attention
The   in and  until the entire house seems to tremble
Then a violent gust of wind blows open the door that leads to the laboratory
Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the corridor
-                    424 Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives and tries the door -- it is locked
The is almost
He puts his shoulder to the door and finally bursts it open
At the very instant he does so, the   abruptly
He stops short, gazing aghast

425 The Time Traveller with his Machine , leaving the present
Then the    the workbench to the corner where we last saw the Time Machine
It is not there
The   to the other corner
Nor is it there
few sheets of paper whirl desolately in the center of the floor
426 He looks tense, ignoring the behind him
Mrs
Watchett hurries in
(nervous, breathless) Oh, Mr
Filby
what
(her eyes widen) (with finality) He's gone
The   Mrs
Watchett as she slowly approaches the center of the room
Here, with squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the floor
(to Filby) There's something funny here, sir
Filby steps aside her to investigate
427 The    parallel grooves resembling the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the front of the sphinx
They are scratched deep in the floor leading from the spot where the Machine was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory where it originally stood
Here, not only its imprint, but also the color and finish of the floor is preserved
428 They straighten
Mrs
Watchett looks at Filby, puzzled
think  understand
- Look
-                                   429 Mrs
Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint in the floor where the Machine first stood and explains
(pointing) See the imprint
This is where the Time Machine originally stood
(he paces across to the end of the grooves) But the Morlocks moved it
They dragged it across the lawn right into the sphinx
right here
(turns and points) And Weena was standing there when he last saw her
the same space - in a different time
- So he moved back his heavy Machine from here, across the room, scratching this floor
(indicating the grooves that lead to the imprint) So that he can appear outside the sphinx again and help the Eloi build a new world
and build a new world of his own
(faintly, sentimentally) Where he left her
Filby doesn't answer
He looks about the labora- tory for the last time, then takes Mrs
Watchett's arm and leads her from the room
The :  "The Land Of The Leal"
-                                 430 Filby and Mrs
Watchett come into the room
But it isn't like George
- To return empty handed
To try to rebuild a civilization without a plan
(to Mrs
Watchett) He must have taken something with him
Nothing
She looks around and discovers three empty spaces on the tightly packed book shelves
She walks to them
Nothing except three books
Which three books
don't know
-- Is it important
(smiles) No,  suppose not
- Only
what three books would you have taken
She looks at him, pondering the question as they leave the library
431 They stop at the door and Mrs
Watchett stands beside Filby as he opens it
Outside the snow is falling softly
Mr
Filby, do you think he will ever return
(quietly) One cannot choose but wonder
- You see
he has all the time in the world
With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into the night
Mrs
Watchett looks after him
She hears the  of his in the virgin snow
Slowly she closes the door
-   - () - ()           432 Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a path and starts walking the long way home
