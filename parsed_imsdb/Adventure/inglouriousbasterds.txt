-  - The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the French call cow country)
We Read a  in the sky above the farm house; "
" This  disappears, and is replaced by another one; "1941 One year into the German occupation of France"
The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread about
The owner of the property, a bull of a man  , brings a axe up and down on  tree stump blemishing his property
However simply by sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last year, or just started today
One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on the clothes line
As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a noise, moving the sheet aside she see's; ' : Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to the hood, a   behind the wheel, a   alone in the back seat, following     on motorcycles, coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm
Pappa
The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder, and see's the Germans approaching
The  ,  comes to the doorway of their home, followed by her    , and see the Germans approaching
The Farmer yells to his family in ,   ; Go back inside and shut the door
(to Julie) Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash up with, then get inside with your mother
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house
She picks up a basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out splashing into the basin
The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive
After living for a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may very well be the end
Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window sill
Ready Pappa
Thank you darling, now go inside and take care of your mother
Don't run
Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her
As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window sill with the water basin
The  of the  of the two motorcycles and car get
The Farmer  water from the basin on his face and down his front
He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist Party come to a halt on his property
We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like the Farmer
The    are off their bikes, and standing at attention next to them
The   has walked around the automobile, and opened the door for his superior
The   says to The Driver in  ; This is the property of Perrier LaPadite
Yes heer Colonel
The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying in his left hand n d Herman, until  summon you,  am to be left alone
As you wish Heer Col
The
yells to The Farmer in ,   ; Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite
am Perrier LaPadite
The
Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides, and says in French with a smile on his face; It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur LaPadite,  am Colonel Hans Landa of the
offers the French Farmer   his hand
The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it
How may  help you
was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion
-    - The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor the
to enter
Removing his grey
cap, inside the Frenchman's home
Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife, and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling in his direction
The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door
Colonel Landa, this is my family
The
clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the French Farmers Wife
Col Hans Landa of the
madame, at your service
He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess hand
please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine
Don't be ridiculous, heer Col
While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her eyes, The
Colonel says; Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors  have heard in the village about your family are all true
Your wife is a beautiful woman
His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters
('  ) And each of your daughters is more lovely then the last
Merci
Please have a seat
The Farmer offers The
Colonel a seat at the families wooden dinner table
The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer, and lowers himself into the chair
Placing his grey
cap on the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his feet
The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says; Charlotte, would you be so good as to get The Colonel some wine
Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine
This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk
Oui
Then milk is what  prefer
Very Well
The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box, and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel
The
Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down on the wooden table
Monsieur, to both your family, and your cows,  say; Bravo
Merci
Please, join me at your table
Very well
The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from The Nazi
The Women remain standing
Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of ; Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss,' would be better discussed in private
You'll notice,  left my men outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside
You are right
(to his women) Charlotte, would you take the girls outside
The Colonel and  need to have a few words
The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them
The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers humble home
Monsieur LaPadite,  regret to inform you 've exhausted the extent of my French
To continue to speak it so inadequately, would only serve to embarrass me
However, 've been lead to believe you speak English quite well
Oui
Well, it just so happens,  do as well
This being your house,  ask your permission to switch to English, for the remainder of the conversation
By all means
They now speak ; Monsieur LaPadite, while 'm very familiar with you, and your family
have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who  am
Are you aware of my existence
The Farmer answers; Yes
This is good
Are you aware of the job 've been ordered to carry out in France
Yes
The Colonel drinks more milk
Please tell me what you've heard
've heard, the fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding, or passing for Gentile
The
Colonel smiles
The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better himself
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews, and found nothing
'm aware of that,  read the report on this area
But like any enterprise, when under new management, there's always a slight duplication of efforts
Most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless
just have  few questions Monsieur LaPadite, if you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family
Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he takes out a folder from inside
He also extracts a expensive black fountain pen from his uniform front pocket
Opening the folder, and referring to it; Now before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself
The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins, and The Dreyfus's, is that correct
8, To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers
- Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if smoked my pipe
Looking up from his papers
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house, make yourself comfortable
The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the fireplace, and removes from it a   that contains all the fixins to his pipe
He sits back down at the table with his Nazi guest
As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the
Colonel studies the papers in front of him
Now according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've ether made good their escape, or someone is very successfully hiding them
(looking up from his papers, across the table at The ) What have you heard about The Dreyfusis Monsieur LaPadite
Only rumors - -  love rumors
Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false are often reveling
So Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding The Dreyfusis
The Farmerlooks at Landa
Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite,  want to hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you
The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe
Again, this is just a rumor - but we heard the Dreyfusis had made there way into Spain
So the rumors you've heard have been of escape
Yes
Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis friendly
As the Farmer answers this question, the   behind his chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the floorboards revealing; lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards
These human beings are The , who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmers house for the past year
But one couldn't call what The Dreyfusis have done for the last year living
This family has done the only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to exterminate them
We were families in the same community, in the same bussiness
wouldn't say we were friends, but members of the same community, we had common interest
The
Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves to the next question
Having never met the Dreyfusis, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names
10
There were five of them
The father, Jacob
wife, Miram
her brother, Bob
- How old is Bob
Thirty - thirty one
Continue
And the children
Amos
and Shoshanna
Ages of the children
Amos - six -  believe
And Shosanna, was fifteen or sixteen, 'm not really sure
-   - The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the clothes line
They can't hear anything going on inside
e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters
Well  guess that should do it
Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his ttache case
the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe
However, before  go, could  have another glass of your delicious milk
it
But of course
Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the aft of milk
As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass, German Officer talks
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me
have no interest in such things
But you are aware of what they call me
'm aware
What are you aware of
That they call you, "The Jew Hunter"
Precisely
Now  understand your trepidation in repeating it
Before he was assassinated, Heydrich apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him
Actually why he would hate the name, "The Hangman", is baffling to me It would appear he did everything in his power to earn it
But , on the other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because 've earned it
As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize with the french farmer
The feature that makes me such a effective hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most German soldiers,  can think like a jew
where they can only think like a German, or more precisely, a German soldier
Now if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk
(') Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips - smell - physical strength - penis size
But, if one were to determine what attributes the jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat
Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda have said pretty much the same thing
Where our conclusions differ, is  don't consider the comparison a insult
Consider for a moment, the world a rat lives in
It's a hostile world indeed
If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now, would you greet it with hostility
suppose  would
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them
Rat's spread disease, they bite people - - Unless some fool is stupid enough to try and handle a live one, rats don't make it a practise of biting human beings
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some time ago
In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life
purpose to you, any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry
Yet  assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you
No
Yet, they are both rodent's, are they not
And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the other has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin, they even rather look alike, don't they
13
6 It is a interesting thought, beer Colonel
However, interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel
If a rat were to scamper through your door, this very minute, would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk
Probably not
didn't think so
You don't like them
You don't really know why you don't like them
All you know is, you find them repulsive
(let's the sink in) What a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure
Yet, not only does he survive, he thrives
And the reason for this, is because our little foe has a instinct for survival and presavation second to none
And that Monsieur, is what a jew shares with a rat
Consequently, a German soldier, conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding jews
Where does the hawk look
He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar - he looks everywhere, he would hide
But there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide
However the reason the Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria, and placed me in French cow country today, is because it does occur to me
Because 'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity
(Changing tone) May  smoke my pipe as well
Th e Farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding
Please, Cononel, make yourself at home

The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings
The pipe, strangely enough, is a Calabash, made from a "" shaped goard kith a yellow skin, made famous by Sherlock Holmes
the Nazi Colonel, busies himself with his smoking life, he ontinues to hold court at the Frenchmans table
The other mistake the German soldier make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the Jews
These citizens are not enemies of the state
They are simply confused people, trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates
These citizens do not need punishing
They simply need to be reminded of their duty in war time
Let's use you as a example Monsieur LaPadite
In this war, you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself, your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet, here you are
So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose a question
In this time of war, what is your number one duty
Is it to fight the Germans in the name of France to your last breath
Or, is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your ability
Or, is it to protect the poor unfortunate victims of warfare who can not protect themselfs
Or, is your number one duty in this time of bloodshed, to protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family
The Colonel lets the last statement stand
That was a question Monsieur LaPadite
In this time of war, What do you consider your number one duty
To protect my family
Now, my job dictates, that  must have my men enter your home, and conduct a thorough search, before  can officially cross your families name off my list
(') And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured, they will be
That is unless, you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary
() might add also, that any information that makes the preforming of My duty easier, will not be met with punishment
Actually quite the contrary, it will be met with reward
And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in anyway, by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country
The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German opponent
You are sheltering enemies of the state, are you not
Yes
Your sheltering them underneath your floorboards aren't you
Yes
Point out to me the area's where their hiding
The Farmer points out the area's on the floor with the Dreyfusis are underneath
Since  haven't heard any disturbance, assume that while their listening, they don't speak english
Yes
'm going to switch back to french now, and  want you to follow my masquerade - is that clear
Yes
Colonel Landa stands up from the table, and switching to  says ; Monsieur LaPadite,  thank you for milk, and your hospitably
do believe our business here is done
The Nazi Officer opens the front door, and silently motions for his son to approach the house
Mademoiselle LaPadite,  thank you for your time, we shant be bothering your family any longer
Yet the LaPadite women watch the Nazi soldiers, machine guns at ready, approach the house
The Soldiers enter the doorway, Col Landa, silently points out area of the floor the Jews are hiding under
So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite bid you adieu

Why did yoy allow a enemy of the state to escape
Oh,  don't think the state is in too much danger, do you

'm glad you see it my way
Besides, not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen year old girl, and allowing her to escape, our not nessessarlly the same thing
She's a young girl, no food, no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed the massacre of her entire family
She may not survive the night
And after word spreads about what happened today, it's highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid
If  had to guess her fate, 'd say she'll probably be turned in by some neighbour
Or, she'll be spotted by some German soldier
Or, we'll find her body in the woods, dead from starvation or exposure
Or, perhaps-she'll survive
She will elude capture
She will escape to America
She will move to New York city

We're gonna be dropped into France, dressed as civilians
And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwackin, guerrilla army, we're gonna be doin one thing, and thing only, Killin Nazi's
The Members of the National Socialist Party, have conquered Europe through murder, torture, intimidation, and terror
And that's exactly what we're gonna do to them
Now  don't know bout y'all
But  sure as hell, didnt come down from the goddamn Smoky mountains, cross five thousand miles of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and then jump out of a fuckin air-o-plane, to teach the Nazi's lessons in humanity

They will find the evidence of our cruelty, in the disembowed, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us
And the German will not be able to help themselves from imagining the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives
And the Germans, will be sickened by us

Rachtman is a little slow to respond
So Hirschberg grabs him by the hair,  him to his feet, and  him in the ass, sending him on his way
Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with Aldo in the middle
As Sgt
Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds, (not Pvt
Butz) speaks over the  in ; () Sgt
Werner Rachtman has seen many interrogations since Germany decided it should rule Europe
But this is the first time he's ever been on the wrong end of the exchange
It's always been his belief, only a weakling, in mind, body, and spirt complies with the enemy under threat of consequence
As Werner watched men cry like women, pleadingly offer their knowledge, in exchange for their worthless lives, he made a vow to himself
If his role is to die in this conflict
When they put him under the earth, his dignity would be buried with him
For in the other world, the gods only respect the ones they test first
Well Sgt, this is your test
And the gods are watching

Then Aldo points to another Basterd
big scary looking Basterd, in a German Sgt's uniform, named, And another one over there, you might be familiar with, Sgt
Hugo Stiglitz
Heard of 'em
The two German Sgt's look at each other
Everybody in the German army's heard of Hugo Stiglitz
The Basterds laugh, a couple pat Hugo on the back
The  comes back on the
() The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple
on the front page of the Nazi version of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper)
() As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly Majors
() Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin, to be made a example of
Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a prison convoy, enroute to Berlin
() Needless to say, once The Basterds heard about him, he never got there
-   - The Basterds  the prison convoy, killing everybody
They walk to the back of the troop truck, inside Hugo in chains, stares back at them
Sgt
Hugo Stiglitz
Hugo nods
'm Lt
Aldo Raine, and these are The Basterds
Ever heard of us
Hugo nods his head, yes
We just wanna say, we're a big fan of your work
When it comes to killin Nazi's,  think you show great talent, and  pride myself on havin a eye for that kind of talent
But your status as a Nazi killer, is still amateur
We all came here to see, if you wanna go pro
Now Werner, 'm gonna assume you know who we are
Aldo the Apache
The circle of Basterds giggle
Z7
Well Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard, we ain't in the prisoner takin business
We in the killin Nazi business
And cousin, business is boomin
The Basterds laugh
Now that leaves two ways we can play this out
Either kill ya, or let ya go
Now weather or not you gonna leave this circle alive, depends entirely on you
Aldo takes out a map of the area, and lays it out in front of his prisoner
Up the road a piece, there's a orchard
'sides you, we know there's another kraut patrol fuckin around here somewhere
Now if that patrol were to have any crackshots, that orchard, would be a goddamn snipers delight
Now if you ever wanna eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you gotta show me on this map, where they are, you gotta tell me how many they are, and you gotta tell me, what kinda artillery they carrying with 'em
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger
well, Werner that's where your wrong
Because that's exactly what  expect
need to know about Germans hidin in trees
And you need to tell me
And you need to tell me, right now
Now take your finger, and point out on this map, where this partys bein held, how manys comin, and what they brought to play with
Werner site, head held high, back straight, chin up, every inch the German hero facing death

respectfully refuse, sir
Aldo jerks his thumb behind him
You see that ole boy battin rocks
to a one of The Basterds not in the circle
He's wearing a wife beater, and power hitting stones with a baseball bat
Werners eyes go to the ballplayer
That's Sgt
Donny Donowitz
But you might know him better by his nickname, The Bear Jew
Now if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about The Bear Jew
heard
What did you hear
He beats German soldiers with a club
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does

Instead of getting mad, The Basterds burst out
k Aldo says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice; Actually Werner, we're all tickled ya said that
Frankly, watchin Donny beat Nazi's,to death, is the closest we ever get to goin to the movies

Goorowitz
What can  do you for, Donny

The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats init
Donny starts going through them without saying anything
You gettin your little brother a present before you ship out
Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up; No
Donny's "no", silences the gabby Goorowitz
He seems to settle on one, feeling it's weight in his hands
Can  try this one on for size, outside
31
Extending his arm; Be my guest
The phone rings
'll get that, you go right ahead
The proprietor answers the phone, and gets into a conversation with his   Mother
Donny walks outside,    , but can see him clearly through the stores big picture window
However, Mr
Goorowitz instinctively, turns his back to Donny to speak with his mother
Donny starts swinging the bat
It's pretty obvious he's pantomiming beating somebody to death with it
Then the he starts yelling; Take that ya Nazi basterd
You like fuckin with the Jews
Wanna Fuck with the Jews
The American jews are gonna  with you
Mr
Goorowitz, see's none of this, as he speaks to his mother
He hangs up the phone, just as Donny walks back into the store
Store owner turns to store customer

He knocks on a door
opens the door, only a little, peering out at the young man
How can  help you

Our people in Europe
She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the young man
Come in
Would you like some tea
-
'  - Donny sits on a overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and saucer in his hand
Mrs
Himmelstein sits on a overstuffed chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor
(Sipping tea) Very good
If you like tea
Donny chuckles at her little joke
The old woman remains stone
She wasn't joking
He places his saucer on the coffee table and begins; Mrs
Himmelstein, do you have any love ones over in Europe who your concerned for
33
What compels you young man, to ask a stranger such a personal question
Because 'm going to Europe
And 'm gonna make it right
And just how do intend to do that, Joshua
And what exactly do you intend to do with that toy
'm gonna beat every Nazi  find to death with it
thought we were having tea together
And in this pursuit, how is it that can be of service
'm going through the neighbourhood
If you have any love ones in Europe, who's safety you fear for, 'd like you to write their name on my bat
Donny takes a long walk to Werner
As    and     and ,     and    and You must be a real , Donny
You bet your sweet ass  am
Good
Basterds work is never done
Specially in Germany
Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi; Gimmie your papers
Werner hands Donny up his papers
Donny  the identity page out, and sticks it in his pocket
Hand me your sword Gideon
do believe will join you on this journey
she signs the , "" Donny  Werner     , to the cheers of The Basterds
watches
Hirschberg says to him; About now, 'd be shittin my pants, if was you
Aldo points a finger at Butzsr and crooks it toward him
That means you, cup cake
crying, visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo
You wanna live
Yes, sir
Point out on this map, the German position
His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the positions
3 s
This area here
How many
Maybe twelve
What kinda of artillery
They have a machine gunn dug in here pointing north
How did you survived this ordel
Pvt
Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time
He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it
They let me go

They'll shoot ya
But there gonna wanna know, why you so special, we let you live
So tell 'em, we let ya live, so you could spread the word through the ranks, what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find

Well, ain't that's a real nice boy
Are you going to take off your uniform
Not only shall  remove it, but  intend to burn it
The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants to hear
But the last answer didn't go down as well as he thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face
Yeah, that's what we thought
We don't like that
You see, we like our Nazi's in uniforms
That way, you can spot 'em, just like that
(Snaps his fingers) But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody gonna know you was a Nazi
And that don't sit well with us
Aldo removes a   from a sheath on his belt
So 'm gonna give ya a little somethin, you can't take off
Pvt
Butz removes his combat helmet, hair hangs in his face, his moves it aside, and   a  has been ' : on ground, looking up at them
Aldo has just carved the swastika, and he's holding the bloody knife
All The Basterds crowd around to admire his handy work
37
You know Lieutenant, your getting pretty good at that
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't 'ch
Practice
: "   " : This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave Black and White
-   - We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris
However the is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen
We start  on the projector beam, emanating from the little glass window in the back of the theatre The  continues to  back, making the Shot Wider and Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens of Paris, who stare at the   silver screen in the dark We can hear the    of a Goebbels produced German omm paw paw musical movie being projected
The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium
The    on a   of Shosanna,
watching the movie
: "1941 ' " We hear the sound of the German musicals climax
The lights go up in the auditorium
Shosanna, dressed in a   she swiped from somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the , gather their coats, and file out
3P
-   ()- Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside the marquees lights
The   in French: "     in   "
-   ( ) French Black Man, who we will learn later is named , is the cinema's projectionist
We see him for a moment, taking the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds
- still sitting in her seat
Except for her, the auditorium is empty
The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman, who we will later know as  , appears in one of the cinema's opera box balconies
Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in the empty cinema
The  will be spoken in , and  into So young woman, since it's beyond obvious we're closed for the evening
must assume you want something
What can  do for you
May  sleep here tonight
So  gather your not a nurse
No
But your a bright little thing, that's clever disguise
Where is your family
Murdered
3 1
So your a war orphan
We were from Nancy
The Bosch found us Is this a sad story
Oui
Sad stories bore me
These days everyone in Paris has one
haven't bore you with mine, don't bore me with yours
You can run the machines
What machines
Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a projector, she says; The machines that show the film
The projectors
Yes,  own a cinema, of course  can operate them
know,  saw you
: eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth, watching
expertly working the projectors
Teach me
Teach me to run the machines, that show the film
It's only you and the negro
know you could use some help
40
know at least six people who've been put up against a wall, and machine gunned for sheltering enemies of the state
have no intention of being unlucky number seven
How long have you been in Paris
week, and a few days
How have you survived the curfew without capture
sleep on rooftops
Again, 'm forced to admit, clever girl
How is it
Cold
() can imagine
Respectfully, no you can't
Fair enough
So you can't operate a 35mm film projector, you want me teach you, in order to work here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole to hide in, is that correct
Oui
Whats your name
Shosanna
'm Madame Mimieux
You may call me Madame
This is a cinema
Not a home for wayward war orphans
Having said that, what you say is true
If you were truly exceptional,  could find use for you
So Shosanna, are you truly exceptional
Oui Madame
will be the judge of that
: Which shows a lovely   of the   , complete with Eiffel Tower
: "1944 " The   , and we see we're not looking at a at all, but a  stuck on the wall of the Little Cinema's Projection Booth
Before we leave it,   the Month is
The  finds, the    , working as the
It would appear, that Shosanna passed Madame Mimieux's exceptional test
lyrical Morriconie-like tune  on the , this will be "Shosanna's Theme"
Little Bell, begins , on one of the projectors, alerting Shosanna it's time for a
Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film she's projecting, waiting for the1st
of the little cinema
On Screen   lies horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old German film, "The White Hell Of Piza Palu", The 1st      in the upper right hand corner of the
(That tells the projectionist to get ready)
As the   on the lst  rolls out, Shosanna stands ready, waiting by the 2nd
the 2nd      in the same place(That's the one)
the lever on the 2nd , switching the film from projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a perfect
As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva , her go through her daily chores
Carry heavy film cans up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect
-  - The   in French: "    in      " Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of (for the marquee), and a tall ladder
Her chore here, obviously, is to change the show on the marquee
The   comes on the Soundtrack in ; () To operate a cinema in Paris during the occupation, one had two choices
Ether you could show new German propaganda films, produced under the watchful eye of Joseph Goebbels
Or
you could have a German night in your weekly schedule, and show allowed German classic films
Their German night was Thursday
Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing the letters on the marquee
(about the same age as Shosanna), walks out of the cinema
He sees the ladder with the young French girl on top, and walks over
They speak ,  into ; What starts tomorrow
Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up at her from below
3
Max Linder festival
Ummmm,  always preferred Linder to Chaplin
Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Rid"
The chase climax of "The Kid", superb
Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation
suppose now you could use a "" a "" and a ""
No need,  can manage
Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure
He hands the French damsel the letters spelling
Merci
adore your cinema very much
Merci
She busies herself with the marquee letters
How does a young girl, such as yourself, own a cinema
Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in hiding as a Gestapo interrogation
My aunt left it to me
Lucky girl
Shosanna makes no reply back
Merci for hoisting a German night
don't have a choice, but your welcome
Do you chose the German films yourself
Oui
Then my merci stands
love the Refensthal mountain films, especially, "Pizu Palu"
It's nice to see a French girl who's a admirer of Refensthal
"Admire", would not be the adjective would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal
But you do admire the director
Pabst, don't you
That's why you included his name on the marquee
She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German Private
'm French
We respect directors in our country
Apparently even Germans
Even Germans
Merci for assistance, Private
Adieu
She turns to go back inside
Your not finished
'll finish in the morning
She opens the door to go inside
May  ask your name
You wish to see my papers
She hands him her excellently forged papers
That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway to read her name
Emmanuelle Mimieux
That's a very pretty name
Merci
Are you finished with my papers
He hands them back
Mademoiselle
My name is Fredrick Zoller
She gives no response
It's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover
Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle
He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a curfew imposed night
She looks after him
She didn't show it, but he kinda got to her
After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate anybody who,
-   - Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night, lighting up a cigarette
As she takes her first big drag, she remembers a voice
, the younger Shosanna, and the black projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth
Shosanna lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux  her face , knocking the cigarette out of her mouth
Marcel quickly  it out on the floor
If-7
if  ever see you light up a cigarette in my cinema again, 'll turn you into the Nazi's, do you understand
Shosanna is shocked by this statement
Oui, Madame
And for bringing a open flame in my cinema, you deserve far worse then a Nazi jewish boxcar
With your thick head, what do you think the highest priority of a cinema manager is
Keeping this fucking place from burning down to the ground, that's what
In my collection,  have over 350, 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not only immensely flammable, but highly unstable
And should they catch fire, they burn three times faster then paper
If that happens
all gone, cinema no more, every body burned alive
If  ever see you with a open flame in my cinema again,  won't turn you into the Nazi's 'll kill you myself
And the fucking Germans will give me a curfew pass
Do you understand me
Out, Madame
Do you believe me
Out, Madame
You damn well better
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke
Marcel comes onto the roof
Are you well
Even on the roof  can't smoke a cigarette without hearing Madames voice yelling at me
That's why do it
To hear Madames voice again
We both miss her
know
'm fine, darling
'll be to bed soon
Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes
-   - Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking wine
When the young German Private from the other day, , walks in
He gets a beer, then notices the French girl sitting in the back
He smiles, and heads over to her
"Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks
Again they speak in   into ; May  join you
Look Fredrick - () - You remember my name
Yes
Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow - - Merci
Your welcome
- regardless,  want you to stop pestering me
apologize mademoiselle,  wasn't trying to be a pest
was simply trying to be friendly
don't wish to be your friend
Why not
Don't act like a infant
You know why
'm more then just a uniform
Not to me
If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend,  suggest you try Vichy
Just then     come over, obviously very impressed with Fredrick
They make a fuss over him in , which nether Shosanna, or the non German speaking members of the movies audience, can understand
He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they go on their way
Shosanna's eyes narrow
Who are you
thought  was just a uniform
Your not just a German soldier, are you somebodies son
Most German soldiers are somebodies son
Yeah, but your not just somebody
What are you, Hitlers nephew
He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says; Yes
Really
No not really, 'm just teasing you
She leans back annoyed
Then what is it
What are you, a German movie star
6' Not exactly
(Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly"
asked if you were a movie star, the answer to that question, is yes or no
Fredrick laughs at that line
When you said that just now, you reminded me of my sister
This catches young Shosanna off guard
come from a home of six sisters
We run a family operated cinema in Munich
Seeing you run around your cinema, reminds me of them
Especially my sister Helga
She raised me, when our father wasn't up to the job
admire her very much
You'd like her, she doesn't wear a German uniform
You were raised by Helga
All my sisters, 'm the baby, but Helga was the bossiest
And your mother and father
My mother died
And my father was a loser
My fathers moto; "If at first you don't succeed, quit"
The day he left, good riddance
My sisters are all  need
It's why  like your cinema
It makes me feel both closer to them, and a little homesick at the same time
is your cinema still operatiing
Oui
What's it called
5
The Kino Haus
How has it done durring the war
Actually, in Germany, cinema attendance is up
No doubt, you don't have to operate under a curfew
How often do you fill your house
(Pfuit), not since before the war
So if you had one big engagement, that would help you out
Of course, but that's not likely to happen
and their    approach the table
They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for them
One of the French Girls says in , how exciting it is to meet a real live German war hero
Shosanna hears it
They leave
So that's it, she thinks
So your a war hero
Why didn't you tell me
Everybody knows that,  liked you didn't
What did you do
He takes a sip of beer
've shot the most enemy soldiers in world war two
so far
You bet your sweet ass that got her attention
Wow
52 was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in Russia
It was myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers
What's a bird's nest
bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower
It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view
Very advantageous for marksmen
How many Russian's did you kill
Sixty-eight
() The first day
hundred and fifty the second day
Thirty-two, the third day
On the forth day, they exited the city
Naturally my war story received alot of attention in Germany, that's why they all recognize me
They call me the German Sgt
York
Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought
So he did
It's called "Nation's Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so  did
They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris
That's another reason for all the attention
"Nation's Pride" is about you
"Nation's Pride" is starring you
know, comical, huh
Not so comical
So what are you doing in Paris, enjoying a rest
53
Hardly
've been doing publicity, having my picture taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops, that sort of thing
Goebbels wants the film to premier in Paris, so 've been helping them in the planning
Joseph is very keen on this film
He's telling anybody who will listen, when "Nation's Pride" is released, 'll be the German Van Johnson
Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch
However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't help but impress
But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph", like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side of things
This young man is trouble with a capital "", and she needs to stay far fucking away from him
She abruptly rises, and says; Well, good luck with your premier Private
hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself
Au revoir
And with that, she disappears
Leaving the perplexed private alone
-   - It's the next day
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee
Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet
$hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her ladder
pulls up in front of the little cinema
in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of the sedan
The , a German Private, steps out as well
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder; Both  and  will be  into
5 q
Mademoiselle Nimieux
Oui
Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French; Ask her if this is her cinema
in French The Driver asks Shosanna; is this your cinema
Tell her to come down
Come down please
She climbs down the ladder
The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to get in
don't understand, what have  done
(to Major) She wants to know what she's done
Who says she's done anything
Who says you've done anything
Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner
Then  demand to know what this is about, and where do you propose to take me
The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his hand, telling him not to bother
The Major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German; 55
Get your ass in that car
No translation necessary
She climbs into the back of the car, followed by the Germans
The sedan takes off
- () - The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris streets
the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside her
We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything
The sedan stops
The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand
/- ' (  ) - She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the Gestapo Officer
It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch
The best table at Maxims
Three people, and two dogs, sit at it
Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in Hitlers Third Reich,  , his female French translator (and mistress),  , and young Private Zoller, are the people
, belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the table
We join them in mid-conversation; They all speak ,  into ; - it's only the off spring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically
America olympic gold can measured in Negro sweat
Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major
Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself, and greets her before she reaches the table
Fredrick says in French,  in ; Good you came
wasn't sure weather or not you'd except my invitation
Invitation
Goebbles Voice says  ; () Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick
Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the arm, and leads her to him
Yes it is, beer Goebbels
Emmanuelle, there is somebody  want you to meet
Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth
The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister formally
Emmanuelle Mimieux, 'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now 'm a actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels
Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to shake
She does
Your reputation precedes you Fraulein Mimieux
He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big bite of terri misu
They all laugh
Fredrick jumps in
And normally, this is beer Goebbels French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino
looks up at Shosanna
5'
'  comes on soundtrack; () Francesca Mondino is much more then Goebbels French Interpreter
She's also Goebbels favorite French actress to appear in his films
: from one of Francesca's / Goebbels produced productions
Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a ()
She speaks in ,  in to ; / love you,  can't help it
My country or my heart, which do  betray
below naming the films title; " " (1943) Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet bed
() And Goebbels favorite French Mistress, to act in his bed
Goebbels  Francesca (-) Do it
Do it
Fuck me - fill me
looking at Shosanna
Bon jour
Bon jour
f
And you've met the Major
The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German; Actually,  didn't introduce myself
(to Shosanna) Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at your service mademoiselle
(he clicks his heels) Please allow me, have a seat
The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit down
Shosanna takes the hot seat
Seated to her right is Private Zoller
To her left are the two curly pampered poodles
Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine from a small craft on the table
Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good
Goebbels looks across the table at her
well  must say, you've made quite a impression on our boy
Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna
must say fraulein,  should be rather annoyed with you
Francesca interprets
arrive in France, and  wish to have lunch with my star
Francesca interprets
Little do  know Be's become the toast of paris, and now he must find time for me
Francesca interprets
c9 AaA People wait in line hours, day's, to see me
For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller,  wait
Francesca interprets
So finally, 'm granted a audience with the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema
Francesca interprets
So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business
Private Zoller interrupts - - Heer Goebbels,  haven't informed her yet
Unless the girls a simpleton, 'm sure she's figured it out by now, after all she does operate a cinema
Francesca, tell her
Francesca tells Shosanna in French; What they're trying to tell you Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch, trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zollers film premier, and change the venue to your cinema
Zoller reacts
( to Zoller) What
wanted to inform her
Shit
apologize Private, of course you did
60
( to Francesca) What's the issue
The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself
Nonsense
Until  ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform
Let the record state,  have not agreed to a venue change
Duly noted
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna; You have opera boxes
More would be better
How many seats in your auditorium
Three hundred and fifty
That's almost four hundred less then The Ritz
Fredrick jumps in
But beer Goebbels, that's not such a terrible thing
You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor
With less seat's it makes the event more exclusive
Your not trying to fill the house, their fightin g for seats
61
(') Besides, to hell with the French
This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration
This night is for you, me, the German military, the high command, their family and friends
The only people who should be allowed in the room, are people who will be moved by the exploits on screen
Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause; see your public speaking has improved
It appears 've created a monster
strangely persuasive monster
When the war's over, politics awaits
Table chuckles
Well Private, though it is true, 'm inclined to indulge you anything
must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before  can say, yes or no
(to Shosanna) So young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening me
Francesca interprets
What German films do you have
Francesca asks
My cinema , on German night, tends to show older German classics
Francesca interprets
Why not my films
Francesca asks
6Z
draw a older German audience in my cinema, that appreciate the nostalgia of the earlier time
Francesca interprets
That's nonsense fraulein
Us Germans are looking forward, not backwards
That era of German cinema is dead
The German cinema  create, will not only be thee cinema of Europe
But the worlds only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of Hollywood
Fredrick Jumps in
Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is quite a formidable film critic
He chuckles, but alone
WSo it would appear
Unfortunately for the fraulein, 've outlawed film criticism
Zoller, thinking fast, says; Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"
'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen
it
And it's so funny, 've been meaning to recommend it to her, for her German night
That's a great idea, let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight
Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids"
When all is said and done, my most purely enjoyable production
Not only that, wouldn't be surprised, if sixty years from now, It's "Lucky Kids" that 'm the most remembered for
know it doesn't seem like it now, but mark my words
Very well, 'll have a print sent over to the fraulein'
s cinema
We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight
63 As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna
the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly filled with the bottom half of a grey
officer uniform
Ah Landa, your here, this is the young lady in question
The
Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the first scene
Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of the
, he'll be running security for the premier
bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes
But if she gives any indication of this, her war story ends here
The that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it, saying in perfect French; Charmed Mademoiselle
Better known as "The Jew Hunter"
The table laughs
Oh Francesca, what was that funny thing the Fuhrer said about Hans
What thing
You know, you were there, it was a funny thing the Fuhrer said, about Hans
Something about a pig
Francesca's memory is jogged
Oh, yes of course
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear
6 " Oh, yes of course, that's it
So the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be surprised if Hans weren't rooting out Jews like a truffle pig from the play pen
That's what we need, pigs that can root out Jews
Who needs pigs when you have me
Big hearty laugh around the table
Do you have a engagement tonight
Well, as a matter of fact,  do - - Break it
We're all going to the Fraulein's cinema tonight to view "Lucky Kids"
Splendid
Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino, ; And now  must get Reich Minister Goebbels to his next appointment
Slave driver
French slave driver
They all chuckle
Everybody begins to stand up from the table
Francesca gathers the stupid dogs
as Col Landa stands, he says; Actually, in my role as security chief of this joyous German occasion, 'm afraid  must have a word with Mademoiselle Mimieux
5
Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds
What sort of discussion
That sounded suspiciously like a Private questioning the order of a Colonel
Or am  just being sensitive
Nothing could be further from the truth Colonel
Your authority is beyond question
But your reputation does proceed you
Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned
Hans, the boy means no harm, he's simply smitten
And he's correct
Your reputation does proceed you
Laughter all around
The Reich Minister and his axis entourage, make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on a leash, leading the way
No need for concern, you two
As security chief,  simply need to have a chat with the possible new venue's property owner
was just hoping to escort Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her cinema
Nonsense
You can eat ice cream, and walk along the Sienne another time
Right now, allow Col Landa to do his job
Everybody saystheir farewells
Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of Maxims
The fluency and poetic proficiency of the
jew hunters french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was simply a interrogation-technique
bd
They speak   into ; Have you tried the strudel here
No
It's not so terrible
So how is it the young Private and yourself came to be acquainted
She's about to answer, when a  approaches
Yes, two strudels, one for myself, and one for the mademoiselle
cup of espresso, with a container of
steamed milk, on the side
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk
Considering Shosanna
grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the least
disconcerting
The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to your secrets
So Mademoiselle, you were beginning to explain
() Up untill a couple of days ago, had no knowledge of Private Zoller, or his exploits
To me, the Private was simply just a patron of my cinema
We spoke a few times, but - - Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you
This is a simple formality, no reason for you to feel anxious
The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter; 67 apologize,  forgot to order the cream fresh
One moment
He exits
(Refuring to the apple pie) Wait for the cream
(Back to ) So Emmanuelle - May  call you Emmanuelle
Oui
So Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as your self, comes to own a cinema
The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels
The
Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking up his fork, he says; After you
Shosanna takes AaAa whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her lead
( of pie) Success
Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves
Like  said, not so terrible
(Back to ) So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership
69
The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle - Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket
- What is there names
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux
He records the names in his little book
Where are they now
My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg
Pity
Continue
Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring
' Regrettable
( ) It's come to my attention you have a negro in your employ, is that true
Yes, he's a Frenchman
His name is Marcel
He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema
He's the only other one who works with me
Doing what
Projectionist
Is he any good
The best
61
Actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them
Can you operate the projectors
Of course  can
Knowing the Reich Minister as  do, 'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening, dependent on the prowess of a negro
So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue, talented no doubt, as your negro may be, you will operate the projectors
Is that exceptable
As if she has any say
Oui
Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit
So it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you
Private Zollers feelings for me aren't of a romantic nature
Mademoiselle
Colonel, his feelings are not romantic
remind him of his sister
That doesn't mean his feelings aren't romantic
remind him of his sister who raised him
70 It's sounding more and more romantic by the minute
Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a
on it
Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy
gold lighter
He offers one to Shosanna
Cigarette
No thank you
Do you smoke
Yes
Then  insist, you must take one
There not French, there German
hope your not nationalist about your tobacco, to me French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine
She takes one, but makes no move to light it
He inhales deep, and says; did have some thing else  wanted to ask you, but right now, for the life of me,  can't remember what it is
Oh well, must not of been important
Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts on his grey
cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting Shosanna, and saying: Till tonight
And with that he's gone
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief
The  begins to slowly lower from a   to her feet ankles and floor
We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine
During her conversation and strudel with the man that exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself
She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her feet
7 1
-   - The on screen is the German screwball comedy " "
We hear   laughter at the on screen aryan antics
Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius
Laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth
Pantingly watching the screen
Smiling, smoking a French cigarette
Smoking his calabash, amused
Truly enjoying himself
watching the screen
The   comes on the soundtrack
() While Shosanna sits there pretending to be amused by the aryan antics of Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky Kids", a thought suddenly comes to her
We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes
() What if tonight, accidently, the cinema burned down
The Third Reich would lose it's Minister of propaganda, it's national hero, and it's top jew hunter, all in one fell swoop
She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's laughing at the German comedy
"The " card for "Lucky Kids" is projected
The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film
The lights go up
Goebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to file out into the lobby
() The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a complete success
And Heer Goebbels conceded to have the venue changed to Shosannas cinema
Not only that, in a moment of inspiration, Heer Goebbels had a idea
Goebbels speaks , and Francesca translates; must say,  appreciate the modesty of this auditorium
Your Cinema has real respect, almost church like
Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit
In Versailles there's a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary
we're going to get it, and hang it from the very middle of auditorium roof
Also  want to go to Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and just scatter them about the lobby
we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening
The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles
Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre
truck driving through the french countryside with the enormous crystal chandelier in the back
The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography
buzz around decorating
The Greek statues are moved into place
We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass's Italian -movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned"
watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in disbelief
73 " in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes
() As they left the little French cinema that night, all the Germans were very happy
We see Private Zoller hanging back, so he
can say goodbye
() None more so then Private Zoller
She closes the door on him
Watching the Nazi's walk into the Paris night
Their shadows, for a moment onAwall, look like grotesque Nazi charcthers
4644 The Nazi's are gone
Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking down at Shosanna
They speak in   into ; What the fuck are we suppose to do
It looks like we're suppose to have a Nazi premier
Like  said, what the fuck are we suppose to do
Well,  need to speak with you about that
About what
About these Hun swine, commandeering our cinema
What about it
She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel
She makes him part his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs
Her back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders
Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel
Well, when  was watching the bosch (Said in ) Capra-corn abomination, (Back to ) got a idea
'm confused, what are we talking about
Filling the cinema with Nazi's and their whores, and burning it down to the ground
'm not talking about that, your talking about that
No, we're talking about that, right now
If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves, we can burn it down by ourselves
Shosanna - No, Marcel, just for sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema, for any number of reasons, you and could physically accomplish that, no
Oui Shosanna, we could do that
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection, we wouldn't even need explosives, would we
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives
Oui, that's exactly what  mean
She begins kissing his hands
75
(') am going to burn down the cinema on Nazi night
One of his fingers probes her mouth
(') And if 'm going to burn down the cinema, which  am, we both know, your not going to let me do it by myself
The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand both caresses, and grips her lovely neck
(') Because you love me
And  love you
And your the only person on this earth can trust
She then  around, so she's straddling him
They are now, face to face
(') But that's not all we're going to do
Does the filmmaking equipment it the attic still work
know the film camera does
How about the sound recorder
Quite well, actually
recorded a new guitarist  met in a cafe last week
It works superb
Why do we need filmmaking equipment
Because Marcel, my sweet, we're going to make a film
Just for the Nazi's
-    - young  , opens the sliding double doors that serve as a entrance to the room
Right this way, Lieutenant
snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside the room
This officer, who has been mixing it up with the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named
young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of Bel Ami, years)
Upon entering the room, Lt
Hicox is gobsmacked
Standing before him is legendary military mastermind, , a older George Sanders type (Village of the Dammed)
But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano, smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable bulk of
Lt
Archie Hicox, reporting sir
(Salutes back) General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox
Drink
Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano, who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar
However the man behind the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room
Which Lt
Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't introduced, he ain't there
if you offered me a scotch and plane water,  could drink a scotch and plain water
7
That a boy, Lieutenant
Make it yourself, like a good chap, will you
Bars in the globe
Hicox heads over to the bar globe
Something for yourself, sir
Whiskey straight
No junk in it
The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy
Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file
It says here you've run three undercover commando operations in Germany, and German occupied territories
Frankfaurt, Holland, and Norway to be exact
Back to them, mixing drinks, he says; Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's
It says here you speak German fluently
Like a Katzenjammer Kid
And your occupation before the war
His back still to us, as he bartends
'm a film critic
List your accomplishments
Well sir, such as they are,  write reviews and articles, for a publication called; "Films and Filmmakers"
As well as our sister publication
7f
What's that called
"Flickers Bi-Monthly"
And 've had two books published
Impressive
Don't be modest Lieutenant, what are their titles
The first book was called; "Art Of The Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind: Study of German Cinema in the Twenties"
And the second one was called;
He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the Generals whiskey no junk
He finishes what he was saying, as he walks toward the General, handing him his drink
"Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci"
It's a subtexual film criticism study of the work of German director Pabst
What should we drink to, sir
(Thinking, for a moment) Down with Hitler
All the way down, sir
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich
Yes
Obviously  haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but  am familiar with it
Explain it to me
77 Pardon sir
This little escapade of ours, requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich
Explain to me , under Goebbels
Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema
alternative to what he considers the Jewish German intellectual cinema of the twenties
And the Jewish controlled dogma of Hollywood
Bellowing from the back of the room; How's he doing
Frightfully sorry sir, once again
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game
Compared to say Louis
Mayer
how's he doing
Quite well, actually
Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years
But Louis
Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite number
believe Goebbels see's himself closer to David
Selznick
Gen
Fenech looks to the Prime Minister
With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says; Brief him
Lt
Bicox, at this point in time 'd like to brief you on, Operation Kino
Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premier of one of his new movies in Paris - 80
- What film sir
The General has to resort to peeking at his file
The motion pictures called; "Nation's Pride"
Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller
We don't have any intelligence, on exactly, what the film that night will be about
But it's called "Nation's Pride"
Yes
can tell you what it's about, it's about Private Fredrick Zoller
He's the German Sgt
York
Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring, Boorman, and most of the German High command, including all high ranking officers of both The
, and, The Gestapo
As well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry
The master race at play, aye
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket
The objective of Operation Kino
Blow up the basket
(Reciting a a poem) "
and like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth"
Jolly good, sir
An American Secret Service outfit, that lives deep behind enemy lines, will be your assist
The Germans call them; "The Basterds"
"The Basterds", never heard of them
Whole point of the secret service, old boy, you not hearing of them
But the Gerrys have heard of them, because these yanks have been them the devil
Their leader is a chap named Lt
Aldo Raine
The Germans call him, "Aldo the Apache"
Why do they call him that
Best guess, is because he removes the scalps of the Nazi dead
Scalps, sir
The hair
He runs his finger along his hairline
Like a red Injun
Rather gruesome sounding little Dicky bird, isn't he
No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a nutters
But you've heard the expression, "It takes a thief"
Indeed
General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over to a military map
9i
You'll be dropped into France, about twenty four kilometers outside of Paris
The Basterds will be waiting for you
First thing, you go to a little village called, "Nadine"
(He points it out on the map) Apparently the Gerrys never go there
In Nadine, there's a tavern, called, "La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous with our double agent, and she'll take it from there
She's the one who's going to get you in the premiere
It will be you, her, and two German born members of the Basterds
She's also made all the other arrangements your going to need
How will  know her
suspect that won't be too much trouble for you
Your contact is Bridget Von Hammersmark
Bridget Von Hammersmark
The German movie star is working for England
For the last two years now
one could even say Operation Kino was her brainchild
In the back of the room the bulldog barks; Extraordinary women
Quite
You'll go to the premiere as her escort, lucky devil
She'll also have the premiere tickets for the other two
Got the gist
think so, sir
Paris when it sizzles
The three British bulldogs laugh
9 3 -   - Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema, literally, making a movie
Marcel is behind a old (even then)  35MM  , positioned low looking up
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down into it
old timey  is positioned out of frame
As they always do, and always will, they speak into you know what
We need a sync mark
What is a sync mark
action and noise put together, So we can sync up the picture and sound
How do we do that
Clap your hands
She does
In frame imbecile
She claps her hands in front of her face
Ready
Shosanna takes a deep breath, then; Ready
Action
,   ,
Big diffrence this time, it's in
But how do we get it developed
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage
How do we get a35mm print with a soundtrack
Do you know one person who can do both things
Of course Gaspar, very nice man, took care of all the experimental filmmakers
But nobody in their right mind would strike a print of what your talking about
If the Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't be worth this
He snaps his fingers
In a wolf fight, you ether eat the wolf, or the wolf eats you
If we're going to obliterate the Nazi's, we have to use their tactics
What does that mean
We find somebody who can develop and process a35mm print
And we make them do it, or we kill them
Once we tell them what we want to do, if they refuse, we have to kill them anyway, or they'll turn us in
Would you do that
Like that
Snaps her fingers
, -    - old mom and pop film processing lab circa the Thirties
Late late at night
, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a at the hands of his friend Marcel
Shosanna watches, pitiless
Bring that fucker over here
Put his head down on that table
Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat against the table top
Shosanna brings a    into the table, just by his face
You ether do what the fuck we tell you to, or 'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull
'm not a collaborator
Then prove it
Or does your manhood go no deeper, then standing to piss
Marcel, does his wife, and children know you
Oui
Then after we kill this dog for Germans, we'll go and silence them
She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker
hands the couple a     35mm
Outside the shop window, it's morning
-  - the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers life story "Nations Pride"(clearly marked) on the floor of the projection booth
The can for  4is open and empty
Shosanna's at the editing bench,  4, is up on the rewinds
Shosanna  her and Marcels footage into  4 of Fredricks film
Rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and puts a piece of   on  4
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind her,
-   () - We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out front that reads, "La Louisiane"
: "The Village of , " and Aldo is dressed like a French civilian
Hicox is dressed in a German grey
Cap't uniform
They look out of a window, in a apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern
You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous was in a fuckin basement
didn't know
You said it was in a tavern
it is a tavern
Yeah, in a basement
You know, fightin in a basement offers a lot of difficulties, number one being, your fighting in a basement
Wilhelm Wicki, joins the , dressed in a German
Lieutenant uniform
What if we go in there, and she's not even there
We wait
Don't worry, she's a British spy, she'll make the rendez-vous
the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg, and Utivich
And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey uniform of a
Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself, sharpening his
on his leather belt looped around his boot
Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening chapter, is dead
Lt
Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room,  his dagger menacingly
Stiglitz is fucking werid
Lt
Hicox approaches Stiglitz
Stiglitz, right
That's right, sir
He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the leather strap
hear your pretty good with that
Meaning the blade
Stiglitz doesn't answer
You know, we're not looking for trouble, right now
We're simply making contact with our agent
Should be uneventful
However, on the off chance 'm wrong, and things prove eventful
need to know, we can all remain calm
99
The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and looks up at the limy Lieutenant
don't look calm to you
Well, now you put it like that, guess you do
He turns his attention back to his blade
Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately; This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz
Not exactly the loquacious type, is he
Aldo just looks at him
Is that the kinds man you need, the loquacious type
Fair point, Lieutenant
So y'all git in trouble in there, what are we suppose to do
Make bets on how it all comes out
If we get into trouble, we can handle it
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for matter, escape from that basement
If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput
Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark, who's idea was it for the death trap redez-vous
She chose the spot
Well isn't that just dandy
Look, she's not a military strategist
She's just a actress
Ya don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement
She wasn't picking a place to fight
She was picking a place, isolated, and without germans
Lieutenant,  hate to be contrary, but  got me a Nazi pissin on Louisianna two-o'clock
They move to the window, and sure enough, , relieves himself against the side wall
Lt
Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan
Shit
Sgt
Donowitz chides him; So what do you think your fraulein Von Hammer - - Obviously,  don't know,Sgt
The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not suppose to be there
When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the window
Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi,
dagger in hand
If we're going, let's go
He sheaths the dagger
-   ( ) - The   , sloppily finishes his task
Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs that lead him back into the basement tavern
We Follow him
-   ( )- Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane
it has a very low hanging basement ceiling
old looking wood bar off to the right
And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both half's of the room
And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of five
' ,     (a powerfully built stocky type), and
The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of the hour,  diva,
Dressed to the nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with fedora
The game their playing consists of each player having a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary, stuck to their forehead
The player doesn't know what name is on their forehead
So they ask the others questions to figure out who they are
The Five Germans, five cards read;   #1( ), #2(),   #3( ), #4 ( ),   #5 ()
And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in the brim of her fedora, has
It's German#5 () turn to ask questions
The  will be in , and  into
Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance of their game playing, and celebrating
okay, 'm not German
Am  American
The whole table bursts out laughing
/ Yes you arel Well, not really
What do you mean, not really
Of course he is
91 Well if he's so American, how come he's never been translated into English
He's not American
He's suppose to be American, but he's not a American creation
In fact, he's something very different
Okay, 'm a fictional, literary character, from the past, 'm American, and that's controversial
/ No it's not controversial
The nationally of the author, has nothing to do with the nationally of the character
The Character is the character
Hamlet's not British, he's Danish
So yes, this character was born in America
Well 'm glad that's settled
If  had a wife, would she be called a squaw
He's got it
The table Laughs
The Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand
The Yes
Did Karl May write me
The Yes
In the ,  , our three counterfeit German Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement tavern
They obviously
see the five German soldiers, but their too far away for us (the audience) to read their face
No doubt their less then happy
Fraulein Von Hammersmark see's them as well
Without getting up, she waves to them
Hello, my lovelies,  will join you in moments
'm finishing up a game with my five new friends here
No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark
Take your time, enjoy yourself
(To Winnetou) So who are you
am ,  of the
The table , and  the Apache Chief, as he takes the card off his forehead
The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of the game)
Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne
Frau Von Hammersmark, when your friends came in, did you realize you did a double take, like in the movies
Really
No,  wasn't aware of that at all
They must be second nature to you now
Did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies
Well, yes they did, but it's not really that difficult
Do one for us
The Tableheartily agrees
Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect, and perfectly funny, Double Take
The Table loves it
q3
My turn,  want to try
Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double Take
want to try
He does
Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes
-  - watch the table do dueling Double Takes
Obviously, they don't understand
Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the Table
She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at the name Gengus Khaun for the first time
Gengus Khaun
would never of gotten that
She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the Gentlemen rise
She greets each warmly with a french cheek kiss, as if she knows them well
They all take a seat
The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink Whiskey
The taverns , a older, big bellyed Frenchman named , comes over to the table, and pours more champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass
He leaves, returning back behind the bar, with the   , the only other person in the establishment
Obviously, they speak ,  into ; thought this place was suppose to have more French then Germans
Normally that's true
The Sgt over there's wife, just had a baby
His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate
We should leave
No, we should stay
For one drink at least
've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink
She's right, just be calm, and enjoy your booze
The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing, rowdy game
She tells them, her person must be French, or she won't know them
Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a name on a card
The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says; The Germans all laugh
There's been some new developments
The cinema venue has changed
Why
No one knows
But that in itself shouldn't be a problem
The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz
So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be doubly effective here
Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react
The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow
Hugo Stiglitz does a
Bridget's eyes bore holes in him
They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing
Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they did dueling double takes earlier
Needless to say, they all get wet
(To Hicox) You'll be going as Ernst Schuller
You'll say your a associate producer on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland"
It's the one German production not under Goebbels control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair
Master Sgt
Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over, dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table
We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity
the
, the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark
the films gone through many delays, and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so if you have to speak
Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her to cool it
Frau Von Hammersmark,  was just thinking, could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday
'd love to Wilhelm
(To the Table) This handsome happy Sgt, just became a father today
The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt
The German Master Sgt,  his heels, and bows before his superior officers
Thank you, heil Hitler
He raises his hand
as do the seated phony officers; "Heil Hitler"
As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch
So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet
most certainly do, fraulein
His name is Maximilian
Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt
Wonderful name, Sgt
Thank you, Lieutenant
When he's old enough to ride a bicycle,  will buy him a blue one
And  will paint on the side "The Blue Max"
He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers
They do
Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish
There you go
But wait, 'm not finished yet
She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick
Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a big red lip print
Then hands the treasured item to the young father
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian
Thank you fraulein, thank you
Max may not know who you are now
But he will
will show him all of your movies
He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall
Then, to the whole tavern
purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany
There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark
The whole room toasts
This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his table, and his men
And he almost does
but
since he is drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome
So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings you to France
97
Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been exhausted long ago, Lt
Hicox butts in
None of your business,Sgt
You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me
The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet
Might  remind you Sgt
,your a enlisted man
This is a officers table
suggest you stop pestering the fraulein, and rejoin your table
The German Master Sgt
, looks quizzically at the officer
Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is is very unusual
The whole room pauses-for different reasons
Where are you from
silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two German born impostors spring into action
Sgt
You must be ether drunk or mad, to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness
Stiglitz,  and  to the other table; 'm making ,
(Pointing at ) and ,
(Pointing at Edgar Wallace) responsible, for him
(Pointing at Sgt
Pola) suggest you take hold of your friend, or he'll spend Max's first birthday in jail for public drunkenness
78 The Germans  , and take hold of Sgt
Pola
1W rings out; () Then might  inquire
The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before of the
The Major stands from the little table he was sitting at
Like the young newly christened father, too have a acute ear for accents
And like him,  too find yours odd
From where do you hail, Cap't
Wicki jumps in; Major, this is highly inappr - wasn't speaking to you Lt
Saltzberg, (Turning to ) or you ether, Lt
Berlin
(Looking at ) was speaking to Cap't --don't-know-what
The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt
Pola, before the impostors table
Lt
Hicox, calmly explains his origin
was born in the village that rests in the shadow of Piz Palu
The mountain
Yes
In that village we all speak like this
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film
Yes
f q s Then you saw me
You remember the skiing torch scene
Yes  do
In that scene was myself, my father, my sister, and my two brothers
My brother is so handsome, the director Pabst, gave him a Close Up
As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her, she says; Major, if my word means anything,  can vouch for everything the Young Cap't has just said
He does hail from the bottom of Piz Palu, he was in the film, and his brother is far more handsome then he
The impostors laugh
Then
so does the Gestapo Major
He turns to the Sgt
You should rejoin your friends
Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do
That table begins playing there game again
Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows graciously to the female German celebrity
May  join you
By all means, Major
The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt
Hicox, and Wicki
The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein
So that's the source of your bazaar accent
Extraordinary
So what are you doing here Cap't
Aside from having a drink with the lovely fraulein
,00
Well that pleasure requires no explanation
Chuckle
Chuckle mean in country
Your obviously not stationed in France, or 'd know who you are
AaA ' You know every German in France
Worth knowing
Well, there in lies the problem
We never claimed to be worth knowing
Chuckle
Chuckle
(Chuckling as he asks) All levity aside, what are you doing in France
Attending Goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort
Your the frauleins escort
Somebody has to carry the lighter
Chuckle chuckle
The Captain is my date, but all three are my guests
We're old friends Major, who go back along time
Longer then a actress would care to admit
Chuckle chuckle
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room
'll drink to that
101 They cheers
They continue to have alot of fun playing their game
must say, that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun
didn't join them, because your quite right Cap't, officers and enlisted men shouldn't fraternize
But seeing as we're all officers here, (Bowing to ) and sophisticated lady friends of officers
What say we play the game
Lt
Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows better), interrupts him; okay, one game
The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers
So the object of the game, is to write the name of a famous person on your card
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter
For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu Manchu
(He  his ) Eric' More pens
(Back to players) And they must be famous
No Aunt Inga's
When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table, and move it to the person to your left
The person to your right, will move their card in front of you
You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead like so
He demonstrates
)oz
(') And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are
As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game, The    , and The Majors dialogue begins to
Untill we're in a
Which is of Hugo being savagely  by somebody wearing a  ,  over his
The Flashback disappears
It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into it
The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack
So let's give it a try, shall we
Everybody write your names
The Five players write their names
Then move their cards to the right
Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead
is is is is is 'll start, give you the idea
Am  German
They laugh
No
Am  a American
They laugh - but then Wicki says; Wait a minute, he goes to 03
Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America
So
visited America, aye
The Table says; "Yes"
Was this vist
fortuitous
Not for you
Bummm
My native land, is it what one would call, exotic
The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic
Hummmm
That could be ether a reference to the jungle, or the Orient
'm going to let my first instinct take over, and ask, am  from the jungle
The Tablesays; "Yes you are"
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask, weather your real or fictitious
however, think that's too easy, so won't ask that, yet
Okay, my native land is the jungle
visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else
When  went from the jungle to America,
Did  go by boat
"Yes"
Did  go against my will
"Yes"
On this boat ride,
Was  in chains
" When  arrived in America,
Was displayed in chains
"Yes"
Am  the story of the Negro in America
The Table says, "No"
Well then  must be King Kong
Be throws the card on the table
They applaud him
Nov since  answered correctly, you all need to finnish your drinks
The three counterfeit Nazi's knock back their whiskey
Now, who's next
Major,  don't mean to be rude
But the four of us are very good friends
And the four of us haven't seen each other in quite a while
So
Major, 'm afraid, you are intruding
beg to differ Cap't
It's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that  become a intruder
How about it fraulein
Am  intruding
Of course not, Major
didn't think so
It's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms
The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation
Then, the Major laughs
'm just joking, of course 'm intruding
Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen, and  will bid you and the fraulein adieu
(Leaning in) Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old single malt scotch whisky from the Scottish highlands
What do you say gentlemen
Your most gracious, sir
Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses
You don't want to contaminate the thirty- three with the swill you were drinking
How many glasses
Five glasses
Not me
like scotch, scotch doesn't like me
Nor
'll stay with bubbly
Lt
Bicox, hold up three fingers(pinky to index), to Eric the owner
Three glasses
Eric brings the three glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for the three soldiers
Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts; To a thousand year Reich
They all mutter, "a thousand year reich", and toast glasses
The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then   a , under the table
Did you hear that
That's the sound of my Luger pointed right at your testicles
( AaA Why do you have a Luger pointed at my testicles
Because you've just given yourself away, Cap't
Your no more German then that scotch
Well, -Major - - Major - - Shut up slut
(To Hicox) You were saying
was saying that makes two of us
've had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down
That makes three of us
We See all three guns pointed at appropriate crotches
As well as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's
Her pretty gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire
And at this range, 'm a real Fredrick Zoller
Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table top
Hummmmm
Looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here
What's going to happen, Major, is your going to stand up, and walk out that door with us
No no no no no no,  don't think so
'm afraid you and  both know, no matter what happens to anybody else in this room, the two of us aren't going anywhere
"7
(pointing behind him at the table) Too bad about them though
They seem like a likeable (referring to Stiglitz and Wicki) You two will have to shoot them
Then Major, i implore you
For the sake of those German troops, will you please leave with us
Oh Bridget, your concern for German troops, gets me (Pointing at his heart) right here
You mean for the sake your whore legs, don't you
You can't afford to get any bullet holes in them, your not finished spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews
Lt
Hicox picks up his thirty-three year old single malt scotch, and says; () 'Well, if this is it old boy,  hope you dont mind if  go out speaking the kings
() By all means, Cap't
The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three the Nazi Major bought him, and says; There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good scotch
And seeing as  might be rapping on the door momentarily
He downs the stuff
(To the Nazi ) must say, damn good stuff, sir
He puts the glass down
Now about this, "Pickle", we find ourself's in
It would appear, there's only thing left for you to do
() And what would that be
Stiglitz
Say, auf wiedersehen to your balls

The only one in the room left alive, is the young German Sgt, with the machine gunn
the feet of the soldiers outside, reach the basement entrance
The door opens
,
The German Sgt, sends   in the doors direction
No one goes through it
What we have here, is a rabbit hole like situation
No one inside is getting out, no one outside is getting in
The young German Sgt,  in , to the outside; You outside
Who are you
British, American, what
Aldo's Voice  down the hole; ' () Were American's 1 What are you
'm a German you idiot
' () You speak English pretty good for a German
agree
So let's talk
' () Okay, talk
'm a father
My baby was born today in Frankfurt
Five hours ago
His name is Max
We were in here drinking and celebrating
They're the ones that came in shooting and killing
It's not my fault
Ito
' () Okay, okay, it wasn't your fault
What's your name soldier
Wilhelm
' () That's the same name as one of the guys you just killed
They attacked us
' () Okay Wilhelm
is anybody alive on our side
No
We hear a   , yell out; ' () 'm alive
Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice
On the floor, with a bullet in her  , lies the alive Bridget Von Hammersmark
The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes
' () Who's that
(To , ) Make a sound whore, and  spit
Meaning the muzzle
' () Wilhelm, who is that
is the girl on your side
Pause
' () Which girl
1 Who do you think, Von Hammersmark
' () Yeah, she's oar's
(To Bridget in ) thought so
So you run with the American's now, huh
Now times are bad
' () Is she okay
(To Bridget in ) You despicable traitor
(To Aldo) She's been shot, but she's alive
(To Bridget in ) For now
We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off Screen
' () Okay Wilhelm, what'd ya say we make a deal
What's your name
' () Aldo
Wilhelm, can  call yap Willi
Yes
' () So Willi, you know we could lob three or four or five or six grenades down there, and your little war story ends here
But good fer you, bad fer her, you die, she dies
So what say we make a swap
Keep talking
112
' () Okay, Willi here's my deal
You let me and one of my men come down to take the girl away
And we take the girl, and leave
That simple, Willi
You go your way, we go ours
And little Max, gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy
So what'ya say, Willi, we got a deal
Willi thinks
Bridget watches Willi think
Aldo
' () 'm here Willi
want to trust you
But howcanI
' () What choice ya got
could kill the girl
' () Well now, Willi, that's true enough
But something you need to know, so you don't get the wrong idea
Ain't none of us give a fuck bout that girl
But, admittedly, if you kill her, it would fuck up our plans
But you'll be dead by then anyway, so what'd you care
And lets not forget that little gatzenjammer Max, growin up without a pop
So in the spirit of gettin you home to him, we got a deal, Willi
Okay Aldo, 'm going to trust you
Come down, no guns
Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands
Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them
Aldo with his hands up, says; Hey Willi, what's with the machine gunny  thought we had a deal
We do have a deal, now git the girl and go
Not so fast, Willi, we only have a deal, we trust each other
Mexican stand off ain't trust
You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican stand off
you got guns on us, you decide to shoot, we're dead
Up top, they got grenades, they drop 'em down here, your dead
That's a Mexican stand off, and that wasn't the deal
Just take that fucking traitor, and go
See
Now your down here Now you get tricky - t - No tricks
- Ain't nobody gittin tricky, Willi;  swear to god, 'm too damn dumb toget tricky
But ( ) him and  lived upto the deal
We came down without guns
Now it's your turn
No trust,no deal
Willi pointing gunn at them
,,, -thinking
i know your scarred
'm scarred, he's scarred, we're all scarred
So what's it gonnabe Willi
Ether we got a deal, or you might as well just shoot us now
Willi decides
He puts the machine gunn down on the bar
Fine
Take that fucking traitor and get her out of my sight
Danka, Willi, danka
okay, Hirschbeg, you grab her shoulder - From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstroms Luger, and  the remaining bullets into Sgt
Willi, who  to the floor,
Aldo and Hirscberg spin around shocked
You fuckin bitch
had a deal with that man
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain (she'll probably lose that leg), German movie star, says to the two American soldier's she's just meeting for the first time; He was a enemy soldier, who knew who was
He couldn't live
Hirscberg loses control, and  the woman on the floor, hard in the side
ought'a beat your fuckin head in Stop it
Just pick her up, and get that bitch outta here
Aldo, she just- - She's right
What
said, she's right
He was a Nazi soldier
If he lived, he would doomed the mission
)Is,
61 (') Don't mean  like it, don't mean like her, but she's right
Now as Willi said, "take this fuckin traitor, and get 'er outta my sight"
-   - Hirschberg, carrying Fraulein Von Hammersmark, and Aldo emerge from the bowels of the basement
Bridget points at a fancy black sedan, telling them it's her's
Aldo, Hirschberg, Bridget, Donowitz, and Utivich pile in, and take off

The  of what sounds like
and the sound of
his bedroom door, is  , and Sgt
Donowitz , grabbing the Old Man in his bed, and putting a 45Automatic to his head
() Doctor
Doctor
() What
What's happening
head, shocking, Donny  the 45
hard against the Old Man's scarring, and bringing the old gent to attention
() Doctor
Are you a fucking doctor
He nods his head, yes
Andi amo
Donny / the Old Man out of bed, in his almost comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality against him hurts more) towards the door
-    - Into a doctors examining room, built into a French country house, with a examining table, and medical instruments
However, it's obviously the medical examining room of a veterinarian
Along the walls are different cages with eight excited dogs in it
The Soldiers are putting the shot in the leg, bleeding, and in excruciating pain, Bridget on the examining table
Donny, still holding on to the Old Man, points in the girls direction
() She's been shot
Shot
Bang bang
(pointing at his leg) in leg
understand
() No no no,  don't speak English
Donny jams the barrel of his 45
into the thigh of the Old Man
() - in the leg, understand
The Old Man nods his head yes
() But 'm a veterinarian
animals
take care of animals
Bridget screams from the table
() He's a fucking veterinarian you imbecile
1 00
It's still a doctor
If he can get a bullet out of a cow, he can get a bullet outta you
Right now, we just need morphine
Donny yells at the Old Man; Morphine
We need morphine
The Old Man tries to explain in French, that he's not a human doctor
Donny takes the 45
and  one of the  in the cages
Everybody jumps
Donny  at the Old Man; He  another dog
The Old Man begs him to stop, and goes to get the morphine
The  of Gestapo Major   dead on the floor
-  - Were back in the basement tavern
Colonel Hans Landa stands over the corpse
He moves over to the next corpse, a smile breaks out on his face
He says in   into ; Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the world  see
Lieutenant
And with your record of insubordination
Truly remarkable
Nazi soldier named , joins the
Officer
And that ones
(Pointing at ) name is Weiheim Wicki
Bets Austrian born jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites
They are the two German born members of The Basterds
They've been known to don german uniforms, to ambush squads
Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a company of other German Soldiers
The Three Soldiers backs are to us
Dried bloody bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms
The  of the German company, yells to the trio; What brings you all the way out here
The    the   with their machine gunns
But that doesnt look like this
This is odd
Looking down he see's something
bending down, he examines fraulein von Hammersmarks two pretty dress shoes lying on the floor
One shoe is covered in blood
The other, while blood speckled, is fairly clean
Picking up the clean shoe, and holding it in his hand
It would appear somebodies missing
Somebody fashionable
'  cries out; () Col, this ones still alive
We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt
Willi lies
He's shot in the chest, but it looks like Max's daddy is still alive
-   - Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot
The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the German lady
Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need to answer a few questions Few questions about what
About  got three men dead back there, and why don't you try tellin us what the fuck happened
The British officer blew his German act, and a Gestapo Major saw it
'fore we get into who shot John, why did you invite my men to a rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis
can see, since you didn't see what happened inside, the Nazi's being there must look odd
Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda odd in English, it's called, suspicious
Don't let your imagination get the better of you, Lieutenant
You met the sergeant, Willi
He had a baby tonight
His commanding officer gave him and his friends the night off to celebrate
The Germans being there was just a tragic coincidence
Aldo thinks for a moment
Okay, 'll buy that
He was ether there with his men waiting for us, or he was there celebrating his sons birthday, he wasn't doin both
120
How did the shootin start
The English man, gave himself away
How did he do that
He ordered three glasses
She holds up three fingers, index to pinky
We order, three glasses
She holds up three fingers, thumb to index
That's the German three
The other is odd
Germans would, and did notice it
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans, and everything went exactly the way it was suppose to
What would of been the next step
Tuxedos
To get them into the premiere, wearing military uniforms, with all the military there, would of been suicide
But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos, and blend in with everybody else
arranged a tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight
How did you intend to get them into the premiere
Hand me my purse
They do
And she opens it, and takes out three tickets to the film premiere
Lt
Hicox was going as my escort
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant
Can you still get us in that premiere
Can you speak German better then your friends, no
Have  been shot, yes
don't see me tripping the light fantastique up the red carpet any time soon
Least of all by tomorrow night
() However, there's something you don't know
There's been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz, to a much smaller venue
Enormous changes at the last minute
That's not very Germatic
Why the hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn peculiar
It probably has something to do with the second development
Which is
, The , aka Adolph Hitler, aka Adolph Shicklegroover, aka The Bohemian Corporal, having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago
The () 've been rethinking my position in regards to your Paris premiere of "Nations Pride"
As the weeks have gone on, and the Americans are on the beach,  do find myself thinking more and more about this Private Zoller
This boy has done something tremendous for us
And 'm beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful
The Fuhrer's attending the premiere
1 2
Donny breaks the teams silence; What
When the hell did this happen
The venue change, two weeks ago
The Fuhrer's attendance, four days ago
And how come London don't know nothing about that
We need to get something straight, once and for all
Everything London knows, it learned from me
If don't know, London doesn't know
So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler's coming to Paris
Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new information
What are you thinking
'm thinking getting a wack at plantin ole Uncle Adolph makes this a horse of a different color
What's that suppose to mean
It means, your gettin us in that premiere
'm going to probably end up losing this leg, bye bye acting career, fun while it lasted
How do you expect me to walk up a red carpet
X73 The doggie docs gonna dig that slug outta your gam
Then he's gonna wrap it up in a cast, and you gotta good how  broke my leg mountain climbing story
That's German, ain't it
'all like climbin mountains, don'tch
don't
like smoking, drinking, and ordering in restaurants, but see your point
We fill ya up with morphine, till it's comin out ya ears
Then just limp your little ass up that rouge car-pet
Splendid
When the Nazi's put me up against a wall, it won't hurt so much
(Changing tone) know this is a silly question before  ask it, but can you American's speak any other language then English
Other then Yiddish
Preferably
Donny referring to Aldo and himself
We both speak alittle Italian
With a atrocious accent, no doubt
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib
Germans don't have a good ear for Italian
So you mumble Italian, and brazen through it, is that the plan
That's about it
That sounds good
it sounds like shit, but what else we gonna do, go home
No, it's good
If you don't blow it, with that,  can get you in the building
(Change tone) So, who does what
Well  speak the most Italian, so 'll be your escort
Donowitz speaks the second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman
And Hirschberg third most, so he'll be Donnys assistant
don't speak Italian
Like  said, third best
Just keep your fuckin mouth shut
In fact why don't you start practising, right now
(Meaning Utivich) What about the little one
Do you mean me
didn't mean any offence
None taken you German cunt
Utivich is the chauffeur
can't drive
Bridget  in frustration; You Americans are fucking useless
IVGimmie a break, 'm from Manhattan
No worries, son
We got over fourteen hours before the movie tomorrow

We've never been in here before
: "' " She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real attractive Forties style dress for the premiere
She's stunning
This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity, or the occasion to wear something like this
Since she knows this is the last night of her life, no time like the present
of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be heard coming from below
Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the Germatic miasma below
:   all the pageantry below
Tons of Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos, and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas cinema
The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away
German Radio and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back home
And of course,    providing security for this joyous Germatic occasion
Shosanna  up a lugi, and  it
, being interviewed by a  , the lugi  him right on his bald head
Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the period style black fish net veil over her face
She takes out a small , and puts it in the pocket of her dress
, and it's on
She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere
From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way baby, all the fucking way

-   - The stairwell in the building that connects the living quarters, with the cinema
She walks down the stairs, goes through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door
She takes out a key and opens it
-   - Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight
The five silver metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid out
The cans for reels one and two are empty
Cans for reel three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for reel five(which should never see the light of a projector) lie in wait
Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the projection booth
The scene in   in ; Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this is so exciting
Pleased to meet you
Shut up fool
Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips meet
Cheeky black bugger
have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs
Let's go over it again
Reel one is on the first projector
Reel two is on the second
Three and four are ready to go
Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel
Our film, comes on in the forth reel, so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel, go down and lock the doors of the auditorium
Then take your place behind the screen, and wait for my , when  give it to you,

-   - The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the German beautiful people, enter the cinema
They mingle in the swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby
Nazi Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink Champagne from passing  who carry glasses on silver trays
We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor entrance
She descends the staircase, and busies herself with theatre stuff
At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his finest  Uniform, smoking on his Calabash
directly behind him
On the right side, we see the figure of Col
Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the cinema
On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance, from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the building
, like in a comic book, appears on the left side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance
Inside of Landas think bubble, a little scene plays out
Inside a hospital room filled with , , and a in a hospital bed
Then Col
Landa enters the room, and screams at everybody; want everybody out of this room
They start to leave
That means now, goddamnit
They
He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none other then
, and yes, he's still alive
Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down
Can you speak, Sgt
- )1
() Yes Colonel
Tell me everything that happened in there
The    away, reveling the entrance again, and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark, dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast
The three basterds in their tuxedos, flank her
smiles
He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs
They speak in ,  in ; Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what has befallen Germany's most elegant swan
Colonel Landa, it's been years
Dashing as ever  see
Flattery will get you everywhere, fraulein
They chuckle, and air kiss
So what's happened to your lovely leg, a by product of kicking ass in the German cinema, no doubt
Save your flattery, you old dog
know too many of your former conquests, to fall into that honey pot
Chuckle-chuckle
Seriously, what happened
130
Well,  tried my hand, foolishly might add, at mountain climbing
And this was the result
Mountain climbing
That's how you injured your leg, mountain climbing
Believe it or not, yes it is
brief moment passes between the two
The Colonel   with
So uproarious in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs
The Colonel begins to regain his composure
Forgive me, fraulein
don't mean laugh at your misfortune
It's just mountain climbing
'm curious fraulein, what could of ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor
The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress
Well,  chant be doing it again, can tell you that
That cast looks as fresh as my old Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing this mountain, last night
Very good eye, Colonel
It happened yesterday morning
Hummm
And where exactly in Paris is this mountain
This stops her for a seconded
Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook
13[
'm just teasing you, fraulein
You know me,  tease rough
So who are your three handsome escorts
'm afraid neither three speak a word of German
Their friends of mine from Italy
This is a wonderful Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti
(Meaning Aldo) very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi
(Meaning Donny) And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick Decocco
The German fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing Basterds
() Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col
Sans Landa of the
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is, but they can't show it
Margheriti
() Am  saying it correctly
Margheriti
() Yes
Correct
() Margheriti
Say it for me once please
Margheriti
13ZAaA () 'm sorry, again
I4argheriti
() Once more
Margheriti
Nargheriti
() It means daisies,  believe
Turning his gaze to Donny
() What's your name again
Enzo Gorlomi
() Again
Gorlomi
() One more time, but let me really hear the music in it
( ) Gorlomi
Now to Hirschberg
() And you
Then Hischberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the ; )33
Dominick Decocco
Dominick Decocco
Dominick Decocco
Bravo
Bravo
() Well, my two cameraman friends need to find there seats
Col
Landa stops a  with a tray of champagne glasses
() Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne
Everyone gets a glass
() - Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please join us,  have some friends 'd like you to meet
Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a champagne glass
This is the first moment The Basterds are aware of Shosanna
() May  say Mademoiselle, you look divine
() Merci'
() This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle Emmanuelle Mimieux, this is her cinema, and she is our hostess for the evening
() And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and none worse for the wear German goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark
1 3
Bonjour
Bon jour
() 'm afraid my companions don't speak any French, there Italian
This is Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick
All three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles
() Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks Italian associates, need help finding there seats
Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind to escort them
() It would be my pleasure
Let me see your tickets
Donny hands her two tickets
She indicates for them to follow her
Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo, then follow the young french girl into the auditorium
-  - The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black uniforms
Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats
After she points out their seats, she turns to leave
Hirschberg
reaches out and grabs her wrist
He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt, because if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this cute French girl to smithereens, he says; Grazie
13r
The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says; Prego
They begin flicking the lights on and off in  in the lobby; Take your seats
The show is about to begin
Everybody take your seatsl Col
Landa, Lt
Aldo, and Bridget are still together
() must call The Fuhrer
He doesn't want to make his entrance untill everybody seated
Come with me Frau Von Hammersmark
The Fuhrer has heard your here, and he wishes to commend you personally
() Me
Why
() Don't be modest
Everybody is quite taken with your resolve
accident, like you've just experienced, and yet you still show up to to a important Party event
The Fuhrer was quite adamant in his gratitude
We'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux's office
(To Aldo in Italian) 'm afraid  must rob you of your companion, but only for a moment
() Yes, apparently The Fuhrer wishes to commend me
' 36 () Wait here a moment
promise  won't detain her long
What are ether of them suppose to do, argue
Col
Landa goes over to one of the Nazi /, and whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo
Like he's saying, leave the boy alone, till we come back
Or is he
Col
Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office
As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers in the now vacant lobby
- '  - Shosanna's cinema manager office
It's small, cluttered, and dominated by a desk
They both enter
Col
Landa closes the door behind him, and
Bridget notices, but says nothing
Now the two Germans are alone
Have a seat fraulein
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk
She lowers herself in the chair
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk, opposite her
The  Colonel pulls another little chair over, and places it in front of the fraulein
He sits
Their knees almost touching
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast
() Let me see your foot
() beg your pardon
1 31 Patting his lap
Put your foot in my lap
Colonel, you embarrass me
assure you fraulein, my intention is not to flirt
Patting his lap more with more aggression
The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap
The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that hold the frauleins shoe on her foot
He removes the shoe
Leaving only the frauleins bare foot
He removes from his heavy  coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane
He slips it on her foot
it fits like a glove
Bridget knows she's
Col
Landa smiles and says in ; What's that American expression
"if the shoe fits
you must wear it"
He removes her foot from his lap
() What now Colonel
() Do you admit you treachery
She stares defiant daggers into him
1314 () The only thing  will admit to, is resisting you
() Sons-a-bitches
() to my last breath
() "Resist to your last breath"
Hans  forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the violence of a Lion in mid-pounce,  with all his
Bridgets face turns tomato , as the  in her face , and her esophagus is  in his
With a violent , he  her
She out of the chair, Landa never releasing his  around her throat
Nov fully on top of her, he  , Every thing he has, he brings to bear on the elegant ladies neck
Then, to finally finish her off, he begins ,
She's dead
He releases the grip around her throat
His hands are He rises
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands, is the most violent act a human being can commit
Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite important part of the endeavor
As Hans Landa stands, the sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task, still surges through him
He tries to gain control of the trembling, that is rippling through his body
He takes out a silver  (filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back a couple of swigs
He holds his hand out in front of him
The is beginning to subside
He picks up the telephone
139- Into the phone in German he says; Inform The Fuhrer the audience has taken there seats, and we're ready to begin
Step one, in Hans master plan, done
He then dials another number
-  - Aldo in the lobby
he's  by the
He's   to the ground face first
Like the modern day Secret Service, within seconds, his wrists are handcuffed behind his back, he's searched, they find the  attached to his ankle, it's removed, a    is pulled over his head, then he's hoisted up, and  out of the building
This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too, no one in the auditorium is none the wiser
-  - ,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the master race, waiting for showtime
-  - The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red carpet, then into the alley besides the cinema
Aldo's put up against a wall
Inside the black hood, he's  every insulting thing about Germany, Germans, German food, German shepherd
anything
' () Shut up
The faceless black hood does
Col
Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner, says in ; As Stanley said to Livingston; Lt
Aldo Raine,  presume
'to
Hans Landa
You've had a nice long run, Aldo
Alas, your now in the hands of the My hands to be exact
And they've been waiting along time, to touch you
He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's face right in the middle of the hood
Aldo's head
Caught ya flinching
In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck
Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck
Also in the truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform, bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant
The Truck drives off
Col
Landa turns around, and    , Hitlers motorcade pull up to the cinema
Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels, Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down the red carpet into the cinema
Landa smiles
() - We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of night
We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino
- () - The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the truck
Utivich, is crying inside his hood
Utivich
Is that you Lieutenant
Yep
lyl
} Do you know what happened to Donny
Hirchberg
The woman
No  do not
Lieutenant, sorry 'm crying
Nothin to be sorry about, son
This bag, get to anyone
Not exactly John Wayne, am
John Waynes a pampered movie star
He burst into tears, if his cook, busts his yoke at breakfast
Just try puttin a bag over his head, and hear what kinda sounds he makes
Utivich, giggles through the tears
just want you to know, son,  was real proud of you tonight
Learnin how to drive overnight
Driving in that Limo line
You was in the hot seat, son, and you stood up real good
Utivich Cries
Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot on top
The  has a slight calming effect on Utivich
In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity
-   - The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La Louisaiane), The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment
-   - The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open for something else, rustic tavern
0The Nazi Guards, unlock the handcuff, then sit them down inchairs
Then, simultaneously, the hoods are
The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now see, is a rustic tavern
On the table is one telephone, one bottle of Chianti, and three glasses
And on the opposite end of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa
sits posted at  a impressive looking two way radio set up in the tavern
Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated American soldiers
They will only speak  in the scene
Italian
Really
() What could you have possibly been thinking
Well,  speak alittle Italian - speak a little Tagalog, but wouldn't begin to presume  could pass for Filipino
Don't get me wrong,  understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans
And  have nothing but admiration for improvisation
Still
Chico Marx is more convincing
if the three of you had shown up to the premiere dressed in womans attire, it would have been more convincing
Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners
() You may leave us
But stay alert outside
They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the Private and a German Radio Man in the corner
"43' So your Aldo the Apache
So your The Jew Hunter
Jew Hunter, (pfuit), 'm a detective
damn good detective
Finding people is my specialty
So naturally, worked for the Nazi's finding people
And yes, some of them were Jews
But Jew Hunter
Just the name that stuck
Well you do hafts admit, it is catchy
Do you control the nicknames, your enemies bestow on you
Aldo the Apache and The Little Man
What do you mean, The Little Man
The Germans nickname for you
The Germans nickname for me is, The Little Man
Or "The Little One, ether one means you
And as if to make my point, 'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life
mean, your a little fellow
But not circus midget little, as your reputation would suggest
Where is my men
Where is Bridget Von Hammersmark
Bridget Von Hammersmark
Oh 'm sure she's in whatever, big bubbling cesspool in hell, the devil reserves for traitors of her ilk
(') Well, lets just say, she got what she deserved
And when you purchase friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for
Now as far as your Pisanos, Sgt
Donowitz, and Pt
Hirschberg- How do you know our names
Lt
Aldo, if you don't think  wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika marked survivors
We simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect  assumed
Now, back to the whereabouts of your two Italian saboteurs
At this moment, both Hirschberg, and Donowitz, should be sitting in the very seats we left them in
Seats, 0023 and 0024, if my memory serves
Explosives, still around there ankle, still ready to explode
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go
The two Basterds don't believe this
It can't be true
That's a pretty exciting story
What's next, Eliza on the ice
However, all  have to do, is pick pick up that phone right there
Inform the cinema, and your plans kupet
, their still there, and  their still alive, and that's one big , there ain't no way, you gonna take them boys without settin off them bombs
have no doubt, and yes, some Germans will die
, and yes, it will ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels will be very very very mad at you for what you've done to his big night
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Gering, and you won't get Boorman
And you need all four to end the war
() But if  don't pick up that phone, right there, you may very well get all four
And if you get all four, you end the war
tonight
The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills three glasses
As he pours, he says; So gentlemen, lets discuss the prospect of ending the war-tonight
All three have their Chianti filled glasses
So the way  see it, since Hitlers death, or possible rescue, rests solely on my reaction
If  do nothing
it's as if 'm causing his death, even more then yourselves
Would you agree
guess so
How about you Uitivich
guess so too
Good, we more or less, all agree
Gentlemen,  have no intention, of Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels, and Killing Gerring, and killing Boorman, not to mention winning the war single handedly for the allies, only later, to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal
q Now they get it
If you want to win the war, tonight, We have to make a deal
What kinda deal
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make
However, 'm sure this mission of yours, has a commanding officer
General, 'm betting
For
() would be my guess
Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess
Oooh, that's a bingo
Is that the way you say it, That's a bingo
You just say, bingo
Bingo
How fun
But  digress, where were we
Oh yes, make a deal
Over there is a very capable two way radio
And sitting behind it, is a more then capable radio operator, named Herrman
Get me somebody on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen, to authorize my - Let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender, if that taste better going down
Shosanna in the booth, she brings down the lights
In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down

In the auditorium, the    part

Landa, with radio headphones over his ears, and a microphone in his hand, talks to the / American Brass on the other end
So, when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded, that  was part of "Operation Rino" from the very beginning, as a double agent
Anything 've done in my guise as a Colonel, was sanctioned by The , as a necessary evil to establish my cover with The Germans
And it was my placement, of Lt
Raines dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels opera box that assured there demise
By the way, that last part is actually true
Landa placing bomb in Goebbels and Francesca's opera box
want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank
want to receive the congregational medal of honor, for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich
He looks over and sees Aldo and Uitvich watching the one sided conversation
In fact,  want all the members of "Operation Kino" to receive the congregational medal of honor
Full citizenship for myself - but that goes without saying
And  would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantuckett island, as a reward for all the countless lives 've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist party to a swifter then imanged end
Do you have all that, sir
() look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir
() He's right here
The Colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo
Yes, sir
We  the  on the other end of the radio, give Aldo his ; () Colonel Landa will put you and Private Uitivich in a truck as prisoners
Then he and his radio operator, will get in the truck, drive to our lines
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you
You will then take over driving of the truck, a bring them straight to me for debriefing
Is that clear, Lieutenant
Yes, sir
The Conversation is over, he puts the radio down
The three men look at one another
Landa picks up his wine
Ito
So  suppose the only thing left to do is lift a glass, and toast to Donowitz and Hirschbergs success
You too Herrman, come over here
The four men, Col
Hans Landa, Lt
Aldo Raine, Pvt
Smithson Uitivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine
Gentlemen, To history, and it's Witnesses

Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in a ornamental tower in a Russian village, picking off  's below
peering at the German Private through binoculars
He lowers the long range glasses, and confers with one of his
() What's the death toll

General,  implore you, we must destroy that tower
() That tower is one of the oldest, and most beautiful structures in Russia

Then proceeds to pick him apart, one single bullet at a time
She removes " 4" (The Special Shosanna Reel), and prepares it on the 2nd Projector
Reel3, on the first Projector, playing now, is halfway through
In a few short minutes, it's going to be show time
Marcel says to Shosanna in ,  in ; It's time
should go lock the auditorium, and take my place behind the screen
This is the last time they will ever see each other, too much to say
He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before die wet one on her
sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by '
They've developed a dopey way of communicating with each other in this hostel environment
Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian
They say English words, only adding a "", or a "", or a "", to the end of it
And saying it in a exaggerated Italian accent, complete with pantomimes
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg, and says in a wispier; They speak in -  into ; (-) -a Go-a Toilet-a, Set-ta Boom-a
( go to the toilet and set the bomb) When-a -a Go-a, you-a Set-ta Boom-a
(When  go, you set your bomb) Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes, he can't set his bomb surrounded by all these Nazi's
Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs, setting bomb on ankle in his seat
Then getting up, and dropping it in the back of the auditorium, in the dark
Hirschberg doesn't get it
What-a
(What
) Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less patience

Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out of the dark auditorium, into the lobby
The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone, the lobby is completely empty
Seeing the  leading down to the  /, he descends them to plant the Boom-a,  mean, The Bomb
leading to the Water closet
Like a lot of old cinema's, not only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you had to pass through a rather large   to get to it
In the Smoking Lounge are    , the Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers gossip
They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed
Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through them
They look up, but don't disturb there time off vibe
Donny enters the big Water Closet
Except for at the urinal, it would appear as if Donny has the whole wash room to himself
He enters the privacy of a toilet stall, locks the door
He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth, into the empty lobby
He goes to one of the auditorium doors, and peers inside
: in the back of the room
The audience seems riveted to Fredrick's exploits on screen
Marcel closes the door, and with a ,  it
to Marcel, who locks the two doors on ether side of the screen
due to curtains placed there, no one notices Marcels actions
Marcel then goes   ,   the (backward) of Fredricks sniper battle of over300nitrate  , lay like a junk pile, right behind the screen
Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a absolute no-no in a cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter
4
He smokes, and waits for his cue to
)53
along side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and
On screen the battle rages
He leans over and whispers something in Goebbels ear, we can't hear
Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German; Perfectly understandable, dear boy
You go now, and we'll see you after the show
He exits the opera box
And walks to the projection booth door
He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way
The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly, stares at him
Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm
They speak in ,  into ; Are you the manager, of this cinema
want my money back
That actor in the movie stinks
He laughs
She doesn't even smile
She says, in all serious business; What are you doing here
came to visit you
Can't you see how busy  am
Then allow me to lend a assist
Fredrick it's not funny, you can't be here
This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up
Normally, you would be
right
And for all the other films  do, intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper sprit
However the fact remains, this film, is based on my military exploits
And in this case, my exploits consisted of me killing many men
Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now,
don't like watching this part
Fredrick,  am sorry, but - - So,  thought, 'd come up here and do what  do best, annoy you
And from the look on your face, it would appear  haven't lost my touch
Sgt
Donowitz, with  in his lap, sets the timer, six minutes from now
He then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank
we see the tile of the floor stretch out before us
We see Donny's feet in the closed toilet stall
We , the Nazi Enlisted Man, finish his piss
Then The The Shoes
as   The Soldier
Till
"   with the German Soldier, with a   on his head, who's done washing his hands
The Soldier removes his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and , He  some    , puts his cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge
As he exits , he says to somebody  ; () Hey Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes, now pay up
Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna, still baring the way
have to get prepared for the reel change
Let me do it
No
Oh please, it's been two years since i've done a reel change
said, no
(Cute whine) Come on, it's my premiere
Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing your ass, you've forgotten what the word,AAAANo" means
No Fredrick, you can't come in here, now go away
No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it
He does a one-armed    on the door, knocking both it , and Shosanna back into the room
Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters the booth, closing the door behind him, and  it
The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick; Fredrick, you hurt me
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something
Even if it's just physical pain
Fredrick steps forward
Shosanna steps backwards
'm not a man you say, "Go away" to
There's over three hundred dead bodies in Russia, that if they could, would testify to that
After what 've done for you, you disrespect me at your peril

The Swastika Forehead Soldier, get a light for his cigarette
He takes a big drag
' : He faces the washroom, and down that long throw, he sees Donny emerge from the toilet stall
His tuxedo jacket is off, and draped over his right hand
Sporting the white dress shirt, and black tuxedo vest
He's quite far away, so now he just looks like some guy in a tux, who just finished taking a shit
Donny walks toward us
seeing him get closer
: Donny gets closer
seeing him closer still
: Donny gets closer
begins to notice
: Donny getting closer, begins to notice, German soldier notice him
now Donny is close enough for the Soldier to recognize
His face ; The Bear Jew

The Soldier's  is out of it's holster, and rising toward Donny's chest
Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and a  concealed under it
Swastika Forehead in the chest
Who finishes raising his ,   Donny in the chest
The Two Soldier's   each other
Till there weapons are empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor
The Nine other ' in the room, stand shocked at what just happened in front of them

Fredrick hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the door
What the hell was that
While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a  out of her pocket, and  Fredrick   in the back
Be   into the door, then    to the floor
Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out projection booth window into the audience
The    rages so  with , that her weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard
Her eyes go from the audience
up to the big screen
Which holds   in a tight handsome
The Face on the silver screen, breaks the young girl's heart
She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood flowing from the holes she put in his back
His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful
though he is, at this moment, Fredrick is still Shosanna moves to him
She touches him, and he lets out another
She turns his body over on it's back
he's holding a  in his hand

Two bullets
against the wall, then   on her knees to the floor
Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor
, the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh
her  around in agony
Like he did to the Russian on screen, he picks her apart, one bullet at a time
Luger drops to floor, Fredrick
Our young French Jewish heroine, lies on the projection booth floor, in a pool of her own blood, her body  with bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain,  and the little bell on the 1st projector, starts to ring, informing the projectionist, it's time for The
Dieing or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she's going to have to lift her ass off the floor, and execute this fucking reel change
The battle on screen continues waging
The audience is riveted
The watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle
He says to Goebbels in German; Extraordinary Joseph, simply extraordinary
This is your finest film yet
Goebbels is beyond proud, he smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats his hand
Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great painful effort,
Hirschberg, sitting in his seat,  the  on his ankle
Then stands up, and begins scooting past everybody in his rows knees
like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl's mountain films, Shosanna   the 35mm film projector, like it was Piz Palu
Private Zoller  away from his perch
In the top far right corner of The
the 1st
Shosanna hanging on to projector, waiting for 2nd reel change mark, it's a agonizing effort
Marcel, smoking, waiting for his cue
get out of his xow, and begins walking up the aisle in the middle of the cinema towards the exit

In the top right of  The 2nd
Shosanna  herself to the floor, as she on the 2nd Projector
in our face
35MM the  ground ,  in slow motion
hits screen
on floor, eyes close, last breath blown into dusty projection booth floor
Like her family befor her, dead from Nazi bullets
in the exact same placement, same background (b/w sky), , so on screen Shosanna is looking down on the Nazi's, the way Fredrick was looking down on the Russians
The way this    '   stares down the auditorium of Nazi's, brings to mind Orwells "1984" Big Brother
and React
standing in the middle of the aisle, turns towards the screen
When he see's Shosanna's  , he's gobsmacked
Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the She stares down the packed house of Nazi's, and says in ; have a message for Germany

And  want you to look deep in the face of The Jew who's going to do it

The  Landa set in Hitlers and Goebbels opera box
, , , , and propelling , still in his theatre seat, across the auditorium, into the opposite wall, and taking out a portion of the ceiling as well
The crowd reacts
The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles, to topple from it's jerry-rigged placement, and  on to the audience below
finishes her
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face of Jewish Vengeance
Marcel, Marcel takes his cigarette, and   into the pile of nitrate film
at the scrambling little Nazi's, running in a panic, as ,    , and     of the cinema

with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive Day of the Locust
People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to there grizzly fate
The  and  spread through thr auditorium
Hirschberg caught in people crunch, knows this is it
right underneath everybody in the room
The effect this has on the people in the room, is very similar to that of the effect a -80blowing up in a ant hill, would have on the ants
The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms, heads, torsos, and asses

And Uitivich, who's next to him
The two Basterds admire Aldo's handiwork
You know somethin Uitivich,  think this just might be my masterpiece
