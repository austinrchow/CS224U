The doll - which resembles a    in old- fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids - is placed on a sewing table
An elaborate sewing kit is opened, and, in flickering green light, the - go to work
The doll's old clothes are cut away; button- eyes torn off; hair pulled out
The doll's stuffing is removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside out, turning from   to
Sawdust is poured in the  's mouth; facial features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a button drawer
The transformed doll, in a   , its new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and ,

Huh
And if 'm a "water witch", -- (points stick, stomps foot) --where's the secret
You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it

Jerks his head toward the pink house in distance

She owns the "Pink Palace" (indicates house in distance) Won't rent to people with kids
What do you mean

'm not supposed to talk about it
Changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake
(') 'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat
() Wybie
Short for Wyborne
Not my idea, of course
What'd you get saddled with
wasn't saddled with anything
It's Coraline
Caroline what
Coraline
Coraline Jones
(confused, not hearing it) Hmmm
It's not real scientific, but heard an ordinary name, like Caroline -- Her face goes as  as the rain clouds above
(') -- can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person-- '  (

Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch
He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his gloved hands
(') But 'd wear gloves next time
() Why
He points to her dowsing rod, nods
(') `Cause that dowsing rod of yours
Uh, it's poison oak
Ehh
Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her hands on her clothes

almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom
(not listening) Uh huh
would have died
(continues typing) That's nice
Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject
Hmmm
So can  go out
think it's perfect weather for gardening
No, Coraline
Rain makes mud
Mud makes a mess
Coraline turns to her
But Mom,  want stuff growing when my friends come to visit
Isn't that why we moved here
Something like that
But then we had the accident
Wasn't my fault you hit that truck
never said it was
() can't believe it -- you and Dad get paid to write about plants and you hate dirt
Mel stops typing, loses her patience
Coraline,  don't have time for you right now
And you still have unpacking to do
Lots of unpacking
That sounds exciting
Mel remembers something
Mel (') Oh - some kid left this on the front porch
Coraline walks over and is handed a - Attached note reads: (
) Hey Jonesy, look what  found in Gramma's trunk
Look familiar
Wybie
She rips open the package and finds the -, - ,  -  from the head credits - it's a litte Coraline
(to herself) Huh
a little me
That's weird
She crumples the note, both annoyed and charmed
What's his name, anyway
Wybie
And 'm way too old for dolls
But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room
- Jones, 40, goose-necked and gangly with thinning dark hair, -- at his ancient computer, surrounded by boxes of   and empty coffee cups
Coraline, with doll, opens the
He doesn't turn
Hey Dad, how's the writing going
Dad
He ignores her reflection in his computer screen as he types away, green letters on black
She Hello, Coraline
(notices doll's reflection) And
Coraline doll
'you know where the garden tools are
He hears rain outside
It's pouring out there, isn't it
Humph, it's just raining
What'd the boss say
() "Don't even think about going out, Coraline Jones
" Then you won't need the tools
Coraline , stamps her feet
Charlie just taps harder on the keys
Pouting, she makes the door squeak, opening and shutting it till he can't take any more
He spins around
(') Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred and fifty years old
So
So explore it
He grabs a pen and pad, holds it out
(') Go out and
count all the doors and windows and write that down
List everything blue
() Just let me work
She rolls her eyes, takes paper and pen and leaves
,  - Coraline, with doll, jumps on  in carpet that moves with each jump
/ She wipes off the misted glass so she and the doll can see out, then writes in her pad: 7 leaky windows
drop of water lands on the pad, smearing the ink
She adds really between 7 and leaky windows
Coraline thumps the carpet bump again and pounds up the stairs
' / sits in the foreground on a beside table
It shows a younger, happier Coraline with her parents by the   at the Detroit Zoo
to bedroom door as it swings into the room, with Coraline hanging on it
She drops to the ground and, doll and pad in hand, decides to check out the bathroom
When she pulls aside the mildewed shower curtain she finds a hundred skittering
Ewww
Disgusted, she jumps into the tub and smashes as many as she can
She turns on the faucet to wash her hands, only to get soaked with rusty water from the shower head
(') Ahh
She shakes out her hair
Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump again in the hallway and jumps on it
closet door opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate
water heater on Coraline
She jots down one rusty water heater in her pad
As she leaves, she flicks off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it that says: Do not turn off
- Lights flicker and then Charlie's computer dies
He hollers
No, no, no, no, no; --
- (
) --
Coraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the closet and -- - -- spots the Do not turn off note
She flips the light switch back on and gets out of there
- The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out on rain and gray
The floor is strewn with moving boxes, a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard mattress box leans against a corner wall
Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in her pad
She sets the doll on a low table beside an open moving box and smiles
The box is filled with her mom's collection of She takes out her favorite - the - and shakes it
She studies the globe and sighs with homesickness
She sets it carefully on the  , then unwraps the rest of the snowglobes and places them beside it
Over the mantel hangs a  of a     - a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand holding an
Coraline takes up pad and pen and adds to her list, muttering aloud
One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting
four incredibly boring windows
and no
more
doors
She turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow globe box
It's gone
(') All right, little me, where are you hiding
Scanning the room, she spots the doll leaned against the corner wall
Perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the doll when she notices     behind the box
She shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a that's been wallpapered over
(') Huh
Intensely curious, she calls to the kitchen
(') Hey Mom
- Mom, typing away, ignores her
(
) Where does this door go
'm really, really busy
- Coraline tries to open it but there's no handle
think it's locked
(
) - (
) Pleeeeeeeeease
Mel gets up, really annoyed
Big sigh
Uhhh
- She walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the door in the ratty old wallpaper
Will you stop pestering me if  do this for you
Coraline nods her head quickly,  like a dog
(') Fine
She heads back to the kitchen
- Mel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key
Holds it up
- Mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key in the lock
Coraline looks on, giddy with anticipation, the doll at her side
Mel turns the key, unlocks the door, and pulls it open to reveal
an Coraline is totally disappointed
Bricks
don't get it
Coraline scratches her wrist rash with annoyance
They must have closed this off when they divided up the house
Mel gets up to leave
You're kidding
And why is the door so small
Mel leaving room, turns back, and loses it
We made a deal
She exits
Coraline makes annoyed sound
You didn't lock it
(
) AaaaaH
Coraline pushes the little door shut, her head lowered
- Pouring rain
We hear Charlie singing a song about Coraline, badly
(
) Oh, my twitchy witchy girl, - , using   to protect his hand, takes a -   from the oven while mom closes up her
Coraline sits at the table with her doll
think you are so nice, give you bowls of porridge And  give you bowls of ice -- sets the dish on the table
(really bad note) -- cream
Coraline pushes it away, disgusted
Why don't you ever cook, Mom
Coraline, we've been through this before: your Dad cooks,  clean, and you stay out of the way
Coraline
(') swear 'll go food shopping soon as we finish the catalog
(indicates Coraline's plate) Try some of the chard, you need a vegetable
Looks more like slime to me
Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot -- now what's it going to be
Coraline looks to her doll, cradles its head
Think they're trying to poison me
She makes the doll's head nod "yes
" Coraline rolls her eyes, looks up to the heavens and -- '  - -- falls back, washed and dressed for bed, on her pillow
Still raining out
Coraline puts the doll on the chair beside her, then scratches at her wrist are strung between the tall, thin bed posts; the   she found in the garden sits up on a box, her   that projects stars and moons is warming up on the bedside table
Despite her efforts at decorating, Coraline's new bedroom feels small and cold, cracked and faded
Coraline reaches for a framed  that rests on a toy by her night lamp
It's her    from home, posing in the snow by her old school's marquee, its letters rearranged to spell ",
" She touches her friends' faces with her fingertips
Don't forget about me, guys
Okay
She puts back the photo, hits the light switch over her bed and, looking over at the doll, sighs
(') Good-night
little me
Her breathing slows and, with the doll  , she starts to fall asleep
'  - --   out her window across the walls
in the room goes t-t-t-t-t-t
Coraline sits up, awake
under her bed
She leans over her bedside, head first, peering underneath when a ghost- pale     and bounds out the door
- She gives chase, down the upper hall, down the stairs, snaps on the lower hall light, sees it hop into the living room
- Coraline enters
The mouse edges out from beneath the sofa, then hops frantically toward the   behind the wallpaper
Coraline runs and dives, but the door is open a crack, and the mouse escapes
Coraline grabs the door's edge and pulls it open
Instead of a brick wall, there is a ,  , with the hopping mouse heading towards a bluish light at the far end
Whoa
She catches her breath, pulls the door wider and - Coraline  , towards the light ahead
Coraline steps out through the same little door, into what looks like the     she just left, only something is different -- it feels deeper, more dimensional
Huh
She looks around, notices the painting over the fireplace: the crying blue boy is now , his shirt clean and his ice cream back on his cone
From across the hall, warm light comes from the kitchen and the smell of delicious food wafts towards her nose
(') , something smells good
- Coraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove, wearing an apron and -
The light and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect in this kitchen
Other Mother is facing away from Coraline as she works
Mom
What are you doing here in the middle of the night
Her mother turns from the stove to greet her and Coraline is : she's got
She beams with happiness at Coraline's arrival
You're just in time for supper, dear
You're not my mother
(') My mother doesn't have b-b-buh
Coraline points to her own eye
-b-b-buttons
Do you like them
She taps one with her nail
(') 'm your Other Mother, silly
Now go tell your Other Father that supper's ready
She opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of great cooking fills the air
Coraline breathes it in, suddenly
(') Well, go on
He's in his study
- Coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door
- She sees the back of a man like her father, only with more hair
Instead of tapping away at his computer, though, he's picking notes on a
Hello
He turns around
He, too, has
He seems happier and a little more handsome than real Dad, and wears an   over   , with on his feet
He smiles broadly
Hello, Coraline
Want to hear my new song
My father can't play piano
No need to
this piano plays
connected with rods and pulleys of the piano's front and
His hands then   to play pounding as Other Father  out
(') Making up a song about Coraline
She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine
She's as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor- a-line
Coraline is amazed as his hands fly
(') When she comes around exploring Mom and  will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on Coraline
Anxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him
, uh  sorry  but she said to tell you the food's ready
Mmmmm
Who's starving
Raise your hand
He sticks his hand up, still in a glove, and his other gloved hand slaps his face
She , then covers her mouth
- Other Mother sets down a ,   near Coraline on a table spread with , fine  and and a circle twin   covered in dishes of ,  , , and
The Other Father seals this Norman Rockwell moment by making and a solemn face
We give our thanks and ask to bless, Our Mother's golden chicken breast
He laughs with glee then a   rings and it's time to eat
Other Father really digs in while Coraline tries some chicken
Mmmm, this chicken is good
Hungry, aren't you
(nodding, mouth full) 'you have any gravy
Well, here comes the gravy train
Choo- choo
Other Mother  as a   circles round the track, pulling a    and blowing its whistle
The train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with Coraline's plate, where it   on her potatoes
Another roll, sweet peas
Corn on the cob
Other Mother looks on approvingly, not touching any food herself
(mouth full) 'm real thirsty
Of course
Any requests
beautiful    descends
Mango milk shake
The dispenser , stops and fills her glass while Other Mother presents dessert: a cake with candles that and   while the words " " write themselves in icing
Coraline is taken aback
(') Home
Her Other Parents squeeze each other's hands warmly
We've been waiting for you, Coraline
For me
Yep
Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo
Coraline remains a little unsure
didn't know  had an Other Mother
Of course you do
Everyone does
She smiles at Coraline, her button eyes gleaming
Really
Uh huh, and soon as you're through eating,  thought we'd play a game
She taps her fingers a little too excitedly on the table
() You mean like, hide and seek
Perfect
Hide and seek in the rain
What rain
, , then  appears outside the window
(') Huh, what about the mud
We love mud here
Other Mother rises, walks towards Coraline
Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's great for poison oak
The takes Coraline's rashy hand, but Coraline pulls it away
() How'd you know -- Coraline adjusts her tone
(') , 'd love to play, but
better get home to my other mother
But 'm your other mother
() mean my other other mother
Mom number one
() think  should get to bed
Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up
(shakes head) But
Other Father steps in beside her
Come along, sleepyhead
They lead her from the table towards the stairs to her bedroom
'   - In this world, Coraline's bedroom is a dream come true: it is filled with rich color and light; there's a fire in the fireplace, a sheer, lacy canopy over her now beautiful bed
And her favorite toys are alive
Wow
Her    towards her
Hello Coraline, hello, hello
Her   greets her with a  of its tentacle
What's shakin', baby
Hello
The   she'd found    on clothes pin legs, making
She laughs, then hears two voices from beside her bed
1 (
) (-) Hey, how zit goin', yuper
2 (
) (-) Where's your swampers and tuke
She jumps onto the bed, grabs the photo of her best friends from home, now
Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls
can't wait till summer
You're both comin', right
1 We're already here, Coraline -- 2 -- gone to Or-e-gine
Coraline grins hugely, then, exhausted, she yawns, stretching out her arms
The Other Mother, in the bedside chair, takes her hand and applies some    to Coraline's poison oak rash
Oh, the mud
The Other Mother gently tucks her in then she and the Other Father smile at Coraline as she drifts off to sleep
See you soon
See you soon
: '   - Coraline awakens
She looks around expecting bright colors, a magic dragonfly
But it's just her  : moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed
She notices the -  on the chair where she left it, where the Other Mother was sitting
She picks it up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist
She stops, noticing that the rash on her wrist
() It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone
- Coraline goes to the little door, still ajar
She peeks behind and finds the
Yes, it was only a dream
() Huh
She shakes her head and pushes the door shut
The kettle blows from the kitchen
- , Breakfast
Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee
Preoccupied with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts her dream, her breakfast untouched
lies outside the windows
It was incredibly real, Mom
Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother
() Buttons for eyes, huh
(indicates untouched food) Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all that chicken
Take your multi-vitamin, at least
You were in the dream too, Dad
You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers
(pretend offense) Orange
My monkey slippers are blue
He stands, put his dishes in the sink
Whispers over his : (') () Pssst
Can you get me some of that magic mud you were talking about
She points to her rash-free wrists
He nods
(') Because  have a terrible case of writer's rash
On my---
Mel   , interrupting
If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he'd better wrap them up
He crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches out the door
Mel gets up to clear the table with Coraline
(') Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs
bet those "actresses" would love to hear your dream
Miss Spink and Forcible
But you said they're dingbats
() Uh huh
Coraline sighs, gets up to go
,   - It's drizzling and a   has lowered over the house and grounds
Coraline  yellow rain poncho, garden in hand  opens the front door
Stepping out onto the porch, she  on a big bundle of mail
Annoyed, she picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes
Bo-bin-sky
Bo-bin-sky
Bo-bin-sky
Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes
(') Ohh, Poo-eeeee
She goes down the front steps and finds a sign that reads "Bobinsky there" with an arrow that points up long, winding outside stairs
With an "oh well" shrug, she goes up
, ' - At the top, she knocks on the door, a little anxious
-hello
She knocks again
(') think our mail got mixed up
Should leave it outside or
The door swings open
Curious, Coraline peeks inside: it's dark and cramped with something boiling on the stove and a caged chicken
(') Hmmm
Suddenly a    swings down behind her and : -
She whips around to find
Bobinsky - upside down, reaching right at her face
She ducks and he reaches past her to his actual target - his door knob - and pulls it shut
The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless -shirt and shorts, pulls a   from his pants
He's not happy
(') () Famous Jumping Mouse Circus not ready, little girl
() Circus
Oh, uh,  brought this for you
She holds out his mail
Bobinsky takes it, smelling the stinky envelopes deeply
Nods approvingly
() Mmmm
Noviseer
Huh
New "cheese" samples
He swings down like a spider monkey and stands beside her on the balcony
Coraline backs away
(') Very clever, using this "mix up" to sneak my home and peek at meeshkas Meeshkas
The Mice
Oh, sorry
'm Coraline Jones
() And  am the Amazing Bobinsky
But you can call me Mr
, because amazing already know that  am
He smells his mail again, makes pleased sound, then seems to fall off the side of the third story porch
Coraline rushes over, looks down
He cartwheels in from the porch railing behind her
Ha
You see, Caroline, the problem is my new songs go oompah oompah
But the jumping mice play only toodle toot, like that
Is nice, but not so much amazing
So now-- (indicates smelly mail) -- switch to stronger cheese, and soon He opens his door, crouches low and turns
He hands her a beet
(') Here, have beet
Make you strong
(salutes her ) Daas vee  ya, Caroline
He scuttles inside and slams the door shut
Coraline mutters
Cor-a-line
Looking at the beet, she makes a disgusted sound and tosses it away, then heads down the stairs
,    - When she gets to the bottom, she starts towards the back, gardening shears out
(to herself) Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot
(
) : --'--
She looks up
No
Bobinsky  all the way to the ground, landing beside her, out of breath
The mice
asked me to give you message
The
jumping mice
Mr
nods gravely
He leans down, so close his moustache touches her ear, and whispers, his voice -
They are saying: do not go through leetle door
Do you know such a thing
Coraline is startled
The one behind the wall paper
But
it's all bricked up
The old man shrugs, straightens
Bah
So sorry, is nothing
Sometimes the mice are leetle
He points to his head and rotates his finger
(') mixed up, hmmm
They even get your name wrong, you know
They call you Coraline instead of Caroline, not Caroline at all

At the door, she tries the comedy/tragedy door knocker and waits
Nothing
She glances down at the doormat - it reads "No whistling in the house
" She peers through the door glass
suddenly inside, startling her, and a moment after, wearing some sort of house robe  opens the door and three    , ,    shoot out and surround Coraline
Spink tries to quiet them down
() Oh cease your infernal yapping
(to Coraline, sweetly) How nice to see you, Caroline
Would you like to come in
We're playing cards
Still Coraline, Miss Spink
(over shoulder) Miriam, put the kettle on

The dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa
Coraline scans the walls to see framed  from the "Shakespeare" the ladies used to perform like King Leer and Julius Seize Her
Miss Forcible peers out her, half-blind without her glasses
April,  think you're being followed
It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline
She'll be having the Oolong tea
No, no, no, no
'm sure she'd prefer Jasmine
No, Oolong
Ah, Jasmine it is, then
Forcible grabs a handful of tea, puts it in the pot and pours boiling water in
Come on, boys
The dogs leap off the sofa and, as Coraline takes their place, she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase filled with () Are those dogs

Couldn't bear to part with them

Coraline, using her feet, finally un-sticks the candy bowl which   and sticks to the ceiling

She turns to Coraline, about to sip her tea
Spink indicates cup
(') 'll read them, if you like
Read what
Oh, your tea leaves, dear
They'll tell me your future
Drink up then, go on
Coraline gulps down the bitter brew
(') No, not all of it, not all of it
That's right, now hand it over
Coraline passes her the cup
Spink puts a saucer on top and swirls it three times, removes the saucer and peers in at the abstract leaf pattern
She purses her lips
(') Oh
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you are in terrible danger
Miss Forcible snorts
Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes are going
My eyes
You're blind as a bat
Spink passes the cup to Forcible, who adjusts thick glasses and peers closely into it
Oh, now, ummm
not to worry, child, it's good news: there's a tall, handsome beast in your future

Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam
The stuck candy dish suddenly  to the floor
(') Oh
Oh, lord
Coraline asks in a practical voice: Well, what should  do
Never wear green in your dressing room
Acquire a very tall step ladder
And be very, very careful
Now, was there something you came to tell us
Coraline thinks it over, then shakes her head
No,  guess not
Thanks for the tea, though
She gets up and leaves, the dogs immediately return to their sofa

Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss
Cat glares at her angrily

He hates to get his feet wet
Geez
() Wuss-puss
Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a tree and up onto the roof of the house
Coraline softens
(') So
that doll
Did you make it look like me
Wybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks his head up for a moment
Oh no;  found it that way
It's older than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly
Coraline is highly skeptical
Wybie returns to his hunt

Wybie stands excitedly and presents a  - to Coraline
Dang, check out Slugzilla
She's not impressed
() You're just like them
Huh
He looks from the slug to himself

Wybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera -- Uh huh
You mind
-- hands it to her
She acts put-out, but frames a shot
He signals he's ready and she fires off one auto-flash shot after another as he strikes silly poses making : horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in another
She can't help but
Ew
Finished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and takes the camera back
He lowers his head, thoughtful, then glances up past Coraline at the house
He  and speaks in a

Coraline sits up, looks to her door, and spots a     stealing the last bit of cheese
- She gives chase after the mice, hopping down the stairs with the cheese
- Coraline follows the kangaroo mice directly to the little door, opened a crack, where they disappear
She pulls it open
Bricks are gone; tunnel revealed
She doesn't hesitate this time to crawl through the door
- Coraline enters Other Kitchen to find Other Mother preparing a delicious breakfast
She looks tonight; her black hair shining, lips
She stops to greet Coraline
Welcome back, darling
Hi
She is grating   into scrambled eggs
So thoughtful of you to send this nice cheddar, Coraline
Cheddar
Oh, the mice bait
Would you go fetch your father
Beams at Coraline
(') Bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now
You mean my Other Father
Your better father, dear
He's out in the garden
But my parents don't have time to garden
Other Mother  her and pops a strawberry in her mouth

Coraline shrugs okay, starts for the door

Coraline, Mr
Bobinsky has invited you to come see the Jumping Mice perform after dinner
Really
That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr

Well, everything's right in this world, Kiddo
Coraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal, while her Other Parents smile at one another

The boy nods, button eyes shining

He just makes a shy smile, doesn't answer
She's confused

(shrugs, smiling) So  fixed him
So he can't talk at all
Nope
She looks Other Wybie over appreciatively
Hmm,  like it
() Now run along, you two, and have fun
Coraline heads out the door with the mute boy
- The Other House  lit by amber spotlights looks with ornate  ; glowing  in the yard
The kids come out the front door
You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything
Other Wybie nods in agreement
Coraline and he start up the stairs to Bobinsky's
(') Uh
It didn't hurt, did it, when she
She points to her mouth
There's an awkward moment and then he points past her, excitedly: a   is flying towards Bobinsky's door

He catches the cone, then starts firing off all the cannons

There's an off screen crash, then the step stool rolls back to Coraline
She gets an idea
Mel is checking out school blouses, when Coraline rolls past, first one direction, then the other, modeling the colorful gloves
Without looking up, her mom tells her: Put them back
But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes
No one will have these
Put them back
Coraline mutters: My other mother would get them
Maybe she should buy all your clothes
Coraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves

Dad's planning something special
Coraline squinches up her nose
Gross-gusting

You can pick out something you like
Coraline plops down in a chair
Oh, like the gloves
Mel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair

That's what you always say
Mom rolls her eyes, shaking her head, and opens the door to leave

Coraline is surprised
Um

Hey there
Was it wonderful, dear
Other Mother's hair looks absolutely beautiful and Other Father dapper
Coraline shakes with excitement as they walk toward the front porch
Other Wybie holds back, loses his smile
Oh yeah

Where's the Other Mother want to go home
The Other Father turns around
He looks ill; his hair messed and his glasses askew
He speaks, his voice slowed- down
All will be swell, soon as Mother's refreshed
Her strength is our strength
The -    from the piano
One , the other    in his face
(') Mustn't talk when Mother's not here
If you won't even talk to me, 'm gonna find the Other Wybie
He'll help me
She turns to go
No point; he pulled a long face
He   the corners of his mouth impossibly far
(') and Mother didn't like it
The   pop out again, aggressively and   away from Coraline
Frightened, she runs to the door that leads outside, and pulls it open
- , She runs out the back porch, towards the Other Garden
She crosses the trail, the Other House in the distance
She runs down the path
Coraline runs past trees that are She's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk
The further she goes, the  - the fruit trees become
She hears the
Surprised, she looks down
And what do you think you're doing
The cat trots along by her feet
She blinks
Well, 'm gettin' outta here
That's what ' doing
The sky starts to  and the apple trees become -
(') Huh
Something's wrong
Shouldn't the old well be here
The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give way to a ,
No ground or shadows
Nothing out here
it's the empty part of this world
She only made what she knew would impress you
But why
Why does she want me
They walk over the horizon
(cont'd) She wants something to love,  think
Something that isn't her
Or maybe she'd just love something to eat
Eat
That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters
don't know
How do you taste
in front of them in the whiteness and becomes the beautiful
Coraline and the cat slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills, white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them Huh
But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it
The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its head to one side
Walk around the world
Small world
Coraline shivers
The cat suddenly , focuses on a shrub
Hang on-- He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a in uniform with a
Before Coraline can blink, he's
Stop, he's one of the circus mice
With a   of its paw, the cat  the mouse into the air, and catches it in his mouth
He gives a ,   -   - and the mouse into a
Coraline is stunned
He drops the rat on the ground
don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm
The cat picks the rat up and heads off
Slack-jawed, Coraline speaks with admiration
Gooooood kitty
Coraline looks to the house with a determined look
On the porch, she takes out a   from the and hits it into her hand
,     - Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors, the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for danger
It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of anything
She  the cane through the doors' handles, and with all her might
One     and the door swings open into the pitch black living room
The hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other Little Door on the far wall, cracked open
She steps into the room
- huge   suddenly crab-steps in her path, blocking the little door, and all around her things start to glow
The room has been  into an amazing , with all sorts of glowing, living specimens in the place of the old furniture and furnishings
The radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a serving bug
The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline
(
) They say even the proudest -- The sofa, now a  , turns in place to reveal her sitting on it
(') --spirit can be broken
with love
She's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out in a behold my handiwork gesture
scoops up Coraline and brings her to the Other Mother
The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug
(') Of course, chocolate never hurts
Like one
She extends a   filled
(') They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar
Coraline is disgusted
The Other Mother takes back the dish and
It's the first thing she's eaten in the film
want to be with my real mom and dad want you to let me go
The Other Mother , swallows
She speaks with a in her voice
Is that any way to talk to your mother
Coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave
You aren't my mother
The Other Mother
Her button eyes, now , stare into Coraline's
Apologize at once, Coraline
Coraline stares right back, not blinking
No
() 'll give you to the count of three
One
Then she stands up,
(') two
She grows   and  like a super model on steroids
This     Coraline by her  and her to the hallway
Ow, what are you doing
- She  Coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the end
Coraline flails at the Tall Other Mother with her fists
Ow, that hurts
Tall Other Mother  Coraline as if it was water
-    - Coraline  the ground hard
The Tall Other Mother, head thrust through the mirror, stares down at her angrily
You may come out when you've learned to be a loving daughter
She     and leaves Coraline in
Coraline pounds on the mirror-door, kicks it with her blue boots
wells up in her throat
And then we hear a
She turns
She can just make out a sagging iron bed
When the voice speaks, there is a faint glow from beneath its stained cover
() Who's there
(
) () Hush
And shush
For the Beldam might be listening
Coraline steps towards the bed, the faint glow from under the covers in sync with the words she hears
() You
you mean the Other Mother
She gently pulls back the sheets
The    of  ,  , : a   , Coraline's size; a , emotional; a young  , very sad
(') Who are you
() Don't remember our names
But  `member my true mommy
The boy, dressed like Huck Finn,  up ghost flowers
The strange-looking flowers wither and fade
He's so sad that Coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it
Why are you all here
The Beldam
The ghosts move about in a dance macabre, like ghostly fish in water
She spied on our lives, through the little doll's eyes, And saw that we weren't    happy
So she lured us away, (') with treasures and treats, and games to play
Gave all that we asked - yet we still wanted more - So we let her sew the buttons
She said that she loved us, But she locked us here And ate up our lives
The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down
Coraline is stunned
She thinks a little and then speaks, trying to steady her voice
Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life
Beating her is my only chance
beat
Then the Sweet Girl asks in her sing-song way: Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you could find our eyes
Has she taken those, too
Yes, miss
And hidden them
Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed
'll try
The ghosts  with hope
Coraline sits down against the mirror door, bounces her head against it
She's not hopeless
Suddenly,      and - of Coraline's , eyes wild, as she  at the hands that hold her
She  one and,  her onto the ground
She pulls off his mask: it's the  , his mouth stitched into a , () Coraline sits him up
(') Did she do this to you
She unstitches his painfully-huge grin
(') hope that feels bet-- Shhh
He stops her with a finger to her lips, and points to the Other Living Room, its door
He grabs her hand and  her there
It's dark, the bug furniture asleep
They run to the big armoire bug that guards the little door and   out of the way
It  to the floor
And from upstairs, a voice calls out
(
) Coraline
Is that you
Let's go
She opens the little door
blows from the dark passageway, now filled with   and the , ,   of other kids who tried to escape
(
) Coraline
The tunnel  at the sound of her voice
Coraline takes Other Wybie's arm
Come on
She'll hurt you again
He shakes his head no, then pulls off his glove to reveal a
He blows his fingers away
from the stairs; she's
(
) Coraline
How dare you disobey your mother
Other Wybie shoves Coraline into the tunnel and shuts the door
Hunched down, she moves as quickly as she can, tearing through the sticky cobwebs
(
) (calling after her) Coraline
Strands of web brush her face, stick to her hair; she closes her eyes, hands out until she finally gets to the little door at the other end
She , , -- -  , --    onto the
Coraline  the door shut and turns the sharp little key  still in the keyhole  to
She stands, covered in dust and cobwebs, and calls out with joy and relief
'
, , '  - She goes quickly through the apartment, happily calling: Anybody here
Hello, hello, hello
Real Dad
Real Mom
- Oh, Mom's groceries
There are bags of groceries on the table, as if her mother had just gotten in
She pulls open a bag to peek and   shoot out
The food is spoiled
(') () Uhhh
That's disgusting
Door bell rings
- She runs excitedly to the door and flings it open
missed you guys so much-- You'll never-- /
- , But it's just Wybie, the real boy
Oh
the Wybie that talks
He's waves, face down, awkward
Huh
Ha ha ha
yeah
Um, so you know tha-that old doll  gave you
Coraline tenses, sharp breath
(') Um
my Gramma's real mad, says it was her sister's - the one that
disappeared
She reads him like a book
() You stole that doll, didn't you
Wybie answers quickly, guilty as heck
Well, i-it looked just like you
And -- Coraline, rushing the words, tells him the truth
It used to look like this pioneer girl; then Huck Finn junior; then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons, and braids, and
Her voice trails off
Coraline studies Wybie, then, snaps her fingers
(') Grandma's missing sister
He nods, one brow raising up
(') think  just met her
'mon
She pulls him inside and-- - --drags him down the hall
Uh, listen, --'m really not supposed -- - Coraline   to the   in the corner wall and points
Wybie looks around anxiously, fearful and curious to be in his grandmother's old house
She's in there
Reluctantly, he bends down and reaches for the key in the lock
-can you  can you unlock it
She grabs his hand, stops him
Not in a million years
But it wouldn't matter; she can't escape without her eyes
None of the ghosts can
Wybie stares at her, nodding his head as if he understands her crazy story
He changes the subject, gets back to his mission
Huhhhhhh
So, uh,  really need to get that doll
Coraline snaps at him
Great
'd love to get rid of it
She exhales in a huff
Grabs his sleeve, leads him from room
'  - The doll's not on the bed, not on the chairs or moving boxes
Where are you hiding, you little monster
Wybie nervously watches Coraline pull out her dresser drawers, yank cushions off the window seat
You and Gramma been talking
The doll's her spy
It's how she watches you, finds out what's wrong with your life
Wybie, trapped like a deer-in-the-headlights, tries to make sense of her remarks
The doll
is my Gramma's
spy
- the Other Mother
She's got this whole world where everything's better - the food, the garden, the-- (leans in on him) --neighbors
Holds her hands up
(') But it's all a trap
Wybie, eager to escape, cups hand to ear by the window
Yeah
Uh,  think  heard someone calling me, Jonesy
Coraline sees right through him
Don't believe me
You can ask the cat
He moves around her towards the door, turns to leave
The cat
-'ll just tell Gramma that you couldn't find the doll--
blue boot - thrown by Coraline -  his arm
He turns back as she takes off the second one
You're not
That's
cause
you're
He  as the second boot flies past
Coraline , and gives chase
- She grabs her boots from the floor, and  him down the stairs in her socks
/ - , Door flies open and Wybie  down the front steps to his electric bike
Coraline  down after him
You creep
(calling over his shoulder) Crazy
He  his bike towards the  ,   and As Coraline hurls a boot at him, he the motor and escapes down a side path past the driveway
Crazy
You're the jerk-wad that gave me the doll
Out of breath, she turns away and notices her ' parked to the side
(') Mom
Dad
Excited, she hops over the fallen tree and runs to the car
'  - Coraline, standing in the rain, excitedly looks through the car's window
But the car is
She spots her mom's , then opens the door to grabs it and speed dial a number
Pick it up, Dad, pick it up
(
) Hi
Dad
Whe- (
) 'm digging in my garden right now, but leave a message and 'll get right back to you
She dejectedly looks at the phone, then snaps it shut
Where have you gone
'   - Miss Spink is knitting a    for a worried- looking , one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap
Coraline sips tea, anxious, the other two  beside her
Uh
don't you only make wings for the dead ones
Just looking ahead dear
Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late
(
) April
Aren't you getting ready
(looks off camera) We've lost our ride, Miriam
Caroline says her parents have vanished, quite completely
Miss Forcible, tightening her elaborate corset behind a screen, using pulleys and hooks
What
We've waited months for those tickets
One of the corset hooks   and pulls off her wig
She ignores it and comes over to address Spink
suppose we could walk
With your gamy legs
It's nearly two miles to the theater
Coraline   , frustrated
Oh, oh yes
your missing parents
We know just what you need
Miriam, get
that's right
Miss Forcible grabs another dish of old stuck-together candy and puts it in front of Coraline
How is hundred-year-old candy going to -- Miss Spink suddenly  her   as if to Coraline yelps, hands up in defense
But it's  she attacks, sending sticky chips flying, making loud grunts as she stabs
She pulls a , -      from the rubble and passes it to Coraline
There you go, sweety
Coraline studies the odd candy
What's it for
She holds it up, looks through its hole at the ladies
Well,it might help
They're good for bad things, sometimes
No, they're good for lost things
They don't look any different
It's bad things, Miriam
Lost things, April
Bad
Lost
Bad things
Lost
Bad
Lost
Coraline can't take anymore
She gets up, takes the odd piece of candy and leaves
'  - Coraline, dressed for bed with her blanket over her shoulder, walks into her parent's room, the  of her and her parents at the Bear Fountain in the foreground
She pulls down the bed covers and builds  of her parents out of pillows
She fits an extra neck brace on one pillow head and some reading glasses on the other
Then Coraline lies down and pulls up the covers, very sad
Good-night, Mom
Good-night, Dad
She kisses them both and
: '  - , Coraline, asleep
blurs past camera
One paw and then two paws bat her nose
She opens her eyes to find    staring at her
It's the  , purring loudly
Hello
How did you get in
The cat yawns, his eyes flash
(') Do you know where Mom and Dad are
The cat blinks
Then he heads out the door
- She follows him, wrapped in her blanket, to the  at the end of the hallway
The mirror starts to  and then an   within the glass
It's
They cling together, blue with cold, as snow falls
They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel  on the inside mirror-glass to fog it
She writes her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a , Frost  , hiding the letters and then her parents
The image fades
Coraline     as hard as she can and she drops to the ground, shaking
The cat nuzzles her
(') How did this happen
'  - From under the bed, the cat drags out the - ,  into   on one side, and on the other
She's taken them
Coraline, enraged,  the doll
comes up on her face as the background  : ,    - :  in the
Coraline and cat watch until the fire burns out
She takes a breath and looks up at the mantel
snowglobe, the one of the   from the Detroit Zoo
Coraline cradles it, remembering
They're not coming back, are they  Mom and Dad
Not on their own
The cat blinks
She looks over at the locked little door in the corner wall
(') Only one thing to do
: '    - Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go
Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest, her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in the bag
She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair
The    , the triangle green one with the hole, drops to the floor
She hesitates a moment, then sticks it in her bag
- We hear the click of the door being unlocked
It opens to reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline
She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a breath and crawls forward
The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall
The cat, his voice returned,  to her
You know, you're walking right into her trap
have to go back
With great feeling, she explains: (') They are my parents
Challenge her then
She may not play fair but she won't refuse
She's got a thing for games
Coraline thinks about it, remembering
Hmmm, okay
The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle and the cat
Coraline tenses when a voice calls out
Coraline
Mom
There, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue, Coraline's  , with neck brace and dressed in her shopping clothes, calls
Coraline, you came back for us
() She runs forward eagerly and-- - --out the Other Little Door, throwing her arms out to hug her real Mom
Darling
(voice shifting) Why would you run away from me
Coraline sees her mother's hand  as it wraps around her
Alarmed, she   and sees the   grow into the
The room   with the glowing bug furniture and a fireplace fire
Coraline tries her best to be brave
Where are my parents
The Tall Other Mother's button eyes
Gosh,  have no idea where your "old" parents are
Perhaps they've grown bored of you and run away to France
Her teeth gleam
They weren't bored of me
You stole them
Other Father, a   than before, his sagging face a pale  color, his hair , comes up behind Coraline
Now, don't be difficult, Coraline
Have a seat, won't you
Other Father,  happily, herds Coraline onto the walking bug chair
The Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns to it and  her hands
moment later, a   skitters out of the tunnel - with spider webs and children's things - carrying the  from the real world door
The Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and - while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she () Why don't you have your own key
Only one key
The Other Mother    growing from his ear, Shhh
() The garden squash need tending, don't you think, pumpkin
She turns him around, her hands under his arms and drags him out
Squish squash, pumpkin sauce
After a beat, Coraline hears the very faint , just like when her mother wrote  on the mirror
Coraline jumps to her feet, looking around the room for a sign of her real parents
(loud whisper) Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you
muffled screen door slams
and the Tall Other Mother calls to her from the kitchen
(
) Breakfast-time
Coraline leaves frame
- Coraline pauses in the doorway
(
) (to herself) Be strong, Coraline
She sits at the kitchen table in her regular place, her back to the sink
Tall Other Mother, humming happily, prepares a mushroom omelet and bacon
Fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the oven
At the table's center, Coraline sees the box with her with needle and thread
bead of sweat rolls down her forehead
As casually as she can, she asks: (') (anxious, trying to be cool) Why don't we play
a game
know you like them
The Tall Other Mother's button eyes
Everybody likes games
() Uh huh
Bacon sizzles and spits on the stove
What kind of game would it be
) An exploring game
a finding things game
Other Mother tries to act disinterested, but her fingers drum with excitement
And what is it you'd be finding, Coraline
Coraline hesitates
My real parents
() Too easy
She folds the omelet over in the pan
And, and the eyes of the ghost children
Tall Other Mother smiles: now it's getting interesting
Huh
The meal ready, she turns from the stove and takes the food to Coraline
(') What if you don't find them
If  lose, 'll stay here with you forever and let you love me
(indicates button box) And 'll let you sew buttons into my eyes
Hmmm
And if you somehow win this game
Then you let me go
You let everyone go my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here
The Tall Other Mother smiles a malicious not in a million years smile
Deal
She holds out her hand
Coraline doesn't reach
Not till you give me a clue
Tall Other Mother snorts, her smile sours
She slowly circles Coraline, and speaks as if talking to a very stupid child
Oh, right
In each of three wonders 've made just for you, a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight
And for my parents
Tall Other Mother - standing behind her in front of the sink - smiles wickedly and just starts with her finger nail
Coraline turns away from her
(') () Fine
Don't tell me
Extending her hand, Coraline starts to turn back
(') it's a deal-- But the Tall Other Mother   and the tapping now is the   in the sink
Coraline , walks to the sink, stares at the dripping faucet
(') What does she mean "wonders
" Out the kitchen window, the    , answering her question
She   , thinks this was too easy
(') Hmmm
: - Coraline walks through the gates
The bright magic of the garden is  , with areas of black against areas of glowing flowers
She passes the  , and the one with the frog suddenly  the animal
She goes up the steps past the  , which now that runs down the wall
At the top, a few , feeble now,  at her
She  them down
Behind her, a brick tree ring like a monster's  and five , sneak towards her
They , knock her to the ground, spilling her bag
No
They   at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and shoulder, and start to Coraline is just able to  her
She one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she is free

Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when a trio of /
They don't attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the and
(') Stop
Coraline chases them, but they're getting away
As she crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and at them
They fall to the ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out
She picks up the triangle candy
(') Why steal this
With a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it up to her eye and
(') Wow
like a pencil drawing, all color gone
She scans the garden, turning slowly
As she turns back to where she started, she sees something, right in front of her: a    --  ' (') That must be it
She lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the ghost's eye is the     from the preying mantis tractor, which with the Other Father, a   , at its controls, his own hands and the tractor
The mechanical hands  Other Father to  , and the tractor  at Coraline, its arms
She yells, backs away
Other Father calls in a garbled voice: Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee
Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the fountains as the tractor moves in
(') Don't waaaanno hurrrrrt you
The Other Father tries to steer the tractor away, but the mechanical hands are stronger
It moves onto the bridge - in front of it
Halfway over, it lurches, then The tractor hangs precariously for a moment
Other Father  away one mechanical hand, and with , manages to
(') Taaaake it
Coraline   and just    before the tractor and Other Father fall away and Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire Coraline   , shaken
The ghost eye/gear knob  , no magic candy necessary
Bless you, miss, you found me
But there's two eyes still lost
Don't worry, 'm getting the hang of it
Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other House
has begun, the full moon a pale acid green
Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she heads towards the house
haunting version of Spink and Forcible's show song starts to play
,     ' - '   : chaser lights circle the door at half-speed
Haunting show song continues
Coraline
She carefully descends towards
- her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears behind the entry curtains
She steps close, pulls the curtain open
Song stops
, quiet and dark save for light coming through entry curtains
She spots usher's  on the ground
- she picks it up, clicks it on, and She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive, then   overhead
She aims flashlight up and startles a   - - half Scotties/half bats
One bares his teeth and
She clicks off the light and shivers
On stage, one spotlight and footlights   on a huge, wrapped
It hangs from ropes and sandbags
She cautiously climbs up onto the stage

She holds her  - - to her eye
There is a -  coming from inside the wrapper
Coraline    through the paper, steels herself, then reaches inside
She touches something sticky and cold and inhuman
Clenching her teeth, she grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together , - Young Spink and Forcible's
Her heart thumps
She  the   open like scallop shells until a large -on-a-ring is revealed
() The pearl
The hands suddenly
She
Young Spink and Forcible, twisted together into one taffy monster, Thief
Give it back
Coraline  ,  the candy arm out across the stage
The taffy monster   another paired arm, and starts    , ropes swaying on pulleys
(') (in unison) You thief
Thief

Coraline, desperate, gets an idea
She clicks on her flashlight and aims it at the -
They  with annoyance,  their wings
The taffy monster is
Coraline hurls the flashlight at the bat-dogs and
Angered, they - just like she planned
Bat-dogs are closing on the left, the taffy monster on the right
She waits to the very last second, and then -
Coraline's hand is released by the taffy hands, leaving her the
The bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as- stone - turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and theater
The  in Coraline's hand
(
) Hurry on, girl - her web is unwinding
Coraline nods, sticks the pearl in her bag, and looks up towards the ceiling and beyond
/ '  - '  , on lower ext stairs to We hear haunting circus music in the air
Other Mr

The pale green moon is nearly - now with what is clearly the    , ,
as she climbs the last flight of stairs to Bobinsky's
She stops with a  at the top
The flag has been replaced with the     - gloves, pants and sneakers pinned on - hanging like old laundry
Oh, Wybie
She takes a breath, leans out over the railing and shouts
(') '
The door behind her  open
Coraline shivers - she is definitely scared
'   - Coraline steps into the apartment and carefully shuts the door
The cannons and Ferris wheel are dark and quiet; the circus tent glows dimly
Pale green moonlight shines in patches through holes in the roof
The corners and edges of the room are very dark
suddenly  by the door behind her
Coraline whips around, on guard
He   past the cannons on her right, leaning towards her
Hello, ga--boo-shka
There are too many joints in his arms and legs
'm Coraline
His tall, crooked hat is pulled so low, and his collar so high, that his face is completely hidden
He throws out his arm towards her and the from the mouse circus rolls from his sleeve to his hand
Is dis vhat you're looking for
She looks through the hole of the triangle candy and sees an    the  '
Uh-huh
She grabs for it, but he's too quick
He back-bends to all fours and  around her towards the back shadows
You tink vinning game is goot ting
Coraline holds up the triangle candy, scans the room for him
His voice sounds distorted now
(
) (') You'll just go home and be bored and neglected

(') same as alvays
He  - from his ankles, his head stopping right by Coraline's
She whips around, alarmed
(') Stay here vis us; vee vill listen to you and laugh vis you
He  to the floor on his head, then  into the circus tent
Coraline does not want to follow him
But she does
- The Other Mr
is perched on a pile of   in the center of the ring
He moves like all his bones are broken
If you stay here, you can have vhatever you vant, vsig- - alvays
Coraline raises the triangle candy to her eye, sees the coming from inside his hat
You don't get it, do you
She moves closer
don't understand
Small forms  under the back of his coat
Of course you don't understand
You're just a copy she made of the real Mr
(last breath) Not even that anymore
Coraline pulls off his hat
Instead of his head, a - holding the circus ball
It barks at her then   the coat collar

There's a rat bark behind her and she turns

Coraline
The cannons, manned by rats, at her
She's  in the side, her leg, her ribs; she weaves and , the shots landing like punches
Ahhh
No
- perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel - appears in the front door as the rat approaches
Coraline looks up to see the    and the - Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and   as hard as she can
The whistling candy  through the pet door towards the , just outside
'  - The  , the  , and the cheese-wheel rat down the stairs with the ball
'  - Coraline, lurching forward,
(') Two waiting rats - tail tips tied - pull tails tight, and her
She     --

Noooo
The whole rig, with Coraline on top,  as it collapses,   toward the front of the house when it
She   a moment
for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and knees and  past the topiaries and poplars and white gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and circus ball
No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost eye
Coraline, lit by a   of pale green light, turns to look at the moon
It's nearly covered now by the Her  stings from a scrape
trickles from her knee
She feels nothing but
(') () Oh God, 've lost the game; 've lost everything
She sobs, hugs knees and face to chest
The band of light that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone
In the foreground, the  of the cheese-wheel rat - -
Sawdust leaks from its neck
Band of light  , the eclipse paused
There's a familiar  and Coraline looks up
Across from her on the front yard, sits the  , licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet
think  mentioned that  don't like rats at the best of times
Coraline smiles, walks towards him
think you might have said something like that
It looked like you needed this one, however
He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline
She picks it up , sticks it in her bag
Around her, the , , ,
Thank you
Looks towards house
(') 'm heading inside
still have to find my parents
: The stalled eclipse  , and in one beat, the last sliver of green moon is The  of the button shadow start to
strange insect thrumming has begun
What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of paper are falling
Confused, she looks up to see:
The huge button shadow is    and then the around it    , revealing dirty white light
The destruction  from sky to the distant hills, the sound of a million, invisible locusts growing louder
The cat hisses
Deeply alarmed, they look from one direction to another
out front yard
The destruction  up the driveway,   the poplars, and then  the topiary elephant and bird
Coraline and cat, his to find they are at the center of a on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their feet  , white light coming through
Cat makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the movie
Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her guardian angel
(') Come on, quickly
The cat  and she catches him, then   up the  porch steps to the front door
She gets through just in time, and  it shut
- It's dark and stable in here, with just some creaks and intermittent vibrations
poisonous green light spills from the other living room
Coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder, past wallpaper that   as she passes, to the room where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on glass
- poisonous   -     - in the fireplace
The bug furniture looks grey now, their lights flickering as if short-circuited; legs and wings twitching uncontrollably
Coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign of her parents
in foreground
She senses the Other Mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of Mother at all but a witch, a Beldam
She turns
The Beldam is hunched on the sofa - her face hidden
So, you're back
Her voice sounds dry and tired
She turns her face towards Coraline
It is a   , cracked and peeling - her true face
(') And you brought vermin with you
Coraline shudders and steps back
The cat makes a fearful sound and digs his claws into her shoulder
No,
brought a friend
The Beldam rises up 12
She is  to the bone; with plate-like shoulders and hips; her bustle now an arachnid's tail section
Her true form
She reaches her long, sharp     to Coraline's face
() You know  love you
Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is
You, you have a very funny way of showing it
The Beldam smiles, turns away, then back, her hand outstretched
So
Where are they - the ghost eyes
Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and starts to hand them over
But she catches herself
Hold on
And pulls back
(') We aren't finished yet, are we
The Beldam looks daggers, then smiles sweetly
No,  suppose not
After all, you still need to find your old parents, don't you
Too bad you won't have this
She produces the   that Coraline lost and it into the green fire
The Beldam laughs while the   out of the candy with sparks and pops
The third ghost eye in her hand
Coraline turns away, so the witch won't see
(
) Be clever, miss; even if you win she'll never let you go
Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the Beldam to unlock it
She furrows her brow as an idea comes to her then nods
She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she can muster, says: already know where you've hidden them
The Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and sceptical
Well
produce them
Coraline points to the little door
They're behind that door
The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and speaks very quietly
Oh, they are, are they
smile creeps onto her terrible face
And she , moving in an odd, laboring way, as if she had four legs instead of two
She signals the armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline
Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on wet glass
Looks around, desperate - where is it coming from
The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he on the mantel
He whispers to Coraline -- There
-- and  to land beside the   - - -
With a -, a section of glass is   from inside by a   - and we see the tiny, cold figures that are ' Coraline's heart races
She purposely stays back from them
() Mom
Dad
, by little door
Oblivious to Coraline's discovery, she  up the  into her hand
She turns to Coraline, expectantly
(') Go on
Open it
They'll be there, all right
The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns it, leaves the key in place
She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song voice
You're wrong, Coraline
She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider- web tunnel
, who glances from the open door to the cat - obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam
She's thinking very hard
(') () They aren't there
She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's , the other a
Triumphant, the Beldam softly gloats: (') Now you're going to stay here forever
Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the fury she can
No

She    off the mantel and (') And she    at the Beldam
The   - face shocked with surprise -  through the air and lands     '

Coraline  the   with her parents inside, stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door from the other side
The Beldam   at the cat
The cat ,   , and - quick as you can - -  '
as he's thrown on armoire bug
, hands covering her face
Her hands pull away to show ,   and (') You horrible cheating girl
She furiously  the floor which   in a spiral of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center
huge
The web trap   into a
There is nothing beyond but
The cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture straight to the little door and disappears into the tunnel
Coraline falls the very bottom of the web
Fifty feet above, the Beldam   and like a huge, flying spider
Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the trap
The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around, grasping blindly
(') Noo
Where are you
You selfish brat
Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the , still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room
She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag on a barb
She pulls and pulls until it breaks free, sending a (') Hahahaha
The Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now
Coraline makes it to the little door, but the (
) (') - Coraline  through the door,   , and grabs the door's handle
Before she can shut it, the '
Coraline     , knocking her back
The cat takes off down the tunnel
Coraline nearly shuts the door, when The door
The ghost children's , and    '  that grip the door's handle
And her
The door
The Beldam at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one thin claw
There's a final moment of resistance - the Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then The  , and the Beldam's hand drops to the ground
She  like a metal rake on pavement
Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when it is  from the other side, green light coming through cracks
She takes off down the tunnel, stooped down, as fast as she can
The pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing
(
) '
'
' And then the tunnel behind coraline , like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side Ahead,  , and then the - Coraline   through the doorway, and
split- second later, the Coraline is
But the real-world door and lock, hold
It's over
Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's ever been,  in breaths of air till her heart slows a little
The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue with white clouds
She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside
She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes and garden shears
But the snow globe is
She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor
Her hand hits a small  by the fireplace, with tiny bits of
drip plops down, then another
She looks up to the mantel and spots the
She stands up and finds that it's  , and neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside
As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe, Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does this mean and where are her parents
Then her calls to her
(
) Coraline
We're home
Her   enter the room from the hallway, a dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair
Mom
Dad
missed you so much
Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around them
Missed us
Huh
Mel notices the broken snow globe
(') Oh no, you broke my favorite snow globe
didn't break it
It must've broke when you escaped
Mom spots her bloody knee
And cut your knee
Charlie crouches low, clutching his briefcase
Coraline,  asked you to count all the windows, not put your knee through them
- Mel tells her
Well, get yourself cleaned up, () we're going out tonight
We gotta lot to celebrate
Coraline, confused, takes a stab
You're talking about
your garden catalog
Of course
What else
Her parents turn to leave the room
But look at the snow on your clothes
But the snow melts without a trace
() What's gotten into you, Coraline
Her parents walk off
Coraline shrugs her shoulders and looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel
She cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room
: - , The  is parked out front, its interior light fading as light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on
We Charlie make a strangled sound
'  - Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and , wounds-dressed, hair shining
The  hangs from a string around her neck
gibbous moon shines in the clear night sky
Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's an alien face-hugger then,  , falls on the bed
Coraline
So, gonna order the tulips
He opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this
What's that
For the garden party
He sits up and kids her, tickling her face with the squid
have no idea what you're talking about
Dad
She turns to Mom, arranging things on a shelf
(') So, Mom
Invitations
Don't forget the invitations
Her mother nods, points up
Even Bobinsky
Mr
's not drunk, Mom, he's just
eccentric
Charlie
He bends down to kiss her
Good night, Coraline
As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers next to her daughter
She gives Coraline a "told you so" look, and she and Charlie leave the room
Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the she'd wanted
She pulls one on to admire when the   appears outside her window Oh, hello again
She walks over to the window, opens it
(') You still mad
His expression says yes, he's still mad
(') 'm really sorry  threw you at her - the Other Mother
it was all  could think of
The cat's angry expression softens
He rests his head on her hand, licking her fingers and purrs
Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and carries him over to her bed
She grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large , the  , and the
She holds them out to the cat
(') think it's time, don't you
To set them free
The cat nods
She puts the ghost eyes under her pillow and gently lays down, the cat lying beside her
The two of them close their eyes, and in no time at all, they doze off to sleep

Coraline, studying sky, her back to us
From behind ,  sound and   begins to shine on her
She turns toward us, shielding her eyes
Coraline's eyes adjust to the brightness to see the , now transformed into  ; , small fluttering

Well, 'm glad it's finally over

They gather around Coraline and bow their heads
() It is over and done with
for us
Silent beat
What about
me
The tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably, then : You're in terrible danger, girl
Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation
But how
locked the door
It's the key, miss, there's only one and the Beldam will find it
The     around Coraline's neck floats out in front of Coraline
She grabs it
The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly
() Tain't all bad, miss
Thou art alive
thou art still
living
They begin to swirl around her, spinning faster and faster
Coraline starts to turn and then she -- : '  - -- above her to find covers thrown off and the  awake by her side
Coraline lifts up her pillow and  - the like hatched bird eggs
She takes out the key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice : -- 've gotta hide this somewhere, s- somewhere she can never
The cat doesn't like the sound of this
Coraline grabs her blanket and heads to her door
But the cat leaps down and blocks her way
(') Outta my way
She sidesteps the cat and leaves her room
The cat glares after her ,  ,   - Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads down the hall
She passes the   and exits frame
stays on living room, where, on the in the corner wall,  and  start to
-- : - The baseboard is
Through the narrow gap at the door's bottom, the It scrambles out of frame in the direction of Coraline
- Coraline moves briskly, the house below, that's tied round her neck
,   reach like fingers across the gibbous moon
Coraline sings her father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling
Oh
my twitchy witchy girl, think you are so nice
- She moves down past the old fruit trees, now covered with that fall gently like snow
give you bowls of porridge And  give you bowls of ice cream
Coraline, moving away
The ' drops into frame and - after her
(') give you lots of kisses, And  give you lots of hugs
- Coraline jams the    Wybie used under the well's cover, lining it up over the
But  never give you sandwiches With grease and worms and mung beans
Circling around behind the  , the behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer
Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one side, leaving the
Huffing and sweating, she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's around her neck
The hand,  what is about to happen, Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head
The hand  onto the big stump and  through the air to    and
Coraline makes a  , her fingers caught between the key string and her neck
The  wants to       and the hits  and ; an ; and   - hollering a   all his own - comes     on his whining electric bike
Wybie  the throttle, and, leaning out,  the confused  with his slug tongs
He   and    , readying to throw the hand in
But the   , and  his handlebars
, Wybie's bike   , and , he just manages to hang on with one hand
The Beldam's hand, caught on Wybie's coattail,   his body and face and onto the well's edge where it to make him fall
(') () Get off
Coraline, choking, rises to her feet
She grabs her and - in the still-blazing headlight of the crashed bike - she   and
It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it
The hand     and
It crouches to attack her
And then   , pumped with adrenaline, a raised over his head
He And it  into
Wybie struggles to catch his breath
Coraline - breathing hard - removes the key and string from around her sore neck
She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together with the string
The key is left attached
The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and By the light of a stray moonbeam, they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in the dark water at the bottom
They slide the well cover in place
Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw
He looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little with moonlight
(') -'m really sorry  didn't believe you about all this
evil stuff, Coraline
Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath, stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the first time
Why did you change your mind
He walks over, and takes out an old & photo from his jacket
-well, Gramma showed me this picture, after  called you crazy
He hands it to her
: two light-skinned black girls - dressed in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink Palace, before it was divided into apartments
One looks just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the , which looks just like her
(
) (') It's her and her sister, before she disappeared
Behind them, blossoms fall like snow in the orchard
The sweet ghost girl
Wybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the distance
'  (
) Wyborne
Come home
(re: his grandmother) Oh, man
what am  going to tell her
She looks up from the photo and smiles
Just bring her by the house tomorrow
We can tell her together
We
we can
You know, 'm glad you decided to stalk me
She gives Wybie a playful punch on the arm and
Wasn't my idea
The   jumps up on the   and
Coraline smiles
We   to the sky and see the last ropey clouds - like two clawed hands - clear away from the bright gibbous moon
: ,  - One   floats against a blue sky with puffy, white clouds
past more balloons to a , set up by the front gates
Coraline picks up a    and heads out to her hard-working , all wearing garden gloves and showing signs of having helped plant about , along with their , are set up at a table below the steps
Empty plant cartons are stacked nearby along with some garden tools and empty bags of peat moss
Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible
(straining to see) Oh, look April - Pink Ladies
Actually, it's just lemonade
Coraline hands them the beverages, then nods towards the digging in the flowers
(') How's Angus doing
Miss Spink sighs
Oh, much better, dear
But he can't duck his wings forever
Coraline heads up the steps to find her  dumping a heavy bag of   around the dead-looking tree in the stone circle
Here comes a burp
Charlie
() Charlie
Oh, excu-say-moi, but that pizza was delicious
Mel
Cold drinks
Charlie nods, grabs them for Mel and Wybie
() Oh yeah, great
() You were right, Coraline
really hate dirt, but the tulips look nice
Thanks, mom
Coraline, delighted, moves on
Coraline comes upon Bobinsky in the bottom of the drained fish pond
He's stealthily  just-planted tulips from the dirt there, and putting  in their place

) (pulling beets) Ooo, dret nican

How are the meeshkas, Mr
Surprised and looking very guilty, he tries to cover up his activities
She smiles and hands him a drink
() Dey tell me that   you - are saviour, Caroline
And --   soon as dey are ready -- dey vish to give   special tenks-you performance
He drains his glass of lemonade
familiar voice is heard approaching
Coraline turns and smiles
'  (
) Wyborne,  know where 'm going-- Wybie and his  as they walk through the garden gates ' (') -- grew up here
Coraline sees them and waves
