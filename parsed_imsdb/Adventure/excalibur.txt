Written by Rospo Pallenberg & John Boorman Adapted from "Le Morte 'Arthur" by Thomas Malory Final Draft : - Darkness
The sound of battle cries and the clang of metal upon metal
The forest lights up with huge sparks flying from sword and ax as armored knights hack and swing at each other
Mounted knights collide head-on at full gallop, their armor made incandescent in the clash
Sparks eddy in their wakes and float to the ground
The forest catches fire
on the flames
Out of the sounds of ancient battle grows music, heroic and barbaric, shot through with melancholy
Two crazed eyes reflect the fire
The eyes belong to a man without age, at once ancient and boyish, female and male; his eyes are pained from the burden of too much knowledge
So close is he to the flames that a lock of his wild hair sizzles alight
He slaps at the fire as if it were an annoying insect
He wears a cloak of black trimmed with silver
It is Merlin
The wizard weaves a path through the burning forest, dodging the combatants, searching
Lord Uther
Lord Uther
The forest around him weeps softly with the sounds that follow slaughter
Patches of undergrowth are smoldering
Small flames lick bark and branches
Smoke floats through the trees and hovers over the bodies of the dying and the dead
huge knight reins up beside Merlin on a lathered horse
His armor is blood spattered
He is weary from battle
He looks down at Merlin, his countenance fierce
The blade of his sword glows with an unnatural aura
It's done
truce
We meet at the river
(disgusted) Talk
Lovers murmuring to each other
,  - Waiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the forest is a warlord, the Duke of Cornwall
He is flanked by his armored warriors
Lot of Lowthean prominent among them
They are battle-weary and bloodied, but they look ready to fight
Behind them is an army of lesser knights
To the opposite bank come Uther and Merlin, a much smaller force of knights, including Uryens, Lord of Gore, surrounding them
spit on your truce, Uther
If you want peace, throw down your swords
Uther and the Duke of Cornwall glare at each other in silence across the river
Uther strains forward, burning with anger; but Merlin restrains him
should butcher all and every one of them
Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues
Just show the sword
Uther unsheathes his mighty sword, and brandishes it in the air high over his head
The blade hums disquietingly and leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air
The marvel instills dread in all present
(waxing eloquent) Behold the sword of power, Excalibur
Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow
(and in an aside to Uther) Speak the words
(bellowing) One land, one king
That is my peace
The Duke of Cornwall looks around nervously as some of his knights fall to their knees in awe
Lord Uther, if  yield to the sword of power, what will you yield
Me, yield
Merlin urges Uther hard
(a whisper) He has given
Now you must
The two knights glare at each other, rage contending with anger
The land from here to the sea is yours if you will enforce the King's will
The enemies lock eyes and Merlin watches anxiously
Done
All men from both sides break out in wild cheers
My Lord King Uther, let us feast together
To my castle
Lord Merlin, you must join - But Merlin is nowhere in sight
-  - Drums and wailing flutes fill the banquet hall with a lusty rhythm
Armored warriors watch a lone woman dancing
She is very beautiful, both sensuous and innocent
Uther sits at the long table beside the Duke of Cornwall with the barons and dukes of the land, and the lesser knights
The table is stained with wine and littered with bones and half-eaten fruit
Uther's eyes burn with lust as he watches the dancer
would wish you such a wife, Lord Uther, as my Igrayne
So innocent, but in bed, a furnace
The Duke rises and goes to his wife, be-striding the center of the hall and Igrayne weaves circles of dance around him
He gloats with pride
The words escape his lips: must have her
Lot spins to face him
What
You're mad
What about the alliance
(oblivious) must have her
And risk all you've won
This castle commands the sea gate to the kingdom
Uther is not one for politics, and Lot's words sail past him
The King lusts for Igrayne
bell is struck not far away
The music ceases and the hall falls silent
The great door creaks open, revealing the dawn light, and a monk steps into the hall and waits by it
Muffled by corridors of stone, a choir of monks can now be heard singing the high, ecstatic harmonies of the Te Deum
Those who have fallen asleep at the table are roused, those drunk, helped up
,   - The monk leads the party down the hallway of the castle
Thin shafts of dawnlight filter through archers' slits in the thick walls onto stone floors
Otherwise, it is dark
Each person, lady and knight, proceeds alone, head bent, some crossing themselves
Uther is among them
He stops in a dark alcove, breathing heavily, waiting
As the lovely Igrayne drifts past him, he pulls her out of sight of the others
In a shaft of pale light Uther clasps Igrayne to his breastplate, his iron arm wrapped around her frail body
So violent is his embrace that she cannot breathe, her mouth is wide with fear, and her feet do not touch the ground; an impaled butterfly
You will be mine
Wife and queen, bed and crown
His face is close to hers, looking as though he would devour her tender whiteness with his kiss
She doesn't answer; she can't
Even Uther understands this and lets her go
(a fierce whisper) want no other crown and no other bed than those  have
Her gown and her fragile skin torn on the spikes of his armor, Igrayne backs away and joins the procession
Uther trembles with unreleased passion
,   - Igrayne enters the candlelit chapel from which issues the chant, calling the castle to worship
She rushes to her husband's side, kneeling next to him and whispering
The Duke of Cornwall looks back at Uther, hatred in his eyes
-    - Uther is in a towering rage
Sword drawn, he stalks among the biers of fallen knights
Squires and clerics keep a healthy distance
The sky is lowering, pregnant with rolling thunder
Beyond his encampment, high on a cliff rising out of the sea stands the impregnable Tintagel Castle, seat of the Duke of Cornwall, now under siege
(bellowing in all directions) Merlin
Where are you
Just then a knight rides up and dismounts
It is Ulfius, a lieutenant
Have you found him
No-- But he cannot finish
He is taken aback by the sudden appearance of a hideous hag who approaches, rattling a beggar's pan
What a hurry you were in this morning, good sir
You forgot to give this old woman a coin
saw you half a day's gallop from here
asked you if you had seen Merlin
returned here straight away
How did - -- heard
have come
am also Merlin
The figure straightens, the filthy rags become a flowing cape, and the hair is swept back by the wind, andoit is Merlin, laughing
have walked my way since the beginning of time
Sometimes  give, sometimes  take
It is mine to know which, and when
(exploding) Dumb riddles, Merlin
am your King
Ulfius edges away
know the storm inside you, and what it has wrought
The alliance forged is wrecked
The Duke of Cornwall under siege
All this for lust
Selfish lust
Uther grabs Merlin
For Igrayne
One night with her
Do it
Use the magic
Merlin frowns pensively, his gaze searching strange distances and wandering; then focusing, blazing straight at Uther
You will swear by your true kingship to grant me what  wish
Then you shall have it
Uther kneels and draws his sword and holds it up by the blade, a cross
swear it
By Excalibur and the holy-- --What issues from your lust will be mine
Swear it again
swear it
Merlin looks down sorrowfully at the kneeling King
,   - The Duke of Cornwall watches a force of armored knights riding forth from Uther's war camp, with banners flying
It passes beneath the castle and on toward a distant cliff
(to a lieutenant) It's Uther and all his best knights
He leaves behind little more than fledglings to guard his camp
His eyes are as cold and as pale as ice
- Uther and his knights, and Merlin on a mule, ride to the high promontory and dismount
Here, overlooking the sea, is a circle of ancient stones, carved with strange runes and hieroglyphics, and as the wind moves through them it moans and sighs
The knights watch as Merlin and Uther, leading his horse, walk toward the stones
Merlin strides into the circle, turning to look at Uther, who hesitates
Come
Uther starts to make the sign of the cross, but Merlin halts him with a gesture
Uther's hand drops, and he enters the circle with his horse
Merlin and Uther look out across the sea, to Tintagel Castle high upon the cliff
Merlin solemnly raises his arms toward that distant castle, and chants in an ancient language, the sounds of which he marries to the roaring and whining of the wind
The wind becomes stronger, and Merlin's incantations become more intense, and the wind in turn becomes wilder still
Until Merlin is charged with a fierce, nonhuman power, as the wind buffets his slight frame
And then, for all to understand: hold the balance of all things in my summoning
Arise mists
Come fog
-   - From the horizon a front of fog advances toward the castle to envelop it, and continues across the gulf to the circle of stones
,   - The portal opens and a small force of armored men, led by the Duke of Cornwall, exits
fog is thickening all around them
- The advancing front envelops Merlin and Uther, eddying around the stones
All else is obliterated
Mount your horse
The King does
Ride straight to the castle, across the sea of fog
Uther spurs straight for the edge of the cliff, then reins in his horse abruptly
But the cliff, the sea
Merlin rages, crazed
Ride across
Across the bridges of desire
Your lust will hold you up
For  have just woven it into the fabric of the world
This is magic - making solid what is in the mind, and unsolid, that which is already solid
He gives the horse a stinging blow with his staff
The horse and Uther charge forward into a gallop and stepping off where the hidden edge of the cliff would be, hoofbeats ceasing and the horse dropping for the blink of an eye, they gallop across the fog
' Galloping on no visible terrain, Uther and his horse advance through the restless fog, and as they recede rider and animal become a wavering, changeable form within the cloud
,   - Horse and rider pull up at the gate
(calling) Wake up in there
It is
If it was not for the electric blue hue burning in the eyes of the man entering the castle, the same magic hue that Excalibur left upon the air when wielded, the resemblance to the Duke if Cornwall would be perfect
After a moment the portal opens
,   - He passes into an inner court, the portal closing behind
Armed men emerge cautiously
Thinking that it is their Duke they help him dismount
'' Have the horse ready
ride out before sunrise
An inner gate opens and the 'Duke' goes through it
'   - The real Duke and his men ride through the fogbound camp, cutting the ropes of the tents, stabbing the men trapped beneath the canvas
When a frightened crow flies squawking into the face of the Duke's horse, which rears
He is unhorsed and falls, and impales himself on a tent stake
Dying, the true Lord of Tintagel Castle rises and staggers forward, blood pumping from him
,   - little girl of four awakens from a nightmare, a small lone figure in her canopied bed
Her eyes are ice, like her father's
Papa
Papa
Igrayne is soon at her side, lifting the child from the bed, holding her tight
My father is dead
'  - The 'Duke' enters
The room is empty, but the door to Morgana's room is open
'  - The 'Duke' stands in the doorway
Igrayne herself is surprised
Look, here is your father
It was just a dream, little one
'' Come Igrayne
Igrayne kisses Morgana, tucks her in and returns to her own room, closing the door
The child doesn't know whether to believe the truth of the dream or the waking truth
'  - In full armor, the 'Duke' bears down on the naked Igrayne on her marriage bed
She stares at him, wondering
But his eyes are closed, and finally he carries her in his wild passion, her white limbs tangling around the lustre of his armor
- And Merlin is jolted awake from deep within himself, coming out of a trance
It is done
The future has found root in the present
He lifts himself up on his staff
He stands in the midst of the ancient stones, bristling with excitement
Uther's mighty knights are asleep, a deep unnatural sleep, huddled together and surrounded by their horses
And then Merlin swoons, collapsing to the ground
,   - His lieutenants deposit the Duke of Cornwall's bloodless body upon the long table
His eyes are wide open, icy and cunning even in death
The ladies of the castle support and comfort the grief-stricken Igrayne as she approaches the body of her husband
Morgana hangs onto her mother's gown
When did it happen
Where
In the camp of Uther, my lady, just after nightfall
It can't be
He came to me, to his bed, last night
It was his spirit, yearning for you in his hour of death, that visited you
His spirit
Pale with grief, Igrayne stares at her dead husband in silence
Then her hand drifts to her stomach
When she talks again, undone and resolved, it is to all and herself: Tintagel Castle falls to Uther
But what shall become of me, and the child  bear
Morgana shows no distress
She runs her baby hands across her father's face and closes his eyes
The intensity that was frozen in them is now added to her own pale and cunning eyes
- Merlin has been propped up against one of the stones
He is in a deep trance and Uther is attempting to shake him awake
want her, Merlin
cannot be without her
Tintagel is mine
Can take her now
Tell me
Merlin's eyes open but he sees nothing, and only a puzzling squeal issues from him
' ,  - Morgana watches from a corner
The ladies of the castle surround Igrayne who is giving birth
Noisy crows alight on the windowsill
Only Morgana notices
,   - Uther strides to Igrayne's bedchamber, his warrior knights following
He is dirty and his iron dress is blood-spattered
(bellowing) Three horses died under me, so hard did  spur them here
Is it born
Is it alive
' ,   - At his approach and entrance the ladies shrink back, and Morgana edges closer to her mother, and seats herself on the bed beside her
Ingrain holds her newborn baby in her arms, the blood of birth still wet upon it
Out
The ladies slip past him to the door, and he goes up to Igrayne
What is it, lady
Terrified of him, Igrayne faces him the best she can
boy, sir
Rest yourself
Uther waves away her words but does sit down on the bed, exhausted
He notices Morgana, who stares at him
Send the girl away
She is just a child - Out
Igrayne draws the child to her and kisses her cheek
(whispering) Go now
Come back later
The child leaves silently, hatred in her eyes
She watches me with her father's eyes
He grasps the newborn baby with his iron hand, and pulls it to himself
He looks upon it with wonder, with a gentleness that is unexpected
Igrayne, is he mine, or - He can't bring himself to say his name
She hesitates on the edge of tears, worried for the infant lying in its iron cradle
The night he died, a man loved me with great fierceness
He looked like my husband, spoke like, smelled like, felt like my own husband
But it was not he, for he was already dead
It wasn't his spirit, for this child, who was conceived that night, is flesh and blood
know nothing more
Uther draws a dagger
He lifts it
No-- But he uses it before Igrayne can move
He severs the leather thongs that bind the iron breastplate to his chest
He casts it to the floor
His chest is smooth and milk-white in striking contrast to his creased, weathered face
And beaming, he holds the baby to it
Through him,  will learn to love them, for  am tired of battle will stay by his side and (looking shyly at Igrayne) his mother's
Igrayne's hatred for the man is at the very edge of becoming love
The baby starts to cry
Here
It's hungry
And his free hand opens her shift, and he holds a swollen breast in his gloved hand, squeezing gently
Milk bubbles from it and he thrusts the baby's mouth onto it
Igrayne weeps and Uther watches proudly as the baby suckles
Merlin advances from the window, his cape the same iridescent green-black as the feathers of the crows that were perched by the window
Merlin
Out of the sick sleep at last
Doing what  did for you, it wasn't easy, you know
It takes it's toll
It took nine moons to get back my strength
Uther avoids looking at him
Now you must pay me
The child is mine, Uther
have come for him
Uther is shaken to his roots
Igrayne watches, trying to understand
The oath
You didn't say-- You didn't ask
Uther, is it true
Don't let him take the child
swore an oath, Igrayne
made a pact with Merlin
Igrayne suddenly understands
She glares at Uther
It was you
You came to me that night
You are the father
Uther is caught, and turns to Merlin who is harsh and unswaying
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child
To kill and be king, is that all
Maybe not even that, Uther
thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword
But it'll take another, a greater king
You strike me with words as hard as steel
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths
You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you
Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you
Give me the child, Uther,  will protect him
Go back to your war tent
Uther wrenches the baby from it's mother's breast and hands him to Merlin
(in torment) By the oath, take the devil child
Take him
With the bawling baby under his cape, Merlin exits
Igrayne pulls herself out of the bed, weak, her legs giving under her
She starts after Merlin
Why must he have the baby
Uther stops her with his bulk and she claws savagely at his chest to get past him
He weeps as he folds his arms around her
,   - As Merlin walks through the castle, the baby crying in his arms, the knights and ladies step back, afraid to intervene in royal matters
,   -
Merlin comes across the empty banquet hall, cooing to the baby, strangely pacifying him
Morgana steps out of the shadows in his path, and Merlin stops at the sight of the little girl, her pale eyes glaring at him
She speaks haltingly and clearly while far-off Igrayne cries out her distress
Merlin, are you now the father, and the mother, of the baby
Staring at her, Merlin shudders and without answering he continues away, faster now, and into an unlit passageway, disappearing from sight a bit sooner than an ordinary mortal would have
- The forest is dark and shiny with rain
An unseen battle rages
The first combatant in sight is Uther, who swings the mighty Excalibur, cutting an attacker in half at the waist
Uther and a small force of knights, Ulfius among them, are retreating through the slippery wet forest, completely outnumbered
Lord Lot of Lowthean and Lord Uryens of Gore are the leaders of the attack
(to his men) The King's sword
must have it
Ulfius and his men stand their ground so the King may escape the onslaught
They are hacked down
Uther flees alone, severing the limbs of any man and tree that stands in his way
- Uther has gained on his pursuers
He comes to a small clearing where the spine of a buried boulder rises through the forest floor
He stops upon it, breathing hard, dripping blood
He rages aloud, but his throat is raw and cracked and only a whisper comes out
Merlin, where are you
To weave a mist, to hide us
He hears his pursuers closing in
No one shall have the sword
No one shall wield Excalibur but me
He holds it by the hilt with both hands, the blade pointing to the ground of stone
He flexes his knees
He lifts up his hands above his head
And with all the strength that rage and pain can muster, and more, he drives the blade of Excalibur into the stone, nearly to the hilt
His mouth widens in an awful silent scream, and then the foam of saliva pink with blood issues from deep within him, so violent was his effort
As the sword cuts into the rock, the earth shudders
- The forest quakes
The knights searching for Uther halt in fear
,  - And far away, a caped figure is crossing a field toward a wood, when the earth shakes, stirring animals and birds
The man turns
He is Merlin, the two day-old baby peeking from his cape
Merlin is amazed at the phenomenon, he puts his ear to a rock protruding from the earth
Into the spine of the dragon
(and then he is saddened) Uther
loved you, mighty child
And tears welling, and giggling at the same time, he whisks away into the woods
- Uther staggers away, colliding with trees, staggering, crashing to the ground
Until the only life left in him is the coursing of his blood, flowing from his gaping mouth onto the leaves on the forest floor
The enemy knights advance through the trees
They prod at the fallen leviathan, they roll him over to get at his scabbard
Only then do they see the sword in the stone, and they stop, amazed and afraid
Their captains appear
Uryens sees what they are staring at, and races to the sword and attempts to pull it out
He strains with all his might, but it is immovable
Let me
He shoves Uryens aside, but he can't loosen the sword either, and he rages with frustration
: : "Fifteen years passed and the land was without a king
" : - Peasants spill over the crest of a hill
They are fleeing a force of armored knights, their plumed helmets forged in the semblance of predatory animals
The knights thunder past the peasants, trampling the ripening crops
Sir Uryens is their leader, his hard face indifferent to the havoc he leaves in his wake
The peasants watch in mute anger
- Sir Lot leading another group of mounted knights comes galloping into a small hamlet, panicked chickens and pigs scattering at their approach
The farmers run for their lives as the steel men dismount, leading their horses to water and hay, and searching for vittles
knight spots a woman who stands frozen with fear, and he drags her into the barn as her crying child watches
-  - farmhouse is burning nearby, and three mounted figures make their way along a trail at a walking pace - an old knight in leather and mail, a young knight proud in gleaming new armor; and on a farm horse, a squire with baggage and jousting lance
The old knight, Sir Ector, is troubled by what he sees
It is a dark hour
everywhere lawlessness and destruction, and no one to lead us out of it
Just then, ten crazed peasants emerge from the darkness, hurling stones and armed with clubs and pronged sticks
They surround the three riders
Sir Ector wheels around and slices the air with his sword to ward off the ambushers
Listen all
am Sir Ector of Morven and these are my sons
You would wrong me, for  have never stolen from others, or destroyed the fruit of the land
The peasants edge closer, working up the nerve to rush the horsemen
The sound of thundering hooves cuts through the clamor
cavalcade of riders, armor gleaming in the moonlight, advances across the fields at a gallop
Immediately the peasants scatter
The old knight is on the verge of tears
The people's anger is just
It is sad that for our own safety, we will have to ride to the tournament with these robber knights
- Red with the first light of day, Excalibur rests in the stone as King Uther left it
The field is itched with tents, each flying its heraldic banner
Knights and squires are everywhere, preparing horses and armor for the joust
burly man in religious robes harangues the crowd, vying for attention
This is Easter day, when Christ rose again
Who will find strength in victory of arms
Who will draw the sword
The Bishop goes among the tents, through the teeming throng, solemnly casting holy water upon man and horse, armor and banner
The knights kneel at the Bishop's transit, but ceremony does not lift the air of grimness that lies over the event
,     - Their armor ablaze with sunlight, two mounted knights thunder toward each other at full gallop, lowering their long jousting lances
As they meet, the lance of each knight is deflected by the shield of the other
gasp goes through the crowd, and the two knights charge past each other
They wheel around at the end of the jousting ground and go at each other again from the other direction
Again lances strike, and this time one of the men is hit in the chest and violently unhorsed
The crowd cheers
- The victor, Leondegrance, rides up to the stone and dismounts
Each great knight with his coterie of lesser knights comes to watch
charge of expectation is in the air, although most knights are glowering with envy
Leondegrance of Camelyarde ascends to the sword, grabs it by the hilt, and begins to tug with all his might
Excalibur is immovable
The moment of tension passes
Leondegrance staggers toward his waiting squires, who lead him away
All the others return to the battle sport
- At the edge of the jousting ground Sir Ector's son Sir Kay is getting ready for a bout
His brother Arthur is buckling the new armor while his father fusses about him, making small adjustments when he notices that Kay's scabbard is empty
He turns to Arthur and grab's him by the ear
Arthur, where is Kay's sword
good squire doesn't forget his knight's sword
The fifteen year-old boy blushes
left it in the tent, sir
Well hurry then, and get it
The boy dashes off as Sir Ector shakes his head, not without affection beneath the sternness
- Arthur runs in search of their tent
He finds it
- He enters
The saddle trunk has been emptied on the floor, equipment is scattered all over
Arthur is shocked, nonetheless he rummages madly
Finally he stops, on the verge of tears
It's been stolen
- He comes out, utterly defeated, and frantic
He stops by two knights who are arguing angrily; and one of them has left his sword in the grass
Arthur looks at it
He is tempted to steal it, but he can't
Head down, he wanders off
- Sir Ector and Sir Kay are waiting
Father, 'll go and see what's keeping him
- Arthur stops at the edge of the dark forest, totally dejected, when he sees the sword in the stone
He walks up to it, his face lighting up, brimming with innocence
He is alone, as everyone has returned to the jousting ground
If only Kay could have it
He smiles, forgetting his troubles, a boy again living in a fairy tale
He grasps the sword by the hilt and it comes away easily from its stone lock
Not expecting it to, he nearly falls
He stares at it, terribly excited and surprised: he tucks it under his arm and rushes back
- He bumps into Kay
(breathless) Your sword was stolen, Kay, but here is Excalibur
Is it too late hurried-- Kay takes it
He cannot believe what he's holding in his hands
He starts to talk but he is so agitated he can only stutter
- Kay, with Arthur in tow, rushes to Sir Ector and shows him the sword; he trembles with excitement
Look, Father
Excalibur
Does that mean that  am to be king
Sir Ector is dumbstruck
Did you free the sword, boy
did, Father
Ector looks at his son amazed, wanting to believe but not able to
We must go to the stone at once
With Excalibur in hand Ector of Morven heads for the stone, Kay following, and Arthur too, the boy flushed with excitement but a little worried, not understanding what is happening
The exchange between Sir Ector and Sir Kay has been overheard
Some have seen the sword in Sir Ector's hand
Rumor spreads like wildfire
- As Sir Ector ascends the stone, from all parts of the jousting ground knights and squires, the Bishop and the clerics, and peasants too, press around
Ector lowers the blade into the tight cleft and Excalibur sinks to its original position
Draw it, son
Sir Kay grabs the hilt and pulls without conviction, and the sword doesn't give
Eyes downcast, he lets go
Sir,  didn't draw the sword
Arthur gave it to me
Arthur
(spinning around to face him) How did you get the sword, child
(frightened) Sir
Kay needed a sword
His was stolen
saw Excalibur, and took it
You freed it, son
did, Father
beg your forgiveness
He starts to kneel but Ector pulls him up
Try the sword, Arthur
Arthur is about to grasp the hilt when Uryens and Lot, and other nobles, Leondegrance of Camelyarde, and Sir Caradoc and Sir Turquine among the younger, stride up
Stand back, Sir Ector, and take your children
We will try again
Uryens, Lot, Leondegrance, Caradoc, Turquine - each in turn grapples with the sword, only to be defeated by its immobility
The crowd around the stone is thickening with common folk
Let the boy try the sword
Let the boy try
The demand is echoed by peasants and serfs
The great knights remain silent and bitter in their defeat
Sir Ector pushes Arthur to the sword
Go ahead, boy
Don't be afraid
The boy hesitates shyly, and then takes the hilt of Excalibur and pulls out the sword with a great sweep
The throng is stunned
Silence falls
Some kneel, following the example of Sir Ector and Sir Kay, of the Bishop and Leondegrance
The other nobles stay back, confused, afraid, angered
Arthur stands there, little more than a boy, his cheeks flushed, his soft hair ruffled by the wind, his eyes shining with exultation, awe, and fear
Then, as if gaining confidence from the sword itself, he turns it in arcs above his head
We have our King, thanks be to God
The commoners and some of the knights react with roaring enthusiasm
The others draw closer to Uryens and Lot and their supporters, closing ranks around them
Please, Father, rise up
was your son before  became your King
if am King
Sir Ector rises, tears streaming down his cheeks
My Lord, you are King, all the more because you are not my son, and  am not your father
This is quite a shock to the boy king, and to the onlookers
Who is, then
don't know
Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own
At first,  did so because  feared Merlin, later because  loved you
Merlin's name is on the lips of all those close by
Who is Merlin
Speak of the devil
From out of the forest strides Merlin, dramatic, cape flowing, eyes crazed as ever, laughing at his own entrance
crow is perched on his shoulder, and it squawks loudly
Annoyed with it, Merlin swooshes it away
am Merlin
Counselor to kings
Wizard and beggar
Prophet and
(he drops it) have feasted on thunderbolts, savored my death before  got myself born
-- Merlin interrupts himself when his eyes fall on the boy, who is taking in his performance raptly, half awestruck, half amused
Whose son am
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne
you are King Arthur
The suspicion and confusion and envy of the lords erupts
Merlin, we haven't forgotten you
This is more of your trickery
You're trying to foist a boy of dubious birth upon us
You want to shame us
Lord Leondegrance, join us against the boy
Surely you can see he is only Merlin's tool
No
, Leondegrance, Lord of Camelyarde, saw the drawing of Uther's sword, and witnessed no trickery
If a boy has been chosen, a boy shall be king
The crowd of serfs and peasants cheer wildly, and their long suppressed anger against the nobles comes to the fore
They dare to press up against them, fists hammering on their shields as the chant Arthur King over and over
Dark and scowling, full of rebellion, all the lords except Leondegrance begin to withdraw their iron men surrounding them
,   - Bells toll the good news
People stream by to see the new king and join the celebration
- Uryens and Lot, and Caradoc, Turquine, and the other lords have mounted, and are moving out, when from the rear guard a bowman in Lot's service draws upon the unarmored figure of Arthur across the cheering crowd
The bowman lets the arrow fly
It flies over the heads of the crowd, unseen
Except by Merlin at Arthur's side
He extends his arms halfway up, his fists clenched tightly as if drawing urgently on the power within himself
The sound of wings is heard as he flaps his arms
The arrow flies toward Arthur
Arthur sees the arrow coming right at him, when a swooping crow plucks it out of the air
Arthur watches the crow flapping its wings, climbing swiftly, the arrow in its beak, disappearing over the forest
Only he has noticed
When he turns Merlin is no longer at his side; to the puzzlement of all
And Arthur is all of a sudden terribly alone and afraid, as people from all sides clamor for his attention and guidance
- Arthur charges through the shadowy forest
He is in armor, but it is only a light tunic of mail
Excalibur is sheathed in a leather scabbard by his side
He is frantic and he calls urgently
Merlin
Merlin
His face shines with sweat, the horse is lathered
He dismounts and continues on foot into denser, more tangled undergrowth
Merlin
huge eye opens in the foreground of what had appeared to be shadow, bark and tufts of weeds is really Merlin's head
You called, sir
His voice is thin as he is awakening from a deep, exhausted sleep
Arthur finds him lying within the large gnarled roots of a great tree
The boy kneels before Merlin and lifts his hands and kisses them
You saved me from the arrow
(a flicker of mischief) But not from your destiny
want to thank you
That's not why you came
Arthur blurts it out: Merlin, help me
need your help don't know how-- (irritated) 'Help me, Help me
' Help me get up
Arthur helps Merlin up and the wizard stands unsteadily
'm tired
Doing magic takes its toll, you know
My arms ache terribly
(he makes flying movements with his arms and grimaces) Once--or is it yet to happen-- stood exposed to the Dragon's breath so that a man could lie one night with a woman
It took me ten moons to recover
'm sure that story would interest you, since
Well, we'll have to talk about it another time
You're too busy now
The forest groans and creaks, alive with murmurs and shrill calls
It is whispered in the forest that
(he cups his ear with exaggeration) Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens
(pressing) Yes, yes,  know that
Everybody does
Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights
can't lose him
Well there
You don't need me half as much as you think you do
You already know what must not happen
(exasperated) must find the means to save him, then
was hoping  could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired
Thank you
Silence
Arthur tries again
It's just that  have no experience, and no men to speak of
How can -- (suddenly fierce) Because you must
You and only you
Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur
Just as suddenly, he is his amused, ironic self again
Besides, it will be a good lesson
(giggling) The best, if it's not the last
Arthur bows his head, confused and almost defeated
Merlin steals a look at him, and puts his arm around the boy
Maybe you'd like to meet the power that gave you the sword
He enjoys being cryptic
How
Where
In the great book
What book is that
(melodramatic) The book without pages
Open before you, all around us
You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders
What
- The dragon
There
deep cleft at the edge of the forest, where far below lava boils with a phosphorescence that lights up a great cloud, billowing upward
Coiled in the unfathomed depths, it emerges
Merlin points to the sky where roiling clouds appear to be unfurling of immeasurable wings
It unfolds itself in the storm clouds
terrific wave batters a coastline, spray shooting up, and as the wave recedes it exposes dark rocks and deep crevices
it washes its mane sparkling white in the blackness of seething whirlpools
Merlin spins Arthur around, and they are transported into a storm swept forest
Lightning strikes
its claws are the forks of lightning
its scales glisten in the bark of trees
The trees shine with wetness, as a great wind tosses their crowns, the branches groaning against each other
its voice is heard in the hurricane
Arthur is awestruck
- Arthur and Merlin are back in the same spot, having in fact never moved at all, but traveled on the spell of Merlin's words alone
it is so much more than a scaly monster
It is Everything
Arthur's eyes shine with the brilliance of the vision
And if  am to be King of everything, lord and commoner, beast, leaf and rock,  must use its voice, its claws, its power
,    - Leondegrance, Lord of Camelyarde, is shocked by what he sees in the distance
His daughter Guenevere, a beautiful girl of sixteen, draws close to him, terrified
With his surviving knights, Leondegrance is making his last stand
The walls have been breached, parts of the castle are burning
- bellowing dragon advances
Its eyes burn, its scales gleam from light shining from within
It snorts fire from its nostrils
Uryens and Lot, Caradoc and Turquine, the great knights in command of the siege of Leondegrance's castle, back away speechless as the monster descends upon their unprepared war camp
All around them, squires and lesser knights flee in panic and confusion
Only a dozen or so remain with their leaders
The group backs up against the swampy moat that surrounds the castle, waiting with swords drawn
The dragon moves closer, and now it becomes apparent that it is nothing more than a force of knights and footmen
Their shields glinting in the moonlight are the dragon's scales, torches its burning eyes
And the snorting flames from its nostrils are only Merlin doing a fire-eater's trick
The dragon form dissolves, and a banner rises bearing the emblem of the Dragon, and under it, Arthur and Ector and Kay lead a charge of twenty knights
In Arthur's hands, Excalibur leaves an electric glow upon the air
,   - Father, it's the boy King
It is
will fight my way to his side
- Arthur and his men charge into the enemy ranks
Lot's and Uryens' people are pushed into the moat
Although the water is only waist-deep, the fallen, weighed down by their armor, drown
The horses of the attackers are brought down, Arthur's among them
He pulls out from under it, limping
Bleeding form wounds, cutting, slashing, thrusting, he falls back from the havoc of the charge
small distance exists now between the foes, a brief respite
Uryens and Lot, exhausted, bleeding, and fierce in their rage: War-wise fighters, grown gray in battle, checkmated by a boy
It's Merlin's trickery, nothing more
won't swear faith to that wizard's brat
Arthur and his men have been joined by Leondegrance and his knights, few in number
Let's finish this with a show of force
We have no more tricks and no more advantages
He rushes alone at the enemy, shouting at the top of his lungs, Excalibur flashing over his head, prepared to die
,   - Guenevere watches
No
- No
Arthur-- The old knight rushes after the boy, sword drawn, to defend his flank, and the others follow, a battle cry issuing from them that is terrifying in its fierceness
- and when she can't watch any longer, she buries her face in her hands
- Arthur fights like a wounded lion at the center of the savage melee of sword and shield, and once again the two sides fall apart
Uryens and Lot are standing in the moat among the bodies of their men, are reduced to eleven knights, all wounded
Arthur is flanked by twenty men at arms, most of them wounded, and trembling now beyond exhaustion with blood lust
Arthur steps forward alone, and addresses his opponents
You are in my hands, to slay or spare
need battle lords such as you
Swear faith to me and you shall have mercy
Noble knights swear faith to a mere squire
Arthur turns, searching for Merlin
He spots him watching from a distance
They stare at each other, Merlin implacable, Arthur's eyes pleading
It's obvious that Merlin isn't going to help
You are right
'm not yet a knight
(gaining strength) You, Uryens, will knight me
He unsheathes Excalibur and goes forward, kneeling before Uryens and offering him the sword
Then as knight to knight  can offer you mercy
(to himself) What's this, what's this
Arthur, kneeling, bows his head and Uryens steps up to him, his features set
He accepts the sword
Lot watches, a mad hope dancing in his eyes
,   - Guenevere watches, frightened for Arthur, not daring to breathe
- Uryens stands towering above the boy
He smiles enigmatically
He lifts Excalibur
Merlin is attempting to push through the crowded ranks to get to Arthur
He's frantic and worried for once
never saw this
Uryens swiftly lowers the sword on Arthur's neck; with the flat of the blade he gives Arthur the three strokes
In the name of God, of Saint Michael and Saint George,  give you the right to bear arms, the power to mete justice
Arthur looks up
That duty  will solemnly obey as knight and King
Uryens is deeply moved
Rise, my King
am your humble knight, and  swear allegiance to the courage in your veins, for so strong it is, it's source must be Uther
doubt you no more
Arthur rises and Uryens kneels and kisses his hands
Sir Ector turns away to hide brimming tears
Merlin pushes through finally, out of breath
Uryens embraces Leondegrance while Lot and the other enemy knights kneel in turn and kiss Arthur's hands
- The castle can be glimpsed through the trees
clear spring bubbles from the ground, and the sun splashes leaf, bird, squirrel, and bee with golden light, and Arthur and Guenevere too
Guenevere is serious and intent on her work
Owww
With water from the spring, she is bathing a large cut on his chest that has been stitched closed
Wounds on his arms, and one on a calf also show evidence of her neat sewing
She's just finishing, and she dabs his chest with a dry cloth
It didn't hurt too much, did it
Ye
--'m pretty good at stitchery
've sewn my father's wounds more than once
He starts to get up
Careful
You'll have to stay still for a few days or you'll tear them open
Arthur shivers at the thought
But  have to leave tomorrow
The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued
didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter
Well, then,  shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles
Arthur smiles at her, enjoying her jealousy, and it irritates her a little
No,  think it's better if you just stay here to heal
At least a week
'm going
Quiet, or 'll sew up your mouth too
She touches his lips with hers, her eyelids fluttering shut
He stares at her young beauty, and draws her into a long, slow kiss
shrill almost human squeal pierces the air not far away
Arthur pulls away startled, half-rising
Guenevere giggles
Would you rescue me from a fiery dragon, sir
She puts her arms around him, drawing him close again, speaking in a half-whisper
It's just a furry little rabbit that took the bait and sprung the trap
They smile at each other, about to kiss
As they come closer: You'll find him served up to you tonight, cooked in a most excellent sauce
,   - The soft beat of psaltery and the liquid flow of lute serving platter bearing roast rabbit in rampant position is carried across the hall
It is laid on the long raised table before Arthur, who presides in the middle
He looks at it suspiciously and blushes, remembering the afternoon; and it looks back at him accusingly with its cherry eye
Guenevere is dancing around her father, lovely, gliding, sensual
She sees Arthur and the rabbit and laughs out-right
He twists off a leg of the rabbit and sinks his teeth into it to hide his embarrassment
Guenevere passes to another partner, smiling at him, radiant
Arthur watches her, his heart breaking
He is in love
Merlin leans close
king must marry, after all
of course
Only then does he realize that Merlin has understood everything
He is annoyed at being so transparent
love her
If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered
(mischievous) There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere
If  put my mind to it,  could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles
Offering you their every favor
Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it
shadow of doubt crosses Arthur's brow
Who will it be
Put your mind to it, then
Guenevere
And a beloved friend who will betray you
(smiling) Guenevere
You're not listening
Your heart is not
Love is deaf as well as blind
Guenevere approaches, smiling and coquettish
She slaps her hands, and a servant sets down a tray of pastries before Arthur
They are only for you, for in them mixed things that heal, but not too quickly; and things that make limbs sleepy, preventing escape, but keep one's mind sharp
She smiles at Arthur's embarrassment and confusion
What's in them
She takes a cake and bites into it
It is an ancient mixture, containing only soft, unborn grains, and flavored with roses
The rest is secret
Guenevere offers one to Arthur, and he hesitates, looking at it
Looking at the cake is like looking at the future
Until you have savored its bitterness and its sweetness, its texture and its perfume, what do you really know
And then, of course, it will he too late
Arthur bites into the cake, and Guenevere looks deep into his eyes
Too late
: : "
but for years war kept Arthur from thoughts of marriage
" : - War tents have been pitched beneath the majestic trees
Near the banner of the Dragon a doe grazes
Arthur is older, in battle-scarred plate armor, pacing and angry
He is watched by his wounded and bruised knights--Kay, Uryens, Lot, Leondegrance, Caradoc, and some new young faces among the ranks
No one talks
The harsh clank of its battle trappings announces the arrival of a horse
All eyes watch it walk into the camp
knight is slouched in the saddle
Arthur runs to meet the horse, followed by squires and some of the knights
He eases the rider to the ground, unlaces his helmet
It is Sir Ector, and his hauberk is badly dented
Tears burn in Arthur's eyes
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights will go
He pushes past the knights and goes to his horse
Kay steps in front of him
king must not engage in single contest
'll go again
Arthur rises into the saddle and takes a jousting spear from the rack
Where is Merlin
The squires are silent
Arthur gallops off in the direction Sir Ector came from
His knights are afraid for him
- His countenance grim, Arthur gallops along a trail bordering a plowed field when in it a scarecrow moves
It starts to run as stick-wielding farmers pursue it
It is Merlin
Arthur turns off into the field, and at the sight of an armored knight on a war horse, the farmers turn and flee
Merlin stops to catch his breath
(angry) should have left you to fend for yourself
had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so  could get some honey, and  didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet
Anyway,  was in less danger than you'll be in today
Arthur's hand is clenched tight around Excalibur's hilt
So you were stealing their honey
They should have killed you
Come now
So much anger for such a little crime
Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you
You know full well there is, and go to meet it now
Come witness my revenge
He offers his arm and Merlin hoists himself up behind the King
- waterfall cascades into a pool
The spray casts a rainbow
Beneath it is a colorful confusion of flowers and budding trees, a place dreamlike in its beauty
Arthur, with Merlin behind, gallops along the edge of the pool
The trail widens into a field of grass
Arthur reins beside a pile of broken lances and twisted shields
Across the field, pitched upon the trail is a war tent made of diaphanous white silk, a sky blue banner above it
Merlin slides off and Arthur continues
From the tent, a knight with jousting lance rides forward to meet him
His armor is so shiny it is a mirror
His eyes, seen through the open visor, seem to laugh
His speech is foreign, from across the sea
He is Lancelot of the Lake
Good day to you, sir
Move aside
This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own
await the King himself
His knights are in need of training
am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time
Who are you, and why do you block the way
am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea
am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service
--That is a wild boast
You lack a knight's humility
Not a boast, sir, but a curse
(a cloud passes over his innocent face) Never have  met my match in joust or duel
Move aside
will not
You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God
He crosses himself
Then may He give me the strength to unhorse you and send you with one blow back across the sea
Arthur wheels away, trembling with anger, and gallops to his edge of the field
He sees that Lancelot has already positioned himself and is waiting, lance down
Merlin watches, a spectator, as the two charge at each other
They collide with great force, their spears shattering
Arthur is jolted but stays in the saddle
Lancelot's jousting is impeccable
Arthur draws Excalibur
Hold
offer you another lance
Pages come forward with new lances for Arthur and Lancelot
You joust well, sir
Battle learnt, but tournament fancy
You should ride more forward in the saddle, though
Arthur grabs the spear from the page's hands, and circles back to work the horse up into an all-out gallop
Lancelot spurs forward to meet him
Arthur is neatly unhorsed
He picks himself up from the ground in a rage, drawing Excalibur
Lancelot on his horse weaves circles around him
Yield
have the advantage
will not
Arthur charges Lancelot, a raging bull, but cuts and slashes only at the air as Lancelot stays clear of him
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me
Your avoidance mocks me
sought only not to harm you, sir
He dismounts and draws his sword, and they clash
Shield and sword and armor against shield and sword and armor
The swordplay is furious, Arthur attacking, slashing, hacking, Lancelot parrying effortlessly, elegantly defensive
Arthur breaks the onslaught to catch his breath
Lancelot lifts his visor
His eyes are calm, laughing
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you
It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around
So be it, to the death
It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must
Arthur goes forward attacking with terrible blows upon Lancelot's shield, and Lancelot holds his ground, shield high
And in its mirror-like metal Arthur can see his own reflection, a face distorted by uncontrolled passion
Arthur discards his own shield, grabs Excalibur with both hands, and with a frightening shout that speaks of all his rage, he swings a terrific blow upon the shield, cutting through his own reflection and the metal
And Excalibur snaps in two
blinding blue-green light explodes from the broken sword
Lancelot, knocked back by the force of the blow, is stunned by the blast and falls to the ground unconscious
Arthur backs away, horrified, half of Excalibur in his hand
What horror is this
(calling) Merlin
Merlin approaches, pale, gripped by dread
The sword is broken
Hope is broken
Arthur picks up the broken blade, utterly undone
My pride broke it, my rage broke it
Humiliation and defeat lie in ambush even for a king
(looking at Lancelot) This excellent knight who fought with fairness and grace was meant to win
With Excalibur,  tried to change that verdict
Merlin stands there, drawn, defeated, his hopes dead
have lost for all time the ancient sword of my fathers whose power was meant to unite all men, to serve the vanity of a single man
Despairing, he flings the two parts of Excalibur into the pool
He kneels at the waters edge, and he cries
am nothing
Then Arthur sees something that startles him
Beneath the surface, suspended in the blue-green water amid the dancing weeds, he sees Excalibur, intact
It is held by a maiden in flowing gown the color of water, her long hair rippling across her face, obscuring it
Excalibur
Is it true
The Lady of the Lake
Take it
Take it, quickly
Arthur dips his hand under the water and grasps the hilt and the moment he does the vision in the blue-green water fades
He rises with Excalibur in hand, and Merlin speaks before Arthur can ask the question
There are infinite worlds within the infinite coils of the Dragon
In one of them, which  have not traveled, the sword was forged
only know that the King is returned to us through the instrument of his power
The game continues
And he laughs
Just then Lancelot stirs
Arthur rushes to his side
He loosens his helmet and removes it, uncovering damp curls
The young knight's eyes open, and his laughing charm once more animates his face
Thanks to God, you are alive
(sitting up) , the best knight in the world, bested
This is a great day, for my search is over
love you, my King
He embraces Arthur, who is overwhelmed by his childlike directness
The King helps him to his feet
You are still the best knight in Christiandom
You gained a hundred advantages over me
It is  who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson
Then make me your champion and will always fight in your place
But your life and lands are far from here
gave up my castles and my lands
He thumps his breastplate
My domain is here, inside this metal skin
And  would pledge to you all that  still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it
And a great heart it is
Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion
Lancelot draws his sword, holding it by the blade, a crucifix
In the name of Jesus Christ and His holy blood,  swear eternal faith to Arthur, King
They embrace, and Merlin watches
'   - Converging from different directions parties of mounted knights enter the war camp
Lancelot among them
They dismount, battle-weary and burning with the excitement of victory
They quench their huge thirst from buckets carried by squires
They rip off hunks of meat from carcasses sizzling on spits over a roaring fire
And they join the throng of knights, where stories of deeds of arms of the day are enthusiastically exchanged
great number of knights are packed tightly around King Arthur, each man anxious to tell of his victories
One of them has the King's attention
We killed every one of them
Burnt their ship
Arthur sees Lancelot in the throng and moves toward him
Merlin follows Arthur and is pushed and knocked around in the crush of spikes and iron
The only unarmored man in the crowd, he glares at the excited knights irritably
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights
Arthur turns toward Uryens
And you, Uryens
Victory
Lot, and you
We drove the invaders into the sea
You, Gawain, the East
The East is ours again
Cheers greet each declaration
The war is over
One land, one King
Peace
Amidst the celebration, a fracas is heard
knight pushing forward to talk to Arthur has entered a shoving match with those in front of him
Let me through
fought the King's battle too
He must know my story
Merlin is brutally jostled
He draws a fistful of powder from his cape and he tosses it into the air above him
He raises his staff into the cloud, cracking it like a whip
The tip of the staff catches fire, and the fire spreads through the powder in the air, stunning all into silence
Merlin shouts and snarls
Chaos
confusion
brutes
savages
troglodytes
Stand back
make space
Merlin swings his burning staff into a wide arc
The knights back away, amused at first, then a bit afraid
The moon
the sun
the stars
they spin
they turn
they circle
around us
us
The knights have fallen back
Merlin stalks past each man, and Arthur too, holding the flaming tip of his staff before each pair of eyes, and staring into them with his gimlet gaze
You, and you, and you, take up your place
Be wedded to the world
Respect its perfection
All of you, together, be one
The knights have formed a circle
They realize this
Awestruck, they whisper in astonishment, looking up at the sky burning with stars
Merlin brims with pride as he waits for Arthur to recognize his handiwork
Your ancient wisdom and infinite sight have forged this circle, Merlin
Hereafter we shall come together in a circle, to tell and hear of deeds good and brave
will build a table where this fellowship shall meet
And a hall around the table
And a castle about the hall
cheer rises
Arthur strides into the ring of knights
And  will marry
Another bout of cheers goes up, and Arthur stops before Leondegrance, resting his hand on the old knight's shoulder
And the land will have an heir to wield Excalibur
Leondegrance's eyes fill with tears of joy
roar of cheers
Arthur draws the sword of power
Knights of the Round Table, good friends, brothers in arms
send you on a quest harder by far than the battles we have fought together, a quest to uphold always, and everywhere, justice, honor, and truth
Each day shall bring forth a cause, and may each cause bring forth a knight
Lancelot is drawn in by the King's enthusiasm
He unsheathes his sword and swoops it low in salute
swear never to rest twice on the same pillow till all men live at peace
In quick succession all knights draw their swords, following Lancelot's example
Merlin struggles to put out the flame on his staff
He finally does it by smothering it with earth
When he looks up again, he sees the knights galloping off in all directions
- Terrified women, a screaming child, cowering men, old or made old by the hard labor of the fields
Armored men are ransacking a farm, looking for grain, and gold which they find among the votive objects of a little house altar woman is dragged away to be raped
Through a window, a knight in shining armor is seen emerging from the adjoining woods
The plunderers are all of a sudden apprehensive, and fall silent
One of them grabs the crying child and covers her mouth with his iron hand
- The knight is Lancelot, in his mirror-like armor
He rides into the cluster of houses and barns that make up the farm
There are other armored men there, around a cart half-loaded with loot
They smile nervously at Lancelot
The farmers are blank with fear
Lancelot stops in the middle of the yard
knight among the armored men comes forward
Good day, sir
Good day to you
And he also acknowledges with a nod the ashen-faced patriarch of the community
Lancelot spurs his horse on, and the knight sighs with relief
But then he reins his horse to a stop
He has sensed something
He turns his head, his hooded eyes on the knight and his men, and they squirm inwardly
- The child, her mouth covered by the armored hand
- Lancelot, listening, watching
- The woman, a blade flashing next to her eye
- Lancelot, immobile
Behind him, the knight, his face shiny with sweat
His minions inch forward, hands moving slowly toward sword hilts
Lancelot wheels his horse around
hear the stifled cry for help, smell the reek of fear
With a shout the knight and his men draw their swords and rush Lancelot
He reins in his horse, causing it to rear and break their attack
He slides off, falling on his feet with sword drawn, already fighting
In an extraordinary show of sword play he cuts down six men
- Hearing Lancelot storm in, the man holding the child hands her to a woman and kneels before the altar, just as Lancelot bursts into the room, sword high and already swooping down on the man's neck
Lancelot brings the sword to a halt mid- air, his fury held in check
The repent man is spared
The woman kneels to kiss Lancelot's hand
- The field is pitched with war tents and pavilions decked for holiday
Nobles and knights flank the King and Guenevere, a beautiful vision in white samite, a wreath of flowers around her head
Lancelot leads a long file of prisoners to the King
They fall to their knees, begging forgiveness; among them is the man whom Lancelot had spared before the altar
These men repented before God for their evil deeds
Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword
(he kneels) Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift
do
Rise, Lancelot, come with me
He rises and follows Arthur and Guenevere into the central pavilion
Pages draw its curtains closed as they pass inside
- Guenevere is surrounded by a group of ladies and maids who fuss over her dress and her hair
They eye the great knight and whisper about him, Guenevere laughing with them
Arthur sits, excited and happy
Sit beside me, Lancelot
Lancelot sits, stiff and upright
Your deeds set an example for all other knights
For your gift, ask a gift of me
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what  am most able to do, and happiest doing
Guenevere overhears
She approaches and Lancelot jumps to his feet
(to Arthur) He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself
(to Lancelot, smiling) grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers
will stay Madame
Merlin leans close to Arthur
The knights of Galys approach the camp
It would be politic
to ride out and meet them
He rises
Lancelot, who was about to sit again, straightens
will ride with Sir Kay
Lancelot, rest here
Don't start a war on my wedding day
Without Lancelot
Arthur and Merlin exit, leaving Guenevere and Lancelot
She looks at him, lively and amused, and he can't help smiling
Look Lancelot
The maids and ladies whisper about you
They all dream of winning you, young and old, fair and ugly
Lancelot blushes
But surely that's no secret to you, dear Lancelot
You're the bravest and strongest knight they've ever seen, and beauty has kissed your brow
He can't look at her
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart
No
Why
am a fighting man and  am married to the quest
That is enough
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you
There is one
Who
You
Me
Yes
would swear my love to you
To me
But why
cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend
And, in pledging my love to you,  cannot love any other woman
Guenevere smiles, moved by his blunt innocence
will see you in all women, and will defend them as  would defend you
He kneels, kisses her thigh, rises and leaves
- chorus of children sings
The Bishop waits at the altar with his friars and altar boys
Cornucopias overflowing with vegetables and wildflowers adorn the church, which glows with the light of a thousand candles
Sir Kay is satisfied
He comes back up the petal-strewn aisle
,        - Arthur and Guenevere are ushered in by Kay
They are flanked by Leondegrance and Sir Ector
Lancelot and Merlin follow, leading the cortege of knights and ladies
Merlin is incapable of entering the chapel, as if at the threshold there is an unseen force that repels him
Lord Merlin, are you ill
No, no,  need air
Strangling a laugh he wrenches himself away
Just then Uryens and a small party of knights rides up through the tents and dismounts in front of the church
Uryens helps a lady off her horse and joins the cortege on foot
Merlin, don't you join the celebration
Merlin, who was slinking away through the throng of bystanders, looks up
What he sees sends a chill through his body
At Uryens' side stands a young woman of sinister beauty, with bewitching eyes of ice
Merlin just stares at her, and she smiles back at him faintly
My wife, Merlin
Lady Morgana of Cornwall
remember you, Merlin
was a child
You took my brother away
Merlin laughs
Uryens shrugs and continues into the chapel with Morgana
As she enters she glances back, and just then Merlin steals a look, their eyes meet
- Uryens and Morgana take their places near the altar
Arthur and Guenevere kneel before the Bishop, and Arthur takes her hand
The clatter of armor mingles with the enthusiastic, happy singing of the children, and seems to strengthen their song
- The chorus carries across the field to the dark wall of trees from which issues another chorus, of hoots and squawks and howls
Merlin advances along the edge of the forest
He stops by the stone that once held the sword, his eyes wild
He forgets his inner torment when he sees a plant at the base of the stone
He kneels beside it and plucks it
He admires its strange flowers; he smells them
Two feet appear at his side
He rises to be face to face with Morgana
They look deep into each other
Then Merlin breaks the silence
You left your husband's side
You left your brother's wedding
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin
It is
Can it truly be used for magic
Merlin smiles at last, and Morgana does, her eyes piercing, cruel and lovely
Yes
sometimes
His gaze drifts toward the chapel
There are many powers in this world
- Arthur and Guenevere are radiant with joy, and Lancelot behind them mirrors the ceremony of their joining in his armor; and the sweet voices of the children fill the chapel as the Bishop pours the wine into the chalice, and lifts it up before him, blessing it
He turns to the royal couple
Drink this the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord
The chalice seems to burn with a mystical light; and as the chorus soars: : : "And Arthur built his castle, Camelot
And one day, in the far reaches of the Kingdom
" : ,  - It is shadowy and dark; ancient trees creak, unseen animals cry out
rabbit hops into view and a boy leaps forward, grabbing the animal by the ears before it can move
He-- Perceval--is a wild boy of seventeen, dressed in skins with an endearing and childlike smile
(to the rabbit) Sorry
Hungry
din is heard to the forest, and it grows
Perceval glances around, panicked
The sound is the rubbing of leather upon leather, of metal on metal, for now a mounted figure in armor hovers over the terrified boy
(stuttering) Have  taken too much
He lets the rabbit go free
The threatening figure dismounts
And Perceval, cartwheels backward, landing in the stream and scooping a fish out
(desperately trying to ingratiate) had rabbit yesterday
Today 'll eat fish
No
He returns the fish to the water
The figure steps into a pool of sunlight and a glorious halo streaks from the armor
It is Lancelot
Don't be afraid
Perceval is overcome with astonishment, and he kneels
You're an angel
Not a devil
Lancelot laughs and pulls the boy to his feet
Just a man
knight in the King's service
You're a man
(he reaches out to touch Lancelot) with metal skin
Perceval is beside himself with enthusiasm
Can  grow metal skin
Lancelot rolls his eyes, amused
You've got a lot to learn
- Lancelot is cantering and Perceval is running alongside, shouting in gasps
'll learn
take me
to the King
What's a
King
Lancelot shakes his head and spurs the horse into a gallop
Perceval lengthens his stride, and keeps up
Lancelot reins to a halt
Very well
Climb up
will run
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here
Twenty days
The world is that big
,  - Perceval cannot believe his eyes
As Lancelot and Kay talk about him out of earshot, he sees things that he's never seen before; and he gapes like the country bumpkin that he is
Dragon-like kites sweep low, maneuvered by children
In a meadow among the trees, knights hone their skills with lance and sword, and ladies watch and their "bright eyes rain influence and judge the prize
" And then, there is Camelot itself; the great gate and the drawbridge; the massive walls, and the soaring towers and spires above
Perceval rushes up to Lancelot and Kay
Who will give me my sword
Kay is not at all pleased; nonetheless he takes the boy by the ear and leads him across the drawbridge and into the castle
Kitchen knives and greasy spits will be your weapons, boy
Lancelot smiles to himself, hesitation, lingering before the great gate of Camelot
There is a walkway suspended in the trees above, that also leads to the castle, and promenading on it is a group of women, Guenevere and her ladies-in-waiting
The Queen sees Lancelot and hastens toward him
Lancelot sees her, and mounts his horse and heads back into the forest
She stops, somewhat ahead of the ladies, and watches wistfully
Lancelot turns back and seeing her one last time, draws down his visor and spurs his horse into a canter
He passes two commoners who are heading for the castle, one fat and the other thin, and they are locked in hot dispute
Their wives keep them from coming to blows and their children spur them on, enjoying the excitement
Lancelot is swallowed by the forest
,  - Guenevere, bearing a bowl of perfect, deep red apples, approaches the Round Table, where Arthur sits and Merlin at his side, attending to the affairs of the kingdom
Quite a few of the knights occupy their seats, talking with each other, drinking and laughing, attended by ladies and pages
Guenevere places the apples at Lancelot's empty place and takes her seat next to Arthur
In the archways that lead into the hall, petitioners wait, eating, drinking, talking among themselves
In the din, no one pays attention to the vehement arguing of the fat man and the thin man, which continues even here
The hall is the burgeoning, happy center of the kingdom
But Merlin is oblivious to the lively clamor
He gazes like a lovesick puppy across the table at Morgana, who bends over whispering to a knight at the table, the young Sir Gahalt,, while his older brother Sir Gawain listens
Morgana notices Merlin's stare and smiles at him, and then resumes her flirtation with Sir Gahalt, much to Merlin's annoyance
Sir Kay ushers the thin man and the fat man into the open space at the center of the table for their audience with the king
They quarrel even as Kay tries to present them, and the attention of the hall gradually focuses on them
The two men talk at once, interrupting, overlapping
brew ale, sir--from old shoes-- am an honest tradesman sir
must sell what produce
He won't buy ale and he won't pay
Pay up
He leans over the barrel and sucks in the vapors
The vapors are mine
How would you know , sir, have the misfortune to live next to this criminal
What loss in that
Not to me
Pay for what
Why
They are floating on the wind
Arthur is both amused and exasperated
Enough
What is a fair price for the smell of your ale
That's why we have come to you, sir There's no one else who can tell us
What does it cost to get drunk on your ale
At least three shillings, sir
Arthur addresses the Thin Man
Give me three shillings
The Thin Man is crestfallen, the smile gone from his face
He reluctantly hands the coins to Kay, who gives them to Arthur
Arthur tosses them in the air and lets them fall on a metal plate
He hands them back to the Thin Man, who is totally confused now, as is everybody else
For the smell of your ale, the jingle of his coins
The knights roar with laughter and the Fat Man and the Thin Man look at each other in astonishment
Perceval lets out a raucous laugh that wins him a glance of disapproval from Kay
- The din of the petitioners is replaced by music
It is the hour of the evening feast, and all knights are present, except Lancelot
Whole tree trunks burn in the great fireplace, and lambs roast on spits in the flames
Pages run to and fro with trays of food and wine, Perceval among them
Morgana stops beside Merlin
What did  see today in the wizard's eyes
Censure, because  enjoy a few words with a young handsome knight
Merlin is in agony, a bug stuck on a pin
No, no, of course not
You are young
'm not jealous
It's clear you are, and it irks me
No
Yes,  am
am jealous
want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name
lovestruck page
Shh
yes, yes
Sit with me, please
Morgana
She does, laughing and in complete control
His hand immediately slides onto her thigh
She removes it, but holds it in her hand, toying with his fingers
steamy, panting, lovestruck page
But what good are songs and poems to me
They are the barter of ordinary love
gift that reflected your greatness is the only one worthy of your love
Merlin looks at her, knowing already, sad yet eager
showed you all my conjuring tricks
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas
Maybe
maybe
Merlin's thoughts have carried him far away, when he realizes that Arthur is addressing him
Merlin, are you counselor to the King, or to my sister
Some knights laugh
At your service, sir
Then answer me this
For years peace has reigned in the land
Crops grow in abundance, there is no want
Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day
Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems
Good and evil; there is never one without the other
Arthur is taken aback
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom
Never where you expect it, that's all  know
He chuckles softly and Arthur is puzzled
knight speaks out, the young knight with whom Morgana was flirting
His manner is sarcastic
If we have peace and justice, why is Lancelot never with us
Why is he always riding out on his quests
He must know where this evil is
Could there be evil within Lancelot himself
To live above human folly, as is his aim, is to be overly proud
He pays no heed even to the Queens longing for his company
The hall falls silent, all eyes upon the Queen
(lashing out) What is it you would have your words mean, Sir Gahalt
Frightened, Gahalt doesn't answer
Morgana has slipped to Guenevere's side
Don't listen to him
You are the Queen
Arthur, ashen-faced, turns to Merlin for help, but he has escaped into sleep
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen
No
meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt
In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil
You merely repeat it
Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness
Morgana picks the bowl up and as she does so, unseen by any and with a magician's dexterity, she thrusts her fingernails deep into the top apple
She gives the bowl to Guenevere, who takes it and sweeps around to where Sir Gahalt sits, followed by Morgana
The young knight jumps to his feet
Take one, Sir Gahalt
am most honored, my lady
He is too shy to take the shiniest, most beautiful apple on top, and goes for another one
Morgana giggles, and he looks at her
She looks at the apple on top and then smiles encouragingly at him
Sir Gahalt takes it and starts eating as the Queen returns to her seat
With the third bite his is unable to breathe
His face goes red and he rises to his feet, attempting to call out
He falls, dying immediately
All leap to their feet, and Arthur rushes to the young knight
Merlin is asleep and far from human affairs
Arthur and Sir Gawain rise from the body of the young knight
Sir Gawain backs away from Arthur and points at Guenevere, trembling with cold rage
Hear me, Lord Arthur, and knights and chieftains:  charge Guenevere with the murder of my brother
Guenevere, white and with a broken voice, turns to Arthur
didn't
am innocent
She begins to swoon and Morgana keeps her steady on her feet
Arthur slumps into his seat and Sir Gawain kneels before him
champion this truth: That Queen Guenevere murdered Sir Gahalt with the aid of sorcery
Enraged, Arthur reaches for Excalibur
But with effort he checks his impulse
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf
Not you, my husband
Arthur cannot look at her
She must be burnt at the stake
That is the sentence for murder done with magic
It is
Lords and knights of the Round Table, as her husband  say that this deed was not done by Guenevere
Who among you will champion this truth
No one responds
Guenevere falls into her seat
Arthur searches the eyes of his knights and they evade him
Sir Caradoc
You
The knight looks up
am torn
Sir Ector, old and feeble, weeps for Arthur
Someone speaks up
It is Perceval, who kneels before the Queen
His voice is unnaturally loud, and his eyes shine with held-back tears; he stutters
will champion you, my lady
He is overwhelmed by his own boldness
He looks around
All eyes are upon him
Guenevere smiles at him, sadly
thank you, but you are not yet a knight
will find Lancelot
He will come
Perceval hurries from the hall
Arthur looks away, ashamed, and his eyes fall on Merlin, twitching and mumbling in his sleep
Boys
boys will be boys
-  - In full armor but for his helmet, Lancelot is seated at a small table in the shadow of a tree, eating an apple
young girl is turning a chicken on a spit, and her mother is removing freshly-baked bread from an oven
It is very peaceful and silent until, galloping all out, Perceval arrives
Frantic, out of breath, he leaps from his lathered horse
have found you
The Queen
An apple
Tomorrow
Sir Gawain
--It must wait, child
These good ladies, for whom  intervened once, will honor me with a meal
am beholden to them now as  was when they begged my protection
The two women set the chicken and the bread before the great knight, and stand back to watch him eat, flushed with excitement
Perceval falls silent, in awe of Lancelot
,  - Arthur stands hunched over the fireplace, staring into the flames
Guenevere paces back and forth to a window
Why can't you be my champion
If  am your judge,  cannot be your champion
When  act as your King, cannot be your husband
And you cannot love me
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all
Lancelot will come
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them
Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy
He hides his anguish from her
Numb with hurt, she goes to a tall curtained window, and draws it open, and stands there looking out upon the surrounding forest, silent and still beneath the moon
- She cries softly, and she whispers the name of the great knight
,    -
mounted knight stands motionless at the edge of the forest, his armor gleaming with dark lustre
It is Lancelot
His eyes are raised to the high window, where he sees Guenevere
He watches her in silence
In the high window Guenevere draws the curtain and Lancelot reins back into the forest
- Lancelot has unsaddled and tethered his horse in a small clearing
He sits, resting back against a tree
He removes his helmet; he plants his sword before him, like a cross
He loosens the ties of his breastplate
He waits for day, yawning, tired
But his eyes burn, and he closes them and nods off to sleep
knight appears silently hovering over him
Lancelot looks up, and his eyes go wide with fear
The knight towering above him wears armor identical to his, and he raises his sword, and the blade is descending upon Lancelot
Lancelot draws his sword from the ground and rolls away, but the knight's sword slices through his shoulder joint
Lancelot attempts to rise but already the knight, Lancelot's mirror image, is upon him
From the ground, Lancelot parries the blow and slashes at the opponent's knee, cutting through the joint in the armor and severing the leg
The knight doesn't fall, doesn't bleed, doesn't cry out
On one leg he comes forward, a horror
Lancelot is paralyzed by fear
As the knight leaps upon Lancelot, Lancelot rises to meet him, impaling himself on the knight's sword below the hauberk
He throws the knight to the ground, and comes down upon him
He rips off the helmet and the breastplate
The armor is empty and Lancelot rolls over on his back, awakening from the nightmare with his own sword deep in his stomach, and in his hand his own helmet and breastplate, while other parts of his armor lie strewn around him
Only then does he become conscious of the terrible pain and the shock of the truth
He grabs the hilt of his sword and draws it from his stomach
He curls up in agony, clutching a fistful of leaves to the wound
Guenevere,  fight against myself
He loses consciousness
- The Bishop blesses the field
Guenevere, numb and disbelieving, is being led to the stake, which rises from a bed of straw and wood
Arthur watches, in shock
Other knights and ladies keep their distance, watching darkly, stealing glances at Arthur, mumbling disapproval of his refusing to defend Guenevere
In battle dress, Sir Gawain rides up and down the jousting run on a snorting and powerful horse, practicing
Perceval, in a mail doublet, waits beside a mangy roan, his face burning with anxiety
Guenevere is tied to the stake
All eyes watch for the approach of her champion
Arthur goes to Perceval
Is he coming
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing
That is all
Arthur hides his pain behind a rigid mask
- The sun has risen shining cruelly into Guenevere's eyes; the queen is alone at the stake
Sir Gawain rides up to King Arthur, who waits alone, separated from the others
My Lord, the sun is upon the field
The Queen has no champion
demand justice, as is my right
So it is
Perceval leaps onto his horse
Let me champion the Queen
Sir Gawain looks at the squire with contempt
(to Arthur) Since no knight comes forward, demand justice-- Arthur is in anguish
He searches the tree line for a sign of Lancelot
He looks from Guenevere at the stake to his own knights watching him
He draws Excalibur
gasp goes through the crowd of onlookers
Boy, kneel
Perceval leaps from his horse and bends his knee before the King
Arthur brings the sword down on the boy's shoulder, giving him the three strokes
In the name of God, of St
Michael, and St
George,  make you a knight
Rise, Sir
Perceval
Gawain shakes his head disdainfully as Perceval mounts back into the saddle, his eyes burning with fervor
Sir Gawain and Perceval ride to opposite ends of the field
The spectators fall silent, all staring blankly, their senses dulled by the tragedy, at the uneven combatants
cry goes up
Lancelot rides out of the forest
He rides up to the King and salutes him
Arthur smiles at his old friend, tears of joy in his eyes
Lancelot bows toward Guenevere and rides on to where Perceval waits
Lancelot reaches out to touch Perceval's cheek
It's my task to prove the Queen's innocence
Perceval cannot reply, his eyes affixed on the blood that trickles from Lancelot's hauberk
Lancelot raises his lance in salute to Gawain across the field
Gawain salutes in answer
The two huge knights charge at each other, each man's spear tip making contact with the other's armor, and in the violent collision both are unhorsed
Lancelot is slower at getting to his feet and drawing his sword
He is bleeding below the hauberk from his self-inflicted wound
In the first onslaught Lancelot fights defensively, falling back
He has to toss aside his shield and hold his stomach with his shield hand
Morgana watches with Merlin
Every terrible blow of sword on sword reverberates through her body pleasurable
Merlin is captivated by her cruel sensuality
- They swing and thrust at each other with slower but bone- crushing force, both unsteady now
Blood seeps from Lancelot's feet, leaving awful footprints on the earth
Finally, with a daring thrust, Lancelot lifts Gawain's visor and the sword tip is before his eyes
Gawain drops his sword and shield, kneels and speaks in a voice hoarse with weariness
The Queen is innocent
yield to your mercy, Sir Lancelot
Lancelot collapses in a dead faint
,  - Eyes closed, Lancelot lies on a bed, naked but for a cloth across his loins
His minor wounds have been dressed, and Merlin is kneading the huge gash in his stomach, working the severed flesh together
Guenevere stands on one side of the bed, Arthur on the other, both looking down upon Lancelot, relieved and not daring to look at each other
Flesh on flesh
You must press on the wound, Guenevere, hold it, and it will begin to bind
Guenevere kneels, and at her touch Lancelot's eyes flicker open
Merlin exits, and draws Arthur away with him
Arthur is deeply tormented
Merlin, tell me
Now that Guenevere is returned to me
What is it my child
Merlin appears moved by the predicaments that Arthur has to face
Will  have a son
Merlin stares off into the evening sky, where a lark sings high up
Yes
Just yes
No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes
That frightens me
king should be afraid, always
The enemy is everywhere
Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here
He taps his skull and smiles
- Lancelot is staring into Guenevere's eyes
She opens her shift, baring a breast with the innocence of a mother preparing to suckle a child
She presses her breast to his wound, her face to his chest, her arms enfolding him
She whispers
Flesh on flesh
will heal you
His body trembles and his eyes brim with tears
He is lost
,  - The court is assembled, for the evening feast
There is music and heavy drinking
Some knights are slouched across the table
Lancelot, still weak, takes his seat, looking at the drunken and frivolous knights
Arthur catches it, and they smile at each other
They miss the battlefield
think we do too
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law
Guenevere cannot tear her eyes from Lancelot
He avoids her look
Arthur looks from Guenevere to Lancelot, and speaks softly to him, across her, and with stabbing directness
It is not easy for the young ones to learn knightly virtues without the hard teaching of war and quest
It is only your example, Lancelot, that binds them now
Then, addressing the hall: Which is the greatest quality of knighthood
Courage
Compassion
Loyalty
Humility
What do you say, Merlin
He is bent close to Morgana, whispering
Only when the hall rings with laughter does he look up
What
(then seeing he has an audience) The greatest
They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword
didn't ask for poetry
Which is it
Merlin looks from Arthur to Guenevere to Lancelot to Arthur
All right
Truth
It must be truth, above all
When a man lies he murders some part of the world
An uneasy silence falls upon the feast
Guenevere and Lancelot cannot look at each other, and Arthur feels it
Lancelot jumps to his feet
Conversation and court life don't suit me
must take my rest in the forest
Guenevere stifles her dismay
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound
It is deep
Arthur is about to rise to embrace him, but checks himself
You will be sorely missed
Heal yourself and come back
The exchange has become closely intimate, even though they stand apart and speak before everyone in the large hall
Lancelot leaves
Only Guenevere cannot watch
- Water gurgles from a rock that is captive in the roots of an ancient oak
Lancelot, in armor, reclines against its trunk, the roots cradling him
He is perfectly still, drawing life from the vibrant, all-enfolding forest
Flower petals drift on the breeze
Trees sigh
Fox and rabbit, sparrow and hawk, at peace with each other, watch over the knight
- horse and rider tear through the thick undergrowth
It is Guenevere
The forest races past her as she gallops toward the glade, brambles tearing at her flesh and clothes
- Lancelot gets to his feet, tense
Guenevere dismounts and approaches
She is flushed and breathless from the wild race
Her horse, left free, wanders over to his and grazes beside it
Why
You will destroy Arthur, and us
She moves closer and he thrusts out his mailed fist to keep her away
She clutches it and presses the metal to her soft tear-streaked cheek
The law forbids it
Love demands it
Hungry with passion, she embraces the cold unmoving armor, kissing it
There are things about love-- --Nothing
He steps back, drawing his sword
He holds it up by the blade between them
By my knight's sword,  swore faith-- And before he can finish she grabs the blade to push it aside
He holds it fast
Blood streams from her bare hands
He cannot prevail without cutting them deeply
He lets go of the sword, and she lets it fall to the ground
She embraces his still and defeated hulk
She kisses the metal, and sensation shoots through him, dizzying him
Guenevere
He folds her in his arm, and their bodies lock together as though a trap had sprung
Their mouths meet, each devouring the other
,  - Arthur and Merlin, the King desperate, the Wizard overwhelmed by compassion: am alone and betrayed
By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights
And by you
Perhaps most of all by you
For you made me, you forged this wretched life
And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister
That is my destiny
have a destiny, too
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at
My powers fade, Arthur
resort to cheap tricks
(with sudden enthusiasm) Yes
enjoy every moment of my foolishness,  join in the making of it, so no one can betray me
But you
You betray yourself
Me
have lived by the oath of king and knight
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon
the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king
Arthur looks up and in the rolling clouds maybe, just maybe, the form of a dragon is taking shape
Arthur draws Excalibur, intensity animating his dead features
must do it myself
must kill them both
Lancelot and Guenevere
Will you ride with me, Merlin
cannot
must not
Here  must stay
They embrace
Merlin is on the verge of tears, his face immediately sad and finally ancient
Arthur exits
Morgana, who has been watching from the shadows, watching from the shadows, slinks up to Merlin's side
Crazy old fool
You think yourself a kingmaker
Ha
meddler, more likely
Look what a mess you've made of things
Merlin smiles knowingly at her
Perhaps, perhaps
'm losing interest, Morgana
have helped men--or meddled in their affairs, if you would have it that way--since the dawn of time
Now let them live by their own laws
Let them stand on their own feet
The gods of once are gone forever, it is time for men
Morgana, make a man out of me
Kiss me
He reaches to touch her lips
She cradles his hand in hers and doesn't allow Merlin to kiss her
She kisses his knuckles and stares into his eyes, stoking his desire
You know what  want
want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world
That  cannot
She breaks away, provocative, alluring
Then  will not
- Arthur and Sir Kay gallop through the forest, silently
It is not a dream
Their armor and the hooves of their horses are muffled with pieces of cloth
- Only Nature will ever see their love; the creatures of the air, tree and ground witness the final reality of their passion and sense its unfathomable depths, singing of it in a hundred languages
Lancelot and Guenevere are naked and interlocked, one being, suspended in the darkness in the eye of the forest
- Arthur walks soundlessly through the trees, approaching the glade
The forest falls suddenly silent
- All passion spent, locked in each other's arms, Lancelot and Guenevere drift off into sleep
Arthur comes upon them
He stands over them
He draws Excalibur
Checking all emotion, he holds it above his head
The ancient steel glows darkly
The lovers faces are serene and innocently beautiful
He hesitates, tormented
His mask of anguish gives way to determination and calm
He strikes the sword home, letting go of it
He backs away, turns and disappears into the forest
- The sky is red; so is the steel of Excalibur
Lancelot awakens and starts at what he sees
His cry stirs Guenevere
They are horrified to see Excalibur impaled in the ground between their entwined bodies
It has pierced their union without grazing their flesh
They leap up and back away, unable to speak at first
Why didn't he kill us
He has given up
She kneels before the sword, embracing the hilt to her breast
The King without his sword, the land without a king
We are to blame
Lancelot stumbles into the forest, berserk with guilt
He rages against a small tree, crying out, and he rips its roots from the ground, the terrible tearing and renting the symbol of his own inner torment
Guenevere sinks to the ground next to Lancelot's empty armor and his abandoned sword
Merlin and Morgana descend winding steps cut out of rock
The only light comes from the glow of Merlin's staff
When Arthur built the castle,  carved out a place for myself, where  could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me
People make you laugh
He laughs
They do
Why
He leans close to her ear, whispering into it
They don't know how close they live to the edge of delight or disas
He is about to kiss her when he slips
He laughs
Happiness or horror
They pass through jaws of stalactites and stalagmites
Merlin cracks his staff whip-like and a ball of fire billows up from the tip and illuminates a cave wildly veined and filigreed with minerals and crusted with growths of crystals
The light goes out but the malachite and the gold, the quartz, diamond and beryllium burn dully
He turns to her, suddenly tall and unstooped, younger, sleek and evil
In the folds of the earth where the forces that hold the world together are more alive, my power is strongest
Here  will possess you, as a man possesses a woman
And the god, the eunuch, the mule that  was, will be no more
He sweeps her up into his arms
You are truly magnificent
Flattery
Do you think  am ignorant of your stupid little games
Preying on you weakness of others
That's your power, a petty evil
Mine is great
Great plans
Impossible dreams
Laughable endings
He deposits her on bare rock
He kisses her
She pushes him away
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing
Show me
won't
You would misuse such power
have paid enough for you, and will have you
She leans forward and kisses his ear and whispers
Make magic, my foolish wizard
For our love
Weave a marvelous room around us, a room worthy of our coupling
She draws closer, kissing him deeply
He breathes heavily
What do you want
You must desire it for me to weave it
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man
Morgana falls silent as Merlin raises a hand, majestically intoning a harsh repetitive charm
The mineral veins of the cave begin to glow and fog seeps out from them enveloping the couple
Desire it and it will be as you desire
Morgana burns with intensity
Merlin utters a formula and the fog coalesces around them into the shimmering presence of crystal walls, fountains raining jewels, flowers made of scented air, a bed of glass shot with light and covered with skins of animals dead before the time of man, goblets of ruby, tapestries woven of golden hair
She reaches out to touch the wall and her hand plunges through the unmaterialized illusion
It's only a semblance
You disappoint me
She begins lacing up her loosened gown
Don't touch the walls
Come close to me
She does, a mad hope in her eyes
She kisses his chest
Do it, Merlin, the deepest secret
Fix it with the charm of Making, for our endless pleasure
He utters the ancient charm, Morgana listening closely, memorizing it
The illusion is all of a sudden solid
For you
She runs her hand across the hard crystal surface, her eyes gleaming
From outside the wondrous room they can be seen to embrace
He carries her to the magical bed where he makes love to her, as they disappear from view in its effulgent light
She comes out through the crystal door, burning with evil intent
She turns to watch him asleep in the bed
She utters the charm of Summoning learnt from Merlin, and the room melts into an eddying carmine fog
Within it, Merlin struggles to awaken from the torpor of love, alarmed
Outside, Morgana utters the charm of Making and the gaseous mass begins to crystallize
Inside, Merlin is rising to his feet, breathing the red fog, his movements slowing to a standstill, his mouth opening in a scream of horror
The cloud has metamorphosed into a magnificent cluster of red crystals
Morgana peers into its facets and there she sees, in fragments, Merlin's terror
an eye, the gaping mouth, a clawing hand--as he is entombed in the stone
She laughs in triumph
-  - Surrounded by forest, the spires and battlements of Camelot rise under black storm clouds
Arthur and Kay ride back to the castle
- The great hall is in gloom
Few knights are in attendance at the table
Some sleep off last night's wine
Arthur approaches, haggard, searching
Has no one seen Merlin
Knights look up; those who meet Arthur's reddened eyes shake their heads
Arthur leaves
knight whispers to another
Did you see
The King was without Excalibur
,  - Echoing in the vaulted corridors outside the hall, the knight's whisper stabs Arthur
The words now seem borne on the whistling wind and follow the King wherever he goes in search of Merlin
He comes upon a knight seducing a lady in a dark corner by the chapel door, his hand under her gown
Arthur notes the sacrilege in silence, and continues on his way
- The wind keens
Thunder rolls overhead
Arthur enters his bedchamber
He sits by the empty fireplace, a broken man
Feminine hands light on his shoulders
He starts
He looks up
It is Morgana
He smiles and grasps her hand
'll weep for you, brother, for a King must not weep
She comes around and she kneels in front of him
Before he can talk she silences him with a tender caress
Do you know what Guenevere's maids have whispered
He shakes his head
That when the King returned from battle
She begins untying the laces of his metal thigh and shin guards
Guenevere would unlace his armor and massage the burns where metal rubbed on flesh
She is stripping his legs naked, gently touching the flesh with her fingertips
He stares off, remembering
She would prepare a bath for you, mixing special ointment in the water
Arthur's eyes brim with tears
Morgana weeps, embracing his knees
He rests his hand gently upon her head, choked with remembrance, soothing her
But as she weeps, she incants a charm
Arthur looks down upon her, and the woman who looks up at him is Guenevere, a Guenevere with cold ice eyes
He is made weak by desire and weakened further by magic
He holds her face adoringly
Guenevere
You are-- "" --Don't speak
thousand words, a hundred thousand words, would only be prologue to the truth that must be
That you, King, and , your Queen, beget a son to bond our love and to strengthen our weak kingdom with a successor
Come, my lord
She draws him to the floor and upon her body, holding him tightly to himself
Arthur trembles with excitement, pathetic in his desperate passion
As he takes her, she shudders, losing control of the charm, and her features change till once again "Guenevere" is Morgana
She holds him in a tight embrace so that he may not see her
She whispers in his ear
The moon flows in my blood to meet your seed
And already  bear him who will be King
Arthur wrenches himself away so he can see her, her arms still around his neck
He looks down upon her, aghast, incredulous
could easily kill you, brother
But  want you to live to see our son be King
In me, the blood of Cornwall will have its revenge; in me, the blood of Uther will show its dark side
She presses her thumbs into his neck and he faints
-  - Morgana, with a small party, rides away from the castle through the lashing storm, till they are taken from sight in the folds of the forest
,   - Lightening forks across the sky, illuminating the interior
The chapel has been transformed into a place of satanic worship
Held up and surrounded by hooded figures, Morgana lies on the altar, her pregnant belly huge; and her features are fierce with passionate intensity
She writhes in the pangs of childbirth
Stand back, all of you
Through my own body  have nurtured him with my potions
made him
alone can give him life
,  - Arthur enters, pale and haunted
Mass is being celebrated, and some knights are present
Those not asleep whisper to each other about the King
The sound of an approaching storm is heard
As the priest raises the chalice to consecrate the wine
Arthur comes down the aisle and steps onto the altar
He reaches out to grasp the chalice from the priest's hands
,   - Morgana holds aloft her beautiful newborn baby, his body glistening in a flash of lightening
She is triumphant
,  -
bolt of lightening strikes the chalice, rocking the chapel, and Arthur is knocked back violently
Rain lashes in through the shattered window upon the terrified knights
They and the priest back away
Arthur is left alone
He rises and goes to the chalice, which is bent and cracked
He kneels before it
Steam hisses up as rain falls on it
- Sun streams in
Many of the knights are in attendance, in full armor
Ladies and pages watch from dark corners
Arthur addresses the fellowship
He holds the cracked chalice in his hands
He burns with a new-found fervor
Who will ride the labyrinths of the forest, to the very root of his soul, to the very ends of the earth, to find the secret that will redeem us from the evil that has fallen upon us, and make this chalice, and ourselves, whole again
Gawain rises and draws his sword in salute
will ride forth in the name of that quest, and commit my strength and my soul to it
Perceval, Kay and a few others draw their swords and touch their lips to the blades in oath
Sunbeams splash off their armor
will go
The rest of the fellowship draw their swords in imitation, but the resolution within them is not strong
Arthur comes forward to Gawain
Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, that we may never meet again, that the fellowship will be no more
He embraces Gawain, tears in his eyes
He turns to Perceval, and Perceval kneels
We will find the secret or die
Arthur kisses the young knight's brow
Then he turns to Kay
Kay,  know your heart yearns to go, but  am prisoner to my duties, and you must be to yours, at my side
Arthur and Kay watch the knights file out till the hall is empty, the harsh song of their armor growing distant
: : "For nine years they searched
Morgana's power grew in the land
" : - Under a leaden sky, Gawain drives his horse through swirling snow
He comes upon a mounted knight who is frozen in his tracks
He brushes the snow from the man's face
The frozen features belong to Caradoc
He slowly continues on his way
- Dangling from the branches of a dead tree are a dozen dead knights of the Round Table, crows pecking at the rotting flesh in the chinks of armor
Perceval rides up, cries out in horror, and spurs his horse away
- The rotting carcasses of sheep
The crops blackened and withered on the stalk
Hungry peasants head for a distant hill
, ,  - giant head has been carved out of an outcrop of rock, its stone mouth gaping toward the sky
People are congregated around the mouth
Peasants and farmers, they are wild with excitement, responding to drums throbbing and bagpipes wailing
They watch Morgana, who is surrounded by knights in dark armor
At her side is an angelic boy of eight, his eyes cold as his mother's
Morgana is more beautiful than ever, in flowing druidic robes, the gossamer silk clinging to her sweat-drenched body
She is standing by the deep hole which forms the giant's open mouth
It is covered by a tooth-like grating acting as a drain for the blood of human sacrifices made there
Before her is Gawain, chained and struggling against five strong men who hold him
Morgana lifts a dagger and plunges it into Gawain's chest
The fountain of blood that gushes from the great knight's body drives the crowd into a frenzy
(intoning) The blood of this knight will feed the god in the earth, he is weak with hunger, and he will be made strong by this blood
Then he will plant his seed, and the land will be fertile once again
Gawain, his blood flowing from him and into the giant's mouth, looks up in anguish
His bellowing voice is echoed and amplified by the hollow beneath the drain
Arthur, forgive me
die without the secret
have failed
- Gawain's death cry and the din of the ritual carries to Perceval's ears as he wanders through the wasteland
He draws down his visor and spurs his horse forward
,  - He gallops toward the giant's head
He checks his sword and lowers his lance
The knight charging forward on his war horse is an awesome sight, but the crowd around the giant's mouth is strangely unfrightened
Morgana is excited; she turns to the boy
Look, Mordred, a true prize for the giant
The lamb rides into our jaws
Perceval is galloping toward them when the ground gives way beneath the horse, and he and the animal plunge into a pit
The cheering crowd rushes to the edge of the trap
(to Mordred) You must kill him, for this knight is dear to your father
You must do it and learn to enjoy your father's pain
Her knights drag Perceval, unarmed, into Morgana's presence
Have you found what you search for
Have you found what Arthur seeks
Perceval doesn't answer, defiant and hiding his fear
You haven't, or you would be smiling now in the face of death
Your quest is an impossible one
That it might be impossible makes it all the more necessary
Fool
(to the men holding Perceval) Uncover him
'll show you the mystery of life
It's death
(to Mordred) Do it, Mordred
Holding Perceval by his limbs and hair, the men force him down on the bloody grating, drawing back his head, exposing his throat
Morgana kneels by his head, and draws the boy beside her
She holds the tip of the dagger to Perceval's neck and takes Mordred's hand and wraps it around the handle
Perceval is choked with fear, his heart pounding in his throat
Feel the life through the dagger, child
It belongs to you
The boy looks up at his mother
The vein in Perceval's neck pushes against the dagger's point
feel it, Mother
will give his blood to the giant
The boy raises the dagger, and hesitates just a bit
Perceval resigns himself bravely
He looks the child calmly in the eye
Mordred brings down the blade without strength, just piercing the skin with the tip
He lets go of the dagger, afraid now of his mistake
The dagger clatters to the grating and slips away down the drain, before Morgana can retrieve it
She rages against Mordred
In the confusion, Perceval tears loose, the men holding him slipping on the blood-wet stone
Perceval runs through the crowd
Immediately, lance lowered, a knight is upon him
Perceval leaps toward him, catching the lance in his hand, and pulling down the rider with it
He jumps the rider and draws the knight's sword
Whirling the lance and cutting the air with the sword, he keeps back the other knights for a moment, giving him time to see his chance
He leaps onto the riderless horse and charges off through the crowd
He reins in abruptly, the horse rearing
He is wary of the ground before him; there could be a hidden pit
But there is no time to think
Knights and men on foot are rushing him
He spurs forward into a gallop, the horse striding mightily And its hind leg sinks into a pit, the animal losing its gait
But the momentum carries the horse forward, and it recovers from the stumble
Perceval gallops away
Morgana is enraged
She shakes Mordred by the hair
You didn't kill him
You didn't kill him
But suddenly she begins kissing him tenderly
My dear, sweet boy
He just stands there emotionless, the dead center of her turbulent passions
- Perceval gallops down a trail
The black-armored knights of Morgana chase him
Perceval reins into deep cover alongside the trail
The pursuers thunder past and the sound of hooves recedes
Perceval checks his newly found sword, slashes the air to feel the weapon's balance
He re-sheathes it
He pats the horse
We'll become good friends
He starts off again, into the patchless forest of dead trees
He is suddenly set upon by a wildman who, swinging a small uprooted tree, knocks him off his horse
Perceval crashes to the ground and before he can use his sword the wildman has knocked it out of his hand
It is Lancelot, demented, who furiously rains battering blows on Perceval's armor, bellowing with rage
All that Perceval can do is attempt to avoid the blows
Lancelot addresses Perceval as if the young knight were Lancelot himself
Where are you going, Lancelot, in your iron tomb
Still trying to save the world
(He hammers blows into Perceval's armor) The best
the bravest
the greatest
fool that ever lived
Now the world rots
Death is king of the earth
And it is you who make it so, Lancelot
Before Perceval can speak, Lancelot disappears again into the forest, his eyes blank, as though his encounter with the young knight had never happened
knot of pain, Perceval pulls himself up
He tries to rise into the saddle
He is too hurt to do it
He starts off on foot, slowly, leading the horse
- It is very dark and Perceval has to feel his way
He comes to the edge of a stream
He kneels to drink, and the horse drinks beside him
Then he rests back on his heels, brooding, too tired to rise
He lowers his eyes, staring into the dark water, defeated, empty
Before him in the water a long thin bar of light appears
He looks at it amazed
Voices are heard singing very far away
He reaches out to touch the long strip of light but his hand just disturbs the water
It is a reflection
The strip grows wider and the ethereal music is closer
Perceval looks up
The strip of light is before him, suspended, thirty feet above
It continues to grow wider drawbridge is being slowly lowered, allowing a powerful light to escape from within
Perceval is terrified
In pain, he slowly rises into the saddle, ready to gallop off; but fascinated, hypnotized by the sight, he cannot, and he stays and watches
The dim outline of a castle becomes visible as the drawbridge is lowered across the water to the ground at his feet
At the center of the blast of light coming from the castle, Perceval can make out a burning chalice
The music swells to a terrifying pitch, searing the forest
- At the sight of the chalice, Perceval masters his fear
Bathed in light and music, he spurs the horse forward onto the drawbridge
Once he is on it, the bridge begins to rise
Unsure of its footing and blinded by the light, the horse becomes skittish, and Perceval has to struggle to control it
He dismounts to lead it, but the horse is terrified, rears up and jumps off the bridge, which continues to rise, drawn up by unseen hands
Perceval hesitates, then advances down the sloping drawbridge into the castle courtyard
All details are bleached out by the blinding light
The chalice appears suspended in space, and now the figure of a man can be glimpsed standing behind it
Enchanting music from unseen singers grows and weaves
Perceval looks back to see the drawbridge slowly closing, trapping him inside
He approaches the figure, his courage ebbing
Hands cupping the chalice, it speaks to him
What is the secret of the chalice
Who does it serve
Perceval doesn't understand
He glances back again
The drawbridge is nearly closed
Terror seizes him
Panicked, puzzled, baffled, he backs away
He scrambles up the drawbridge desperate to reach the top before it closes
He claws his way up till his hand grasps the top
He heaves himself through the narrow closing slit which is about to crush him
He screams, and with a final effort he wriggles free and topples over crashing into the water below
- He looks up
The drawbridge thunders shut, the last thin strip of light disappearing; and now he is surrounded only by the silence of the forest
Where there was a castle, now there is darkness
Perceval wades through the water
He has crossed the stream and all he can see and feel are tree trunks
The castle has disappeared
He is utterly defeated
The chalice
The secret was in my grasp
let it slip, afraid for myself
question was asked
didn't understand
didn't try
failed
: : "Nine years passed
" : Dripping water is steadily encrusting the crystal with limestone
,  - Dead knights lay on biers
The once glorious seat of power is falling into decay
Few are in attendance around the table
Agitated, Kay enters and goes to Arthur, who is worn and haggard, and aged
Your son Mordred is at the gate
Arthur comes alive
At last
Don't recognize him
You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery
(staring off) Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me
Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall
All  have left is the memory of their fellowship
Echoes and memories
am a ghost of the King that once was
(he turns to Kay and with sudden harshness) Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood
will see him, must
,     - The drawbridge lowers slowly, and Arthur moves away from Kay and the other knights, and advances across it
Rooks wheel over the dead trees of the forest that surrounds Camelot
group of armed men waits at the edge of the forest
One steps forward, a huge knight in black armor, the metal defining and exaggerating the powerful musculature of his body
He is Mordred, a young man of eighteen, and of extraordinary beauty
page follows ten steps behind him bearing an enormous spear, its points hooded
Arthur stops at the edge of the drawbridge, the huge knight a few steps from him
Kay, ready for anything, moves halfway across the drawbridge
Mordred kneels on one knee
Father
Rise, Mordred
have come to claim what is mine, Father
recognize you only as my son, no more
(his tone is scathing) And you are the great King
The lords have rebelled
Invaders attack the coasts
Crops don't grow
There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land
Only  am feared
will be king
You may have lost Excalibur, but  have found my own weapon of power
There
He points to the huge lance
The page pulls a string and the hood drops, revealing a diabolically sharp spear tip, its metal glinting menacingly
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross
Your mother told you that
Mordred is thrown off by the doubt Arthur has cast
Arthur looks upon his son, desperately trying to read him
cannot offer you the land, only my love
And  offer only this, Father
To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king
Arthur goes forward to embrace his son, a desperate attempt
Mordred recoils
We will embrace only in battle
Father, and  will touch you only with the blade of my spear
Arthur is on the verge of tears
will muster a great force of knights, and  will return to fight for what is mine
So be it
He turns and re-enters the castle, the drawbridge pulled up immediately behind him
He is hunched over, broken
- Asleep in the saddle, Perceval rides across burnt and smoldering fields
The horse walks aimlessly; it is the same animal, mangy and old
hoard of children in filthy rags closes in on him, begging, pulling at the horse's trappings
He bolts awake and reins away
His eyes are red and feverish
Wild hope grips him when he sees a glinting light by a farmhouse
He spurs the horse forward into a gallop
- He leaps from the saddle and a terrified woman backs away
Perceval plunges his hand into the source of light
It is nothing but the reflection of the dying sun in a bucketful of water
Perceval covers his face
Illusions
will never find it again
am sorry, woman, that frightened you
Peasants have emerged, surrounding him, and they hold axes and pitchforks
Good woman, do you have any food
Some water
The little we had, we gave to Mordred's knights
He has taken this land
Tell the King that now we must look to Mordred
But we will give you some water
At least ten peasants encircle Perceval and he is too exhausted to put up a fight
They grab him and carry him away
Other peasants pull his horse to the ground, and one raises and ax to kill it
,   - They throw Perceval down an escarpment and he rolls into the fast-moving water
He is swept downstream and thrown ferociously against the rocks in the stream bed, crying out in pain
- The water is deeper and Perceval is dragged under by the weight of his armor
He struggles desperately to shed it, half drowning
Exhausted, he pulls himself up onto the muddy shore beside a rotting sheep carcass, and around him, the daylight dies
- Ragged and bruised, lifeless, he stares into space
have lost my horse, my armor, my sword
have lost my way
have lost my strength
have lost everything
will not lose hope
light bursting through the trees shines on the mud, wordless, harmonies sound somewhere in the forest
Perceval sets off toward the source
The burning light blasts into his face but he doesn't flinch
The chorus builds in power
Before him, a drawbridge lowers
- He steps onto the bridge and walks in
He crosses the courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him
All details of the castle are bleached out by the searing light
- He steps onto the bridge and walks in
He crosses the courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him
All details of the castle are bleached out by the searing light
, Heading for the source of the light he ascends what seem to be a staircase
He enters a hall where the chalice stands suspended, burning with light, and the mysterious music swirls and grows
Perceval approaches the diaphanous and featureless Figure who stands over the chalice
Who does it serve
You, my lord
have waited long for you
Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you
Why am  served from the chalice
Because you and the land are one
am wasting away and  cannot die
And  cannot live
You and the land are one
Drink from the chalice
You will be reborn and the land with you
Perceval cups his hands around the chalice to lift it
But they close on nothing, and he draws back
The Figure's hands, although insubstantial, grasp Perceval's and appear to hold his hands around the cup
But who am
Perceval begins to kneel
You are my lord and King
You are Arthur
The blinding light vanishes, the music drifts away
- Perceval falls to his knees before Arthur and he holds the chalice, now whole again, up to the King
It fills with blood from within and Arthur takes it from Perceval
He drinks
And having done so, he seems to become younger and to grow in strength
didn't know how empty was my soul until it was filled
Sir Kay stands by the vast fireplace where a small fire burns, and only now looks up and is aware of Perceval
Perceval, you have returned
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more
have lived through others far too long
Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt
My knights have fought my causes
Mordred carries my sins
Now, at last,  will rule
- Arthur at the head of a small force of knights, their armor shining beneath the moon, gallops through the land
Where hooves thunder, the ground becomes alive with sprouts and tendrils, and bare trees start to bud, and grasses to blossom, the power of Nature exploding into life
- An old nun approaches the doors, upon which someone is pounding loudly
She opens the peephole
It is Arthur
Go away
No man is allowed beyond these doors
am Arthur
The old nun is amazed and starts pushing open the many bolts, mumbling and agitated
- She leads the King, his footsteps ringing in the silent cloister, past the doors to the cells
His armor is wet with dew and it shines with a dull and deep luster
Nuns whisper at his transit
She opens the door to a cell and Arthur steps inside
- Candles flicker on a small altar before which a nun is praying
She turns to see who has entered
It is Guenevere, older, thin with self-denial, all the more beautiful
She looks up at the majestic figure who stands before her
She nearly swoons
He helps her to her feet, and words rush from deep within him
Guenevere, accept my forgiveness, and put your heart to rest
We have suffered to long
have always loved you, and  still love you
She weeps
loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky
Forgive me, my wife, if you can was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory
The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again
Now once more  must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be
have kept it
She draws back the covers of her pallet, and there is Excalibur
Arthur is overwhelmed by emotion; he can barely speak never dared to hope all these years that it was in your keeping
He kneels before her and kisses her thigh
She gazes off, remembering the life of long ago
He rises and looks off into her eyes, unable to find the words; he finally does
have often thought that in the hereafter of our lives, when  owe no more to the future and can be just a man, that we may meet, and you will come to me and claim me as yours, and know that  am your husband
It is a dream  have
He takes Excalibur by the hilt and exits
- The nuns scatter before him in awe and terror
He strides forward, Excalibur in hand
He stops and tests its balance, and he draws force from it
Guenevere
- Excalibur gleams in the sunlight
Arthur holds it high, at the head of a small force of knights under the banner of the Dragons
Kay and Perceval ride at his side
Plumed helmets, shields blazing with armorial colors, pennants flying in the clean wind from their lances; it is a brave sight
The trees are in blossom and dandelion fluff billows up at their passage
,  - Arthur's group comes to a halt
Two knights and a few squires galloping from the opposite direction rein in before the King
The knights draw their swords in homage, and the older one addresses Arthur
It is only me and my son
All other knights of the dukedom have rallied to Mordred
Arthur smiles hiding the hurt
He points to an open pit, a huge devastation
What horror is that
Mordred, sir
He digs for precious metals, with which he buys the loyalty of men at arms, binding them to his side
- '   - It is a clear night and the sky blazes with stars
crescent moon casts its silvery light upon Arthur, who wanders from his camp alone
,   - He stops in the ancient circle of Druidic stones
am outnumbered ten to one by Mordred's forces
Merlin,  need you at my side as you were once, my friend, to give me courage
There are no war tricks that will fool Mordred
He was weaned on blood
He falls on his knees in front of the stone, tired, between thinking and dreaming, and he bangs his mailed fist against it
More than  ever did,  need you now
Where are you, Merlin
Is it true that Morgana has trapped you
The veins of crystal glow darkly, and the hammering of Arthur's fist upon the stone is dimly echoed here
In the red crystal, fragments of Merlin can be glimpsed, trapped, frozen
- Arthur slips off into sleep
The stones around him distort
He speaks softly, but then though the words continue, his lips are closed
If only you could be at my side, Merlin, to see me wield Excalibur once more
The crystal is cracking, shards falling to the cave floor
- Arthur is still on his knees, and he sits back, looking up
But the atmosphere is different, within a dream, and the stones of the henge loom larger over him now
What is this place
It is rumored Merlin, that you drew your power from these circles
hand ruffles the King's hair
He turns, and is face to face with Merlin, standing over him
Arthur looks at him without surprise, as though the intervening years never were
Merlin begins to laugh his hideous giggle
Arthur rises
Quiet
You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives
know
have heard noises and echoes through the stones
What is this place, Merlin
It is like a tree
The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men
Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree
And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events
(becoming passionate) But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge
In fact,  nearly didn't make it in one piece
He limps affectedly and stretches with exaggerated pain
But, 'm here
Where have you been these many years
Is it true that Morgana-- --Stories
You brought me back
Your love brought me back
Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams
Is this a dream
Tell me, Merlin
Merlin smiles, turns and leaves, heading for Arthur's camp, giggling
Arthur starts off after him and awakens from the dream when he walks into one of the stones
It takes him a moment to realize that Merlin has vanished
Merlin
He hurries away toward the camp
' , '   - Arthur shakes Kay awake, and as the faithful knight comes out of a deep sleep, he clutches Arthur's arm
Merlin, will  live
(he shakes away the dream) was dreaming
Of Merlin
Yes
He spoke to me
He said  would fight bravely tomorrow
have never dreamed of Merlin before
dreamed of him too
Merlin lives
He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one
He speaks to us from there
'   - Cape flowing, Merlin sweeps between Mordred's war tents, and in the logic of dreams, unseen by the guards
He passes a tent where the huge shadow of Mordred is thrown on the canvas, as he sharpens the blade of a fearsome spear
He enters a tent
'  - She is stunningly beautiful in her sleep
Merlin leans over her lovely body, kisses her softly on the lips, and waits for her to awaken
have returned, enchantress
You are beautiful, magnificent
Have you used up all the magic you stole from me to keep yourself young
Have you any magic left to do battle with Merlin
- ' She rises from her sleeping body
You provoke me, Merlin
What's behind that beauty
wizened, cold-hearted snake
Merlin steps back, grandiose and melodramatic
You are a snake about to strike
He raises his staff
And  am the staff that drives the snake back
He lowers the staff with dreamlike slowness and she slinks right up to him
Burning with the fire of desire, am the flames that consume the staff to ashes
She winds her fluttering hands around the staff, and the shadows they cast upon the tent give the illusion of licking flames
am the cloudburst that quenches the flames
am the desert, where water disappears-- -- am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight
-- am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping
She laughs at her cleverness
Fog and mist
You couldn't be that
You don't have enough magic
'  - Morgana tosses and mutters in her tormented dream
have the desire and  have the magic
- ' Merlin, huge, magnetic, enfolds Morgana in his cape
You are mine at last
am the sea and you will never escape me
Fog and Mist
And he laughs at her, suffocating her
Morgana begins chanting the charm of Making, desperate-- '  - --and she finishes uttering it in her sleep
Her eyes spring open, and vapors issue from her gaping mouth
She screams and the fog gushes out filling the tent
' , '   - Fog billows out of the tent, spreading through the camp
'  - fog is rising, sir
That cannot be
He rises and goes out with the lieutenant
'   - It is fogbound, the campfires yellow smudges within it
(to the lieutenant) My mother has a sense for such things
She said there would be no fog
Mordred enters his mother's tent
'  - Mordred enters
Mother
Morgana, withered, old, lies dead in the bed, wisps of smoke rising from within her ruptured body
-  - Arthur, with Kay and Perceval, canters through the white fog
They are flanked by a phalanx of knights in silver armor
Kay, you will lead the attack
Perceval, you will stay with me
Kay draws his sword in salute, elated
Be cautious, my brother
He spurs forward, while Arthur reins to a halt, watching him disappear
Perceval and a few knights stay behind and surround the King
In this battle there is one thing must do, that no one else can
Find Mordred and kill him
Ahead, the horrible din of joined battle
In the swirling fog, clash of arms follows clash of arms
There is confusion, for each knight is unable to see if he is fighting friend or foe until they are upon each other
The battle becomes a series of vicious duels, a knight in silver armor against a knight in black-burnished armor, just glimpsed in the fog that is alive with the clang of sword on shield, the pounding of hooves, the cries of the dying
Squires drag away their wounded knights, their young faces pale at the sight of the carnage
Kay is unhorsed but picks himself up and mounts a riderless horse, rejoining the combat although he is bleeding
-  - It is full day, and the fog blinds with its painful glare
Arthur with Perceval at his side rides through the fog, searching
Perceval takes up a challenge against the King
He unhorses this opponent, piercing him with his lance
He returns to the King's side
There are too many on Mordred's side
We cannot hold out much longer
Kay is glimpsed fighting on foot, hurt, barely holding his own, but then the sight is hidden in the fog
Kay overcomes his opponent and stops to catch his breath
He is amazed by what he sees
knight, in old, battle-scarred armor whose pieces don't match, cuts down the knights in black in foray after foray, wheeling and turning in a brilliant and ruthless spectacle of martial arts
He fights without a shield, a lance in his left hand and sword in his right
Kay moves away in search of Arthur
Arthur and Perceval watch the lone knight meting out death with such terrible beauty, weaving in and out of the fog
He can be no other
Lancelot
It is Lancelot
He spurs his horse forward to join him, but Perceval is quick to stop him
No, my lord
We seek Mordred
will join him
Kay rises onto a fresh horse and gallops away
-  - Arthur and Perceval ride alone, the accompanying knights gone, the dying and the dead and the crazed horses all around them
Squires are carrying Kay upon his shield
He is dead
Arthur leaps to the ground and reaches out to touch his face, and closes his eyes
He stifles his tears
Has anyone seen Lancelot
He lies over there, sir
Arthur rushes off, Perceval following on horseback
Lancelot is mortally wounded, blood flowing from his abdomen, his eyes open but his gaze dead
Arthur falls to his side
Squire
Here
But there is no one now except the dead and wounded, and Perceval, who dismounts to watch over the King, sword drawn
Desperate, Arthur stops the wound with his hand
Lancelot's eyes are sightless, but tears spill from them
Arthur
Lancelot,  will save you
Don't die
He tears off a piece of his tunic and staunches the wound with it
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table
You are that and much more
You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men
Now we will be together-- --It is the old wound, that has been opened
have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed
Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty
Arthur takes Lancelot in his arms and rests his lips against the knight's brow
(a death whisper) Guenevere, has she come to you, is she Queen again
He lies, closing his eyes, unable to look at Lancelot
She is, Lancelot
boyish smile settles over the features of Lancelot's face, and he dies
Arthur holds him to his breast, his eyes shut tight
strong wind rises
Perceval kneels beside Arthur
The fog is lifting
Only we remain alive
- Arthur and Perceval rise, and as far as they can see across the green hills that roll down to the sea lies the aftermath of the massacre
Hacked bodies, abandoned armor, steaming horse carcasses, everything still
The murmur of the dying is carried on the wind to the soft roar of the sea
The squires have fled the scene of horror
But for Mordred
Where is Mordred
Elsewhere on the battlefield, Mordred searches the dead, accompanied only by his lieutenant, who turns over the bodies of Arthur's knights
Where is Arthur
One of Arthur's knights reaches out blindly for help
Mordred crushes his skull underfoot
The shaft of his huge lance is caked with blood, as are his hands
Arthur and Perceval see Mordred and his lieutenant, and the King restrains Perceval from going forward
No, Perceval
Now it is time for me to raise my sword
(he bellows out) Mordred, prepare to meet your death
Shield on his left arm, and Excalibur in his right, he starts toward Mordred
wait for you, Father
Mordred advances forward, the huge spear in both hands and parallel to the ground
Arthur goes straight for him, shield ready to receive the blow
Mordred keeps walking, his arms now tensed back and ready to strike
Once they are within weapon's reach of each other, Mordred dashes forward and thrusts the spear
It glances off Arthur's shield, slides under his hauberk and penetrates the King's body, and so powerful was the blow that the blade pierces him right through
Mortally wounded, Arthur's scream of pain becomes a horrible war cry, and he drives himself forward with all the strength he has along the spear shaft almost to Mordred's hands
Mordred is knocked back and to the ground and Arthur presses down on him, the butt of the spear pinning Mordred
Arthur lifts Excalibur
Mordred attempts to free himself, as the blade of Excalibur descends upon him and cuts through metal, flesh and bone
Mordred's head falls to the ground, rolling away
Mordred's lieutenant flees
Perceval races to Arthur's side, and supports the King who has fallen on his knees
Arthur speaks through the pain: Draw the spear from me
Do it
Perceval holds the King tight to himself with one arm, while with the other he draws the shaft through and out of Arthur's body
Arthur sags but doesn't fall
Perceval begins to remove his armor to get at the gaping wounds
The King speaks slowly, softly, from outside his own pain-wracked body
There is one thing left to do
Excalibur
And you must do it, Perceval
Leave my wounds,  command you
cannot-- --Take Excalibur
Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it
Perceval, stunned by the command, doesn't move
Obey me, Perceval
You must act for me
It is my last order as your King
Do it, and be back
Perceval picks up the sword, mounts his horse and rides inland
Arthur watches him go, struggling with the pain, still kneeling, and then his head falls to his chest
,  - Perceval steps through tall reeds to the edge of a pool
He cannot bring himself to throw Excalibur into the water
He examines the blade, and it is haloed with a faint iridescence
It is too precious a thing
can't
He backs away from the water and hides the sword in the reeds, and starts back
- Perceval dismounts, rushing to kneel at the King's side
Arthur looks up, calm and intense
When you threw it in, what did you see
saw nothing
The King looks at him with piercing power
Perceval blurts it out
My King,  couldn't do it
Excalibur cannot be lost
Other men-- --By itself it is only a piece of steel
Its power comes from he who wields it
For now there is no one
Do as  have ordered
Perceval leaves once more
The daylight is failing, the sun is near the horizon over the sea, bursting through clouds
- He picks up the sword and looks at it for a long time
Finally, with great misgiving, he hurls it into the middle of the pool
As Excalibur is about to touch the water a woman's hand reaches and grasps it by the hilt
It holds the sword aloft for a moment and then draws it under
Perceval backs away from the pool stunned by the marvel
- Perceval returns to the King, terribly excited, shouting from his horse: Arthur
But Arthur isn't there
Perceval looks around him, he doesn't understand
He sees a trail of blood
He spurs his horse and follows the trail down to the sea
- There is a trail of blood and prints upon the sand left by a man crawling
Perceval follows them toward the sea
He looks around, searching, terribly distraught
Where the blood and prints cease, there are many footprints coming from and returning into the sea
Perceval looks out across the waves
He sees a sailing vessel rising on the swell
On its deck he can make out the distant figure of Arthur, lying surrounded by women, their gossamer robes rippling in the wind
The sun hovers on the horizon and the ship is heading for it
He gallops into the waves until his horse will go no further, calling out with all his strength, a futile attempt: Arthur
Will you return
The sun slips below the horizon
Night is falling, and the wind whips the wavecrests
He turns from the sea and wades back
All the knights of the Round Table are dead
Excalibur is returned
Arthur is gone
Maybe he lives, maybe he will return
He stops at the edge of the water
In the uncertain light sky and sea become one
He draws the chalice out of a pouch on his saddle, and he holds it up before him
Only  remain, and this
The wind swirls and whistles mysteriously in the hollow of the cup
Music grand and melancholic grows from it
The chalice, etched in starlight, is the last thing that is taken from sight in the enfolding darkness
