by 2nd Draft Revised 10 March 1984 1EXTERIOR Huge trees taper upward like columns supporting the roof of heaven
Moonlit dewdrops spangle a delicate spiderweb
The setting is tranquil and utterly majestic
Over the brow of a distant hill, a pair of brilliant light beams scintillate in an etheral ballet
Numerous small animals gather to behold this wonder
They stand on the hillcrest, staring down as if at the Nativity
Squirrels, quail, hedgehogs, mice, pheasants and badgers, natural enemies untied by the radiant
magnificent stag watches, numbers of tiny songbirds perched in his branching antlers
1A : from the hilltop, through ferns and brambles to a steep embankment where umbrella-sized toadstools cluster
snarling face  under a mushroom cap
This is  a brigand goblin hunter
Clad in decrepit armor and slung with savage weapons, he is a terrifying figure
Blix
The  is unexpectedly lovely, a nightingale's call
Further back, three other goblins return the
They bristle with weaponry
is a pig-faced fop wearing tattered lace and flithy brocade
Tiny  and  are both masked by grotesque helmets
Swarms of gnats drone above their hidden heads
They creep forward to join Blix
1B '  : The distant animals silhouetted by dazzling
1C Blix signals an advance and the goblins creep through the forest towards the hilltop
moth lands on a twig two feet from Tic's head
He turns
His incredibly sticky tongue uncoils from within the helmet seizing the moth and retracting with it, quick as a flash
As the goblins near the hilltop, the fantastic  gradually illuminates their hideous features
tiny mouse runs out of the eye-slits on Blunder's helmet, circles the crest, and runs back in on the other side
Blix signals silently for the other goblins to spread out
The goblins crawl separately through the underbrush
Pox comes snout to snout with a wild piglet
Terrified, the little shoat  and scampers off
2 2A  : Alerted by the , they face the impending threat
The startled animals run for cover down the hillside
3 3A Blix charges forward, brandishing his crossbow
: Kill
Blix runs over the top of the hill and down into the gully beyond, closely followed by Tic, Pox, and Blunder
Brilliant clumps of forget-me-nots are everywhere, like disgarded jewels
3B '  : The pair of shining   race away between the trees
4 5 5A The goblins watch the   disappear
Blix  in frustration
(musing):
Fast as a hound dog with his ass on fire
Blunder spots a  silver hair caught on the bark
He reaches up and plucks it free
: What's that
-l-let me see, old chap
: No
It's mine
Blunder hides the hair behind his back, but Pox quickly grabs the other end
: Give it to m-m-m-me
Both goblins pull on the hair
Miraculously, it does not break, but stretches between them like spun steel
: Turn loose, anus features
: Hard cheese
furious tug of war
Pox pulls his knife and tries unsuccessfully to cut the hair
: It's mine you rectum
Mine
Mine
Blix marches up and furiously bangs their heads together
Pox and Blunder fall dazed to the ground
Blix holds the silver hair shining above his head and studies it
: Disgusting and pure, like a prayer
There be magic in this hair
The beast ran off, faster and faster
We must take this to our Master
6 An incredible landscape, fantastically contoured hills rise above the monnbright mist
The four goblins dismount, tie up their devil steeds, and disappear over the brow of a hill
6A The goblins scramble down a steep hillside towards a desolate wasteland below
mysterious malevolant shape looms on the far horizon
7 miasmic Jurassic swamp
Stunted trees rise like amputated limbs from the fetid water
The goblins pick their way across the bog towards a distant island, stepping from submerged logs to crumbled chunks of masonary to floating lily pads
cracked marble plinth juts out of the water
The goblins creep by a towering skeletal statue playing a bone violin
7A v-shaped ripple undulates past them like the wake of a submerged crocodile
Blix unhooks a dead rat from his game belt and tosses it from his game belt and tosses it onto the scummy surface
There is an angry swirl and it is gone
Blix waves the goblins on and they climb onto a huge root twisting out of the water like a petrified serpant
The ominous wake cruises back and forth like a shark
Blunder follows its progress with fear-widened eyes
:Wish i was still a leprecaun
Stay clear of nasty places like this and do nothing all day but sing and dance and guzzle wine in the sunshine
Furious, Blix turns on him, his finger to his lips
: Shhhh
Unchastened, Blunder whirls on Pox and repeats the gesture: : Shhhh
Pox follows suit with Tic: : Shhhh
Not to be outdone, Tic turns to silence whoever might be behind him
:
7B rises out of the bog, huge and hideous
The water hag is half corpse, half serpant
She seizes Tic and disappears beneath the foul surface
The goblin's final  trembles in the chill night air
7C Blix, Pox, and Blunder are terrified
They scramble over the twisted root in a wild panic, leaping onto a floating log
: Run
Panic
Emergency
The log rolls beneath their frantic feet
They barely keep their balance
: Frog spit
: Snail Sperm
: All together
now or never
The goblin co-ordinate like tiny lumberjacks, running in unison
The rolling log drifts forward
: -j-jolly good
Team spirit and all that
The log runs against the island and the goblins hop ashore
8 An enormous blasted tree crowns the ruins of a forgotten castle
Tangled roots grip the anicient stones like the tenacles of a malformed sea monster
An atmosphere of eternal evil hovers over the site
The goblins stare back across the bog
: Poor Tic
(growling with anger): Forget Tic
Less is always more
: Better we spilt three ways than four
Blix hurries up the crumbling steps
Pox and Blunder follow
The steps lead under gigantic twisting roots
Blix finds a small opening and slips inside
Pox and Blunder like this less and less but follow their leader without complaint
9 The three goblins tumble down a steep slope
The giant tree is a vast hollow stump, open to a moonlit sky, surrounding a smaller tree transfixed by a curved bronze horn, an instrument of unspeakable evil
Pox and Blunder stare up like open-mouthed tourists
Blix is impatient
: Boost me
Hurry
We must sound the summons before the dawn
The three goblins form a teetering ladder with Blix wobbling at the top and Blunder crushed at the bottom
Blix blows into the horn with all his might
Nothing happens
Suddenly, he breaks wind
Pox and Blunder grimace
Blix blows again into the horn
There is no sound
Dead leaves and dust puff out of the bell, followed by three  bats
The supporting goblins wobble
Pox steps on Blunder's head
Blix blows a third time into the great horn
The unholy  reverbarates like the wailing of all the doomed souls in Purgatiory
10  ( ) As the evil  moans, the forest creatures react with terror
Squirrels, rabbits, and mice dart fearfully for cover
Birds flock to their nests
Only the night creatures, the wolves, weasels, and owls perk up thier ears to listen
11 The three goblins cower terrified among the gnarled roots
: Now what
: We sit
We wait
That be our fate
11A The goblins wait up on the upper platform of the ruined castle
Blix sits apart from the others, staring out across at the bog
The light of a campfire casts their shifting shadows against the huge trunk of the hollow tree
Blix plays with the silver hair
(to himself): Moving silent like the breeze
Soft as shadows, still as trees, Darkness be in all we sees
He lives in silence, he lives in fire, He lives in all that's dark and dire
mysterious floating shape approaches out of the distance
It is a black cloak, wafting through the mist like an airborne manta ray
12 The flying cloak wraps about the statue of the skeletal fiddler
The wind presses it tight, revealing the skull through the cloth
Suddenly, the statue's head turns to look at the great tree
13 Blix walks to to the edge of the platform, peering into the night
: Look in the gloom, search out the tomb
That be where you find our sire
The pedestal is empty
The statue of the fidder has vanished
Blix gets down on his knees, genuflecting, toward the the open bog
The black shadow of the    falls across him
Darkness towers over the ruined castle platform, a huge horned figure drpaed in bacl cloth
An awesome silence ensues
Blunder and Pox kneel, heaping ashes and dirt upon thier heads
: Hail  great One
divine and dark
Strong like a lion, swift like a shark
Blix offers the silver hair up to Darkness
: Though 'm not worthy of the task Great Lord,  found this for your amusment
Blunder leaps to his feet and grabs the hair from Blix
: Don't listen to them mealy-mouthed lies boss
'm the one who found it
Me
Blunder the Bold
There is a bight
Blunder  with pain
Blunder stares at his arm in dismay
His hand is gone, magically replaced by a grotesque birdclaw
(stunned): Thank you, Lordship
Blunder experimently clenches and unclenches his new bird claw
: Quite stylish, actually
Darkness dangles the shining silver hair in front of him
: Where
: In the woods, six leagues back, 'Tween Twin Oaks and the Dragon's Track
: Did my bold hunters chance to see quarry which cast this spoor
:  stalked it, Sire, but much too slow, What beast it be  do not know
: This hair is from an angel of light
It comes this way rarely
must have this creature
: Oh Divine Dark One, teach us how to catch this creature
: Your instruction would be m-m-most ap-p-preciated
: Amen
wants to learn
craves knowledge
: No trap of yours will work
There is only lure for such disgusting goddness
one bait which never fails
: Name the bait, Lord
: Innoncence
14 beautiful flower-spangled meadow alive with songbirds
Baby rabbits frolic in the tall grass where industrious squirrels forage for acorns and nuts
delicate fawn gambols under the watchful eye of the doe
Clouds of multi-hued butterflies swirl overhead
Waist-deep in flower, a young princess skips  across the meadow
Her name is
She wears splendid brocades and carries a bouquet wrapped in a lace napkin
Like these blossoms, she is beautiful and fresh and innocent
Tiny birds fly down and land on her head and shoulders
She laughs as a warbling wren takes a seed from her lips
(singing): Come down sparrow, sing me good morning
Rise up sun, light the arch of the sky
Living river, turn light to diamonds, When  look in my true love's eyes
Lili runs towards a distant thatched-roofed cottage
15 Blix, Pox, and Blunder hide behind a boulder, watching the girl
(whipering): Darkness say the perfect lure Always be a virgin pure
15A The '  is hangin up the washing when Lili sneaks from behind the cottage
Grinning micheviously, Lili unfastens one end of the clothes-line and lets it drop
The laundry flutters onto the new-mown grass,  sheet drpaes around the outraged wife
: Dad-blamed faeries
16 The cottage is snug and homey with smoke-blackened beams and hand- pegged furniture
sleeps by his bench surrounded by wood-shavings and roughed-out toys
Lili steps into the sunlight streaming through the open doorway
Her beauty is etheral, an angel descending
Finches peck at newly-made tarts laid on a trestle table to cool
They rise to the rafters as at Lili's approach
The Princess peeks around the room
She tiptoes to the hearth and lifts the stewpot lid, dipping a finger in for a taste
Spying the tarts, she grabs one and eats it hurriedly, leaving a telltale crumb on her upper lip
The clock tolls the hour
carved wooden maiden piroettes from the interior, pursued by a skeletal fiddler playing a bone fiddle
Lili is fancinated
The Woodcarver's Wife enters
She curtsies to the Princess
: God Bless Your Highness
royal visit is ever a joy
: 've not come to visit, Nell : Won't you stay for a tart
Nell pulls a tray from the oven
(cont): They're fresh-baked
: 've no time today
(teasing): The Princess must have a sweetheart waiting
: Nonsense
: Surely the king forbids such folly : What my father doesn't know won't hurt him
: The wilful heart invites despair, Like blind men creeping in a dragon's lair
With Nell's back turned, Lili steals another tart, hiding it among the flowers in her bouquet
: Neither country provebs nor king's command can keep me out of the woods today
: Then it's common sense ought
These woods be thick with spriggen and banshee
: Is that why you've hung a bell over the door
: Aye, and spread the floor with flax and salt
My babe won't be stole by faeries
The Princess starts merrily for the sun-bright doorway
(laughing): More salt, Nell
You'll worry yourself to death if you're not careful
Lili runs out like a naughty child
The Woodcarver's Wife leans against the door jamb and calls after her: : Beware of toadstool rings and willow trees
Stay away from old oaks
17 Hiding behind a moss-coverd log, Blix, Pox, and Blunder watch Princess Lili run  through the woods, oblivous to any sign of danger
(scowling): May be innocent
May be sweet
Ain't half as nice as rotten meat
18  ' lovely glade surrounded by tall trees, Breathlessly, Lili runs in from the woods
She is familair with this spot
It is her trysting place (calling): Jack
know you're here
Jack
Lili looks around in exasperation
Behind her, something wild and mysterious swings through the trees like an animal
(cont): Jack
Where are you
Answer me
Lili is apprehensive at getting no reply
She hears the  of the leaves but does not see the sun-dappled figure leaping from limb to limb overhead
(frightened)(cont): Oh, Jack
please say something if you're here
'  , a legendry "Green Man" who lives the free life of a hermit in the woods, drops down from a tree behind the Princess, landing without a sound
He is barefoot, about sixteen, and wears woven ivy leaves and skins
Startled, Lili
(cont): Jack
You scared the life out of me
Jack says nothing, staring at her shyly
Lili hands him the flowers
flies down out of the greenery and lands  on Jack's shoulder
He imitates the bird expertedly, The Jay answers him in English: : She brings a gift as fair as herself
Lili , It all seems magic to her
: You're so clever, Jack
See what you can find in the flowers
Jack pokes in the bouquet and discovers the stolen tart
He stuffs it immediately into his mouth
: Mmmmmmm
: Sweet
: Sweets from the sweet
:  know someone sweeter
Lili blushes
19 Concealed behind the trees, Blix, Pox and Blunder watch the Green Man and the Princess wander down a meandering path
Pox picks a spider from his web, pops it in his mouth, and crunches it down with a happy smile
19A Several birds perch on Jack's head and shoulders
Squirrels, rabbits and hedgehogs play about his feet
Jack feeds them nuts and berries from his pouch, answering their chatter expertedly
Jack understands the language of all wild creatures
When a frisky wren flies warbling overhead, Lili hesitantly returns its call
: That was very good
just right
: Teach me rabbit like you promised
: Rabbit is much harder than wren
: Let me try
'm a very good student
My father thinks 'm brilliant
Lili toys with the silver madallion pendant she wears, causing reflected sunlight to shine in Jack's eyes
(cont): See how brilliant  am
(laughing): Stop it
can't see
: Don't  dazzle you with my wisdom
Lili seems to glow with sunlight
Jack stares at her, rapt with love
: Much more than wisdom dazzles me
Lili  and hangs her madallion around his neck
: Then teach me rabbit
: Not today
There's something really special promised to show you
(delighted): Oh, Jack
Do you mean it
: If it pleases you
: More than anything
: This is their season
They won't pass here again for a long, long time
If you want to see them, you must do everything  tell you
:  swear
on my honour
: 'm taking you to a very special place
it's sort of sacred
Nobody but me knows where it is, and, well
(impatient): What
Tell me
Jack unwraps the lace napkin from Lili's bouquet
: You'll have to wear a blindfold
(coyly): Don't you trust me, Jack
: 'll always trust you, Lili
20   , Jack holds Lili's hand, leading her blindfolded along a path through the woods
Distant thunder
: Storm's coming
: Who cares
Haven't you a cosy place to hide
: Many places
None fit for a princess
: In these woods you are the prince, Jack
am only a pauper here
Jack turns to face a radiantly smiling Lili
He bends towards her, closer and closer, and, for a moment, seems about to steal a kiss
She waits, smiling, sensing what is about to happen
In the end, Jack's innoncence and timidity get the best of him and he turns away
Without his knowledge Lili lifts a corner of the blindfold and mischievously peeks
20A The three goblin peer around a mossy trunk
: Yuck
Did you see what he was gonna do
Makes me want to puke
:  swear by all the bats above, Nothing's quite so foul as love
21 sun-glided amphithtre within the darker confines of the forest
Sparkling like a ribbon of diamonds, a stream flows down the middle
Jack leads Lili out of the woods and unties the napkin from around her eyes
(aewstruck): Oh, Jack
It's magic
21A Some time has passed
Lili is uncomfortable and restless
: How much longer
: Be patient
Lili kneels by the bank of the streem, cupping water into her hands
Jack stops her from drinking
: 'm thristy
Jack points at a huge viper moving sinously along the bank
: It's poisened the brook
No animal will drink here now
(indignant):  want some water
: Shhh
: Don't tell me to be quiet
'm a princess
Jack pulls Lili back into hiding
(very softly): Just watch
True royalty approaches
22    ( & ' ) The radiant    through the trees
moment later, a splendid white unicorn moves down the hillside to the edge of the stream
This is a stallion
He holds his head proudly
His mate stands at the edge of the woods
(): Ohh
They're so beautiful
The unicorn dips his horns into the stream
(): The alicorn purifies the water
The stallion watches his mare approach to drink
She is slighter and more delicate, but every inch as mignificent
(cont)(): There's no creature with more power or magic
As long as they roam the earth, evil cannot harm the pure of heart
23 The three goblins crouch hiding
(disgusted): Ugly one-horned mules
: Shhh
24 The Princess is entranced
: Such grace
Can you speak their language
:  little
it's very hard
Unicorns talk only of love and laughter
Dark thoughts are almost impossible for them to express
: Oh Jack
must touch one
(alarmed): No
:  want to
Jack restrains the Princess when she attempts to get up from hiding
: It is forbidden
These are sacred animals
: Nothing is forbidden me
: Don't ever say that
You risk your immortal soul
Lili pulls free and steps into the clearing
: You sound like my confessor
only want to touch one
The Princess strides defiantly into the open meadow
The unicorns watch the girl from across the stream
They snort and paw the ground
Lili stands alone, holding her arms to the unicorns
(singing): Like a child feels watching a rainbow
Like a brid feels the first time it flies feel magic stirring within me, When  look in my true love's eyes
The Stallion's nostrils flare
His strong neck arches
Sunlight gleams on his horn as he charges
From Lili's  the stallion is terrifying as he thunders towards her acroos the stream
The stallion rears and prances, racing around the Princess as if drawn foward on an invisable lead
Jack watches from the underbrush, his outrage tinged with more than a touch of jealously
25 Blix, Pox and Blunder peer from their hiding-place
Evil leers brighten their impish features
(whipering): -m-might as well be fish in a barrel
One would hope for a t-t-touch more sp-p-port
Blix clamps his hand over Pox's mouth
: Pox
Shut your yap
26 The lureof the virgin is too strong for the unicorn to resist
Lili makes no move as the trembling stallion stands before her, the rapier tip of his horn pressed against her breast
It is obvious he could kill her is an instant
The Princess calmly reaches out and caresses his muzzle
(singing): When the darkness falls like a curtain And the rivers and streams turn to ice, have summer and daylight forever When  look in my true love's eyes
Across the stream, the mare paces back and forth, obviously agitated
27 Blix pulls a long black flute from his quiver
He takes a dried hornet from a black snail-shell with a hinged lid and slips it into his flute, aiming the instrument like a blowgun
: Steady
take your time
Don't miss
Blix silences the foolish golbin with a ferocious scowl
His cheeks puff
There is a soft  of expelled breath
28 The poisened hornet sails the air and strikes the hornet on the haunch
Stung, the unicorn bolts through the clearing, disappearing into the undergrowth with the mare hard on his heels
The Princess stands be confused and bewildered
Distant  disturbs the tranquility
Jack rushes to Lili's side
: Oh, Jack, it was so lovely
like a dream
(angry): You're lucky it wasn't a nightmare
: Don't be such a scold
Come, 'll chase your fears away
The Princess takes Jack by the hand and leads him from the clearing
29   ( ) The unicorns plunge through brambles and fern clumps
Leaping a deadfall log, the stallion stumbles
He struggles to his feet and continues running
The three goblins gallop pell-mell on their devilish steeds
There is nothing comical about them now
30 Jack and Lili sit atop a high promontory jutting over a crystalline pond
: Sweet William did a-hunting go, In the wood where faeries dwell
From dawn to dusk roamed he to and fro, Lost,  lost, all under thier spell
31   ( ) The stallion stagger, his gait increasingly unstable as the poisen takes effect
The mare nuzzle his flank where the envenomed hornet struck
It is a virulent ound, red and swollen
The war-like  of the goblins grows even closer
The unicorns pause at a fork in the trail
The stallion motions with his head
Sadly, the mare compreheads and flees down the divergent path to safetly
The stallion stands his ground
When the three goblin hunters gallop towards him, he turns and limps into the woods
32 Jack lies beside Lili, listening raptly to her poem
(reciting): Came he at last to where bluebells grow, He heard them ring, 'tis true to tell
He lay him down and did not know The flower's sound was his own death knell
And while he slept came teh lady fair, And gathered him up behind her saddle
Now, all young hunters of bluebells beware Sweet William rode straight through the gate of Hell
Jack is lost in Lili's smile
: When  get to heaven,  know just how the angels will sound
(enjoying it): Do you flatter all the girls like that, Jack
(embaressed) It's the truth
Lili kisses Jack sweetly
He doesn't respond
(smiling): Are you afraid of my kiss
: 'm afraid you'll break my heart
: Then still your heart
You are dear to me as life itself
: Only because  amuse you
Like some trained bear
: That's not true
do love you, Jack
You must believe me
: And if  so
no good can come from it
am only a Green Man, without land or title
no name or wealth to bring you
The Princess her golden ring on and off her finger
: What does it matter
don't care about any of that
: But it does matter
If not now
Someday
What about when the time comes for you to marry
:  want to marry you
: That's impossible
: Not if it's what you really want, Jack
Lili shows Jack her ring
(cont): Don't you wish this was our wedding ring
: What if  say yes
Will my wish come true
: It is my right as a princess to set a challenge for my suitors
Lili throws her ring high over their heads
It glitters through the air, tumbling over and over in the long drop to the pond
(cont):  will marry whoever finds this ring
The ring spalshes into the cnetre of the pond
Jack strips off his leafy cloak and dives headlong from the cliff
33 Sweat-streaked, the unicorn staggers out of the tree onto a sweeping green meadow brilliant with pink bloosoms
Froth bubbles on his nostrils
His wide azure eyes betray his panic
The goblins ride onto the flower-bright meadow
They jump down from their mounts in a frenzy
(excited): We got him now
We got him now
The stallion stumbles forawrd, making a last futile effort to attack the goblins
Limbs leaden, head hanging, the noble animal settles against a sapling and slides to the ground
Thunder  overhead
wild wind whips the pink blossoms into the air
34 The golden ring drifts down, tumbling in a lazy spiral
Jack's pale form stabs through the crystal water
The distant glint of the sinking ring lures him on
The ring settles into the mud at the bottom, concealed by waving weeds
Jack searches blindly as clouds of silt billow about him
35 The three goblins advance towards the fallen unicorn through a pink blizzrd of wind blown blossoms
35A The black clouds boil and , thunderheads mounting one upon another in a dark maelstrom
36 The goblins stands around the fallen unicorn
Blunder turns away as Pox seizes the end of the alicorn, lifting it off the ground
Blix swings an evil battle-axe high up over his head
Jagged lightning splits the raging darkness as the black blade falls
Blix waves the severed alicorn in triumph
The whirling pink petals turn instantly into white snowflakes
37 Apolcalyptic winds  through the forest
Lightning
The world is plunged into winter darkness
Lili clings to a tree trunk
(in desparation): Jack
Help me
The Princess can't maintain her grip
The icy blasts knock her to the ground and she crawls to the cliff edge
(cont)(screaming): Jack
The her horror, Lili sees a skin of ice form over the surface of the pond
(cont) (sobbing): Oh, dear God
Jack
no
Fighting the raging winds, Lili stumbles to the pond and pounds on the ice in frustration
It is no use
(cont):
got to get help
Frantically, Lili runs off into the storm-whipped woods
38 Jack turns and looks up at the dark surface
He storkes upwards, only to bump his head into something solid at the top
The pond is covered by a sheet of ice
39 Jack's contorted face is seen through the ice
He breaks the frozen surface with his fist and his gasping head thrusts into the air
(shouting): Lili
His words are lost on the wind
40 Winter shrouds the tiny homestead
Immobile goats, chickens and ducks stand silent as snow statues in the farmyard
Lili runs from the frozen forest and stumbles up the cottage steps
41   () The Princess barges in, wild-eyed and distraught
Frost rimes the walls and furnishings
Everything glisten like sugar candy
The Woodcarver and his wife are frozen solid
: Nell
Arthur
Lili touches the wife's gelid cheek
: Nell
Oh, nooooo
Lili is shocked to discover the wife is frozen
The Princes throws herself sobbing across the bed
of  and  come from outside Lili scratches the frost off the window pane in the sleeping alcove
42 '  : The noisy goblins ride up on a makeshift sleigh of lashed animal bones
They stop outside and clamber out
Blix has the alicorn tucked under his arm
43 Terrified, Lili runs wildly across the cottage and clims the ladder to the loft
43A Barrels and chests are stored here
Cured bacon and hams hang from the rafters
Lili hides in a corner with several twig brooms and a butter churn
She wraps herself in an old quilt snatched from an open trunk
Snows blows in through a hole in the roof, covering the floor timbers
Three-inch gaps between the planks permit a view into the cottage interior
43B '  : The front door slams open and the goblins stumble laughing inside
: Mortal world turned to ice, Here be goblins' paradise
43C Blunder sinks his handaxe onto the kitchen table as he saunters past the frozen tarts
: Lots to eat
Pox runs forward to the cradle and seizes the frozen baby, baring his tusks for the feast
:  s-s-simply adore m-m-milk-fed meat
: What're you
Some kinda animal
Horrified, Lili  () in the loft
The goblins cock their ears to listen
Pox  and drops the baby back in the cradle
Curious, Blunder starts up the ladder to the loft, but changes his mind half-way, more interested in what Blix is doing
: Why eat cold
It's better hot
Blix points the alicorn at the frozen stewpot on the hearth
It begins to steam and bubble, magically boiling without a fire underneath
: Am-m-mazing
How did you d-d-d-do that, old, ch-ch-chap
Blix is equally surprised by the alicorn's power
He  and aims it at the clock on the mantle
The clock's hand spin wildly around backwards, the carved figures darting in and out at fives times their normal speed
Blix launches on an orgy of destruction, waving the alicorn like a magic wand
Plates shatter, the cradle rocks
furniture topples, Toby mugs come  alive, painted wooden toys dance and caper
The goblins  with impish joy
43D   () Lili watches the havoc through the gaps in the floor
Blix points the alicorn straight up
Snow flies wildly around the crouching Princess
The broom and the butter churn begin a mad dance across the crowded loft
It is all the Princess can do to keep from screaming
43E   () As a grand finale, Blix points at Nell's frozen figure, blowing her skirts above her waist
(languidly): -m-most amusing Blix
most terribly amusing
: This is sure our lucky day
Killed that ugly one-horn dead as a cowplop on a birthday cake
: Prattle, prattle like a priest
(pointing to himself) It was me who shoot the beast
: Without the p-p-princess for bait, you'd never gotten close
-b-beauty brought the b-b-beast to bay
: She's so sweet
could eat her brains like jam
43F   () Lili slumps against the wall, aghast at what she's just overheard
43G Blunder and Pox fill a sack with frozen tarts
: 'd like such her b-b-bones
Blix points the alicorn at the cottage door
It flies open with a : Better hurry
Can't be late
Blix marches out of the door
The other two goblins follow, darrging their sacks of tarts
: When we deliver that horn, Pox ol' buddy, Darkness gonna give us a humongous big reward
Blunder and Pox leave, slamming the door behind them
After a long pause, Lili creeps sobbing down the ladder from the loft
: Oh, God
God
The Princess stumbles across the cottage towards Nell
(cont) What have  done
didn't want the unicorn to die
All  did was touch it
Lili pleads with the frozen Wife, as if begging for her forgiveness
She is interrupted by the gruff voice of a House
(): You're a wicked, wicked girl
Lili looks up and sees a long-bearded Brownie standing next to the clock on the mantle
43H '  : : The world is in a fine mess because of you
43I '  : LILIbr (desperately) : 'll make it somehow
swear it
don't care what happens to me
43J '  : : Words
mere words
Bolds deeds be needed now
Look at you
Pampered and soft
Never done a day's work in your life
(): Who are you
: Me
'm the house brownie
keep dust devils under the bed and all the china cracked
You know how a watched pot never boils
do that
and 'm a wizard at turning sweet milk sour
The front door  loudly open
43K   () Little Blunder swaggers into the cottage
Lili covers her face with the quilt and holds herself rigid as if frozen
The Brownie ducks out of sight
Blunder stalks to the kitchen table and pulls his axefree
He does a double-take on spotting the Princess
The tiny goblin can't remember can't remember if he saw her earlier or not
He pokes her and lifts her skirt to peek at her legs
He is stopped short by Blix's angry  outside: (): Blunder
Move your butt
On the double
Blunder hurries to the door
Lili relaxes when she hears it
: Thank God
Lili looks up at the mantle
(cont) (sobbing): Can you
help me
437 '  : : Can  what
(): Help me
(sadly): 'd like to
but 'm a domestic sort of chap
no good at all where demons are concerned
43M '  : : Then 'll do it myself
'll follow those goblins
somehow
even if it costs my life
43N '  : :  like your spirit
There's always hope when a brave heart back a noble cause
but what chance have you
They have the alicorn
The power is theirs
43O '  : The Princess resolutely hurries about the cottage, gathering things to eat and other useful items
:  will do it
You'll see fooled them now, didn't
Well, 'll do it again easy as pie
Lili starts for the door
(): Wait
Take this
Lili turns back
43P '  : The Brownie pulls a golden feather from his cap and tosses it down to Lili
: 'Tis from the tail of the cockatrice
Make you as fleet as a running deer
And better, when things seem at their darkest, 'twill remind you always that hope is alive
43Q '  : The Princess tucks the feather into her bodice
: Thank you
Hope is just what need
Lili rushes from the cottage back into the snow
44   ( ) full-scale blizzard drives down through the naked tree limbs
Jack slogs forward, near frozen
(calling): Lili
Lili
Jack sees a tiny bird, frozen solid on a branch
He takes it tenderly down, trying to warm it with his breath
(cont): What's happened
Standing rigid all around him are numbers of frozen animals
He can do nothing for the bird and trudges on into the storm
(cont)(calling): Lili
Up ahead, the figure of a man is barely discernible
Jack runs to the man, thinking himself saved
Jack discovers the man is frozen, like the bird
His initial shock gives way to releif
The man is his salvation after all
Quickly, he unties the stranger's travel bags and cloak
(cont): God rest your soul
know you won't mind if  borrow your things
Jack wraps himself in the claok and finds a tinder box in the travel bag
He scrapes together a pile of twigs, striking sparks with the flint and steel to start them smouldering
45  :   46D 46 campfire blazes
Jack sleeps beside a tiny fire, shivering under his new cloak
tiny glowing  streaks out of the woods
It circles around Jack
The  touches the fire and it  up like a bonfire, waking Jack
: What
46A '  : Jack stares at the radiant buble hanging above him
He sees a tiny woman-child with delicate dragonfly wings trapped inside
This is (cont)(): Who're you
46B Luna  off into the treetops
Jack grabs a flaming brand and jumps to his feet
(cont): Who's there
Watching him through the drifting smoke in , an elf no more than the waist high
Slightly built, he is near-naked in spite of the cold
His face is that of a child, yet his eyes shine with a wisdom centuries old
(smiling mysteriously): Here you be a forest child and not know the Gump
: Gump, is it
: Aye, Jack
Honeythorn Gump at your service
The air is filled with frenzied  and : stones tapping, stick's rubbing, logs being thumped, etc
Numbers of green-glowing eyes stare at Jack out of the shadows
(frightened): How d'you know my name
: How does a migrating swallow know the way south in winter
Or a spawning salmon find the tiny freshet of his birth from the black cold depths of the mysterious sea
know everything, Jack
: Everything
Why has this happened
Why is it winter now
: 'd be a powerful wizard indeed could  answer
(shrewdly): Suppose you tell me , Jack
Jack in uncomfortable
: Me
How can  do that
: You know these woods as well as any elf
Did you not see something odd today
Any strange spirits
Did nothing untoward happen
: No
well
took Lili to see the unicorns
(furious): You did what
Numbers of elves and faeries appear out of the dark woods
They come in all sizes, from sprites no larger than squirrels to plump hobmen as big as small children
is a plump, tipsy leprechaun, draped with pots and pans like a tinker; , a tiny pixie wearing an ill-fitting cap and garments tassle with flowers
(whispering in chorus): What
Codfish and cockles
Never
Pewterpots and
pumpkins
Poo-poo pudding
Doo-doo dumplings
Shit-willy whatnot
: Silence
The whipering stops
All eyes are on Jack
He writhes with guilt under thier scrunity
(deepling ashamed): Oh God, she touched him
rises from the crowd of faeries
They are outraged
Gump is the maddest of all
His face darkens
His eyes glow
He trembles with banshee fury
: Touched it
mortal laid hands on a unicorn
: Bad
terrible bad
: We meant no wrong
(screaming): What was it you did mean, Jack
: Nothing
(cold and hard): Nothing, he calls it
:  wanted to share something special with her
: Well
have something now to share with you
a lively reel to warm your bones
Gump magically pulls a violen out of thin air
: 'm in no mood for dancing
(screaming with wrath): Squawk
Squawk
No more talk
Do you think you can upset the order of the universe and not pay the price
Brown Tom produces ancient bag pipes, Screwball a tambourine
The other wee folk tune up an incredible variety of oddly-shaped instryemnts : seashell trumpets, acorn cellos, gossets, serpentines, blossom-bell horns, bone flutes, all manner of drums and rattles
wild and haunting overture begins
The rhythm is complusive
Jack cannot control his body
His feet move against his will
(frantic): No
want no part of your nonsense
Gump leers demonically
: Time to dance, Jack
Playing his fiddle, Gump is possessed, demonic
Screwball beats on a log with a pair of shin bones
The faerie orchestra breaks into an other-world melody
Jack leaps and jumps like a zombie
: No
Please
(chanting): Round and round and round and round, Before you're lost, you must be found The tempo increases
The musicians leap and cavort
Jack twists and capers, dancing against his will
(chanting): In and out and up and down, Behind each smile there lurks a frown
Gump leaps wildly, fiddling like a demon
Jack is a prisoner of the frenzied music
(chanting): Spin and spin and spin and spin, To learn to lose you first must win
Gumps hops into the fire, dancing and playing as sparks leap about him
The music grows wilder
Jack will never survive
(chanting): Twist and reel and toe and heel, The end to pain is to learn to feel
Jack's face is a mask of agony
With supreme effort, he hurls himself onto the ground, his body jerking spasmodically to the music
(screaming):Enough
The faerie orchestra falters, their tempo broken
(angry): Is the music not to your liking
(gasping):
won't
go
on
Take my life, if you must
What  did is unforgiveable
(boldly) But,  did it for love
And 'd do it again
love Lili with all my heart and would sooner die than break a promise
Gump stares at Jack
tender expression softens his flinty eyes
: Hmmmm
Love, you say
Love is another story
:  meant no disrespect
: Answer me this riddle and all is forgiven
: And if  cannot
: Why, Jack
then 'tis your death song 'll be playing
: Ask away, and pray God my answer pleases you
: What is a bell that does not ring, Yet, its knell makes the angels sing
Gump laughs, knowing Jack can't solve his riddle
Jack frowns in concentration, then grins, as the memory of Lili's song rushes back
: Bluebells
: What
: The flower
Bluebells
To hear then ringing means your life is at an end
Gump hurls his violin to the ground and stomps on it
: Damnation
Codfish and cockles
Gammon and trotters
Screwball and Brown Tom run for cover as Gump explodes in an insane fury
He throws himself to the ground, kicking and
(cont): Rabbot noodles
Schweinhundt saukraut mit schlagober
Piddle-puddles und ka-ka crumpets
Piss pots and thunder mugs
Demkopf doo-doo brains riddle-widdler
Abruptly, Gump stands and dusts himself off as if nothing had happened
He smiles at Jack and holds out his tiny hand
(cont): You bested me, Jack
Bested me
bested me
(modestly):  riddle with an answer is like an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine
: Well spoke
And if it's wine you want, it's wine we shall have
Gump claps his hands and four tiny glasses magically , floating in the air before them
Another clap and Brown Tom's hat  off his head, revealing a wine bottle balanced underneath
(cont):  small measure of entertainment at best
Gumps snaps his fingers and the wine bottle floats off Brown Tom's head, pausing to in mid-air to fill each bobbing glass
(cont): Elderberry wine
no finer drink under heaven
Each one takes a glass
Gump raises his in a toast
(cont): Here's to Jack
riddle-solver
dancing fool, and faerie friend
They all clink glasses
Jack regards his with suspicion
: 'm honoured, Gump
But no more tricks
(to the others): Here be precious summertime frozen into a winter memory and the blamed fool won't drink faerie wine for fear of enchantment
They all drink, Jack with some relunctance
The faeries enjoy the wine
Jack gags, as if he's swallowed fire
(coughing): Pranks
Is that all you're good for
've lost Lili
Gump
Help me
Use your magic to find her
set the world right
: Changing this frozen hell is beyond my modest powers
: Is there nothing you can do
: If you want more tricks, 'm your man
but, for big questions, you must go elsewhere
: But don't you care what's happened
: Course we care
What good's the world locked in a season of death
No folks to scare on a summer's night
: No babies to tickle
: No lovers to tease
: No more spells to cast
Does that sound like an enjoyable prospect
: We must find the answer
: That we must
But first, we better see that no harm's come to the unicorns
:  sadly fear the worst
Gumps claps his hands and everyone is magically holding luminous flower lanterns
46C Seen from a distance, the lantern-lit faerie procession glows like foxfire between the massive trees
46D   (  ) Princess Lili tuns swiftly between the frozen trees, following the tracks of the goblins
The quilt is torn, her hair dishevelled
She pauses at the top of a small, steep hill
The tracks of the goblins' sleigh pass below
Lili jumps from the hilltop, leaving the quilt floating behind like a discarded skin
It is an incrediable leap
She lands with the sureness of a wild woodland creature and runs off, hair streaming behind, following the trail of the sled
47 The faerie procession moves out of the woods onto the frozen meadow
(singing together): What can you do when there's Nothing to be done
Sing a little song And have fun, fun, fun
The silhouette of the unicorn is glimpsed in the glow of the faerie lanterns
Led by Jack, the faeries run towards the recumbent stallion
Wisp stoops and picks up an arrow dropped by the goblins
: This is goblins' work
Powerful demons are agaisnt us
Jack kneels sadly beside the ice-glazed unicorn
The  of   alerts the faeries as the mare unicorn thunders out of the trees
: Take cover, laddies
The faeries dive for protection
Only Jack stands his ground
The mare charges straight at Jack
He is knocked to his knees as she gallops past
The unicorn wheels about
Jack scrambles to his feet
She charges again, skidding to a stop on the frozen grass
Her alicorn is aimed straight at Jack's throat
: Run, Jack
: The fault was mine
owe her my life
: Nobly spoken, lad, and nobility is her gift in return
The mare makes a soft  deep in her throat
It is a cross between whale song and the cooing of doves
Jack responds in kind, imitating the sound exactly
: What's he saying
What's it mean
(shrugging): Search me
speak some rabbit, but not a word of unicorn
The unicorn continues, a  as close to music as anything in nature
Jck listens intently and answers her
: Come on Jack, don't keep us in the dark
: The dark is where we'll stay
We're cursed
All warmth and light was lost when the stallion died
: Is there naught we can do
: We must get the alicorn back
Only then will the world return to normal
: And how do faeries fight a demon
: She says we're to find a champion
a mortal, bold of heart and pure in spirit
: Look
Look
Screwball points to the mare's hoofprints in the snow
Tiny wild flowers spring to life within each indentation
: That is the warmth of her soul
Not even death's icy hand can stop it
: Little good her soul'll do us now
: Screwball's right
Where we gonna find a champion when every mortal can swing a sword is froze stiff as an icicle
: Don't give up so quick, lads
(feeling Jack's arm) You sure you're mortal
(indignant): Course  am
(dubious): What sort of mortal speaks unicorn
: Why aren't you frozen then
:  don't know
was underwater
and when  came up for air, everything was covered with ice
: You'll do
We best get you some weapons
(puzzled): Weapons
What are they
(dubious): He's no champion, Gump
: We'll have to make him one
or kill him trying
Follow me
Gump leads Jack and the others into the woods
The unicorn follows
(singing together): What can you do when there's nothing to be done
Sing a little song And have fun, fun, fun
48 Lili creeps around the base of the tree, making no sound
She moves with the grace of an animal and hides behind a gnarled root where she can watch the goblins
Blix holds court, surrounded by a lantern's glow
Pox sits on a bit of crumbling masonary
Blunder watches Blix gesture with the alicorn
: Look at us
Waiting around like lackies
and for what
We're the ones with the power
: You shouldn't talk like, Blix
We gets in plenty big trouble
: 'm not afraid
Not even Darkness lasts forever
Blix aims the alicorn at Blunder, causing a burst of fire to erupt beneath the tiny, helmeted goblin
Blunder  and runs off, clutching his flaming backside
Blix roars with laughte
Power has gone completely to his head
(cont): Watch out, Pox
Blix points the alicorn at Pox
Fire explodes beneath the pig-faced goblin
He leaps  into the air
Blix points the alicorn at the fire he started and it grows larger
(cont): Higher
higher
Burning fire
Making music Like the choir
Blunder and Pox watch Blix make the fire fountain into the air
The heavens blaze
Lili is dazzled
Something very strange is happening within the swirling column of flame
Gradually, a demonic face emerges, Outlined in the fire we see the leering face of Darkness
Pox and Blunder applaud Blix's rebellion
/ (chanting): Higher
higher
Burning fire
Making music Like a choir
The three unsuspecting goblins looks up and see the demonic Lord of Darkness flaming above them
Blix tosses the alicorn into the air
Blunder unwittingly catches it
: Greetings, Worship
: -w-welcome, Great Lord
-d-darkest of the
: Your devotion disgusts me
You insignificant strands of toad slobber
Blix and Pox drop grovelling to their knees, covering their heads with leaves and dirt
Blunder can't control himself
He rushes forward and points the alicorn up at Darkness
: Hear me, you angels of light
Your reign is over
new order begins
All the imps of Hell will dance freely over this dark land
hold the power
: Enough
Darkness points a burning finger at Blunder
The alicorn is rippef from the goblin's graps and flies up to Darkness
Blunder  in terror
Something terrible happens: the ground around Blunder begins to soften
To his horror, the little goblin sinks under as if into quicksand
: Please
It was only a joke
didn't mean it
Honest
Blunder is in up to his neck
(cont): Whatsamatter
Have you no sense of humour
hope you choke of faerie breath and flower petals
Blunder's hand points up from the earth
Darkness  it, turning it to another chicken-claw
Blunder is gone without a trace; sucked under with a disgusting Darknesss  his triumph to the heavens
From her place of concealment, Lili overhears every word
: Did you think this alicorn a mere plaything
With it my empire is eternal
Before  ruled only the night
Now, my minions will frolic in darkness until the end of time
Darkness aims the alicorn at the column of fire started by Blix, tracing an arc of flames through the night
Like a mad orchestra conductot with a magic baton, Darkness controls the fire's movements
The blaze twists and swirls across the black night, blazing meteor trails, bright as the aeora
(fawning): Forgive this intrusion
My goblins are a free-spirited lot
like to encourage their
initiative
What do you think of this policy, Master
Columns of flame shower around the Dark Lord and from within thier incendiary interiors, evil wraith-like spirits emerge, swirling like ghosts
Bright as comets, numbers of etheral flaming spirits orbit their fiery master
Darkness stands in total control within their mighty conflagration, the alicorn his sceptre
Suddenly, with the pure clarity of a  , the presence of is detected
The reflected glow of the coming dawn tinges the ground and casts it luminence over Darkness and the goblins
(cont) (writhing): What is this light
Beams of rising sunlight advance down the tree trunks
Darkness recoils, wrapping his flaming cloak about him
(cont): You killed the final unicorn
Is this not true
Blix and Pox exchange guilty looks
: This is true
: Undeniably t-t-true, Lord
Darkness is on to them
He points with the alicorn
: You lie
Here is dawn
: Well
almost t-t-true
ess-s-sentially true
: That stallion is dead, dead as dreams, dead as legend
:
Sunlight is half-way to the ground
Darkness shrinks, shrivelling like a dying ember
: But
but
the m-m-mare still lives
: If even one unicorn walks the earth, my power is not complete
: Just a female
She has no power
The ground grows very light
Darkness melts into the campfire
: Only the power of creation
Get that female
command you
In the name of Darkness
Sunlight strikes the ground
Darkness is gone
His arm holding the alicorn aloft the fire is the last to disappear
Lili backs silently into the shadows surrrounding the Great Tree
49 Lili runs straight into a driving blizzard
distant  alerts her and she pauses to listen
It is Jack and the faeries,
Jack's voice carries above the others
&   (os): When times are hard and things look bad, Don't feel blue and don't feel sad
look of astonished joy comes over Lili's face
As the  of singing , she runs towards it, calling eagerly
: Jack
Ja-aack
50    ' Jack and the faeries troop march through the blizzard, all merrily
&   (singing): If your down, wearin' a frown, That's the time to dance like a clown
Jack hears something in the distance and stops to listen
(very faint) (os): Ja-aack
Ja-aack
(bewildered): Lili
The  of her distant call is erased by the howling storm
Jack sadly decides it was a trick of the wind and hurries to catch up with the others
51 Lili stops running
There is nothing but the wailing wind
(softly): Jack
Oh, Jack
solitary tear starts from her eyes, only to freeze on her cheek like a diamond beauty spot
(cont): Please God
help me
Lili drops sobbing to her knees
Through her grief, she sees the unicorn's track in the snow, each hoofprint gay with tiny blooming flowers
Her courage restored, Lili follows this meandering trail of burgeoning life through the forest
52    ' Gumps leads the way a huge  lodged uner the roots of a giant tree
(proudly): Here's my home, Jack
What d'you think of that for a front door
Jack thinks Gump is pulling his leg
(in jest): Be some job in getting it open
: Think you so
Gump
Immediately, two eyes blink open on the front of the boulder, and he is seen to have facial features
: Morning', Gump
The Boulder stands on a pair of tiny legs and waddles forth from under the tree roots,  the entrance to a cavern
He promptly trips and rolls over and over in the snows, his tiny stone feet kicking wildly in the air
(bowing): After you, Jack
Jack enters apprehensively udner the twisting roots
: Thank you
The other faeries follow, leading the unicorn
53 An earthern antechamber under the tree, high enough for Jack and the unicorn
There is a small wooden door at the far end, sealed with a bright brass padlock
: Brown Tom
Stay here with the unicorn and guard her well
: Like me own life
: Better than that
She's the last of her kind
Gump marches to the little wooden door
He inserts a finger into the padlock, twisting it like a key
Instantly, the pops apart
Gump opens the door and enters a low tunnel beyond
54 Tree roots twist down like dead men's fingers and clutch the ancient rune stones lodged in the earthen walls
Gump and Screwball walk upright in the damp tunnel, but Jack is forced to crawl on his hands and knees
Luna flies above thier heads like a tiny neon insect
: Right this way
Gump pauses by another wooden door, sealed with a brass lock
He opens it instantly with his magic touch
: Home, sweet home
55  ' Jack and the faeries enter a cost burrw furnished with carved wooden chairs and tables, a porcelain stove and bundles of herbs hanging from the ceiling
The simple furniture is overwhlemed by vat piles of treasure: gemstones, pearls, chests heaped with gold coins
: Fit for a king's ramsom
Jack in awe as he wades through the ankle-high loot
: Such riches
feel  must be dreaming
: If life is a dream, better you dread the waking
Screwball fills a golden helm with rubies and pours them out over his head
He laughs like a child in a sandpit
:
beautiful
: Mere trinkets
Let's find you something useful
Luna's golden  streaks down and whirls around Jack's head
He swats futilely at her
: Stop it
Go away
: Easy
Luna only seeks a little affection
Luna hovers beside Jack's cheek
:  meant no disrespect, but
ouch
Make her stop, will you, Gump
: Does your blood run so cold
You'll be a corpse before your time
Gump unstoppers a silver wine decanter and pours three goblets full
: What does she want from me
: Foolish question
(handing Jack a goblet) Drink, and wamr your heart
The answer's at the bottom of your cup
Jack sniffs his goblet suspiciously
This time, he is careful not to drink when the faeries do
(cont): Now then
down to business
Gump pulls a bejewlled broadsword free from its scabbard
It is a remarkably beautiful weapon
: What's this
Something to cook with
Gump and Screwball exchange a hopeless look
(patiently): This is a weapon, Jack
As fine a weapon as you'll ever see
(curious: So, that's a weapon
What's it do
: World is doomed, if you ask me
Screwball goes back to playing with the jewels
Gump pulls a silk handkerchief from his belt
:  little demonstration
Gump tosses the kerchief high in the air and it wafts slowly down
The little elf is an expert swordsman
He whirls the weapon in a gleaming blur, slicing the drifting handkerchief neatly in half
(cont): With such a blade you could behead an ogre as easily as uncapping a soft-boiled egg
: That's really something
Can try
Gump hands the sword to Jack
: You're the champion, aren't you
Jack picks up half the kerchief off the jewel-littered floor and tosses it into the air
As it flutters down, he swings wildly with the broadsword
Gump has to duck to avoid having his own head chopped off
(cont): Watch out
You'll get the hang of it in time
Now, we best see about some armour
Screwball
: Coming right up
Screwball flips open the lid of a chest
Folded inside is a golden chain-mail coat of exquisite workmanship
: Go on
see if it fits
Jack slips the coat over his head
It fits perfectly
(nodding approval): It will turn a broadhead arrow ar fifty yards
: He might pass for a champion in that
: Have a look at yourself, Jack
(pointing: Use yonder shield for a mirror
(confused):
Shield
(exasperated): The round shiny thing over there
: Clothes never made the man
Gump silences Screwball with a stern look and and stalks over to a small carved desk
There is a loud,
Gump pulls a remarkable instrument from a pouch on his belt: a wonderous crystal globe filled with whirling miniature worlds
(studying globe): Hmmm
getting late
Almost half- way past the morning mayfly hatch
(sullen): Too cold for mayflies now
'Sides,  ain't got no timepeice
: You first must know how to tell the time
:  ain't got nothing
: No more chatter
've got work to do
Gump sits at the desk setting his timepeice beside him and rummaging among his papers
Jack kneels before a brightly polished shield and studies his reflection
Luna round and round his head
: Think 'll brew some tea
Screwball snatches variosu herbs off the ceiling
(cont): Colt's foot and sassafrass
Maybe a spot of spearmint
St John's Wort not bad
and a little foxglove
Screwball feverishly stuffs a silver teapot full of dried herbs
56 57    ' The unicorn's flowering footprints lead Lili to Gump's cave
She pauses to consider the situation
Snowflakes glisten in her tangled hair
She is fiercly beautiful
Deciding nothing is amiss, Lili stalks silently inside
58 small cooking fire flickers under blackened pots and an iron skillet
The mare unicorn is bedded down on a blanket of straw
Brown Tom lies fast asleep against her flank
The unicorn lifts her head when Lili tiptoes in
Brown Tom is jerked awake as the mare climbs to her feet, snorting with rage
: What
What
Who's there
: 'm Princess Lili
: You
You're the cause of all our sorrow
The Princess drops to her knees
:  know it was wrong
Everything is my fault
(weeping) Please
please forgive me
:  ain't the one ye should be asking
:  want to make it up to her
followed the goblins
They gave the alicorn to the Lord of Darkness
: Good lass
You're a plucky little partridge at that
: We can't stay here
It's not safe
Darkness sent the goblins to hunt the mare
If  found her, so will they
We msut go
59 60 Brown Tom looks past Lili to the mouth of the cave
: Too late
Pox and Blix stand in the entrance, aiming their wicked, barbed arrows straight at the hearts of Lili and Brown Tom
Brown Tom swings an iron skillet back over his head in a warrior's stance
: If you imps're looking for a fight, ye've come to the chap who'll oblige ye
/: Kill
-k-kill
Kill
Blix and Pox loose their arrows, renocking the bows with incredible speed
Brown Tom moves like lightning, using the skillet as a shirld to deflect the arrows raining about him
Lili stands in front of the mare, striving to protect the unicorn's body with her own
Brown Tom lepas acrobatically about with the skillet
fusillade of arrows   its iron surface
lucky shot peirces Brown Tom's hat
Dark red liquid streams down his face
His eyes roll up in mortal terror
: Dick-o-Tuesday's duck
They've done for me
Brown Tom staggers in a dramatic half-circle, toppling straight over backwards, stiff as a board
The mare unicorn rears  on her hind-quarters
The goblin hunters advance
Blix spreads a heavy net wide
The black shadow on the net falls across Lili and the unicorn like an evil spider web
61  ' Screwball's teapot steams merrily
He sits stop a jewel cask enjoying a cup
horned Viking helmet several sizes too large covers his head down to the bridge of his nose
Gump works at his desk, marking out distances on an ancient chart with a pair of golden dividers
Dozens of parchment mps are spread in front of him
(muttering): Forty leagues from the Dragon's Track
another half-span past the basilisk den
Gump lifts his elbow and the curled parchment rolls together
(cont)(annoyed): Wirrikows and dopplegangers
: Spot of tea, Gump
Help calm your nerves
: Not now
'm busy with navigation
On the other side of the cave, Jack practices a variety of thrusts and passes with his sword in front of the polished shield
Luna buzzes around him like a miniature meteorite
: That's not so bad
What do you think, Luna
Jack studies his reflection in the shield
There is a    behind him
Luna materialises as a child- sized woman with gossamer wings
She wraps her slender arms around his neck
:  think you look like a hero
: What
'd you do that
Jack spins around, but Luna is gone
Only the tiny dot of hovers in the air
(cont) (puzzled): Magic
Jack looks back at the shield and there is a full-sized Luna hugging his reflection
: Nobody knows nut you
it's our secret
(kissing his cheek) Promise
(squirming): Don't do that
(another kiss): Better promise
: All right, all right
promise
loud,   interrupts Gump's work
he looks around for his timepiece but it is nowhere in sight
: Hmmmm
Screwball
(all innocence): Something  can do for you, Gump
: Hand it over
Sheepishly, Screwball pulls Gump's timepeice from inside his tunic and gives it back
: Well, well, well
how'd that get in there
Must be some kinda magic
: Sneak thief's magic
(studies timepiece) Jack
it's time we were on our way
At the  of Gump's voice, Luna  instantly back to a dot of light
: 'm ready as 'll ever be
Jack picks up the shield and starts after Gump and Screwball
Luna flies overhead
62 Brown Tom lies flat on his back as Jack and the faeries emerge from the tunnel
Gump rushes to his fallen friend, lifting him in his arms
: Brown Tom
You can't be dead
Oh, this is is terrible
terrible
Brown Tom opens his eyes and looks feebly about
(in a daze): Why, Wisp
they kill you, too
: Course they didn't
What in blazes are you talking about
Brown Tom rolls his eyes up at the arrow piercing his hat
: Goblins shot me through the brain pan
Gump yanks off Brown Tom's hat
Bits of broken wine bottle tumble out
Gump reagrds his friend with scorn
: Your brains are one spot an arrow'd do no harm
: Where's the unicorn
Sheepishly, Brown Tom pulls the arrow from his hat
: 'm afeered the goblins took her
Did me best to fight them off, but they swarmed up by the hundreds
Horrid creatures they were
The Princess warned me, but
: Princess Lili
: Aye
(overjoyed): She's alive
: She was living still when they killed me
: You'll earn your champion's spurs this day, Jack
We'll follow their tracks in the snow
Foul weather's on our side for a change
62A Jack and the faeries march through the woods holding lanterns, into the teeth of a driving blizzard
63 Blix and Pox kneel nervously before the Throne of Darkness
huge fire blazes in the hearth
: Hail m-most great, and d-d-darkest of the dark
: Though we be nothing in your sight, We bow before your strength and might
We hear Darkness speak, but see only his bat-winged shadow spread like an inky cloak across the two kneeling goblins
(os): Can you fawning sycophants do more than grovel
What of the task  set you
: -d-done, Lord
We have the m-m-m-m-m-m
the unicorn
(os): Where is she
: In the dungeon like a treasure, Awaiting your darkest pleasure
(os): Very good
You two are not entirely devoid of talent
: There's m-m-more, Sire
: Though unworthy of your magnificence, Trifles without consequence, We present with all due deference
gift
(os): Gift
What sort of gift
: This thing you once called innocence
(os): Innocence
must behold this wonder
Darkness stares into the fire
As Darkness grimps the arm of his throne, his fingers start to melt, dripping to the dank stone floor
64 Darkness bleeds through the groin vault ceiling, speading like a stain across the curving stones
Below, the unicorn is locked in a steel halter, a woven steel cable binding her to an iron windlass
The Princess paces the dark and dripping cell
Her dress is in tatters, her hair tangled
There is something wild and free about her now, and yet she has never appeared more alluring
The melting shadow of Darkness drips from the ceiling, forming a small demonic shape as it falls
We hear the  of Darkness' heart in time with each evil drip
The sound grows  and  until the echo reverberates within the vaulted chamber
Lili is terrified
She looks frantically around as the pulsing rhytm continues
The Princess sees nothing and hugs the unicorn's neck for comfort
64A Darkness contemplates the raging flames, his heartbeat
65 Jack and the faeries stare out at the tree-crowned ruin and surrounding bog
65A Jack and the faeries wade forward through the drifting curtains of mist
: Legend says the Dark Castle stood in olden days when evil anarchy ruled the land
The wicked still come here to sacrafice
: They worship the demon
: It's ugly
hate it
: Good
You shall go first
65B : Darkness
For the briefest instant, we see the smouldering eyes of the demon  in anitcipation out of the shadows
65C Although Jack is in no trouble, the water is rapidly growing too deep for the faeries
Gump urges Screwball forward: : Go on
Hurry up
: All the time me
Same old story
Screwball clibs up onto a floating lily pad
An undulating v-shaped wake moves through the water alongside as they step from lily pad to lily padf and clamber onto a long, twisting root
Without warning, an emaciated green arm shoors out of the water and grabs Screwball
He is gone under the surface with a scream
: Screwball
: What was that
: Big trouble
Jack grips the hilt of his sword and rushes to the spot where Screwball disappeared
: We've got to do something
Before Jack can finish, Meg Mucklebones rises out of the bog behind him
She tosses Screwball aside and hauls Jack into her cadaverous embrace
: Foul tasting faerie
Come to me, juicy boy
Jack  in horror
(cont): Who be this tender morsel disturbing Meg Mucklebones' rest
(terrified): They call me Green Jack ma'am
The faeries watch in dismay
: Our champion's a goner, he is
The fearsome hag pinches Jack with her wicked talons
: What a fine fat boy you are
: You don't mean to eat me, do you ma'am
: Oh, indeed  do
: That would be a shame, Miss Meg
You're so lovely
You deserve far better than scrawny little me
The flattery gives Hairy Meg a pause; she simply can't resist it
: Hmmmm
think me fair, do you, Jack
: All the heavenly angels must envy your beauty
: Ooooo
what a find meal you'll make, be the rest of you as sweet as your tongue
: Let me go and 'll sing songs of praise to you
: Let you go
Don't be daft
've had naught but muskrat and snakes all this month
bit of rancid goblin, too
: But
but
don't you like my words
: Words are little help in filling an empty stomach
: Then fill your soul with loveliness
Look into your glass and feast on beauty
: There's no looking-glass here
Sometimes, when the moon is full, 'll chance to see my reflection in the bog
Jack glances at the shield hanging over his shoulder
: My shield would serve you well
Meg Mucklebones takes Jack's shield, partially releasing him from her clammy clutches
: What a splendid idea
You be so clever, Jack
Hanging onto Jack with one hand, Hairy Meg bends over the shield
: Your radiance is the alchemy that makes rusted steel shine like silver
Meg primps and preens: an obscene parody of a pretty maiden at her vanity table
: Oooo
That's nice
be the envy of any princess in the land
While Meg is pre occupied with her grotesque reflection, Gump catches the Jack's eyes
The cunning elf silently mouths the word: 'sword', pointing to his waist at the same time
: Better, you are a queen without a peer
a reigning angel
Jack nods to Gump and silently draws his sword
Meg doesn't notice thing
: You have such discerning taste for so young a boy
Meg turns to face him with a fearful pucker of her tattered lips
(cont): Come, Jack
give us a kiss before dining
Jack petrified with fear
(shouting): Give her the kiss of cold steel, Jack
Jack swings blindly with his eyes closed
It is a lucky stroke, Meg Mucklebones' head flies from her shoulders
(astonished):  did it
The decapitated hag sinks back beneath the scummy surface
: Like a chmapion, Jack
: Bravo
: How's Screwball
: Chewed, but not disgested
Jack points his sword at the hollow tree
: Then on to victory
(all together): On to victory
65D huge fire blazes in the gaping hearth
Darkness stands before it, almost a shadow in his midnight cloak
: 've been an exile for too long
banished by the sun
forced to hide in the bowels of the earth
On the eve of my greatest victory, this
child of nature appears
It has been an eternity since  felt such desire
could know her in an instant
She is helpless
and yet
(anguished) What is wrong with me, Father
answers Darkness; majestic and sepulrchral; the flames billow out as it speaks: : You hold the world in your grasp
Supreme power belongs to you
yet your triumph is meaningless
: Meaningless
: What do you gain from it
What pleasure comes from ruling a pack of imps and goblins
Souls already black
This innocent creature fascinates you because only she can appreciate the enormity of your achievement
: 'll take her then
:  hollow victory
She remembers the world as it was, when she loves your new order you will triumph
Woo her
win her
break her spirit
: Thank you, Father
Your wisdom is ever my guide
: Remember
She must desire you
nothing else matters
65E Jack and the faeries step ashore on the island
Gump makes a mystical sign with his hands
: What's that
: For our protection, Jack
You must be ready
Remember, Darkness is a liar
a treacherous fiend
Don't listen to him
Never believe what you see
: He won't fool me
: Don't be so sure
No human has ever set foot in this place before
66 Jack and the faeries stare up at the massive horn embedded in the inner tree
Screwball starts to climb towards it
: What a nice big trumpet
Bet it sounds louder than anything
Gump hauls him back down by the seat of his pants
: Don't touch it
Our lives are lost if it blows
Jack finds an opening hidden between the roots of the inner tree
: In here
've found a passage
Jack drops inside
66A The moment Jack enters the inner tree, a deep  reverberates through the subterranean Castle of Darkness
Draped in shadows before the fire, the Dark Lord looks up at this disturbance
(to the fire):  feel a presence
Some power invades my sanctity
(from the flames): Every wolf suffers fleas
'tis easy enough to scratch
The flames surge out towards Darkness, embracing him
67 Like the catacombs of Paris, the walls are decorated with bones and human skulls
At each corner of the open ceiling is a carved demonic head
Jack and the faeries stand looking up
(gloomily): The decor of death
: Tells you somthing 'bout him what lives here
: It's a dead end
Jack searches along the ossuary walls
: Doesn't make sense
Check the walls
There must be some sort of secret key
Screwball doesn't join the other faeries in the search
He is attracted by several round stone balls lying in the rubble
Picking up three with a happy grin, he begins to juggle
: One-two-three
fidde-dee-dee
Gump sees what Screwball is doing and flies into a rage
: Screwball
Drop those this minute
Screwball tosses the balls carelessly over his shoulder
One lands in the stone cornice near the ceiling and rolls along, gathering momentum as it passes through the open mouths of each gargoyle
The balls disappears into the mouth of the final gargoyle
It is swallowed with an emphatic
All at once, the roof slides shut above
(alarmed): Newt-finger marmalade
The floor pulls suddenly open and they all plummet  into empty space
Luna circles, a dot of light above tthe bottomless pit
(wee voice): Oh, dear
Oh, dear
The tiny faerie whirls in a blur of indecision before streaking down into the dark opening after her falling friends
68 Like prisoners on a fairground helter-skelter, Jack and the faeries spin down a seemingly endless curvinbg chute
(singing): When times're hard and thing look bad, Don't feel blue and don't feel sad
: How can you sing at a time like this
: Can you think of anything better to do
They hurtle through festooned cobwebs, stirring up smokey clouds of ancient dust
69 The end of the chute opens into an iron cage
Jack and the faeries tumble through onto a pile of straw
Luna is right behind, bright as a firefly
: Ouch
Ow
: Where are we
Gump stares woefully at the iron bars
: Some place we don't want to be
scuffling  in the far side of the cage attracts their attention
Blunder pops up from a pile of straw, still wearing his helmet
: Shhhh
What is this
chatterbox convention
: Who be you, bucket-head
: Stay clear of that imp
He's a hell hound goblin
: What  am won't help me none, nor you neither
Blunder pulls off his helmet
He is Screwball's indenical twin
(cont):
even if you is my brother
Screwball can't believe his eyes
(astonished) Blunder
: Screwball
They rush into each other's arms
(to Jack):  Buttercup family reunion
can't believe it
Last  remember, he sold Screwball a jug of dragon's tears that turned out to be cow piss
: What happened to you
(flexing his bird claw): It's a long story
Let's just say  went look for adventure and found more'n  could handle
Doesn't matter now anyway
We're all of us in the same fix
: Just what sort of fix is that
: The kitchen of the Lord of Darkness
All of us be on his menu
:  knew it
knew it
Should of stayed at home
: That's right, brother, me'n you is barbeque
: Wish  had a drink
: Only dead meat waits for the stewpot
Spring the lock, Gump
Gump examines the huge padlock with a frown
(wearily): Iron is sore trouble for elves
: Magic's no good against it
Jack slumps down in the corner to think things over
The faeries mill about by the opposite wall
Jack stares at the bars
Luna orbits his head
:  know  promised
but it's the only way
Luna buzzes him furiously
(cont): Sure it's a secret
It'll keep forever when we're all dead
Jack glances guiltily at the whirling dot of
(cont) (to Gump): Why not have Luna fly out between the bars and find a key
(shaking his head): She's much too small
could never lift it
(blurting it out): Not if she changes sizes like she can
: What
There is a bright  of faerie-light and Luna stands full-sized before them, her gossamer wings a-tremble
(cont)(outraged): You wilful sprite
How dare you keep such secrets
: They're mine to keep
But 'll do what you ask
if you kiss me, Jack
: That's easy enough
Jack kisses her chastely on the cheek
: Call that a kiss
Am  not sweet
(eager to please): Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind
Luna moves in close to Jack
: Sweet is the wind thats blows me to you
Jack gently pushes her away
: It's not possible
'm in love
:  faerie's love makes anything possible
soft cocoom of faerie  engulfs Luna
She metamorphoses within it, emerging as Princess Lili
/:
even you heart's desire
Luna/Lili embraces Jack
It is sweet and tempting
(resisting): No
this isn't real
Screwball and Blunder giggle and snigger
/: Oh, but it is
'm warm and alive and happy to be in your arms
Jack is nearly enchanted, but after a delicious moment, he pushes away
:  can't do it
This is faerie glamour
brilliant aura of faerie  envelops Luna/Lili and she into her true winged-form (bitterly): You
You
mortal could vex you
Dance you life away
: Threats can't make you love you
Human hearts don't work that way
: What care  for human heart
Soft and spiritless as porridge
faerie's heart beats fierce and free
There is a furious pytotechnic whirlwind and, in an instant, Luna returns to a tiny dot of
: Luna
Without an answer, Luna flies out between the iron bars
(cont) (to the faeries):
didn't mean to hurt her
(scornful): Your fine senseibilities have left us here to rot
The  of heavy footsteps approaches, accompanied by rough, tuneless
(os):
this li'l piggie went to market
anudder li'l pigge got eat
pig-meat pie, l'l piggie die
: Oh, no
He's coming
Hide
Hide
Hide
Blunder conceals himself under a pile of straw
deformed shadow is cast across the cage
: Blunder's got the right idea
Screwball hides in the straw
Jack and the other immediately do the same
fiendish demon  opens the cage door
He is ten feet tall and unspeakably ugly
He peers blindly inside, sniffing the air with his hideous nose
:
pig-pig-pig
The Cook gropes inside the cage
The Cook reaches deep into the straw pile in teh corner and grabs Blunder
: Help
Lemme go
Turn me loose, you tub o' guts
The cook hauls Blunder out, kicking and screaming
He locks the cage abd stumps away
(cont):  hope  give you heart-burn
After a bit, the faeries and Jack peer up out of the straw
(woefully): Fricasseed faeries, the lot of us
: Lambs to the slaughter
Jack draws his sword
: Not without a fight
Transformed back to full-size, Luna tip-toes into the alcove outside the cage, her hands coyly behind her
: Luna
(maliciously): You look like mourners at your own funeral
(angry): Come back to dance on our graves
: 'd gladly frolic on Jack's
She  and holds up a large iron key
(cont):
but this cage shan't be your tomb
Luna tosses the key in to Gump
Instantly, she reduces to a tiny dot of  and flies out of the alcove
: Well done
Gump unlocks the barred door and they all clamber out
Screwball steps on Brown Tom's head in his eagerness
: Lemme outta this stink hole
: Mind you bleeding foot
: Shhhh
Jack is the last of all
: Keep behind me in case there's trouble
Sword in hand, Jack ;eads the faeries out of the alcove into the kitchen
70 Huge ovens belch fire and smoke
The vast hearth blazes
Like the lower reaches of Hell, the Dark Lord's kitchen is a place where all hope is abandoned
Jack and the faeries creep through the brimstone haze
: Terrible sight for a sober man to see
: Quiet
The demon Cooks blocks the way, chopping meat with a montrous cleaver,   , every bit as terrifying,  by the hearth
Trussed to a spit, Blunder hangs upside-down nearby
Jack motions the faeries on
The blind Cook turns them, sniffing the air
: Whut be there
Jack and the faeries duck behind a huge bellows
:
Back in the frying pan
Gump clamps his hand over Screwball's mouth
Grasping his cleaver, the Cook advances towards them
(sniffing): Be it live victuals
From where he hangs, Blunder sees the faeries' plight
(calling out): Hey
Lard belly
The Cook turns, angered by this insult
: Whut say, pip-squeak
: Two things down here look just alike
: Wuzzat
: Your face and my ass
The Cook  with fury
: Bash in you face
Den it no be so pretty
The Cook backhands poor Blunder, smacking him about like a punching bag
Jack and the faeries make a break for the exit
Blunder manages to work one arm free from his bonds
(cont): Whut you got to say now, pork pie
Blunder rears back and punches the Cook in the jaw
Stunned, he topples over over backwards a great
70A The reverberations tremble through the immense underground castle
Darkness listens by the fire
: Do you feel it, Father
force
loose in my domain
(out of fire): Guard well what is yours
(roaring):
71 The faerie band gathers in the foul, dripping corridor
Irregular torchlight casts a lurid glow across the broken stones
(gasping for breath): saved
by a goblin
Never thought
'd see
the day
: Wish we could repay the favour
: My brother can take of himself
: Screwball's right
It's more important we find the unicorn
: And Lili
: Where do we start
: We must find the dungeons
Legend has is they house such sirriw that death is a gift
albeit one rarely granted
Screwball sits down defiantly
: Think 'll stay right here thank you very much
Gump grabs hold of Screwball's ear and hauls him back up
: Not so fast
You search with the rest of us
Screwball hugs Jack's leg
: All right
'm going with Jack
: No you won't
Be faster if we split up
Screwball looks both ways, deciding which seems safest
: Fine
'm going this way
: 'm going that way
They both turn and collide, falling flat on their rumps
: Wait
Better to search in teams, Gump and me together
Brown TOm, you and Screwball look in the other direction
Gump hauls out his ornate timepeice
: Right
Let's synchronise
We meet back here in twice five hundred beats of a bluebird's heart
Brown Tom takes a similar timepeice from under his tunic and studies its intricate interior
: Best to allow another couple dozen butterfly breaths in case we get thirs
er, get lost
: No grog shops down here, Brown Tom
: Let's hurry
Jack and Gump run off along the corridor, followed by Luna's glowing Screwball watches without moving
: Know what  want to know
: What
: Why me
Brown Tom gives Screwball a swift kick in his rear
: Why not
The two little elves scamaper off together
:  hate it
hate it
hate it
72 The iron-studded dungeon days swing magically open as Lili watches, her eyes aglow with animal fire
She crouches beside the unicorn, resting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion
Lili rises like a sleepwalker, unable to resist the compulsion luring her toward the open doorway
The chained unicorn  pitifully
Princess Lili looks back without expression as she leaves
73 74 75 Luna's bobbing  leads the way as Jack and Gump hurry along the rubble-choked corridor
Alerted by the  of something, they dart into the shadows
: Quick, Jack
Jack and Gump watch in horror as a cracked  the size of a watermelon runs down the corridor on armor-scaled chicken legs, led on either side by a Demon holding a chain leash
Jack draws his sword
The Demons stop and the Egg begins to crack
: 'll scramble that one
Gump restrains him
The Egg cracks apart
: Don't trust your eyes
All is enchanted here
The Egg breaks into pieces and a dripping winged monster emerges; a diabolic cross between a bat and a pterodactyl
It emits a fearsome and flies off down the corridor followed by the twin attendant Demons
Jack and Gump hurry on in the opposite direction
75A Screwball and Brown Tom creep timorously forward
They are alerted by the  of something approaching
hideously deformed shadow fall across the opposite wall
The two faeries clutch each other in terror and duck into the shadows
It is Princess Lili
She passes the evles' hiding place as if in a trance
76 Jack and Gump emerge on a narrow span arching across the vast central of the undreground castle
Similiar viaducts, above and below, bridge the awesome chasm
The Green Man and the faerie gawk at the sheer magnitude of it all
: Not even kings live like this
On a high span above, Jack sees Princess Lili drifting by like a somnabulist
(cont): My God
Gump, look
It's Lili
: Don't believe it, Jack
(yelling): Lili
The   through the vast space
77  ' The Princess pauses
section of parapet has broken off and she wanders to the edge, staring down into the void
For a precarious moment, she teeters on the brink, seemingly about to fall
(os) (calling): Li-li
The Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow edge of disaster
She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug chunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss
(cont) (os) (calling): It's Ja-ack
Lili's face is blank
She turns and continues blindly on her way
78 Jack stares up at Lili's retreating form
: It's her
know it
: Don't be so hasty
Remember who we're dealing with
: 've got to reach her
Jack races off
Gump runs along behind
78A The shadowy figure of Darkness looms over a band of deformed with needle-sharp teeth and wickedly curved talons long as pitchfork tines
: My enemies approach
destory them
Darkness points an evil finger and the Pygmies scurry  off
79 80  ' Jack and Gump hurry out onto the arching span
The Princess is nowhere in sight
(running after): Slow down
Use some caution
: This way
Jack runs on into the corridor in the direction taken by Lili
Gump follows after
81 Lili wanders down a long colonnade with dangling vine-like roots glistening magic rain falls from the granite ceiling
Her blank eyes stare straight ahead
Jack and Gump appear at the opposite end of the passage in time to see the Princess drift out of sight
: There she is
Lili
Jack and Gump run to catch up, pushing through root tendrils agleam with rain
Suddenly, they are attacked by  Pygmies
: Jack
(drawing his sword): Demons
The nimble Pygmies leap about them, lethal talons slashing through the drizzle
Jack and Gump retreat, backing between clingling rootlets
: Quick
In here
Gump yanks open a heavy oaken door in the side wall and they duck inside, slamming it shut in the teeth of the attacking Pygmies
81A Jack strains against the door handle, struggling to keep the portal shut tight
There is less space than in a closet
The corridor behind them is completely bricked over
: Trapped
: With great force, the Pygmies' claws stab through the thick wood like stiletties
Their needle tips are mere inches from Jack and Gump
The door's inner surface is studded with talons
Jack suddenly the door open with such force it swings into the side wall with a loud
The Pygmies' frenzied  ends in abrupt
Jack and Gump peer cautiously out
81B The Pymies hang unconscious on the other side of the door, dangling from their imbedded talons
: Come on
Jack and Gump run into the rain
82 Jack and Gump hurry around the corner just as Lili heads towards a pair of massive doors swinging slowly open at her approach
(calling): Lili
Wait
Gump grabs Jack's arm and yanks him to a stop
: Don't be daft
She's under a spell
Lili enters and the doors swing closed behind her
83 An enormous chamber draped with black cloth surrounded by tall Baroque columns
Winged demons writhe in the shadows above
long black table reaches down the centre of the room
All is lit by firelight
The gaping hearth, with its entablature of monumental sculpture, is flanked by a pair of massive ebony thrones, carved in a hideous, twisting mass of tendons, sinews and museles
When the imposing doors swing closed, Lili's spell is broken
She stares in terror at her news surroundings
Something weird and mysterious approaches from out of the draped shadows
It is a magnificent high-collared black gown, waltzing like a ghost across the black marble floor
There is no one wearing the garment
Fascinated, Lili watches the dress circle towards her
She finds it irresistable
Taking hold of the gown's empty sleeves she begins to dance, spinning round and round to the impulsive music
84 Jack paces back and forth in front of the sealed doors
: Why did you stop me
: We best reconnoitre
What if it's a trap
Gump and Jack strain to see through the crack between the doors
85 Lili dances by herself, turning slow dreamy circles before the blazing fire
She is now  the splendid black gown
Reflected firelight  in the shadows
An open jewel box spills its sparkling treasure onto an ornate table
Lili is lure like a moth to the flame
She steps up onto an oversized footstool by the table
The ebony casket brims with gemstones
Lili's eyes dazzle
carved ebony figure of a skeleton turns slowly out of the centre, holding in its up lifted arms the most exquisite black diamond necklace the mind can imagine
The Princess sucks in her breath
The temptation is too great
She impulsively takes the necklace and hops down from the stool
The high collar of her gown makes fastening the clasp difficult and without thinking, she backs towards the wall, fumbling behind her neck
She leans against a sculpted marble frieze of souls in torment, concentrating on the tricky clasp
All at once, a piece of sculpture becomes
Powerful arms reach out to fasten the necklace
For a moment Lili doesn't notice, grateful for the help
Then, she realises what is happening and
The musular black arms reach for her as she pulls away in terror
Lili turns to run, but is stopped short by her reflection in a tall cheval glass mirror
She looks furtively about, making certain she is unobserved
Alone, she admires her perfect image
: Beneath Lili's pleased expression we see the evil face of Darkness  like a man emerging from under water
Darkness penetrates the surface of the mirror
Lili backs away,  soundlessly with terror
Darkness steps forth through the glass into the room, clad in black finery
Lili staggers
Darkness reaches to embrace her and the Princess at the top of her lungs
The moment he touches her shoulder, she slumps tothe floor, unconscious
Darkness stands over the fallen girl, his heartbeat pulsing like muffled thunder
Something almost like a smile creases his hideous features as he rolls a lock of Lili's hair between his clawed fingers
The Princess blinks and opens her eyes
She is horrified to find Darkness kneeling over her and frantically tries to get away
: Do not be afraid, lady
Lili  like a stranded fish
She is catatonic with fear
(cont):  mean you no harm
Darkness offers the Princess his hand
(cont): How like you my gifts
Does the gown not please you
Come
tell me
Lili's terror renders her speechless
(cont): The colour is most suitable
We sanctify the death of the old world and the birth of a new order
You are the guest of honour
Lili  and tugs at the black dress
:
of dishonour
Take this away
Please
beg you
Darkness advances on Lili
The slow kettldrum  of his heart underscores his words
: Your soul in like some dark nectar
cannot rest unril  taste its sweetness
(frantic): Never
hate you
hate this dress
: Can you speak so of your bridal gown
(screaming): Nooooooooo
86 Jack and Gump listen by the closed doors to Lili's peircing scream ()
Jack is desparate and half-draws his sword from the scabbard
: What has he done to her
Gump restrains the boy
: You have no power to stop it
Be thankful she lives
Jack shoves his sword back in disgust
(bitterly): Some champion
What good is this fancy sword
: It's not the sword that counts, but the man who swings it
87 Lili slumps to the cold stone floor,
Darkness bends solicitously over her
: Why the tears
(sobbing):
everything is lost
poor Jack
: Why weep for him
He left you alone to die
: No
He'd never do that
He was killed
like everything else
(glancing over his shoulder): Yes
But why mourn
You have a new and grander destiny
: Consort of some cowardly vile toad who slinks through the night
: Not so
requite to shadow's solace and dark of the night
Sunshine is my destroyer
(scornful): You think you're so powerful
and hide in the ground like a mole
(smiling): This too will change
The last unicorn dies tonight
As her blood ebbs, the sun sets forever
There shall never be another dawn
(horrified): No
You can't
You mustn't
Darkness throws back his evil head and
88 The demonic  of Darkness carries through the massive doors
: He means to kill the mare, Gump
: Don't mourn the corpse 'til the coffin's in the ground
(): My dominion shall encompass the enternal night
: As long as the sun still shines, so does hope
(bitterly: Sun doesn't shine down here
Jack fingers Lili's silver medallion hanging around his neck and from out of the blue, inspiration strikes
(cont) (grinning): Wait a minute think  know a way
89 Lili stares at Darkness with terror and loathing
: The world shall be at last as nature intended
a place of chaos and anarchy
: You're mad
: Aye, Lady, and proud to be so
For in madness lies the soul of all that's noble
Can you fathom the loneliness of untold eons lived in darkness
My spirit was forged in that black fire
: You live alone because you are loathsome
The contagion of your wicked heart demands isolation
: Nay, mistress
've found my mate and you know it
We're just alike, you and
Beneath the skin we are already one
: Never
: 'Twas your sin trapped the unicorn
Even now, the evil seed of what you've done blooms within you
(shrieking): You lie
You're repulsive
(stung by her words): No more so than you
Can't you sense it
That is why  desire you
need someone to share the dark secrets of my soul
: You
You disgust me
You're nothing but a beast
: Everyone is a beast
only most are afraid to see it
Darkness compels Lili over to the mirror with the force of his will
90 '  : Lili sees her reflection in the glass
The lovely feminine features  into those of a cat-like beast
(os): This mirror shows how we really are
Behold your true reflection
91 Lili pulls free from his graps and turns from the glass
Her face remains lovely and unchanged
(frantic): No
You're working magic on me
won't believe it
: My Lady misjudges me
am no common trickster
look at you hands
Lili's fingers transform before her eyes: hooked claws spring from their tips, coarse black hair pushes the skin
(cont) (Laughing): My mirror never lies
Lili's lovely face undergoes the same tranmutation she witnessed in the mirror
She feels fur-covered sheeks and pointed ears
This time, her  is hysterical
Darkness places a protective arm around Lili
(cont): Glory in your animal nature
It is your triumph
: 'm hideous
: No
The puling, pallid creature you were was truly something disgusting
Now you are magificent
a fierce goddess
Lili jerks away,  and showing her claws
: Damn you
: We are both of us damned, my Queen
Darkness bows with mock formality,  into his own shadows, which slides through a crack in the paving stones
Lili cannot resist her reflection
Horrified anew
she falls to the floor,
91A Round and red, the great disc of the setting sun slides towards the distant horizon
92 Crazed by anxiety, Jack finds the keyhole and cups his hands around it
(calling out): Lili
Can you hear me
93 Lili huddles  on the cold stones
(os):
Lili
At the sound of Jack's voice, the Princess looks up with a start
:
Jack
(os): Over here
By the door
Lili turns eagerly turns to the door
: Oh, Jack
dear Jack
Can it really be you
was afraid you were dead
93A : Thank God you're all right
didn't know what to do
never want to lose you again
93B Lili pauses before the keyhole, out of Jack's line of sight
: Jack, my love
my precious love
pray it's you and not more wicked magic
93C : It's me, you can be sure of that
and there's magic on our side, too
93D : It's all my fault
the unicorn
everything
(os): My fault as much as yours
Don't worry
We're here to save you
(sadly): 'm far past saving, sweet Jack
huge tears wells in Lili's eye and flies out toward the keyhole, defying gravity
94 Lili's tear flies through the keyhole and strikes Jack's face like a horizontal raindrop
He touches the spot curiously
(amazed): How did you do that
(to Gump):  didn't do anything
(into keyhole) let me see your face
It will give me hope
Jack strains to see through the keyhole
95 Lili stares at the keyhole in horror
(os):
just to glimpse your smile
(grief-stricken): No
can't
forget me, Jack
The Princess reaches out her animal's paw and covers the keyhole
96 As the  in the opening grows , Jack tenderly places his hand next to Lili's
: Lili
love you
Gump pulls frantically on Jack's arm
: Come, Jack
We've no time to spare
Remember your plan
Sadly, Jack takes his hand from the keyhole and follows Gump back along the corridor
97 Princess Lili lies
High above, the winged figures watch her
The music , underscoring a low, rhythmic
Like some ghastly chorus fro, Hell, the living statuary sings in unison to Lili: (singing): Bride of Night
Bride of Night
Darkness is your heart's delight
Hail to Darkness
Hail the Night
His the Power and the Might
Master of Chaos, Lord of Doom, Sing his praises from the tomb
Lili lifts her head, listening to the sepulchral
Her eyes burn like a tiger's
She bares her fangs, and from her throat issues a bone-chilling
98 Screwball and Brown Tom stop short in their tracks when they hear the  of a distant  echoes in the shadows
(trembling):  vote we run like hell
The two faeries scamper off into darkness
99 Gump, Jack and a woman-sized Luna wait outside the kitchen door as Brown Tom and Screwball come running up
Gump studies his ornate timepiece
: Where were you
In another three flicks of a badger's tail it'll be half-past
: Sorry
time slips away when you're having so much fun
(out of breath): We
found the mare chained
in the dungeon below
Gump shoves his timepiece back in his belt
: Excellant
Who has a bit of parchment
The two faeries search in their clothing
Screwball produces a plethora of trash: marbles, string, old doll's eyes, coloured bird's eggs, ancient coins, etc
At last he finds a crumbled peice of sheepskin
: Here
was saving it to write me will on
: Where there's a will there's a
: Shush, both of you
Jack has a plan
a good one
Gump squats on the floor, and, using a triangle and some charcoal, divides the parchment into mysterious lines and angles
(mumbling):
angle of refraction equals
angle of incidence
multiplied by a factor of fourty
divided by the square root of a google-plex
Gump  his fingers triumphantly
(cont): Perfect
It will work like a charm, Jack
: Let's get started
What we need to do is sneak back into the kitchen and gather all the plates and platters
: Oh no
Not me
Seen enough of that kitchen,  have
: Don't be so pig-headed
You can trust Gump
: 'd sooner trust a rat in the ghetto
: Well
trust Jack then
Jack eases open the kitchen door
: Remember
just the shiny ones
Jack leads the way back into the kitcheb
Gump urges the other two to follow
:
and be quiet
Soft as thistledown, that's the faerie way
100 Jack and the faeries tiptoe cautiosuly into the kitchen
Both Demon Cooks are asleep, the encountered first is stretched out across his chopping block,  like a dragon with indisgestion
The unfortunate Blunder turns slowly over the coals, hog-tied to a spit
bright red apple is stuffed in his mouth
Jack and Gump rush to his side
Gump pulls the apple from Blunder's mouth
(frantic): Get me outta here
Please
While 'm still medium rare
: Quiet
You're a free imp on one condition
(very loud): Condition
What condition
Loose me or 'll make such
Gump shoves the apple back into Blunder's mouth, stoppering his loud complaint
: Any more noise and you're shish-ka-bob
Blunder nods eagerly
(cont): You do what we tell you
understand
More eager nodding from Blunder
(cont): Swear it
Gump pulls the apple out of Blunder's mouth
:  swear
On the festering forelock of Nicodemus
Jack cuts Blunder's bonds and the little imp hops nibmly out of the fireplace
:  thousand thanks
Jack boosts Gump and Screwball up onto the mantle where the polished plates are stacked
: Up we go
Luna  into a dot of  and flies up to the cimnet pieces,  there in her full size
(cont): Your turn, Blunder
Jack lifts Blunder onto his shoulds so he can climb to the first level of the three-tiered mantle
Blunder joins Screwball, Gump and Luna as they rush about the mantlepiece, frantically gathering shield-sized plates
One by one, the faeries toss the plates down to Jack, who stacks them in Brown Tom's arms
Brown Tom staggers through the kitchen carrying a teetering tower of plates
He can't see where he is going and trips over the nozzle of the giant bellows
The plates fall with a deafening
Both ferocious blind Cooks are awakened by the
: Huh
Wuzzat
Jack and the faeries freeze in place as the Cook rises and pulls his huge cleaver from the chopping block
(sniffing the air): Meat
Me smells fresh meat
Jack draws his sword and steps between the awesome Cook and Brown Tom, sprawled helplessly on the floor
: Find meat
: Over here
The blind cook lunges for Jack
He wields his deadly cleaver with amazing accuracy for one without sight
: Chop it up
Jack ducks past the Cook, smacking him on the leg with the flat of his blade
The huge demon  in pain
The Second Cook picks up a skillet, wielding it like a club
: Smash
Me smash
Jack is caught between the two demon Cooks
He cannot face one without turning his back on the other
Gump sees Jack's predicament and leaps from the mantle onto the Second Cook's head with a wild : : Schweinhundt
Gump clings to the Second Cook like a terrier, confusing him and giving Jack time to dart acrobatically out of the way
(jabbing the Cook): Gotcha
: Cut you in half
mighty swing from the Cook misses Jack, who executes a nimble back-flip
The Cook cleaves through a hanging side of meat by mistake
The Second Cook grabs hold of Gump and shakes him
: Sweet, sweet blood
Up on the mantle, Screwball and Blunder exchange a helpless look
Gump is a goner unless they do something
They a simultaneous unspoken conclusion, and leap onto the Second Cook's back
(calling out): Rooster toes
(calling out):
pig whiskers
Faced with this new twin threat, the Second Cook drops GUmp, who immediately bities him on the leg
: Whut
Who now
Ouch
Jack fights a rearguard action, stabbing at the savage Cook as he retreats
: Best you can do
: You gonna be mince-meat
Jack back onto a steep stone ramp against the far wall
: Got to catch me first
The Cook's cleaver  against the ramp, missing Jack by inches
The Second Cook has his hands full
Brown Tom has joined the fray and clings to his other leg while Blunder and Screwball claw and punch at his head
& : Hit him
Sock him
Staggering under the full weight of the faerie onslaught, the Second Cook lurches in circles
: Kill
Smash
Furious, the Second Cook swings his heavy skillet at Screwball and Blunder
He misses them completely, hitting himself square on the head and knocking himself out
The faeries leap off as the demon toppes backwards into the fireplace
: We must help Jack
The faeries race to the foot of the ramp
Jack parries the Cook's fearsome swing
The Cook presses him relentlessly
The  of steel rings through the cavernous kitchen
The faeries start up the ramp like a tiny cheering section
: Stick him a good one
: Cut him down to size, Jack
Giant wine barrels are stacked at tge top of the ramp
The Cook back Jack against them
There is no further room for retreat
: Gonna spill your guts, boy
The Cook swings his cleaver from the hip
Jack nimbly springs out of harm's way
The cleaver drives full force into one of the chocks supporting the pyramid of wine barrels
, the Cook yanks his cleaver free
This pulls the chock loose from under the bottom barrel
(cont) (Listening): Wuzzat
The entire stack of barrels shifts, rolling towards the Cook
(cont): Bad news
The Cook runs for his life
The huge hogshead  forward in a wooden avalanche
Jack crouches at the top of the ramp
As the Cook runs past he sticks the sword-blade between his legs and trips him up
The Cook tumbles, head over heels, down the ramp
Half-way up, the faerie band sees the giant barrels  towards them
(horrified): Sodom and Glockamora
The faeries turn and run
The barrels  on top of the fallen Cook, knocking him senseless as they  rolling
The faeries dive for cover in the arched opening of the kitchen doorway at the bottom of the ramp
The barrels  into the kitchen wall
Because they are larger than the doorway, the faeries crouching inside are spared
Oceans of wine flood out in a dark tidal wave, forcing the door and washing the little people into the corridor beyond
101 Brown Tom is beside himself with delight
He scoops up wine with Screwball's helmet and pours it on top of his head
: Whoopeeeeeee
Jack appears in the shattered doorway, sword in hand
: Hate to break up the party, but there's work to be done
Gump jumps to his feet
: Hurry
Get those plates~ Jack sheathes his sword and rushes into the kitchen
Screwball and Blunder follow, but Brown Tom lingers behind, scooping the helmet full of wine
: Just a wee taste
Gump kicks Brown Tom smartly in the pants
: Move
Or  make your head ring worse than any hangover
Gump chases Brown Tom back into the kitchen
101A The faeries gather up the fallen plates
Jack stares thoughtfully at the fireplace, where the body of the Second Cook has snuffed out the flames
: What's on your mind, Jack
: Smoke rising
That chimney must go clear to the top
Gump peers into the hearth
: Not much to hold onto
Take a peapod pixie to make the climb
Screwball steps proudly forward
: 'll do it
The faeries are astonished
Screwball never volunteers
: What
Can  believe my ears
: Don't see why not
Ain't small enough for the job
(proudly): No job's too small for the Buttercup brothers
(on his knees: Please, Gump
let me try
know 'm always trouble, but  want to make it up to you
Prove that  won't let you down
: Be sure ya don't fall down
: All right
Do it
But be swift
: Thank you
thank you
You'll never regret it
Jack boosts Screwball up into the chimney
: 'm proud of you, Screwball
(handing him a plate) Don't drop it
(calling up): We'll send Luna with a signal when all is ready
101B Screwball clings to the smoke-blackened bricks, staring up the nearly endless shaft at a small circle of light far above
(os) (calling from below): Always knew you'd be going places, Screwball
Good luck
(to himself): 'm goin' places, all right
straight to the top and on outta this hell-hole
No more kitchen
no more demons
Just the easy life for Screwball Buttercup
101C shining gold plate is propper on the Secnd Cook smouldering in the fireplace
Luna positions another plate against the bellows, taking care to get the angle right
Gump stands between the bellows and the shattered kitchen door, measuring the nagle with a curious hand-held instrument
: Little more to the left, Luna
that's better
just a touch more
perfect
101D Blunder and Brown Tom run off carrying armloads of plates
Jack leans a platter against the corridor wall, adjsuting it precisely
(calling): How's that, Gump
(os): Dead centre
102 Lili's tears have dried
She prowls the majestic hall with regal dignity
Something magic occurs at the baquet table: each crystal goblet fills mysteriously with black wine as she passes; every empty bowl and platter suddenly is heaped with an incredible things to eat-all of it black
The food is beautiful in spite on its colour
Lili stares a it with undisguised hunger
Some animal instinct warns her not to trust this gleaming ebony feast, but she's famished and snatches up an apple bright as ploish anthracite
(os): Good
eat
Lili , dropping the apple
Darkness sits in one of the twin grostesque thrones flanking the hearth
(cont): The food is for your enjoyment
:  don't want it
'm not hungry
: Do you lie just to please me
:  do nothing for your pleasure
Darkness gestures to the opposing throne
: You are so like a child, milady
Sit, and we'll talk
Lili makes no move towards the chair
() (gently): Like a child, you expect anger and defiance will upset me
These are the qualities  admire most
Lili snarls, fangs gleaming in the firelight
: So
'd love to rip out your throat, yet it would pain you more if  licked your hand
: All  desire is that you sit in that chair and talk with me
Lili approaches the grotesque throne
Like some impossible organism, it pulses in anticipation
: Sit
Here
: Yes
Please
:  prefer to stand
For a moment, Darkness nearly sucumbs to anger
The viens in his forehead throb
His talons grip his throne in a spam of fury
(snarling): Sit
Darkness shrewdly realises rage won't work and he relaxes with a twisted smile
: (cont):
or stand
As you wish
It's enough that we're alone together
just the two of us
102A : Across the Great Hall from the blazing hearth is an identical fireplace
This one is cold, but not empty
Covered with soot and as black as a Moor, Screwball climbs into  between the massive andirons
(cont) (os): All of time awaits us
why not make a start
Screwball puts down his plate and tiptoes into the Great Hall towards the banqueting table
(os):  start at what
102B Darkness leans forward in his throne, smiling at Lili
: Simple conversation
: What do we possibly have to talk about
: Thoughts
dreams
ambitions
:  have no interest in your foul ambition
: Desire then
surely we beasts all have desire
102C    (  ) Unseen, Screwball climbs up onto the banquet table
He can't believe his good fortune
bounteous feast surrounds him
(os): You'd never dream what desire
(os): Don't be so sure
Dreams are my speciality Screwballs stuffs his tunic with black fruit
He rushes about, treading on the feast in his crazed delirium at beung surrounded by such plenty
(cont) (os): It is through dreams  influence mankind
have dreams of my own
dreams of enternity with you
no more silence
no more loneliness
102D Lili  in the face of Darkness
(scornfully): Such drivel
You sound like some simpering schoolboy
: 'll wager there was a time when the attention of a devoted schoolbvoy were entirely to your liking
Lili regards her claws with a savage sneer
(snarling):  know what 'd do with such meat now
:
all things change, lady
The pleasures of youth become the regrets of maturity
loud  on the banquet table causes Darkness to look around
He Screwball standing by the centrepiece, about to shove a whole chicken in his mouth
(cont) (angry): What're you doing here
Blackened with soot, Screwball easily passes for a goblin
(all innocence):
am early
: You impudent imp
:  thought the invitation said half-past
(roaring):
Screwball gets the message
He drops the chicken and hops down off the banquet table, running to the opposite fireplace for all he's worth
(cont) (gently to Lili): Sit
value your thoughts
Why not share them with me
Lili looks at the grotesque throne
: No more than that
just sit
(nodding): Sit
Lili steps up onto the oversized footstool
Inches behind her, the monstrous throne swells and throbs like an organic creature, the powerful sinews rippling with desire
(a feline smile): Doesn't seem such an outrageous request
The Princess prepares to sit, her luscious, silk-swathed bottom only inches from the lavcivious surface of the squirming throne
: You'll never regret granting me this favour
Lili's eyes glitter as she teases him
: What shall we talk about
(impatient): Just sit
The febric of Lili's gown brushes the writihing throne
In another second she will be sitting
Unexpectedly, she stands up tall on the footstool
: Such a disagreeable chair
must be terribly uncomfortable
think 'll stand if you don't mind
Darkness barely controls his raging anger
:  prefer you to sit
: 'd rather stand, thank you
Darkness's forehead swells with fury
: Sit
: No
Not now
Darkness puffs like an adder in his frenzy, rising up to tower over Lili
(roaring):  command you to sit
Lili is utterly unafraid
She  at the swollen image of Darkness
: Don't be silly
Lili hops down from the footstool
(screaming with rage): ,
Lili sashays past him, twitching her gown in an unashamedly wanton fashion
Her hearty  is as loud as the outraged  of Darkness
(laughing): Never
never
103-110 110A Jack scales a plate like a golden discus across the chasm to Brown Tom waiting on the viaduct above
Jack hurls another plate
Suddenly, the Winged Monster, hatched from the walking Egg, glides from the shadows
It catches the plate in its saw-toothed beak and dives at Jack
Gump sees it first
: Jack
Dropping the plate, the Winged Monster rips at Jack
The Green Man draws his sword and defends himself
The fight is savage and brief
Jack hacks the Monster out of the air
It lies, flapping and broken at his feet
Gump touches him sympathetically on the arm
:
'm all right
Let's get on
to the dungeon
(pensive): You have power within  never imagined
111 Darkness stares at the Princess in a towering rage
She flirtatiously pretends to be interested in a bit of fruit before rejecting it in favour of another, which also proves not to her liking
: 'm not above my own little pranks, milady
Should you have a taste for them
: No doubt they're as foul as the stuff you set on your table
Darkness relaxes, taking his cue from Lili's mocking tone
: Foul
or fair, such distinctions are entirely arbitrary, my dear
Does not the lowly toad think his mate fair, warts and all
: Do you suggest  will think you fair some day
: In time
and time we surely have
stretching before us
infinity
like a merciful curtain closing off the past
Darkness moves gracefully to Lili's side and kneels before her
(cont):  beseech you
do not reject my foods as you do my food
Never have abased myself so before another
It is not humility that brings me low, mistress
but love
: Love
: Aye, love
You think my heart a barren desert where only hate can flower
much finer blossom show its petals now
nourished by sorrow
watered with your tears
(baring his breast) offer you this rose, Princess
my heart
my soul
Lili is astonished
She walks away to consider what Darkness has said
Darkness watches her slyly
His expression reveals his words to have been a ruse
He gloats in anticipation
Lili turns back to face him
Darkness immediately resumes his look of adoration
: You dizzy me, lord
never thought to hear the word 'love' spoken again
: You'll hear it forever
(shouting) love you
: If such is true
hope is yet alive
(regarding her claws) These talons can caress as well as kill
They are interrupted by the  of a
An unseen clocks tolls the hour
Darkness stares up into the shadows
: It grows late
111A The setting sun blazes through distant drifting clouds, tinting the sky in a riot of colours
Another  is heard
111B The  of the unicorn's frightened whinny carries up from the dungeons below
(laughing): Our wedding feast is in good voice
Think you not
Lili cunningly disguises her alarm
:  admire your thrift, my lord, both the meal and entertainment in a single dish
Darkness appreciates this joke
: Are you anxious to see blood flow
: As you are to drink it
(smiling slyly) Will the groom grant his bride her wish on this night
(beaming with pleasure): You have but to ask my savage beauty
Lili leers, baring her feline teeth
:  want to kill the unicorn
Darkness claps his hands with joy
: Lady, you make me proud
111C Screwball struggles up the endless chimney, past hideous gargoyles and ancient skeletons imbedded in the blackened bricks
The  of conversation   from below
():  will do it with joy
Let the unicorn's blood anoint our love
: Crumpets and candlesticks
She's gonna kill it
():
and in the eternity awaiting us,  will happily sit on your throne as befits the Queen of Darkness
:  can't let that happen
Why, it's not civilized
Clutching the golden plate, Screwball struggles upwards like a tiny mountaineer
He reaches into a grinning skull for a handhold and the jaws clamp shut on his fingers
(cont): Billygoat dumplings
Screwball yanks his hand free, nearly losing his balance
His terror gives him renewed energy and he scrambles frantically up the inside of the chimney
111D The chimney pot is shaped like a monstrous demon
Black as a sweep, Screwball emerges at the top and looks around
The distant sun is a dying ember resting on the surrounding rim of dark mountains
We  the  of a clock
111E distant  stops Gump in his tracks
He pulls out his timepiece from the pouch and studies it
:
not much time
111F Princess Lili stretches out her arms towards Darkness
: Bring me to the wretched beast
Darkness takes her arm and leads her towards the blazing hearth
The unicorn's distant whinny  from below
: This way, fair beauty
hear a throat begging to be cut
Lili hesitates when she realises Darkness intends to lead her straight into the flames
(fearful): No
It's impossible
Darkness steps into the leaping flames
He turns and takes Lili's hand
: Now you are my queen
Nothing is impossible
Come
it takes but a single step
Find the faith
Darkness looks deep into Lili's eyes
She places her tiny foot among the white glowing coals
Nothing happens
Not even the fur is singed
Lili smiles
Her fear vanishes
She stands at the side of her master
Darkness wraps a powerful arm about the girl and they are consumed by flames, becoming one with the blaze around them
112 113 Unseen by the deformed goblin , the faeries creep out of the shadows and take cover behind a squat stone column
Jack positions Blunder in the corridor entrance with the final plate before joining the others
: Everything's ready
: And you, Jack
Your greatest challenge is still to come
Darkness and Princess Lili emerge, arm in arm, out of a background curtain of fire
They sweep majestically down the stone steps to where the unicorn is chained
Silent as mice, Jack and the faeries peer around at them
Jack is horrified by Lili's bestial appearance
:
oh, God
Lili
: Judge her with your heart, not your eyes
Blix and Poxand the other goblin Guards scramble to attention as the regal pair ascends
: Greetings
: -s-s-salutations
: Silence
Prepare the unicorn for sacrafice
The goblins hurry to comply
Blix selects a grotesque black greatsword from among a rack of weapons
Pox furiously pedals a grindstone
Blix applies the blade
Showers of sparks shower onto the glistening floor
Behind the column, the watching faeries are desparate
Luna's glowing  hovers above their heads
: The game is lost
for all of Jack's pretty plan
: No
It'll work
It must
: Luna
Fly up to Screwball
Tell him it's time
Quick as a , Luna  off into the shadows
Blix carries the sharpened greatsword to Darkness, offering it with a low bow
: Excellent
Let the ritual begin
The demon Guards stand in a semi-circle around the unicorn
Blix and Pox open tattered black prayer books
Darkness steps to a twisted lectern and  from a sinister volume
: In the beginning, there was nothing
a void of darkness, a cold enternity of silence
: Endless night, black as death
Mother of Shadows protect us
The assembled Guards answer in a ghastly : : Mother of Shadows, renew us
: Dream Sister
eclipse our pain
: Night Bride
restore our strength
114 Luna  straight up out of the abysmal keep; a tiny shooting star
The demons' ceremony continues (): ():
and when the perfect void was corrupted by Light, a great wailing was heard and all the brethern fled in terror
Luna rockets along the ruined corridors of the labyrinth
(): Deliver us, ' Darkness, from all fear
115 Darkness steps forward
His booming  disturbs the sleeping abts and sends them wheeling in clouds around his head
: Hear me, ye Powers of the Night
We offer this sacrafive in honour of you
Darkness reaches up and seizes a fluttering bat from out of the air
(cont): Here is our offering
sanctified with blood
Darkness crushes the bat to a pulp and splatters the unicorn's white flank with its blood
Darkness struggles mentally with the mare
(cont):
and with fire
Darkness touches his fingertip to the unicorn's haunch
The hide smoulders instantly, leaving an ugly brand
: Blood and fire, born of Night
Blood and fire, drown the Light
The unicorn rears back
Her hooves  on the cold stones
:  pray you, Father, accept my sacrafice
Let Light be orever extinguished
Let the Age of Darkness begin
Darkness contorts with the strain on imposing his will on the unicorn
He dominates the mare and she grows calm
As the Demon Guards , Blix and Pox strain at the winch
They drag the unicorns towards the chopping block
116 116A Screwball stands watching the sunset
One hands holds the plate, the other polishes a black apple on his tunic
(singing under his breath): nickety-nackety
noo-noo-noo
The apple is bright as obsidian
Screwball smiles at his reflection on its gleaming surface
(cont) (singing):
fiddle- dee-widdle-dee
Screwball takes a big bite of the apple
Screwball grins, chewing happily
Not a care in the world
It hits him like a stroke
His eyes cross and he toppes, dropping the plate
Luna comes  out of the chimney like a tracer bullet
(tiny voice): Screwball
Screwball falls onto the rim of the chimney
In a brilliant   , Luna materialises into her grown self, catching the plate an instant before it drops over the edge
(cont): Do it
Luna looks sadly down on Screwball, touching him with her toe
(cont): Screwball
wake up
Screwball  loudly
(cont): Oh, Screwball
Luna aims the golden plate at the ruby  of the setting sun
She aims a beam of  straight down the chimney
116B The beam of  descends the dark shaft like a golden waterfall
116C The beam of  moves like a searchlight inside the fireplace, criss-crossing the Second Cook's body as it misses the propped plate he holds by inches
117 Working together, the two goblins turn the iron winch
Bit by bit, the cable is drawn forward onto the drum
The unicorn's neck is stretched across the block
Darkness stands before Lili, offering the greatsword
: Once your hands were too delicate for such a task
spinning and weaving were more their work
: Let my loom be made of flesh and blood
am sister to the Fates
Lili eagerly seizes the sword
: What a queen you'll make
Jack slumps against the wall, desparate
: Come on, Screwball
: She means to do it, Jack
She's one of them
Jack stares at Lili
Gump grabs a long black bow from a weapon rack, and an arrow from a quiver beside it
(cont): 'm going to stop her
: Gump, wait
trust her
Gump fits an arrow onto the bowstring
The unicorn is helpless before Lili
Blix locks the winch, securing the cable
: My lady, the birth of a new world awaits your stroke
Lili swings the greatsword high over head
(chanting): Blood and fire
eternal ice
Blood and fire
and sacrafice
Gump draws back the arrow in the longbow, aiming at Lili
: No
Don't
Jack grabs the bow
He and Gump struggle for the weapon
118 119 120 120A The beam of  hits the plate held by the Second Cook in the fireplace
It  across the the plate leaning on the bellows, out into the corridor
120B The beam of   out of the corridor, strikes the plate on the viaduct, and  down into the lowest depths of the castle
121 Gump is determined to shoot Lili
Jack, equally determined to stop him
:  trust her, Gump
'll always trust her
: Foolish, mortal
The beam of   in through the corridor
Blunder it off his plate towards the others
Struggling for the bow, Jack and Gump kick over the propped shielf the moment the  beam reaches it
: Stop lads
The light
wild  bursts from Lili's throat
She swings the sword with all her might
The blade arcs through the air, a glittering  where it carves through the deflected beam of
Lili aims not for the mare, but for the line restraning her
The sword severs the woven cable
(exultant): Run
You're free
The unicorn plunges into the shadows
Only the  of her hoofbeats remain
Jack and Gump stop struggling
Jack dives for his fallen shield
Darkness pulls a weapon from his belt
It is the stallion's alicorn mounted as a shortsword
(sneering savagely): Innocence
Huge and terrible, Darkness lunges for Lili, driving the alicorn straight through her side
Lili is pierced by the horn
She , supported by the Demon's hold on the blade
Miraculously, Lili's features alter and
The fangs and claws disappear
Her fur melts like the morning dew
She is an innocent maiden once more
Lili slides dying off the alicorn and falls to the ground
Jack holds his shield in the beam of , angling in a bright swath towards Darkness
: Burn
You evil bastard
The  hits Darkness like an express train
He , blasted in a smoking whirlwind across the dungeon
Darkness cowers on his knees,  in the
All the goblins scatter  from the
Brown Tom capers a happy two-step around Gump, who stares straight up into the central keep
:
and we'll dance on the black devil's grave
'  :  : The beam of  dims and goes out
(): What's wrong
What's happening, Gump
Gump shrugs, looking sadly at Jack and the darkened shield he holds
(sadly): Sunset
With a savage , Darkness staggers off into the gloon, trailing trendrils of smoke
Jack drops the shield and rushes to Lili's side
He kneels and cradles her in his arms
Throwing back his head, Jack  like a wild animal
His  is a wolf-wail of utter despair
Gump runs frantically up to grieving Green Man
: No, Jack
Quick
He's after the mare
Gump seizes the grotesque sacraficial greatsword
(cont): The world needs a champion
(handing Jack the black sword) Use this against him
Jack snatches the sword
He rises cold with fury and runs off into pursuit of Darkness
122 123 124 125 125A The unicorn gallops through a desolate landscape of broken columns and grumbled masonry
126 precipice jutting over eternity
The unicorn runs along a narrow trail bordering the edge of the abyss, highlighted by a bright backdrop of comets and stars
126A : The black hooves of Darkness as he runs relentlessly along the unicorn's track
to show Darkness  into a muscular black unicorn stallion
He surges onward, an explosion of strength
flare from his nostrils
126B The huge black unciron  out of the cavern-mouth
The mare stand alone, trapped on a final promontory
The black stallion  and charges the mare
Black and terrible, the devil stallion rises over the mare, striking out with his fearsome hooves
The mare staggers before this onslaught of evil, falling to the ground amid flying black feet
The black stallion paws the ground, preparing to ram his alicorn into the fallen mare
Jack runs out from the dark cavern, gripping the evil greatsword with both hands
He sees the stallion tower above the mare (calling out): Darkness
You rotten filth
The superb black unicorn turns to meet this new challenge
He , breathing fire, and lowers his head, charging straight at Jack
Jack stands his ground, greatsword poised, as the huge black stallion gallops towards him, hooves striking
Jack swings with all his might as the demon unicorn slavering past
The greatsword passes straight through the black beast, as if it were striking a ghost
Jack is knocked off balance by the fury of the charge, but he manages to stay on his feet as the stallion wheels and attackes again
The black unicorn's red eyes  as he crashes into Jack
The Green Man is thrown awkwardly to one side
He loses the greatsword and sprawls helpless on the ground
Dazed, Jack rises on his elbows
He sees the black hooves of Darkness standing before him
Looking up, Jack sees the Lord of Darkness  back to his original form
He holds his alicorn sword pointed straight at the boy's heart
: Always a pleasure to take a brave man's life
Darkness thrusts down with the alicorn, but Jack rolls skillfully aside and counds to his feet
:
haven't killed me yet
Jack draws his own sword and swings at Darkness, who parries with the alicorn
fly
Jack swings again
Darkness catches the blade in his bare hand and holds Jack immobile to meet his malevolent gaze
:
Oh, but  have
Jack is speechless with horror
(cont): Don't you know me, boy, don't you know from whence  come
The muscle hump behind Darkness's neck bulges and cracks
It bursts open and a pair of leathery bat wings unfold
Jack's horror is complete
(cont): Time to die
Darkness drives the alicorn sword into Jack's chest, running him through
Jack's eyes are wide with astonishment
Is this what it's like to die
Darkness pulls the alicorn out of Jack
There is no blood
No trace of a wound remains on his flesh
Jack blinks in wordless amazement
(cont): So
should have known
We're just the same
You're immortal, Jack
(disbelieving): No
'm not
'm human
(laughing): Who was your mother
(confused):
don't know
: Who was your father
:
can't remember
: How long have you lived in the forest
: All my life
know who  am
: You pitiful fool
An immortal all this time and never knew
(laughing) Don't you see, Jack
Don't you understand your power
Together we could rule the universe
(bewildered):
together
: There'd be nothing to stop us
No power could stand in our way
We're just the same, Jack
You and
eternal
Jack struggles to understand the immensity of this revelation
He wavers in the face of the demon's persuasiveness
All at once, the mare unicorn gallops up from the shadows, white and pure
She spears Darkness straight his mid-section
The evil Lord , staring down at the shining alicorn thrsut out of his chest
(cont):
Father
Protect me
Darkness starts to shrink
The mare lifts the writhing demon high in the air, impaled like a kicking insect
Rearing, the unicorn arches her neck and tosses Darkness over toe edge into the abyss
Darkness tumbles into the haze
His final  is a lament from the depths of Hell
At the last moment, the falling figure of Darkness  into the flapping black cloak and sails off into the shadows
Jack picks up the alicorn
He wraps his other arm around the unicorn's neck
They stand together at the edge of the world, united in a victorious embrace
126C The faeries gather at the entrance
Screwball is there, half asleep
Luna is full-sized
Pale and sleeping, Lili lies on the black cloak
The faeries stand around her, eyes downcast
Jack rides up, mounted on the unicorn
Surrounded by light, he is more than a champion
He is divine
The faeries are delighted
: Why
Jack
solved your riddle at last
: Should've known no mortal could speak unicorn like that
: How is Lili
: Sadly beyond the help of faerie magic
She's under a powerful spell
It's like a riddle
Jack understands
He brightens into a smile
:  know the answer
Lift her to me, gently
Jack hands Gump the alicorn as the faeries gather Lili in their arms, lifting her above their heads
Jack carefully pulls the enchanted Princess in front of him across the unicorn's withers
(cont): We'll meet again, dear friends
Jack touches his heels to the unicorn's flanks and they gallop off in a  of hoofbeats
(waving): Ride like the wind, Jack
: Wish we could go with him
: And why not
know some magic words that'll do the trick
: Oh no
Not me
hate to travel like that
makes me sick
: Stand back
The sky's the limit
: Can't stand your bumpy takeoffs
Abruptly, Screwball  into the air, flying out of sight
: Screwball
Wait for the spell
(os):
never do
Gump gestures magically
: Eiderdown and milkfeed fluff
All at once, Gump, Blunder, and Brown Tom  off into space
Luna watches them go
into a dot of , she speeds up after them
127   ( ) Jack clings to Lili as the unicorn thunders through the midnight forest, darting like quicksilver between the shadowy trees, leaping impossible chasms, splashing across streams in a burst of moonlit spray
127A The full moon hangs above like the lantern of God as the faeries tumble through the clear night sky
Gump rides the alicorn like a broomstick
Far below, magically white and fluid as free-roving moonbeam, the unicorn carries her passengers across the nocturnal forest with the ease of a dreamer transported through time
128 It is not yet sun-up
The first faint trace of the false dawn tints the eastern horizon
Everywhere, the snow is melting
It is like springtime, with bold patches of green showing through the frozen landscape
bright beam of  , weaving between the giant trees
It is Jack and Lili, mounted on the unicorn
Jack rides up onto the high rock overinghanfing the ponnd and slides easily to the ground with Lili in his arms
The unicorn doesn't move
She stands watching as Jack gently rests Lili down on the mossy earth
Jack strips off his golden mail coat and steps on the edge of the promontory
He dives gracefully into the pond
128A Screwball in the lead, the faeries  down through the trees, bouncing to a stop on the forest floor
: Ow
: Ouch
(cheerfully): Home again
The bedraggled faeries scowl at Gump
129 Jack streaks down, streaming air bubbles like a comet's tail
129A The faeries gather around the frozen unicorn stallion
His alicorn has been restored
Wreathed in flowers, it stands majestically out from his forehead
129B Jack strokes deeper and deeper into the pond, past undulating weeds and curious fish
129C Faeries are all about, dancing and  around the statuesque unicorn
They pelt one another with petals
The mare stands demurely to one side, draped in blossoms
129D At the bottom, Jack moves carefully, trying not to stir up the muck
He gently parts the drifting trendrils, searching among the water weeds
129E High above the faerie celebration, beautiful  is
It is Gump, playing his violin in uppermost branches of a towering pine
Delicate as the call of a meadow lark, Gump's music rises sweetly into the heavens
It is just dawn
The sun's  blazes in the east
129F winking  catches Jack's eyes and he reaches out an eager hand
cloud silt issues from his grasp as he opens his fingers
Centred on his palm, golden and perfect, is Lili's ring
129G Round and full, the sun rises
The golden sun rays pierce through the trees and start across the open meadow
Gump's music continues, more lyrical than ever
As the sunlight advances, bright spring flowers push up through the once-frozen earth
129H Jack turns and strokes upwards, higher and higher, towards the shining ceiling of light far above
129I Gump's music swells to a crescendo
The life-giving sunlight reaches across the meadow and strikes the flank of the dormant stallion
130 Jack breaks the surface, holding the ring triumphantly above his head
130A The Princess sleeps under the tree
She no longer wears the black wedding gown, but is dressed as before
Jack's armour has also disappeared
Jack kneels before Lili and slips the ring onto her finger
He takes the girl into his arms and kisses her passionately on the mouth
Lili smiles
Her eyelids flutter
131 132 133 134 The unicorn's sunlit flesh twitches, dislodging a butterfly warming his wings on his haunch
In a single, beautiful movement, the stallion rises to his feet
He arches his powerful neck and  to his mate
The magic animals gallop off together across the open meadow
135 136 136A Princess Lili awakens
: Oh
Jack
What a dream 've had
The Princess smiles when she sees the ring on her finger
(cont): Such a terrible dream
could never tell you
Lili looks around, but Jack is nowhere in sight
(cont): Jack
Where are you
(calling) Green Jack
Getting no reply, Lili wanders off in search of Jack
137  ' Puzzled, Lili searches the familiar place
(calling): Jack
Where are you hiding now
The wind surges through the treetops
The leaves all move together as if they were a single living organism
Jack's  is heard out of the waving trees
(os): 'm everywhere, Lili
my spirit lives in everything
: Jack
Don't play games with me
love you
(os):
love
you
: Will you be here tomorrow
Unseen in the bushes, Gump and the faeries hide, grinning as they watch Lili
(os): 'm always here, Lili
whenever you come
Mystified, but happy, Princess Lili picks a flower and wanders off into the sun-bright woods
138 lush broad expanse, boldly pattered with wild flowers
Breasting the waving grass like a swimmer in the sea, the unicorn bounds joyfully in total freedom
Mounted on the animal's back, his arms in victory, Jack rides like a triumphant angel
His hair and skin are tinted green
He is the incarnation of all that is magical in Nature
