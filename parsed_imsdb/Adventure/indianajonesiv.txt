She is  with Tyki in sign language
The woman is Dr
Clare Clarke
The famous zoologist
She works in Africa, studying animals in their natural habitat
Very interesting, Marcus
Now if you'll turn the lights back on -- (continuing) Three weeks ago, Dr
Clarke discovered that cute little fellow
"Tyki"
a pygmy of an unusual race
unrelated to any known African tribe
(bored) Marcus

Dr
Clarke believes that Tyki comes from the Lost Civilization of Sun Wu-Kung
Indiana

Suddenly
What
But how did Miss -- "Doctor"
"Doctor" Clake
How did she arrive at such a preposterous hypothesis
The pygmy speaks in a language that has no African origins
but bears a strong resemblance to Chinese
Means nothing
The rivers of Africa have been plagued by various Oriental Pirates and Scavengers since the 16th Century
(turns from screen) Not much evidence, Marcus
There's more
The pygmy was found wearing an ornamental peach stone around his neck
believed to come from Sun Wu-Kung's legendary Garden Of Immortal Peaches
(skeptical) Marcus, there are countless undiscovered African tribes
all with various obscure beliefs and practices
(smirks) One tribe may wear peach stones
another may wear banana peels
Indiana  back to his papers
Marcus
There is one final bit of evidence
Enlighten me
The pygmy is over 200 years old
Indiana  his spectacles
He  at the black and white image
The cute pygmy appears to be in his -
He walks to the ,  into the lens
Tyki examines the camera with That's impossible
Dr
Clarke has done a considerable amount of testing on the pygmy's clothing
his sandals
everything was over 200 years old
(skeptical) He's probably wearing his Great Grandfather's stuff
to the projected image
Tyki begins to  the camera lens
The picture goes
The film
Marcus the projector and flips  the overhead room lights
Indiana gives Marcus a  look
What does all of this have to do with me
Dr
Clarke wants to mount an expedition to find the Lost City of Sun Wu-Kung
She is quite familiar with your reputation
she'd like you to come along
(gathering his papers) No chance
There will be money involved
The museum is willing to fund the expedition
Sorry, Marcus
've burned this bridge
Indiana  and begins to  out of the room
Marcus  him
Indiana
Indy
He  the papers at Marcus
Marcus
Please
've got to finish these
You've got to finish something much more important
You crossed the threshold over a decade ago
and it's been tearing at your insides ever since
(passionate) My friend, if there is even one iota of truth in Dr
Clarke's findings
then you can lift the veil of mystery that has surrounded this Chinese legend for Centuries
You may uncover the secrets to a Lost Civilization
and possibly, to man's never ending search for immortality

Long ago
a place known as the Flower Fruit Mountain, in the Chinese province of Ao-Lai
was struck by lightning
Stone Monkey, "Sun Wu-Kung", was born
This monkey
He could walk
Talk
Like human
More than human
He was blessed with countless heavenly powers
But it wasn't enough
Sun Wu-Kung wanted to learn the secret of Eternal Life
of Immortality
(pause) Equipped with his Golden Hooped Rod to protect him, Sun Wu Kung travelled the world for many years learning the secret philosophies and teachings of Eternal Youth
Eventually, he was granted entrance to heaven
where the Jade Emperor gave Sun Wu Kung the title of "Great Sage of the Heavens"
and permitted him to oversee the Garden of Immortal Peaches
(pause) After several years, the stone monkey returned to somewhere on earth
Here, he ruled an empire
a Civilization of Monkeys and humans who had life spans of many hundred years
(shrugs) The exact whereabouts of that Lost City has been a mystery for hundreds of years
until Doctor Clarke discovered the pygmy
The crew members, Scraggy, Betsy and Clare, listen with
It's uncertain just how much of this legend is based in reality
Nevertheless, we're hoping to find some sign of the Lost Civilization
What about Sun Wu Kung
Whatever he was
a stone idol
an actual monkey
a human being
is unknown
But he is one of the most influentual religious figures in History, and his remains are most likely somewhere in the Lost City
