Ghostbusters by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd September 29, 1988 Last revised Feburary 27, 1989 - high   of the island features the Statue of Liberty prominently in the foreground then   the harbor,  the Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village
77TH  - car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer
comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse
The building superintendent , sees her struggling but pretends not to notice
(exasperated) Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags
'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett
'm a building superintendent
You're also a human being, Frank
(reluctantly going to help) Okay, okay
It's not my job, but what the hell
'll do you a favor
He takes the grocery bags from her
(setting the wheel brakes on the buggy) Thank you, Frank
'll get the hang of this eventually
She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and makes funny faces at the baby, , a very cute nine-month old boy
(to the baby) Hiya, Oscar
What do you say, slugger
(to Dana) That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms
Barrett
(finding her keys) Thank you, Frank
Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom
asked you last week
Didn't  do it
It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand
77TH  -  - He  with delight at the movement
77TH  -    - Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage
No, you didn't, Frank
Okay, that's no problem
That's exactly what you said last week
The brakes unlock themselves
She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward just out of her reach and stops
Surprised by the movement, she reaches for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even further
Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps rolling down the street at ever increasing speed
Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy swerves and continues unchecked
Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races toward the corner
She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian
77TH  -  - city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy
It careens toward the corner
77TH  -  - Its eyes are wide open with excitement
77TH  -  - Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and into the crosswalk
The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the intersection at high speed
It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street
The bus continues missing the buggy by inches
Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the intersection and snatches up the baby
She hugs it close, deeply relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the supernatural has re-entered her life
: -     -   - kicks in strongly as we see the familiar "No Ghosts" symbol and   to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the Upper West Side
is driving and   is riding shotgun
77TH  -   ( ) The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the house
-   ( ) greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished house
(all business) How many of them are there, ma'am
Fourteen
They're in the back
hope you can handle them
It's been like a nightmare
How big are they
She holds her hand out indicating about four feet
(resolute) We'll do our best, ma'am
They're right out here
She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room
Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment
Ready
'm ready
Then let's do it
He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room
-   ( ) They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming between the ages of seven and ten
(disappointed) Ghostbusters
Boooo
Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the room is strewn with discarded toys and games
couple of weary parents sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party
(trying his best) How you doin', kids
(nasty) though we were having He-Man
He-Man couldn't make it today
That's why we're here
My dad says you're full of crap
(stopped cold) Well, a lot of people have trouble believing in the paranormal
No, he just says you're full of crap and that's why you went out of business
He kicks Stantz in the leg
Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront
(low and menacing) 'm watching you
(to Winston) Song
Winston switches on a tiny   which starts  the Ghostbusters
Stantz and WInston start singing 'There's something wrong in the neighborhood
Who you gonna call
' (all together) He-Man
: 77TH  -  () Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile
That's it, Ray
've had it
No more parties
'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds
Come on, Winston
We can't quit now
The holidays are coming up
It's our best season
They get in the car -1 -  ( ) Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over
Give it up, Ray
You're living in the past
Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore
In a year these kids won't even remember who we are
(tries to start the car again) Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae
After all we did for this city
Yeah, what did we do, Ray
The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise
Yeah, but what a ride
You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow
He turns the key again, the   , then starts  and disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits of metal onto the pavement
Finally, with a  of black sooty exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies
Frustrated, Stantz bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel : -    -  () bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on , Channel 10 in New York
We    one of the monitors as a title card and logo come up accompanied by some   , and we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr
Peter Venkman
"  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and sitting there is our host  , the renowned and somewhat infamous ex-Ghostbuster
He turns   and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone, understated and intimate
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' 'm Peter Venkman and 'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund
(to his guest) Milt, your new book is called The End of the World
Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease
Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it
Well,  think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book
predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve
This year
That's cutting it a little close, isn't it
mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right
So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year
And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential
You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe
(irritated) This is not just some money-making scheme didn't just make up the date
have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve
(placating) Well, for your sake,  hope you're right
But think my other guest may disagree with you
Elaine, you had another date in mind
The   , an attractive, aggressive New Jersey housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016
Valentine's Day
That's got to be a bummer
Where did you get that date, Elaine
received this information from an alien was at the Paramus Holiday Inn,  was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking
Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn can't be sure, Peter
(humoring her) No, you can't, and  think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them
You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or
, but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard
Anyway, we're just about out of time
(does his wrap-up right the ) Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets
(holds up a hairless cat) Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying
(puts a finger to his temple and sends out a though to his viewers) Good night
: -  -  () Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, , a well-meaning young incompetent
Where do you find these people
thought we were having the telekinetic guy who bends the spoons
lot of the better psychics won't come on the show
They think you're too skeptical
Skeptical
Norman, 'm a pushover
think professional wrestling is real
There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants
(to Norman) What's all this
They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline
' The Mayor
He's a friend of mine
Venkman starts down the hall as the  and his principal aide, , come walking out of the studio
(calling to the Mayor) Lenny
The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know him
(starts to follow him) Lenny
It's Pete Venkman
The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand against Venkman's chest
(snide) Can  help you
(dangerous) Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest
Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand
'm Jack Hardemeyer
'm the mayor's assistant
What can  do for you
'm an old friend of the mayor's
just want to say hello to him
(scornful) know who you are, Doctor Venkman
Busting any ghosts lately
No, that's what  want to talk to the mayor about
We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you
(bristling) Look, you stay away from the mayor
Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends
You read me
Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops
Okay,  get it
But  want you to tell Lenny that, because of you, 'm not voting for him
: - The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and visitors
Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and enters the museum
-   -  () We are -  a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of , a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an incredibly powerful evil presence
Then we   to reveal the studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit by large skylights in the ceiling
Working on the Vigo painting is , a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy
Janosz is staring longingly across the room at Dana
She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy
Janosz watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her shoulder
(with an East European accent) Still working on the Turner
Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion
Oh, yes,  got in a little late this morning, Janosz
You know, you are really doing very good work here
think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations
Thank you, Janosz
've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older,  was hoping to rejoin the orchestra
At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his head and looks at Dana
Neither of them notice the movement in the painting
(disappointed) We'll be very sorry to lose you
Perhaps could take you to lunch today
Actually, 'm not eating lunch today
have an appointment
(looks at her watch) In fact, 'd better go
She starts gathering up her things
Every day  ask you, and every day you've got something else to do
Do  have bad breath or something
(trying to brush him off) 'm sorry
Perhaps some other time
Okay, 'll take a raincheck on that
Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel
(to himself) think she likes me
He switches on an English language  and starts practicing the phrases as he resumes working
: - Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building
sign identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research
" -  (  ) Dana is explaining the buggy incident to  , the soberly intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean
The device he is testing is a black box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic displays
and then the buggy just suddenly stopped dead in the middle of the street Did anyone else see this happen
Hundreds of people
Believe me,  didn't imagine this
'm not saying you did
In science we always look for the simplest explanation
An  interrupts
We're ready, Dr
Spengler (to the Assistant) We'll start with the negative calibration
He picks up the device and prepares to test it
(curious) What are you working on, Egon
'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field
It's a theory Ray and  were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters
An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room
Inside the waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated arguement
(to Dana) They think they're here for marriage counseling
We've kept them waiting for two hours and we've been gradually increasing the temperature in the room
(checking a heat sensor) It's up to 95 degrees at the moment
Now my assistant is going to enter and ask them if they'd mind waiting another half-hour
As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay
They explode with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them through the glass
After recording his readings, he returns to his Assistant
We'll do the happiness index next
(to Dana) 'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman
Oh no
(affectedly casual) Do you ever see him
Occasionally How is he these days
Venkman
think he was borderline for a while there
Then he crossed the border
Does he ever mention me
No
Not that  can recall
They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys
(slightly disappointed) Well, we didn't part on very good terms and we sort of lost track of each other when got married
The Assistant interrupts again
We're ready for the affection test
(to the assistant) Good
Send in the puppy
(continuing) thought of calling him after my marriage ended, but --
Anyway,  appreciate you're doing this, Egon They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl
Spengler monitors her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog
(handing him a card) This is my address and telephone number
Will you call me
Certainly
Egon, 'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind
won't
Thank you
She shakes his hand and exits
(to his assistant) Now let's see how she reacts when we take away the puppy : '    -  () It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in Greenwich Village
The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old books full of arcane metaphysical lore
The
(v
o
, answering the phone) Ray's Occult
'   - The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan sweater over a -shirt
He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews on a battered, reeking pipe
As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text
(on the phone) Yeah
mmhmm
What do you need
What have  got
've got alchemy, astrology, apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon intercession,
abductions, psychic surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, 've got it all -- what are you looking for
Don't have any
Try the stockyards
He hangs up
Who was that
Some crank
Looking for goat hooves
Come up with anything
(referring to the book) This one's interesting
Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground
Three hundred eyewitnesses
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis
(going to the stacks) Good idea
The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me
'm looking for an aerosol love potion  could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request
Oh, hiya, Pete
So, no goat hooves, huh
(strung) knew that voice sounded familiar
What's up
How's it going
Nowhere -- fast
Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub
(slightly evasive) Uh,  can't
'm kind of working on something
Spengler steps out of the stacks
Egon
Hello, Venkman
How've you been
How's teaching
bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh
think they're more interested in my epididymis
don't even want to know where that is
Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge
Oh, your book came in, Venkman
Magical Paths to Fortune and Power
He hands Venkman the book
Great
(reading the contents) So what are you guys working on
Oh, just checking something for an old friend
Who
(at a loss) Who
Just -- someone we know
Oh, Ray -- He grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up
Who
Who
Who
Aaah
Nobody
can't tell you
Who, Ray
(giving in) Dana
Dana Barrett
Venkman lets go of his ears and smiles
Spengler looks at Stantz and shakes his head
: '  -  () The apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of modern and traditional pieces
Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does day care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the : Dana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door
She opens it and admits Ray and Egon
(hugging Ray) Hi, Ray
It's good to see you
Thanks for coming
No problem
Always glad to help -- and hug
(to Spengler) Hi, Egon
She shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears in the doorway
Hi, Dana
Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance
knew you'd come crawling back to me
She regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his presumptuousness
Hello, Peter
(to Dana) You know, Dana, 'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first
'm still into all this stuff, you know
Haven't you ever seen my show
have
That's why  didn't call you first
can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, 'm going to give it my best shot
Let's go to work, boys
Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on the baby and the immediate physical environment
Venkman starts nosing around the apartment
Dana follows him
So what happened to Mr
Right
hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe
He didn't "ditch" me
We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it
He ditched you
You should've married me, you know
You never asked me, and every time  brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep
Men are very sensitive, you know
We need to feel loved and desired, too
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when  left
may have a few personal problems but one thing am is a total professional
He leaves her and crosses to Spengler
He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby with a tape measure and calipers
What are you going to do, Egon
Knit him a snowsuit
Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar
'd like to have a stool specimen Yeah, you would
Is that for personal or professional reasons
(picking up the baby) Okay, kid
Up you go
He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking him
Help
Please somebody help me
Get him off
Quickly
He's gone completely berserk
Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby
What do you think
There's no doubt about it
He's got his father's looks
The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly
And smelly
(resumes playing with the baby) You stink
It's just horrible
You are the stinkiest baby  ever smelled
(to Dana) What's his name
His name is Oscar
Oscar
You poor kid
(losing patience) Peter, this is serious
need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him
Unusual
(holds up the baby and scrutinizes him) don't know
haven't had a lot of experience with babies
He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper off
(taking the specimen jar) 'll do it
'll supervise
'  -  -  ( ) Venkman enters and finds Stantz monitoring the room
(to Stantz) Well, Holmes, what do you think
It's an interesting one, Pete
If anything was going on it's totally subdued now
Spengler enters
(to Spengler) What now, Brainiac
think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard
: 77TH  -  () Dana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the runaway buggy
Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring  valences from the pavement and the buildings
(to Dana, nostalgic) Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it
(pointing out familiar neighborhood sights) There's our old cash machine
And the dry cleaners we used to go to
And the old video store
(he wipes away an imaginary tear) We really had some good times, didn't we
We definitely had a moment or two
Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street
That's where the buggy stopped
Okay, let's take a look
Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely oblivious to the   and whizzing past him and starts motioning like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill
Then he signals for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street
(reading the  meter) Is this the spot
little to the left
Right there
That's where it stopped
Stantz reads the  meter
Nothing
Not a trace
Why don't we try the Giga-meter
What's that
Egon and  have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts
That's a thousand million electron volts
knew that
Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the  starts think we hit the honeypot, boys
There's something brewing under the street
(worried, to Venkman) Peter, do you think maybe  have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things
You mean like the time you got possessed and turned into a monster terror dog
No, not a chance
Total coincidence
(to Stantz and Spengler) Am  right
Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the coincidence theory
: - The museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and employees are leaving
- Janosz is working late on the painting of Vigo
Unnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow
He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red, crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body, driving him to his knees
The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures dramatically at him
Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice
, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you
(in agony) Command me, lord
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, sat on a throne of blood
What was will be, what is will be no more
Now is the season of evil
Find me a child that  might live again
Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes
He screams and falls to his knees
: -  77TH  - Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee, sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street
love this
We're onto something really big
can smell it, Ray
We're going to make some headlines with this one
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound
Are you nuts
If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble
The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting
Relax
We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile
77TH  -  ( ) Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is  a hole in the middle of the street
Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is lit by strong work lights
It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift worksite and stops
The noise of the  is so loud, Spengler doesn't notice the police car and the two  inside looking at them
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes
How ya doing
(reeking with guilt) Fine
It's cutting fine now
(curious) Why are you cutting
(looking for one of the others) Why are we cutting
Uh - boss
Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman
What are you doing here
(belligerent) What the hell's it look like we're doing
We're bustin out asses over here 'cause some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin' better to do than make idiots like us work late on a Friday night, right
(looks to Spengler for agreement) (with a "right on" fist) Yo
The cops seem satisfied by the explanation
Okay, boys, take it easy
They drive off
Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts rubbing his sore shoulders
You were supposed to help me with this
You need the exercise
Stantz resumes , while Venkman and Spengler clear the rubble from the hole
Suddenly he hits metal
They clear away generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters
(examing it) What the hell --
Help me lift this
They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and very deep abyss
(shining a flashlight into the hole) Wow
It's an old airshaft
It just goes forever
Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now
Very intense
We need a deeper reading
Somebody has to go down there
Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray
Thanks, boys
They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong cable attached to a winch
Ray calls out orders to them as he descends deeper and deeper
(
) (his voice echoing in the airshaft) Keep going -- more -- more -- -  ( ) Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent in total darkness
(using a radio now) Lower -- lower -- (to himself) Gee, this really is deep
Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft and swings free in some kind of tunnel
(shouts) Hold it
Steady
He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into the tunnel below
- '  - He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled Art Nouveau mosaics
finely inlaid sign identifies it as He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework, and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie
(reverently) This is it, boys, the end of the line
Van Horne Station
The old New York Pneumatic
It's still here
77TH  -  -  ( ) Venkman has no idea what he's talking about
(explaining) The New York Pneumatic Railway
It was an experimental subway system
Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870
(over the walkie-talkie) This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole
(to Stantz) What's the reading
-  ( ) Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely high reading
(on the radio) Off the top of the scale
This place is really hot
Lower me to the floor
As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight down the wall of the station, then onto the floor
(shouts) Hold it
Stop
Whoa
- '  -  - Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable torrent of disgusting ooze
As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely amplified and magnified sounds of great   and pulsing in the bowels of the city, of   through pipes, through ducts, the muffled  of the  and the  of , and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain --   in anger,  in fear,  in pain, a sad and eerie symphony
-  - (ranting on the radio) Oh, my God
It's a seething, bubbling, psychic cess
Interlocked tubes of plasm, crackling with negative GEVs
It's glowing and moving
It's -- it's a river of slime
He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he can
He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting the pole
Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet
He jerks his legs up as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him
(on the radio) Haul me up, Venkman
Now
77TH  -  -  ( ) Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier burly  gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two cops
(no nonsense) Okay, what's the story here
Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex hardhat
What,  got time for this
We got three thousand phones out in the Village and about eight million miles of cable to check
(not buying it) The phone lines are over there
(points to the curb) Venkman pops Spengler on the head
told ya
Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie
(
) (filtered) Help
Help
Pull me up
It's alive
It's eating my boots
Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie
You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company
We checked
Tell me another one
Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment
Gas leak
- Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which is now bubbling up the shaft after him
(shouting) Get me out of here
Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old, rusting conduit
- The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping through the cable with a
77TH  -  - Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright deep down in the hole and a  from Stantz
77TH  -  - One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness
(
) Sorry
'  -  ( ) She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over the living room
Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for information about the blackout
She listens to a special news report for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door and looks in
Suddenly the  , scaring her half to death
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of the hallway
He looks slightly dazed and even creepier
(surprised) Janosz
Hello, Dana
happened to be in the neighborhood and  thought 'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything
Are you okay
Is the baby all right
His affected concern is chilling
She is frightened but conceals it from him
(mechanically and cautiously) We're fine, Janosz
He tires to look around her into the apartment
Do you need anything
You want me to come in
No, everything's fine
Honestly
Thanks anyway
Okay, just thought 'd check
Good night, Dana
Sleep well
Don't let the bedbugs bite you
Good night, Janosz
She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid
'  -  ( ) Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like headlights and he walks off down the hall
: -   - The , a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the court to order
want to make one thing very clear before we go any further
The law does not recognize the existence of ghosts, and  don't believe in them either, so  don't want to hear a lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and demons
We're going to stick to the facts in this case and save the ghost stories for the kiddies
Understood
Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh
His nickname is "The Hammer
" Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney  , lawyer, and former demonic possession victim
Louis is desperately paging through a mountain of legal textbooks
(nervous) think you're making a big mistake here, fellas
do mostly tax law and some probate stuff occasionally
got my law degree at night school
That's all right
We got arrested at night
' Venkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery
wish  could stay
feel personally responsible for you being here
You are personally responsible
If  can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing
Please don't say that
You won't go to prison
Don't worry about me
'm like a cat
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug
'm El Gato
always land on my feet
(sincerely) Good luck
Thanks
She gives him a quick, unexpected kiss and exits
Venkman savors it for a moment then goes back to the defense table
Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's principal aide, is goading the , a very sober, humorless woman in her late thirties
How are you doing, hon
Just put these guys away fast and make sure they go away for a long, long time
It shouldn't be hard with this list of charges
Good
Very good
The mayor and future governor won't forget this
He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table on his way out of the courtroom
The Ghostbusters look up as Hardemeyer approaches
(gloating) Nice going, Venkman
Violating a judicial restraining order, willful destruction of public property, fraud, malicious mischief -- smooth move
See you in a couple years -- at your first parole hearing
Herdemeyer exits
Louis looks devastated
Gee, the whole city's against us
think 'm going to be sick
Spengler hands him a waste basket as the Prosecutor calls her first witness
-   -  () The Con Ed Supervisor is testifying
Mr
Fianella, please look at Exhibits through  on the table over there
Do you recognize that equipment
Lying on the table are the basic tools of the Ghostbusting trade: three proton packs and particle throwers, a couple of ghost traps, and various meters and detection devices
(o
c
) That's the stuff the cops found in their truck
She continues
Do you know what this equipment is used for
(shrugs) don't know
Catching ghosts,  guess
(to the Judge) May  remind the court that the defendants are under a judicial restraining order that specifically forbids them from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators
So noted
Now, Mr
Fianella, can you identify the substance in the jar on the table marked Exhibit
She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel
been working underground for Con Ed for 27 years and  never saw anything like that in my life
We checked out that tunnel the next day and we didn't find nothing
If it was down there, they must have put it there
Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz
(defensively) Hey,  didn't imagine it
There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source
(nervously) Should  say that
doubt that they'd believe us
Louis moans and goes back to his notes
: -   - Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him
So like you were just trying to help out your old friend because she was scared and you didn't really mean to do anything bad and you really love the city and won't ever do anything like this again, right
Objection, your Honor
He's leading the witness
The witness is leading him
Sustained
Okay, let me rephrase that question
(to venkman) Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children
Yes,  did
We were city champs
Objection
Irrelevant and immaterial
Sustained
Mr
Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case
(to Venkman) Do
No,  think you've helped them enough already
(to the Judge) No,  guess not
(to the Prosecutor) Your witness
The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish
So, Dr
Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice
The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order
Keep that up, mister, and 'll find you in contempt
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that  can't resist
'll ask you again, Dr
Venkman
Why were you digging the hole
And please remember that you're under oath
had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but 'm going to tell you the truth
There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway
That's where we come in
So what are you saying
That the world of the supernatural is your special province
No,  guess 'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it
The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order
: - The trial is nearing its end
The Judge calls on Louis to make his summation
Does the counsel for the defense wish to make any final arguements
Louis rises
Your honor, may  approach the bench
(impatient) Yes
Louis crosses to the judge's bench
(to the judge) Can  have some of your water
Get on with it, counselor
(scared) Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the -- (he remembers there's no jury) audience
don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds
Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody
was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and  had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but don't blame them because once  turned into a dog and they helped me
Thank you
He goes back to the defense table and sits down
Stantz and Spengler hang their heads
Venkman pats Louis on the back
(to Louis) Way to go
Concise and to the point
He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation
That's it
That's all you have to say
Did  forget something
He searches through a disorderly pile of notes
That was unquestionably the worst presentation of a case 've ever heard in a court of law
ought to cite you for contempt and have you disbarred
As for your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz and Egon Spengler, on the charges of conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction of public property,  find you guilty on all counts
order you to pay fines in the amount of $25,000 each and  sentence you to eighteen months in the city correctional facility at Ryker's Island
He sees the activity in the jar Uh-oh, she's twitchin'
The Judge continues And on a more personal note, let me go on record as saying that there is no place in decent society for fakes, charlatans and tricksters like you who prey on the gullibility of innocent people
You're beneath the contempt of this court
And believe me, if my hands were not tied by the unalterable fetters of the law, a law which has become in my view far too permissive and inadequate in it's standards of punishment, would invoke the tradition of our illustrious forebearers, reach back to a sterner, purer justice and have you burned at the stake
He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily
Then he feels a    in the courtroom
The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar
Stantz anticipates big trouble
Under the table, boys
The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table
He stands up and looks around fearfully
-   - Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases
All eyes turn to the exhibit table
Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as  - explode out of the specimen jar
He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and recognizes them immediately
(in horror) Oh, my God
The Scoleri Brothers
Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten feet tall
They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still attached
Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to get at the Judge
Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the spectral intruders
(terrified) You've got to do something
Who are they
They're the Scoleri Brothers
tried them for murder
They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48
Now they want to kill me
Maybe they just want to appeal
They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense table and  it with - -
She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers
They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge with them
These boys aren't playing around
(desperately) You've got to stop them
Please
(thinking like a lawyer) Violating a judicial restraining order could expose my clients to serious criminal penalties
As their attorney 'd have to advise them against it
They start punching through the jury box
He is just about hysterical with fear
All right
All right
'm recinding the order
Case dismissed
(he pounds his gavel on the floor) Now do something
Let's go to work, boys
With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were being displayed as evidence
They strap them on hastily as the Brothers continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge
(slinging the pack onto his back) Geez,  forgot how heavy these things are
(grabbing other gear) Okay, let's heat 'em up
They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle throwers
All right, throwers
Set for full neutronas on stream
They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms
They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts them
Hey
Why don't you pick on someone your own size
The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot lightning at their new adversaries
(to the others) On my signal, boys
Open 'em up -- Now
They all pull their triggers and the wands  with incredible powerful   , doing even more damage to the courtroom
Spengs, take the door
Ray, let's try and work them down and into the corner
Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on the floor
Watch it
'm coming under you, Pete
They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers
Finally, Ray sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of light energy
Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now -- Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him down -- trapping -- trapping -- now
He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the traps which snap shut
-  - LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a ghost inside each trap
(checking the trap) Occupado
-  -  (  ) He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and looks around in total amazement
He crawls out from under a chair
Reporters and spectators get back on their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation
She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk
(to the Prosecutor) Brilliant summation
They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of them standing in the wrecked courtroom
Case closed, boys
We're back in business
The spectators cheer and applaud
: - The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground, dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted into place over the main entrance
It's just like the original "No Ghosts" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding up two fingers
Venkman enters the firehouse
(  -   ) - man and his wife are lying in bed reading
The man is played by Louis Tully and  , the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist, is playing his wife
They are both terrible actors
Suddenly, a ghost, actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom
Janine sees it and screams
What is it, honey
It's that darn ghost again
don't know what to do anymore
He just won't leave us alone
guess we'll just have to move
Don't worry
We're not moving
He is
He picks up the phone
Who are you going to call
(with a wink) Ghostbusters
As he starts to dial, the    to reveal the Ghostbusters standing in the bedroom
Their acting isn't much better than Louis and Janine's
Stantz speaks directly  the
'm Ray -- 'm Peter -- 'm Egon -- And we're the

That's right -- Ghostbusters
We're back and we're better than ever with twice the know-how and twice the particle-power to deal with all your supernatural elimination needs
During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b

pretending to trap the fake ghost
Careful, Winston
He's a mean one
( ) And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan
Hold on, Ray
Half-price
Have you gone crazy
guess so, Pete, because that's not all
Tell them what else we've got, Egon
Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them, waiting for his cue
You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids
He holds up a mug and a limp, uninflated balloon
You bet

He sniffs around, following the smell
Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really big -- He freezes
- ' Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing down Louis's bag lunch
Slimer looks up and sees Louis
They both scream and run off in opposite directions
He passes right through a wall and disappears
He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry
(screaming) Help
There's a thing
: -  () Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog along the track that circles the reservoir
One of the runners looks behind him at the sound of   and screams
ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace
Other runners stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them
Seemingly oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse
-  ( ) Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup
He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging track
He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting
As the ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit concealed control buttons
ghost trap buried in the track throws up a glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger
(checking his watch) You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect

: -    - The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the Ghostbusters enter the store
- All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the glass shelves and display tables
Stantz and Venkman are talking to the manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices positioned in each corner of the store
On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store
The manager watches in horror as all the  suddenly drops out of the air, through the   and  on the display tables

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the painting
As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana turns suddenly and catches the movement
Frightened now, she hastily leaves the studio
- Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area
We the floor and see a foot pedal, then   the cord  a ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk
Hanging from strings over the desk are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken
Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the chicken bait
He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to the chicken
His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal

The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy
Slimer dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down on Louis's desk

He slinks off, defeated
: -   - The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable  on the security desk
Rudy, the Security Guard, is reading a National Enquirer with a giant front-page headline:
Venkman enters
'm looking for Dana Barrett
Room 304 -- Restorations
(recognizing him) Hey
Dr
Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic
' 'm a big, big fan
That used to be one of my two favorite shows
(flattered) Thanks
What's the other one
'Bass Masters
'  It's a fishing show
Ever see it
Yeah, really great
Take it easy
He exits
-   -  ( ) Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer
Janosz is at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo
Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana
(looking at the Ver Meer) So this is what you do, huh
(glad to see him) Oh, hello, Peter
You're really good, you know
didn't paint it
'm just cleaning it
It's an original Ver Meer
It's worth about ten million dollars
He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana
Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life, holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do
You know you can go to Art World and get these huge sofa-size paintings for about forty-five bucks
He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio
'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art
As a matter of fact,  stopped by to tell you that  haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case
They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz
(smiling at Venkman) Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend
Oh, 'm sorry
This is Peter Venkman
Peter, Janosz Poha
Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up
(avoiding his gaze) Pleasure to meet you
've seen you on television
How are you
(looking over at the Vigo painting) What's that you're working on, Johnny
Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go
Venkman and Dana cross to the Vigo painting
Janosz steps protectively in front of it
It's a painting 'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition
It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian
He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century
(staring at the painting) Too bad for the Moldavians
(defensive) He was a very powerful magician
genius in many ways and quite a skilled painter
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman
hate this painting
've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room
You know what it needs
(picking up a brush) fluffy little white kitten in the corner
Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand
(with forced good will) We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr
Venkman
Well, 'd make an exception in this case if were you
Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman
(to Janosz) 'll let you get back to it
Nice meeting you
My pleasure
Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace
(confidentially) may be wrong, but  think you've got a little crush on this guy
Good-bye, Peter
(dragging his feet) 'd like to stay, but  really don't have time to hang around here
'll call you
(calls out to Janosz) Later, Johnny
He exits
Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench
She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the painting
As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana turns suddenly and catches the movement
Frightened now, she hastily leaves the studio
: -   -   - Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab area
Oh good, you're here
Spengler and  have something really amazing to show you
(to Spengler) It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it
Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among the  dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a Tupperware container
(to Venkman) We've been studying the stuff that we took from the subway tunnel
He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute
And now you're going to eat it
No, 'm just restoring it to its normal state
He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a large Petri dish
Now watch this
He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it
(simulating anger) You worthless piece of slime
(as the slime starts to twitch and glow) You ignorant disgusting blob
It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult
You foul, obnoxious muck
He continues venting his rage on the slime
've seen some real crud in my time, but you're a chemical disgrace
The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the Petri dish
They turn to Venkman for his reaction
He's dumbfounded
This is what you do with your spare time
(very excited) This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman
psychoreactive substance
Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states
'Mood slime
'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately
(poking at the slime) You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'
Like a goat on garbage
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction
What kind of tests
(a little embarrassed) Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things -- You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you
Spengler reacts as if he might be
It really responds to music
(to Spengler) Let's calm it down
Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to the slime specimen
It stops bubbling and starts to shrink
Does it have any favorites
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson
Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster
Watch this
Stantz turns on a   and Jackie Wilson's "  " from the speakers
It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the
He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat
don't care what you say
This could be a major Christmas gift item
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand
So we'll put a warning on the label
Stantz turns  the  and the toaster stops moving
Venkman looks at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot
(to the toaster) Go ahead
dare you
Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand and won't let go
The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and easily withdraws his hand
Just kidding
: '  - Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet
She's wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby
She turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby
(talking sweetly to the baby) Look at you
think we got more food on your shirt than we got in your mouth
The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the bottom of the tub
Dana reaches over and turns off the water without looking into the tub
When she turns away, both taps start to spin by themselves and the tub flexes and bulges
Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath into the tub
The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the bubble bath
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to close up around the baby like a hugh mouth
Dana screams, snatches the baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime
: '  -   () The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment
Venkman is asleep on the floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed just short of the bedroom
The  , he wakes up, lumbers to his feet and answers it
He opens the door and sees Dana standing there
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked, wrapped in a baby blanket
(somewhat embarrassed to be there) 'm sorry
Were you on your way out
(surprised to see her) No,  just got in -- a couple hours ago
Come on in
(noting her apparel) Are we having a pajama party
(upset) Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar
Venkman looks at her for a long moment
You know, if anyone else told me that, 'd have serious doubts
But coming from you, can't honestly say 'm surprised
must be losing my mind
At the museum today  could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me
Who could blame him
Were you wearing this nightgown
(distraught) don't know what to do anymore
'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub
You better stay here
He exits to the bathroom
She looks around the loft, amazed at the disorder
Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and takes Oscar from her
Now this kid has a serious nudity problem
He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts tying it around him like a diaper
(to the baby) This is Joe Namath's old number, you know
You could get a lot of chicks with this
Just don't pee in it
Peter, what about the bathtub
(grabs the phone and dials) We'll take care of that
(on the phone) Ray, Pete
Listen, get over to Dana's right away
Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid
It was full of this awful pink ooze
(to Ray) Sounds like another slime job
No, they're all right
They're here now
Right
Let me know
He hangs up
They're going over there right now
You might as well make yourself at home
Let me show you around
(he crosses to the kitchen area) This is the cuisine de maison -- It's an incredible mess
The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the counters are littered with all sorts of food trash
He grabs a big open Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it
(looking at the sink) We may have to wash some of these if you get hungry -- (he looks in the fridge) -- but there's no food anyway so forget about it
have all kinds of carry-out menus if you feel like ordering
He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then crosses to the bathroom
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know
He goes into the bathroom and we hear  , the and more items going into the Hefty bag
(
) The shower works but it's a little tricky
They're both marked "Hot
"  It takes a little practice, but at least this one won't try and eat you
He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his shoulder
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter
But the bed's good and  just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free
In fact,  think you should definitely plan on spending the night here
Really
And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements
For me it's best if  sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me
If we go the other way 'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby
Or we could do that
Thank you
(she picks up Oscar) Poor baby
think  should put him down now
'll put him down for you
(taking the baby) You are way too short
And your belly-button sticks out
You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother
Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer
: -  ( ) Venkman is waiting in front of the building as -2 pulls up and Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment
Did you find anything at Dana's
Nothing
Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub
But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned
found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen
Listen to this: (reads from xerox of entry) "Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --" hundred and five years
He really hung on, didn't he
And he didn't die of old age either
He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered
guess he wasn't too popular at the end there
No, not exactly a man of the people
(reads) "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy
" This guy was a bad monkey
He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy
Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window
'll be back
" That's it
"'ll be back
" It's a rough translation from the Moldavian
They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment
-   -  ( ) Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter
Hey, Dr
Venkman
What's going on
We're just going up to Restorations for a minute
Oh,  can't let you do that
Mr
Poha told me not to let you up there anymore
(with mock seriousness) Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but think you can be trusted
Tell him, Ray
(very official) Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic, subfusionary flux in this building
We got a flux
You got a flux and a half
Now if you don't want to be the -- (he counts) -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift,  suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear
" Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters head upstairs
-   -  ( ) Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter
He rushes over and stops them at the door
Dr
Venkman
Dana is not here
know
Then why have you come
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list
Your name was first
(to Spengler and Winston) Let's sweep it, boys
They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices
(to Janosz) You know,  never got to ask you
Where you from, Johnny
(nervous) The Upper West Side
(consulting his  meter) This entire room is extremely hot, Peter
What exactly are you looking for, Dr
Venkman
We'll know when we find it
You just sit tight
This won't take long
Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio
Venkman comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels
This is the one that looked at Dana
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio
People start imagining things -- (interrupts) 'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory
If she says it looked at her, it looked at her
(to Vigo) Hey, you
Vigie
Look at me
'm talking to you
Hey
Look at me when 'm talking to you
They watch the painting for any sign of movement
His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance
Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo
(to Vigo) Beautiful, beautiful
Work with me, baby
Just have fun with it
(to Stantz) Okay, he's playing it cool
Let's finish up and get out of here
'll get one more reading
Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting
Stantz scans the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's
His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul
He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle transformation occurs within him
Winston comes up behind him and breaks the spell
(looking at the painting) Now that's one ugly dude
(coming back to his senses) Huh
What
You finished here
(distracted) What
Yeah
Are you all right
You coming down with something
No, 'm fine
just got light-headed for a second there
Let's go
They head for the door
He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door
So you see, everything is in order, is it not
Not
Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities
We'll be back
They exit
: -  () The Ghostbusters cross to -2
There's definitely something going on in that studio
The  levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red
'd put my money on that Vigo character
Yeah, that's a safe bet
(to Stantz) You and Spengman see what else you can dig up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha
Those two were made for each other
-2 -  () The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse
Stantz is at the wheel
His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense
Stantz swerves suddenly and  the horn angrily
(to another driver) Idiot
(honking) Move it, you jerk
Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks
-  ( ) Stantz drives extremely fast,  vindictively, weaving dangerously through traffic
-2 -  ( ) Winston looks at Ray, concerned
Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray
Stantz turns on him
(viciously) Are you telling me how to drive
No,  just thought -- Well don't think
He  again and tromps hard on the accelerator
-  () Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue
Pedestrians leap to safety as Stantz runs a red light
-2 -  ( ) They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride
(to Stantz, really worried now) Are you crazy, man
You're going to kill somebody
Stantz looks at him and smile demonically
No, 'm going to kill everybody
He swerves off the road
-2 -  ( ) The car heads right for a big tree
-2 -  ( ) At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel and steps across to stomp on the brakes
-2 -  ( ) The car skids into the tree and stops
The Ghostbusters stumble out dazed and shaken, but unhurt
Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the others, completely at a loss
(himself again) What happened
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license
Are you all right
Yeah,  guess so
It was the strangest thing
knew what  was doing but couldn't stop
This really terrible feeling came over me and --  don't know --  just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all
Whew
Sorry, boys
They inspect the damage to the car
(confidentially, to Spengler) Watch him, Egon
Don't even let him shave
: '  -  () There's a  at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small suitcase of Dana's
(calls out) 'm home
He looks around the large open loft
(to himself) knew it
She cleaned
He hears the   and crosses to the bathroom
The door is half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through the transparent vinyl curtain
He closes the bathroom door and looks at the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling off
Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel
She jumps back into the bathroom
She comes out again, this time wearing a robe
Are you all squeaky clean now
(humoring him) Yes, 'm very clean
Did they find anything at my apartment
She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door
(through the door) Nothing
They stayed there all night, went through your personal stuff, made a bunch of long-distance phone calls and cleaned out your refrigerator
And didn't find anything
Dana opens the bedroom door
They didn't find anything
In the bathtub the pink ooze
nothing
So, what do do now
Now you get dressed and we go out
got a babysitter and everything
Trust me, you need it
'm not here to date
can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone  don't know
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff
She's one of my most valuable employees
Does she know anything about babies
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding
(handing her the flowers) Do  have a vase
brought some of your clothes
Wear something intriguing brought along some interesting possibilities
Okay, but it's not a date
It's a dinner
She smiles and closes the door again
He opens the closet and starts looking for his good suit
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here
(
) put them in your hamper
thought they were dirty
(shaking his head) have a hamper
Next time ask me first, okay
have more than two grades of laundry
There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty
He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them
These aren't so bad yet
You just hang them up for a while and they're fine
: -   - Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights
Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs
She starts primping and freshening up her makeup
-   - Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once and for all
He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband
(to himself) Okay, Stinky, this is it
Showdown time
You and me, pal
You think you're smarter than  am
We'll see about that
(loud) Oh, hello, Pizza Man
Oh, two larges only ordered one
Oh, pepperoni and pineapple
My absolute favorite
guess 'll have to eat these both by myself
Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging upside down
He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror
(quietly) Okay, let's boogie
He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a gash across the ceiling
Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and strikes the wall behind her
Slimer disappears
(embarrassed and apologetic) Oh migod
'm sorry
didn't mean to do that
It was an accident
What are you doing up here
was trying to get that smelly green thing
The guys asked me to help out
'm like the fifth Ghostbuster
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt
Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down
Have you made any plans yet
You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve
No,  celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first
That way  beat the crowds
That's very practical
hate going out on New Year's Eve, too
There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave
Well, good night, Louis
(on an impulse) Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home
'd like to, but  told Dr
Venkman 'd babysit
(seductively) Do you want to babysit with me
Oh, sure, that sounds great
They exit
: '  -  () There is a  at the door and Venkman goes to answer it
He's dressed for the evening and looking very dapper
'  -   - Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection jars and photographic equipment
They look like they're rigged out for a major spelunking expedition
(ushering them in) Don't tell me, let me guess
All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow
We thought you might want to come along
Darn it
wish 'd known you were going
'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters
Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population
Roach breeding
Sounds better and better
(calls out) Dana
The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime
Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge
Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead
Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful
Wow
Dana looks curiously at their outfits
Hi
They nod and wave back
(to Ray and Egon) think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys
Let me know what you find out
(on his exit) Okay, but you're missing all the fun
-  () Stantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station, guided by a very old map of the underground city
This is it
Van Horne Station
Right where the old transit map said it would be
They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime
Let's get a sounding on the depth of that flow
Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of it attached to his utility belt
Stand back
He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and casts it out into the middle of the flow
The plumb bob sinks and Spengler reads the depth
Six feet -- seven -- eight -- That's it
It's on the bottom
Nine feet -- ten -- Is the line sinking
No, the slime is rising
Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the platform and around his boots
(alarmed) Let's get out of here, boys
He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck
Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger than all three of them
As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt
Spengler lets go in time but Winston doesn't
He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow
Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in after him
: -  () Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne
(very intimate) Here's to -- us
She sighs and drinks
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions
want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real
All right, you want to be real
So tell me why did you dump me
Oh, Peter,  didn't dump you
just had to protect myself
You really weren't very good for me, you know
'm not even good for me
Why do you say things like that
You're so much better than you know
Thank you
If  had that kind of support on a daily basis,  could definitely shape up by the turn of the century
(already feeling the effects of the champagne) So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000
Let me jingle you right now
He leans over to kiss her
Maybe  should call Janine
Don't worry
Janine has a very special way with children
They kiss
: -  ( ) Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby
(looking around) can't believe a person could actually live like this
(to the baby) So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them
It's really not a bad place
It just needs a woman's touch
(continuing) So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which 'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so  guess it's all right
can finish this later if you're tired
Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down
You're really good with children, Louis can tell
(as he returns) Why don't you come here and sit with me
Okay
He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa
(getting close) Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me
'd like to have a baby myself
Wouldn't you
(gulps) Tonight
-   -  ( ) manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below
It slides away, and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler
They are exhausted and covered with slime
(uncharacteristically angry) Nice going, Ray
What were you trying to do -- drown me
(unusually mean) Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line
(shoves him) You better watch your mouth, man, or 'll punch your lights out
Oh yeah
Anytime, anytime
Just go ahead and try it
Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one
(putting up his fists) Who wants it first
Come on, Ray
Try me, sucker
(squaring off) Butt out, you pencil-necked geek
've had it with you
They grab each other and start to tussle
Suddenly Spengler comes to his senses and pulls them apart
(forcefully) Strip
Right now
Get out of those clothes
He starts yanking off his slicker and waders
Bewildered, Stantz and Winston start doing the same
Spengler helps pull off their clothes and throws them into the open manhole
Now wearing only long underwear, they seem to return to normal
What are we doing
Ray,  was ready to kill you
Don't you see
It's the slime
That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil
Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the museum
And it's all flowing right to this spot
: -  ( ) The  ' looks up in surprise as Stantz, Spengler and Winston enter the restaurant wearing only long underwear
' (intercepting them) Can  help you
Stantz looks around and spots Venkman
That's all right,  see him
They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass
He's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston coming toward him through the restaurant
(very excited) You should've been there, Venkman
Absolutely incredible
Yeah, sorry  missed it
(noting their attire) guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here
It's really kind of a coat and tie place
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually
Rivers of the stuff
And it's all flowing toward the museum
He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and lands on a well-dressed diner
(calls out) Sorry
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else
Venkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues aside
(confidentially) Boys, listen
You're scaring the straights
Let's save this until tomorrow, okay
(to Venkman) This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman
It's hot and it's ready to pop
' He hurries through the restaurant with two city  right behind him and makes straight for Venkman's table
' Arrest these men
(recognizing them) Hey
It's the Ghostbusters
You're out of uniform, gentlemen Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look
(self-conscious) Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but forget that
We have to see the mayor as soon as possible
Look, Doc, why don't you just go home
You'll get a good night's sleep and then you can give the mayor a call in the morning
Come on
He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists
We're not going anywhere with you
told you we have to see the mayor now
(grabbing Stantz) 'm warning you
You can come along peaceably or -- (grabs the Cop) Hey, don't be an idiot
This is serious
(angry) Look, pal, keep this up and you're going with them
Oh, yeah
(has had enough) Yeah, let's go
You're all under arrest
The Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the restaurant
(to Dana) Finish your dessert -- it's already paid for
'll call you
They all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners
'  -  ( ) The police car is parked right behind Ecto-2
Spengler stops at the police car and confronts the cops
Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy
This is a matter of vital importance
Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags
What are you doing
just want to get your names right for when the mayor asks us why we didn't let him know about this sooner
The Cops look at each other, uncertain about what to do
(relenting) Okay, Doc
You want to see the mayor, you got it
Follow us
They head for their respective vehicles
: '  -  ( ) Louis and Janine are on the sofa making out when Dana enters
They jump up and start smoothing their clothes
(embarrassed) Oh, hello, Dana
we were just -- we were -- know what you were doing, Louis
It's all right
How was your date
Typical
Peter was arrested
Has he called
No, nobody called
Dana frowns
Is everything all right with Oscar
Oh, he's fine
He's such a good baby
He was a little fussy at first, but we gave him a Freach bread pizza and he went right to sleep
(relieved) Oh, good
'll just check on him
She crosses to the bedroom
'  -  ( ) Dana looks at Oscar sleeping peacefully on the bed
She starts to change clothes
'   -  ( ) Louis and Janine aren't sure what to do
Should we go
don't think we should leave her alone
You're right
We should stay
He grabs Janine and they start making out again
: -  ( ) Janosz stands before the painting of Vigo
Vigo comes to life and repeats the litany of his power
, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia -- (heard all this before) Yes, the scourge -- -- the sorrow of Moldavia -- -- the sorrow -- command you
(checking his watch) await the word of Vigo
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year
Bring me the child that might live again
(abjectly humble) Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong
was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if  bring the baby, could have the woman
So be it
On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me
: -  () Preceded by a police car, Ecto-2 enters the small park on the East River at 88th Street and disappears into an underground entrance
The to reveal Gracie Mansion, the residence of the Mayor of New York City
- The Ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors
The butler knocks lightly, then opens the door to reveal the  sitting in front of the fireplace in his well-appointed private study, flanked by Jack Hardemeyer, both in tuxedoes
The Ghostbusters enter
- The Mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of his formal reception
He frowns at their bizarre attire
All right -- the Ghostbusters
'll tell you right now; 've got two hundred of the heaviest campaign contributors in the city out there eating bad roast chicken waiting for me to give the speech of my life
You've got two minutes
Make it good
You get enough negative energy flowing in a dense environment like Manhattan, it starts to build up, and if we don't do something fast this whole place will blow like a frog on a hotplate
Tell him about the toaster
don't think he's ready for the toaster
(shaking his head) Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker's God-given right
What am  supposed to do -- go on television and tell eight million people they have to be nice to each other
'm sorry, none of this makes any sense to me, and if anything does happen we've got plenty of paid professionals to deal with it
Your two minutes are up
Good night, gentlemen
The mayor exits, leaving the Ghostbusters to Hardemeyer
(smirking) That's quite a story
Yeah,  think the Times might be interested, don't you
The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too
Hardemeyer's eyes go cold and calculating
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown
Now you're talking
: -   -  () An attendant opens a locked door with a wire mesh window and the Ghostbusters, in straitjackets, are led into the psych ward as Hardemeyer confers with the chief
(protesting) 'm telling you, we're not crazy
He is
He laughs off the remark
(to the Psychiatrist) The mayor wants them kept under strict observation for a few days
We think they're seriously disturbed and potentially dangerous
We'll do whatever's necessary
Hardemeyer shakes his hand and exits as the door slams shut on the Ghostbusters
'  -  ( ) Louis and Janine are watching an old rerun on , eating popcorn, while Dana is stretched out on the other sofa
(wishing they'd leave) You know you really don't have to stay
Peter should be back soon
Oh no, we don't mind
She hears a little  from the nursery and sits up
Excuse me
think Oscar is up
She crosses to the bedroom
'  -  ( ) Dana enters and immediately notices that the crib is empty and the window is open
(screams) Louis
Frantic now, Dana rushes to the window and looks out, as Louis and Janine come running in
- '  -  () The baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building, fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's waiting for something
-  () ( ) Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby
Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes
They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition
'  - sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground
Her face looks remarkably like Janosz Poha's
The nanny extends her hand to the who  sweetly as he reaches out to take it
She watches in helpless horror
(screams) No
She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and smiles at Dana
The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby
She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through the window assisted by Louis and Janine
(resolutely) Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him what happened
(confused and worried) Where're you going
To get my baby back
: -  (  ) taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum
The moment the door closes behind her, there is a loud , the ground trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the building
: -   -  ( ) Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are in a padded cell
They are handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their waists
Venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical Psychiatrist
We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian is alive in a painting at the Manhattan Museum
see
And are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them
(impatient) You're wasting valuable time
We have reason to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been collecting under the city
Yes, tell me about the slime
It's potent stuff
We made a toaster dance with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his friend's baby
The psychiatrist looks at Venkman
Don't look at me
think they're nuts
: -  ( ) Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in eerie white light
Oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the painting of Vigo
Dana enters cautiously and sees the baby
Seeing no one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and intact
(
) knew you would come
Startled, Dana turns at the sound of his voice as Janosz steps out from behind the Vigo painting
(defiantly) What do you want with my baby
No harm will come to the child
You might even say it's a privilege
He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo
And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world
Doesn't that sound nice
If this is what the world will be like, don't want to live in it
(confidentially, indicating Vigo) don't believe we have the luxury of choice
Everybody has a choice
Not in this case, my dear
Take a look
That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there
He's Vigo
don't care who he is
He's not taking my baby
Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms, floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle
She turns and looks at Vigo, for the first time feeling his power
You will see
It's all for the best
: -  ( ) It's the last day of the year and the sun is shining brightly
: -  ( ) The Ghostbusters are sitting in the dayroom, a dingy lounge for patients in the locked ward
There is a television set, a Ping-Pong table and a few tables and chairs
Stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy wire mesh covering the windows
This is it
boys
It's starting
Shit-storm 2000
Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom
It better not start yet
'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true
at the next table joins the discussion
(with certainty) 1997
My dog told me
What kind of dog
Labrador
(shakes his head) Habitual liars
They can't help it
It's in the breed
: -   -  ( ) Louis is pleading with his cousin,  , a doctor on the staff at Parkview
He looks and sounds just like Louis
Come on, Sherm
You're my cousin
Do this for me
'm begging you
can't do it, Louis
It isn't ethical could lose my license
Why can't you just have them released
You're a doctor
'm a dermatologist
can't write orders on the psych ward
Sherman, 've done lots of favors for you
Like what
got you out of those bad tax shelters
You were the one who got me in
fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she
Yeah,  had to give her free dermabrasion for a year
Forget it, Louis
could get in a lot of trouble
'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast
That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back
It's just a scared little baby, Sherm
Then you should go to the police
don't believe in any of that stuff
Sherman looks out the window
- ' The sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed
-   - The room goes dark
Louis switches on a lamp which casts an eerie light on his face
(spooky) Do you believe it now, Sherm
: -  () drainpipe starts dripping slime into the river near the Cunard Line docks
: (59TH  ) -  () With the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout psycho-reactive slime
well-heeled  and  step out of a limousine and walk up the steps toward the revolving door
She looks up at the sky and frowns
(shrewish) told you we should have stayed in Palm Beach
The weather here gets stranger every year
Yes, dear
She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat
The doorman nods courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs
She yelps in pain
(to the doorman) Something just bit me
The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat comes alive
pop out of the thick fur, ,  and , their sharp, little teeth biting the air
Reacting quickly, the doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror
The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street
: -  () The squad room is busy as  try to answer the flood of calls regarding the wave of supernatural events sweeping the city
(on the phone) Look, lady, of course there are dead people there
It's a cemetery
(his face falls) They were asking you for directions
(on another phone) Was this a big dinosaur or a little dinosaur
Oh, just the skeleton, huh
Well, where is it now
(on the phone) Wait a second -- the park bench was chasing you
You mean, someone was chasing you in the park
No, the bench itself was chasing you
see -- weary  answers a
Manhattan Central, Flaherty speaking
Yeah
yeah
What
Who is this
Wait a second
He puts the caller on "Hold" and turns the
Lieutenant,  think you better talk to this guy
(on another call) What is it
'm talkin' here
It's some dock supervisor down at Pier 34 on the Hudson
The guy's going nuts
What's the problem
(takes a deep breath) He says the Titanic just arrived
-  () The dock supervisor stands there with the phone in his hand, an assistant beside him, both staring out the window at the ocean liner tied up at the pier
34 -   -  () The name "
Titanic" is clearly visible on the side of the huge ship
The gangplank is down and dozens of drowned passengers, sopping wet and festooned with seaweed, are disembarking while drowned porters off-load their waterlogged baggage
: -  ( )() Ecto-2 is parked outside as Louis and Sherman come out of the hospital with the Ghostbusters, now wearing their standard uniforms
Good work, Louis
How did you get us out
Oh,  pulled a few strings
wouldn't want to say any more than that
Louis winks conspiratorially at Sherman
This is my cousin Sherman
Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters
(sotto voce to Stantz) promised him a ride in the car if he got you out
(to the Ghostbusters) Hi, it's really great to meet you guys know this sounds weird but once  had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but  knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that -- While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ectomobile and drive off, leaving him and Louis standing at the curb
Hey
Wait
Okay, 'll meet you there
thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster
let them handle all the little stuff just come in on the big ones
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (original version of the above scene - 11/27/88) (' : These two versions of this scene were put in my copy of the script, so  have included both of them here) Actually, they still think you're crazy, but convinced them you're not dangerous
(determined) Yeah, well guess again
-  ()( ) Ecto-2 is parked outside and the Ghostbusters are hastily donning their standard uniforms
brought everything you asked for and gassed up the car with Super Unleaded
It cost twenty cents more than Regular Unleaded but you get much better performance and in an old car like this that'll end up saving you money in the long run
put it on my credit card, so you can either reimburse me or  can take it out of petty cash -- While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ecto-2 and drive off without him
Hey
Wait
Okay, 'll meet you there
: ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -  ()() -2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum
Hundreds of spectators are already there gawking at the building as the Ghostbusters jump out and gape at the sight that greets them
- The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime
and  are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches, jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make a dent
They size up the situation as they don their proton packs
It looks like a giant Jello mold
hate Jello
They stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to the museum
(to the Fire Captain) Okay, give it a rest, Captain
We'll take it from here
(skeptical) Be my guest
We been cutting here for three hours
What the hell's going on
You know the Titanic arrived this morning
Well, better late than never
The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers
(monitoring valences) Full neutronas, maser assist
They adjust their settings and prepare to fire
Throw 'em
They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime
(to the firemen) Okay, who knows "Cumbaya
" few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands
Venkman grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum
All right
Nice and sweet -- (starts singing) Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya -- Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding hands and swaying to the music
(singing) Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya
Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime
Forget it
The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff
Good effort
Now what
Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray
It won't work
There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell
can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back
Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy
And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you
But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg
We just have to mobilize it
We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol -- His eyes fall on -2's New York State license plate which features a line drawing of the Statue of Liberty
(he sees it, too) Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us -- Something good -- And pure -- And decent
-  ( ) There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives with a police escort
Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor himself and they cross to the museum entrance
Hardemeyer, his  and several police  confront the Ghostbusters
Look, 've had it with you
Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here
This is a city matter and everything's under control
Oh, you think so
Well, 've got news for you
You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid
Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants
And that's just round one
Are you telling me there're people trapped in there
(to his assistant) This is dynamite
Call
,
, and and get them down here right away
When the police bring this kid out  want them to hand it right to the mayor and want it all on camera
Mr
Mayor, if we don't do something by midnight, you're going to go down in history as the man who let New York get sucked down into the tenth level of hell
The Mayor stops to consider the situation
(to the Fire Captain) Can you get into that museum
If  had a nuclear warhead, maybe
The Mayor turns to Venkman
You know why all these things are happening
We tried to tell you last night, but Mr
Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony bin
Hardemeyer flips out
This is preposterous
You can't seriously believe all this mumbo-jumbo
It's the Twentieth Century, for crying out loud
(viciously, to Venkman) Look, mister,  don't know what this stuff is or how you got it all over the museum, but you better get it off and  mean right now
He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily through the slime curtain
Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the slime
(to Venkman) Okay, just tell me what you need
: (  ) - With the city skyline in the b
g
, the Ghostbusters prepare their equipment
Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks, hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators
Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it
Wonder what
If she's naked under that toga
She's French, you know
There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons of iron and steel
Stantz is looking worried
hope we have enough stuff to do the job
Only one way to find out
(to Stantz) Ready, Teddy
They enter the statue
: - The Ghostbusters are working from the iron staircase that spirals straight up 100 feet inside the hollow super-structure of the statue
Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to various relays on the interior surface of the statue
Venkman and Stantz are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase
They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks and gives the order
Okay, boys
Let's frost it
They begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho-reactive slime
: -  ( ) Janine watches as Louis, wearing a Ghostbuster uniform, slings a heavy proton pack onto his back
'm not sure this is such a good idea
Do they know you're doing this
Oh, yeah, sure -- no
But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum
You're very brave, Louis
Good luck
She kisses Louis and he gets extremely self-conscious
Uh -- oh -- well,  better hurry
He rushes out
-  ( ) Louis stands on the street corner waiting for a bus
Finally, a bus pulls up, Louis climbs aboard and finds Slimer behind the wheel
: -   - Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are standing in the observation windows in the crown of the statue
It looks like they're on the bridge of an ocean liner, then the    to reveal the head of the statue
He plugs the main cable lead into a transformer
It's all yours, Pete
(checks his watch) There's not much time left
Venkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat
(giving the downbeat) Okay, one, two, three, four -- He hits "Play" on the Walkman and "  "  from the huge , amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior
-  ( ) The head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to the rail and manage to keep their feet
She's moving
've lived in New York all my life and never visited the Statue of Liberty
Now finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk
(reading the Giga-meter) We've got full power
Stantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and starts pushing the buttons
(into a microphone) Okay, Libby
Let's get it in gear
They feel a strong vibration and the statue starts to move
: - New Years Eve celebrants line the riverfront, pointing and gawking at an incredible sight
-   -  ( ) The statue is moving up the river almost completely submerged, only her head from the nose up is visible above the surface
-  ( ) Winston looks out apprehensively
How deep does it get
That water's cold and can't swim
It's okay
have my Senior Lifesaving card
With a water temperature of forty degrees we'd survive approximately fifteen minutes
Stantz studies a maritime navigational chart
'll keep to the middle of the channel
We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th
Are you kidding
We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th
'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth
Trust me,  used to drive a cab
: -  ( ) Spectators cheer wildly, inspired by the sight of the Statue
: -  ( ) Janosz is sitting next to Dana, still wheedling her with promises and self-serving logic
Time is running out, Dana
Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's
Well, mainly Vigo's
But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship
We don't have a relationship
know
Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son
There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god
'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment
And perhaps a car and free parking
hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul could never forgive what you've done to me and my child
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while  believe we could learn to love each other
Think about it
'd rather not
: -  ( ) People are jammed together shoulder to shoulder filling Times Square, watching the big Seiko clock count down the last ten minutes to midnight
Suddenly, they look down Broadway and see a magnificent sight
-  ( ) The Statue of Liberty is walking up Broadway approaching 42nd Street, with "Higher and Higher"  from the  inside
great cheer goes up, and the crowd goes wild with joy, dancing and singing along with the
-  () Spengler reads the Giga-meter
It's working
The positive GeV's are climbing
(patting the Statue) They love you, Lib
Keep it up
: -  () The avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all the side streets
squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around the corner at 72nd Street and proceeds up Fifth Avenue in the direction of the museum
Then  is heard  in the distance, the ground shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng
: -  ( ) The Ghostbusters can see the museum ahead
So far so good
(worried) 'm worried
The vibrations could shake her to pieces
We should have padded her feet
don't think they make Nikes in her size
We're almost there, Lib
(to Stantz) Step on it
-  ( ) The Statue's huge foot comes down and squashes a car
-  ( ) The Ghostbusters look down at the flattened car
(shouts out the window) My Fault
(shouts) She's new in town
: -   - Janosz is painting the last of the mystical symbols on the baby's chest
: -  ( ) The people still in the square start counting off the last ten seconds to midnight and the New Year
(chanting) Ten
nine
eight
seven
: -  - strange light spreads over the painting
As the light moves onto his face, Vigo spreads his arms wide and his upper body starts to emerge from the canvas
Soon my life begins
Then woe to the weak, all power to me, the world is mine
-  - The baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it
Then suddenly a dark shadow falls across the skylight
Janosz looks up
- '  -  - The Statue of Liberty is looming over the skylight looking down on Janosz with an expression of righteous anger on it's face
-  ( ) Kneeling beside the museum, the statue draws back it's mighty right arm and smashes the skylight with its torch
-  ( ) Janosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the Ghostbusters come sliding down ropes into the studio and confront Janosz with their new weapons
Quick as a flash, Dana seizes the moment, dashes across the studio and snatches the baby from Vigo's outstretched arms
(to Janosz) Happy New Year
-   -  ( ) Vigo bellows in rage
-  -  ( ) Janosz steps in front of the painting
Hi there
Feel free to try something stupid
Janosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo
You pitiful, miserable creatures
You dare to challenge the power of darkness
Don't you realize what you are dealing with
He's Vigo
You are like the buzzing of flies to him
(sighs) Oh, Johnny
Did you back the wrong horse
With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from head to toe, blowing him into the corner
Then they turn to Vigo
He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the knees down
He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash his magic powers
They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been neutralized by the good will of the people
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey
The whole city's together on this one
We took a vote
Everybody's down on you, you know
(arming his slime-blower) Say goodnight now
Suddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield
Don't shoot
You'll hit Ray
(strangling) Do it
Just do it
Winston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray
He bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting
-  - The paint turns liquid, melts off the canvas and runs onto the floor revealing another painting underneath it
-  -  ( ) Venkman, Spengler and Winston rush over to Ray and kneel beside him
He is completely covered with slime and motionless
(examining him) He's breathing
Winston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man
(smiles lovingly) Groovy
've never felt better in my life
Oh, no
We've got to live with this
They pull him to his feet
love you guys
You're the best friends 've ever had
He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well
Venkman recoils in disgust
Hey,  just had this suit cleaned
(indicating Janosz) Take care of the wiggler, will you
Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby
She hugs Venkman
What is this -- a love in
(notes the symbols painted on the baby's body) Hey, sailor
think the tattoos are a little much, don't you
He picks up the baby
(to Venkman) think he likes you
think  do too
Finally came to your senses, huh
They hug and kiss
, They help Janosz to his feet
He's dazed but unhurt
(restored to normalcy) What happened
(calmly) Sir, you had a violent, prolonged, transformative psychic episode
But it's over now
Want a coffee
(extremely nice) That's very kind of you
(to Stantz) He's fine, Ray
Physically intact, psychomagnetherically neutral
Is that good
It's where you want to be
As they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by Vigo's self-portrait
Late Renaissance,  think
Caravaggio or Brunelleschi
(staring at it) There's something very familiar about this painting
-   - It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby
One holds a harp, one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword
Most remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston
: -  ( ) city bus pulls up near the museum and Louis steps off
He waves his thanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel
(to Slimer) Okay, so Monday night we'll get something to eat and maybe go bowling
Can you bowl with those little arms
and  a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps
Okay,  have to go save Dana
'll see you later
: -  ( ) The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come out the main entrance with Dana and the baby
Everybody starts singing "Auld Lang Syne
"  Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and finds the Ghostbusters
Am  too late
No, you're right on time
Stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him
-  ( ) Hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime
He looks at the celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears
(weepy) Happy New Year, everybody
He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne
" : -  () The Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind the museum, her toga up over her knees
The Mayor looks nearly suicidal
The Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating
She's all right
She's just sleeping it off
(stricken) We just had it restored
This probably isn't a good time to bring this up, but the last time we did a job for the city you stiffed us
(handing the Mayor an invoice) This is a bill for tonight's job
The Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount
What
This is way too much
(hands the bill back to Venkman) We won't pay
Venkman looks at the Statue
(to Stantz) think she looks pretty good here, don't you
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island
Realizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back
All right, all right
If you can wait until Monday 'll issue you a check
Sorry
No checks
Company policy
: -  ( ) The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she belongs
The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests
(looking up at the statue) Pretty impressive, huh
(musing) It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country
From where -- Neptune
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland
Ostrov
've been there
Good party town
(in a similarly reflective mood) My great-grandparents were Swiss
still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived
Oh, right, you told me that
They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as recall
How about you, Winston
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man
And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either
What are you, Dana
Miss Blue Blood
Her family's been here since the year 12
That's not true
It was 1620
Same difference
What's your story, Pete
Me
'm a little of everything
Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around
And that's what made this country great
That's a terrible thing to say
So what
It's a free country
(looking up at the Statue) Thanks, Lib
They all look up at the Statue
-    - Slimer flies out one of the observation windows,     and the    and   the island  a   of the Statue, lower Manhattan and the shining sea beyond
