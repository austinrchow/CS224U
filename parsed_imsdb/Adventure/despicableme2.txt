2 Written by Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio :   - Snow and ice as far as the eye can see
What looks like a windowless   surrounded by barbed wire fences sits in the middle of the wasteland
:
At the  , two   play poker using an overturned barrel as a table
Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds
and four Aces
The other Guard folds
Russian Guard 1  and drags in the pile of coins
While he    and does a celebratory dance, the coins fly up into the air
Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and sees that the coins are gone
He accuses the other Guard of stealing them
Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them
Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly, until it flies up into the air
They both look up to see where it's gone
Then the metal barrel they were using as a table flies up, knocking them over
Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a watchtower guard shouts
door below opens as a bunch of Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship
Then
All of their guns are pulled up towards the ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to their guns
lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet
Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from the ground
Then-- The lab makes contact with the ship
It flies up and down, shaking the scientists and guards off
They fall to the ground
The magnet ship flies away with their lab, vehicles, and weapons
The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the snow with the remnants of the damaged base
We see a porta- potty door open
Confused Guard is sitting on the can reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident
He closes the door
: 2             &     2
:   - of the research station named   being carried away by the magnet ship plays on the screens at Headquarters
We see the back of several heads watching the footage
There's a heavy sigh
Three weeks and we're still no closer to cracking this
No response
(') Right
bring him in
(
) Yes, sir
:   - Gru steps toward camera, holding some sort of menacing gun, which he loads and cocks
He pulls the trigger, which shoots out an inflatable unicorn balloon
Smiling, he ties it to the windowsill next to some others
: '  - banner reads: "Happy Birthday Agnes
" and a massive backyard party is in full swing
The yard is decorated with pink balloons and streamers, and a   shaped like a castle
and several other   slide down a slide
They are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a princess riding a unicorn
This is the best party
Edith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades, and boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her
She jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap
Haha
Yeah
2            &         3
Two   fish in a small kiddie pool
One of the girls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl, but then a   jumps out and eats the toy duck
and a  sword fight
The Boy does a bunch of fancy moves
The Girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him on the head with a club
Two kids in the background are on a see-saw made of bombs
Agnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen
Oh no
dragon is approaching
All of the kids turn and see  dressed as a dragon
He and then they  and huddle around Agnes
Then Margo enters wearing a    and wielding a
Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us
She gestures to a group of minions wearing tiny suits of armor and wielding various
The Kids as the minions charge toward Kyle
One accidentally hits another with his sword
fight ensues in which they use the medieval weapons on each other
One minion pounds another with a
One Minion wanders off from the fight with his helmet on backwards, wildly swinging his mace
Across the yard, Gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on the phone
Not happy
No, no, no
What do you mean she's not coming
have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess
The mace-swinging Minion walks by and accidently, repeatedly hits Gru with the mace in the shin
(') Ah
Hurts
Ah
Stop it
Gru kicks the minion's helmet and chases him off with a spatula, sending him towards the party swinging his mace
Gru  and returns to the call
2               &     4
(') Listen
don't want a refund want a fairy princess
please
Please,  am begging you
(Resigned) You know what
hope that you can sleep at night, you crusher of little girls' dreams
Gru hits the phone with his spatula and hangs up
Turns and sees Agnes standing there
Ooh ooh
When's the Fairy Princess coming
Gru stares down at Agnes' big excited eyes
He opens his mouth to tell her the truth, but can't do it
Any minute now
Agnes squeals with excitement and runs off
Yayyy
Gru looks worried--what do  do now
He signals two minions
Stall them
:  - hand-painted piece of cardboard reading "  " is placed on an easel
Agnes and all of the little kids sit in a semicircle on the grass
Two minions dressed as magicians are doing a magic act with Edith as their assistant
One minion blows up a balloon and puts it in Edith's mouth
Then the other whips out a  and fires it up, heading toward her
Margo sees this and quickly intervenes
Whoa
Whoa
Okay, okay, alright
That's enough of the magic show
The minions don't hide their disappointment
Awwww
2             &     5
Margo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something
Wait, did you hear that
It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust
(gasps) It's the fairy princess
She's coming
Margo gasps and points up to the sky
Look
Edith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it up to reveal-- Gru
Dressed in a   , fairy wings, glittery eyelashes and tiara and magical wand
Up on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him down on a rope
Edith's balloon floats by and distracts them
They let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into the wall of the house and crashing to the ground
Aaaaaahh
He stands up and tries to cover
Agnes  , in awe of the fairy princess
(') (in falsetto) It is , Gru
zinkerbell
The most magical fairy princess of all
And  am here to wish Princess Agnes a very happy birthday
Gru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to stare, frozen
Then a   raises her hand and speaks with a lisp
How come you're tho fat
Gru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a high-pitched, dreamy voice
2             &      6
Because my house is made of candy and sometimes  eat instead of facing my problems
The girl starts to ask another question
How come you have- Gru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face
She Okay
Time for cake
As the kids run to the table, Agnes approaches Gru
Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell
You're the best fairy princess ever
Gru smiles
(in falsetto) You are welcome, little girl
She runs off, but quickly returns
(whispers in his ear) know it's really you, Gru
'm just pretending for the other kids
She runs off again to join her friends
Gru watches her go
Couldn't be happier
Then he is approached by , a heavily-Botoxed mom
Hey there, Gru, Mr
Life of the Party
(forcing a smile) Hello, Jillian
Sooooo, 'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and
2              &     7
In the background, a homely  leans against a buffet table and seductively raises her eyebrows at Gru
The table collapses to the ground beneath her
(realizes what's going on) No, no, no, get off of the limb right now
No limb
Oh, come on
she's a riot
She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her
In the background, Natalie inadvertently walks in front of a bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the ground
No, Jill's, that is not happening
Seriously
'm fine
(calling after Gru) Okay, fine
Forget Natalie
How about my cousin Linda
Gru walks off, passing by Edith and Margo
No
Oh, oh
know someone whose husband just died
Suddenly Jillian is sprayed in the face with water
Reveal Gru holding a  with a
'm sorry
did not see you there
He sprays her again
She falls down
(') Or there
He drops the hose and walks away,  softly
2              &           8
: '  - Gru takes Kyle out to the front yard
camera with nightvision is watching them
The screen analyzes Kyle and a readout comes out as ":
" Kyle sniffs Gru's flowers
Kyle
Kyle
Then it analyzes Gru and the readout says "
" (') Ky--Kyle
No, do not do your business on the petunias
Kyle lifts up his leg next to Gru's flowers
He picks Kyle up and places him next to his neighbor's bush
(') There you go
Those are Fred's
Go crazy
Kyle does and the bush immediately withers and dies
Gru (') Good boy
(
) Mr
Gru
Gru turns and sees Lucy Wilde standing there
Wha
didn't
What
Yes
(holds up her badge) Hi
Agent Lucy Wilde of the
(realizes her badge is upside down) Oh
Whoops
(clears her throat, all business) Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me
Oh, sorry, --Freeze Ray
2                  &        9
Gru whips out his   and fires it heads for Lucy
But before it gets to her, Lucy pulls out a retractable gun from her purse, which acts as a
Melting the ice
You know you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr
Gru
For example-- She pulls out a
Fires it at Gru
The tip flies through the air and connects with his chest, latching on
It tases him, which sends his body flailing in different funny poses before passing out
(') Lipstick Taser
Oh, it works so good
:  - Lucy tries to drag Gru to her car, but he's too heavy
Man
Ugh
Large
person
She gets an idea
Lucy gets into her car
In the background, we see Gru begin to come to, but he is struck by Lucy's car as she pulls back and is knocked out again
(') Oh
sorry
Closer now, Lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk
Just then Tom and Stuart come out of Gru's garage and see their boss being loaded in
Lucy struggles to close the trunk
(') Get
in
there
you
big
man
Lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into the vehicle
Tom and Stuart exchange horrified looks
Boss
2              &     10
They take off running after the car as it pulls away, running as fast as their tiny legs will carry them
They get right behind it and Tom  up onto the trunk
He reaches his hand out to Stuart, who is falling behind
Koom ey lah
Koom ey lah
Koom ey lah
Stuart leaps for the bumper and Tom catches him by his overall straps
Tom holds on tight as Stuart dangles from the back of the car, his overall straps stretching way out
(') Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah
As Lucy turns a corner, he slams into some garbage cans and ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box
Now in the box, Stuart continues to ride behind the car, and even starts to get the hang of that, too
He waves at Tom, and Tom waves back
(') Woooo
Ooooh
All is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets stuck on Stuart
The sheet forms a parasail which lifts Stuart up into the air
He strikes a Superman flying pose
Then a flock of fly toward him and one actually slams into his face
Quack quack
It  at him as it flies off
Lucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on the brakes
Both minions fly forward-- : '  - Lucy sees this, drives forward, and opens the convertible top, causing the Minions to land right in the passenger's seat
They strike threatening karate poses
2                 &     11
Hi-
Lucy tases them and they pass out
She floors it
:  - Lucy's car continues driving until it reaches a crowded
And doesn't stop
It drives right off the end of the pier
confused fisherman leaps for his life
What the--     Oh
:  - Lucy's car now transforms into an
As the minions come to, one of them tries playing with the radio until Lucy slaps his hand away
They speed through the sea and an octopus slams into her windshield
She turns on the wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had enough and swims off in a cloud of ink
She  her  as she passes through a school of fish
Whoa
As the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark heading for them with his mouth open
They
Lucy quickly steers the car out of harm's way
They pass by several more sharks until they arrive at a with the letters "" on the side
opens and Lucy's car goes inside
The hatch closes behind her
:   - The water drains out from the holding dock
buffer and hair dryer come out to dry off the car
squeegee wipes off the windshield
Then the platform the car is on lowers down
2              &     12
:   - Lucy's car lowers into the center of the room as a large circular table assembles around it, effectively locking them in
Lucy and the Minions get out of the car
She pushes a button on her remote and Gru, with a starfish attached to his head, is ejected from the trunk
(groggily) Ugh
ooh
what
where
ah
oh, foot's asleep
ah
pins and needles
(
) Good afternoon, Mr
Gru
Ehhh
apologize for our methods in getting you here
don't
'd do it again in a heartbeat
am not gonna lie-- enjoyed that
Every second of it
Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually
That's enough, Agent Wilde
Sorry, sir
Okay, this is bogus
Gru peels the starfish off his head and drops it onto Tom's
Stuart  at him
(') don't know who you people think you are, but-- comes over with tea for Silas
We are the Anti-Villain League
2              &     13
As Silas summons a map that shows all of the  offices around the world, Lucy's car drops out of the way
Stuart is trapped on the lowering platform and he scrambles to get back onto stable ground
Silas continues
(') An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale
Rob a bank
We're not interested
Kill someone
Not our deal
But you want to melt the polar ice caps
Or vaporize Mt
Fuji
Or even steal the moon
Then we notice
First of all, you've got no proof that  did that
Second, after did do that,  put it back
We're well aware of that, Mr
Gru
That's why we've brought you here
(beat) am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom
Upon hearing the name, Tom and Stuart start giggling
Bottom
Heeheheeeeheeehee
Silas bristles at this, and glances over at Lucy
Hilarious
Agent Wilde
Oh, me now
She continues the de-briefing, turning to the screens, which show an image of the Magnet Ship stealing the lab
(') Um, recently an entire top secret lab disappeared from the Arctic Circle
Yeah, the entire lab
Just whoosh
Voom
Gone
Where did it go
2               &      14
don't care
The screen shows  of a    in a scientific lab
Furry and adorable
The lab was devoted to experiments involving -41, a transmutation serum
What is -41, you ask
Mmmm, it's pretty bad
Look
approaches the bunny with a containing the purple liquid
Injects some in its butt
Aaah
Instantly the bunny transforms into a Gru and the Minions smile, impressed
Then it goes crazy and attacks the scientist
Gru covers his eyes and the Minions pass out
Oh
The bunny attacks the technician, then the camera
and the film is over
(') Hmm, you usually don't see that in bunnies
As you can see, in the wrong hands, the -41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on earth
(struggles to get through the opening in the table) Fortunately it has a very distinct chemical footprint, and using the latest chemtracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall
On the screens we see images depicting a highly technical diagram of the shopping mall
Ha
mall
2              &     15
Precisely
And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal
Silas scrolls through pictures of the mall's shop owners
(') And that's where you come in
As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts
The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully you'll be able to-- Okay,  see where this is going, with all the Mission Impossible stuff, but no
No
am a father now
And a legitimate businessman
am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies
Silas shoots him a look
He
Jams and
jellies
Oh, attitude
That's right
So thanks, but no thanks
(beat) And here's a tip--instead of tasing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call
Good day, Mr
Sheepsbutt
Ramsbottom
(chuckles) Oh, yeah, like that's any better
Gru turns and heads for the door, followed by Tom and Stuart, who continue to  about Ramsbottom's name
:  - Gru exits the  headquarters, which he now sees is on a 2             &         16
Lucy leans out the door and taps him on the shoulder
Look,  probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing, so if you ever want to get back to doing something awesome--give us a call
She hands Gru her
Gru takes it and stares at it
:  - Gru rows back to shore as Tom yells to him like a coxswain
Gru  with each stroke
("Stroke
") Mack-oh
Mack-oh
Mack-oh
: '  - Gru carries a sleeping Agnes upstairs
: '  - Gru enters to find Margo and Edith not in bed
Margo is texting someone
(whispers) Hey,  told you guys to get to bed
Oh, sorry
So when ya goin' on your date
What
Remember
Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you
Yeah, well, she is a nutjob
And 'm not going on any date
2               &      17
Why not
Are you scared
Gru stares back at Edith
Gets a far-away look in his eyes
:  -  - We flash back to   on the school playground
He stares, lovesick, at a    , named
(to her friends) Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on
Yeah,  can't believe it
It's so cool
Yeah, and you know what-- Gru approaches her
Excuse me, Lisa
But she doesn't notice him
He tries again
(to her friends) was talking to Billy the other day
No way
He is so cute
Gru clears his throat
(') And  think he likes me
Hey Lisa,  was wondering if you-- Gru reaches out and taps her shoulder with his pointer finger
Then one of the other little girls points to Gru's finger on Lisa's shoulder
2                  &     18
Ewww
Gru touched Lisa
Gru touched Lisa
The other girls turn and squeal, horrified
Eeeeewww
little buck-toothed red-haired girl shouts out to the entire playground
Lisa's got Grooties
The playground erupts with  and everyone turns and runs away
Little Gru is left alone
Crushed
: '  - Gru comes out of the flashback
Scared
Of what
Women
No, that's bonkers
just--  have no interest in going on a date, that's all
Case closed
'm not scared-- of women
or dates
let's go to bed
Gru gives each girl a goodnight kiss
(') Goodnight, Edith
Then he goes over to Margo, who's already in bed
(') Goodnight, Margo
She continues texting as he gives her a kiss
(') Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Well, hold the horses
Who are you texting
No one
Just my friend Avery
2             &     19
Avery
Avery
Is that a girl's name or a boy's name
Does it matter
No, no, it doesn't matter
Unless it's a boy
know what makes you a boy
Gru turns to Agnes, concerned
Uh
oooh
you
do
Your bald head
Gru nods, relieved
Oh, yes
It's really smooth
Sometimes stare at it and imagine a little chick popping out
Peep peep peep
Gru sighs and gives her a kiss
Goodnight, Agnes
Never get older
Gru turns out the light and leaves the room
:  - Gru rides the elevator tube down to his lab, passing minions in various stages of jelly making
sign reading, " has been hastily pasted over a nuclear warning sign
checks his clipboard as the  next to him steals a banana from his pocket
He turns, but the Minion who stole the banana has hidden it in his mouth
We see the ends of the banana pushing out his cheeks
Hey, oh
Me banana
2              &     20
The Minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs
single apple is passed down a line of Minions in the least efficient way possible
few Minions mash fruits in large vats ala " Love Lucy
" One wears a bunch of fruit on his head like Carmen Miranda and sings the   song
His supervisor comes over and tells him to get back to work
The Minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit, but slips and falls down into a large test-tube filled with mashed fruit
Then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor belt
The trapped Minion is injected into one of the jars
Gru enters the lab and greets the minions
Hey, Tim, nice haircut
He points at Tim
(') Donnie, hang in there, baby
It's almost Friday
Gru high-fives Donnie as he approaches Dr
Nefario
(') So, how's today's batch, Dr
Nefario
developed a    new formula which allowed me to    get every known kind of berry into    one flavor of jelly
Gru sticks his finger in and tastes the purple goo in the jar
Makes a disgusted face, then attempts a smile
(faking it) That tastes good
(gags) Love the flavor of that
It's horrible, isn't it
2            &      21
No
No
Oh, we're making great progress
(to the Minions) Here, try some of this
He hands a jar to a minion, who tries it
He
Another minion tastes some and scrapes it off his tongue
They smash the jar and all the minions run away, disgusted
(') Whoa
okay, just because everybody hates it doesn't mean it's not good
Dr
Nefario hangs his head
Listen, Gru
There's something 've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now
What
What's wrong
(clears his throat) miss being evil
Sinister plots, large-scale crimes
It's what live for
mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly
Well, 'm also considering a line of jams
Um
the thing is, Gru
(deep breath) 've had an offer of employment elsewhere
Dr
Nefario
Come on, you're kidding, right
It's a great opportunity for me, bigger lab, more evil, full dental
Dr
Nefario presses a button and his stuff folds itself up into a traveling suitcase
2              &       22
Dr
Nefario hangs his head
Gru stares back at his old friend
Very well
Let us give you the proper send-off
(calls off screen) Minions
: '  - Seven minions are lined up with seven fart guns
Dr
Nefario sits in his scooter
The highest honor awarded
To Dr
Nefario for your years of service
The twenty-one fart gun salute
Dr
Nefario
His eyes are watering (and not only from the smell)
Uh,  counted twenty-two
Dave , guilty
Dr
Nefario fires up the scooter
(') Farewell, my friends
The minions
Dr
Nefario pushes another button on the scooter, transforming it into flying mode
He  the engine and it begins flying away
At the slowest pace possible
Everyone just stands there awkwardly
(') This may take a while
Go about your business
Everyone walks off
(') miss you already
Gru examines Lucy's business card
Makes a decision
: '  - The shadow of a mysterious figure approaches Gru's front door
2              &      23
: '  - Minion wears a French Maid's outfit and  as he vacuums the floor
The doorbell rings
The Minion opens the door to see who it is
Hello
shadow falls across the terrified minion as something unseen abducts him
: '  - The vacuum moves back and forth across the floor by itself
Another Minion walks by wearing a different Maid outfit
He doesn't see the other Minion and closes the door
Then he opens it again, cleans the doorknob, and closes it
:   - It's morning at Gru's house
Margo and Agnes sit on the couch with a
Edith leans over the top of the couch, looking on
Are you sure we should be doing this
Yes, it's for his own good
On the screen is a   (--
)--the girls are creating a profile for Gru
(') Okay, we need to choose a picture
Margo clicks through pictures of Gru
Each one is worse than the last
No
(') Scary
2            &      24
Weird
The next picture is of Gru in a bathing suit
The girls react in horror
Aaaaaah
Margo covers Agnes's eyes
What is that
Gru enters the family room
Good morning, girls
have an announcement to make
Hey, what celebrity do you look like
Ummm
Bruce Willis
The girls stare at him blankly
Mmmm
no
Humpty Dumpty
Ooh, Gollum
The girls
Okay, what are you doing
We're signing you up for online dating
Oh, okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Gru grabs the laptop away from the girls
2              &      25
Aw come on, it's fun
And it's time for you to get out there
No
Stop
No one is ever getting out there
Ever
Gru hands a Minion the laptop, accidentally hitting him in the face
(') Okay, now for the announcement: have accepted a new job
Whoa--really
Yes,  have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world
You're gonna be a spy
That's right, baby
Gru's back in the game
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars
the whole deal
Awesome
Agnes looks up at him in awe
Are you really gonna save the world
Gru looks at Agnes
Yes
Yes  am
He coolly puts on a pair of sunglasses
We pan to Dave mimicking Gru with a pair of sunglasses
Mocha
2               &     26
And then to Kevin dressed in an Amish beard and tie
Cacao
And then Stuart dressed as a little girl with pigtails
Papadam
:  - Establishing
:  - Gru comes down the escalator wearing the sunglasses, with the three disguised Minions behind him
Stuart gets his dress caught in the escalator
It comes off and he hides in a nearby potted plant
Gru glances at a store called the "
" He then arrives at a charming, pink
The sign reads, "  " Gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses
Hm
"Bake My Day
"   Blech
:    - Gru unlocks the door and enters
on the door ring
The inside is sugary and clean and quaint
Gru takes it all in
Then turns to the minions
Alright, here is the cupcake recipe got off the internet
The minions excitedly grab the recipe and head for the kitchen
Gru kicks Stuart, who is still staggering around in the potted plant
(') And don't go nuts with the sprinkles
Gru is left alone
He looks around
Sees a   in a glass cake dish
Then a   in the next cake dish
And in the next dish he sees Lucy's head
She makes a funny face
2              &       27
Gru , which causes Lucy to  and jump up, hitting her head on one of the shelves, sending all of the flying
Lucy immediately goes into action, using incredible and frankly weird-looking    to dispatch the cupcakes as they fly toward her
Ha
Yaa
Ho
Ooof
Zaaa
Ay-ay- ay-ay-ay
She successfully eliminates all of the cupcakes, then turns to Gru, out of breath
(') Whoo
Wasn't expecting that
(strikes a martial arts pose) Or was
Gru has a cupcake stuck to the top of his head, frosting side down
Lucy gestures as if he's got a little food on his face
(') Ooh
you got
You got
a little
The cupcake slowly slides down, then falls to the floor
It leaves a long smear on Gru's face
(') Here, 'll-- 'll get it
Gru stands frozen as she tries to clean him up
(') Oh, that's just spreading
um
Alright, alright
got it
got it
Stop it
Lucy backs off
Oh
'll let you get it
Gru  and wipes the frosting off his face
2             &     28
(') Yeah, what you just saw there was a little something new 've been working on
It's a combination of Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare, and krumping
Okay, that's weird--why are you here
On assignment from Silas
'm your new partner
Yay
What
No, no "yay
" Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner
Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you
But not me
stepped up
And 'm new, so kind of have to do what they tell me anyway
Gru is about to respond when Dave the minion comes out the kitchen door
He carries a cupcake in the shape of a Minion
Walla
Immediately Lucy moves with lightning-quick reflexes
She smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to the counter
Dave
You know this guy
Yes, he's one of my minions
Oh, 'm sorry
should have known
She releases him
(') You're free to go
2              &       29
Dave stares at Lucy
Immediately smitten
magical glow appears around her as romantic music plays
We go into Dave's fantasy
:  -  - Dave and Lucy run along a beach together hand in hand
:  -  - Dave and Lucy have a romantic picnic together
They toast each other with champagne
Dave drinks from the bottle
:  -  - Lucy and Dave sit on the railing of a moonlit footbridge
Both fire  into the air to create fireworks and are about to kiss when-- (
) Dave
:    - Back to reality, where Dave is staring up at Lucy, lovestruck
Earth to Dave
You can leave now
Dave goes back into the kitchen, never taking his eyes off of Lucy
:  - the Giant Cupcake on top of the cupcake shop
The on the Giant Cupcake rotates, revealing a hidden inside
The lens zooms
(
) Now, what do we got
Who's on the list
Fire `em at me
:    - Gru and Lucy stand next to each other under a domed lamp lowered from the ceiling
2                &     30
Inside the dome of the lamp, Gru and Lucy are uncomfortably close together looking at a video screen
First suspect
Hedda Blumentoft, proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop
The camera moves over to Mum's the Word Floral Shop and No
Not her
Okay, moving on
The camera moves over to the "Stuff--Bear" store , a small perky man, holds up an empty teddy bear skin for a little boy
(') Chuck Kinney, owner of "Stuff-- Bear
" Kinney shoves the teddy bear's butt onto a sharp metal tube
The bear inflates until it  into a torrent of bear skin and stuffing
The little boy
(') Ooh
don't think so
----
The bell rings on the cupcake shop's front door, signaling a customer
(
) Hello
Oh
Gru and Lucy quickly hide their equipment, look up and see at the door
They try to act natural
Buenos dias, my friends
am Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa & Salsa Restaurant, across the mall
Now open for breakfast
And you are
2             &     31
Gru
And this is Lucy
And we are closed
This is just gonna take un momento
am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo party, and  am going to need two hundred of your best cupcakes decorated with the Mexican flag
It looks something like this
He rips open his shirt, revealing a  of the Mexican flag on his chest
(') What do you think
He flexes and makes it wave
Gru hides his eyes
Look away
Lucy stares at it
You-- Whoa
Hooo
Anyway,  have to go
It's all settled
pick `em up next week
Have a good day
Come by if you get a chance, okay
He exits
Gru , relieved
Finally
Then Eduardo pops back in
(') And welcome to the mall family
Gru studies Eduardo's face and
He pictures Eduardo in a red luchador mask surrounded by flames
Eduardo turns and leaves
As soon as the door closes-- (whispers) El Macho
What
But it couldn't be
2            &        32
Wha-- What
What couldn't be
That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho
From about twenty years ago
:  -  - Classic Spaghetti western sepia-toned shot of El Macho looking menacing
He looks like the large Hispanic man from the mall, only younger and wearing a Lucha Libre outfit and mask (a mask which looks similar to the one Gru imagined)
El Macho pushes the  out of the way and grabs a large bottle from behind the bar
(
) He was ruthless
He was dangerous
And as the name implies, very macho
El Macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle over his own head
He reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the bar
He squeezes its head, squirting venom into the shot glass
He drinks it down and then eats the glass
He sticks the snake's fangs into a few dollars that he leaves on the bar, before breaking through the wall behind him, leaving an  Macho-shaped hole
:  -  - El Macho head butts an armored truck and approaches the passenger side window
(
) He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands
When the   look over he punches through the bullet- proof glass, knocking them both out of the truck
Then he lifts the truck onto his back and runs down the street with it
(
) Ah, but sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon
2            &      33
:  -  - bird, flying in the air, is suddenly struck by an airplane
(
) He died in the most macho way possible
El Macho leaps out of the plane riding a , a ton of strapped to him
He plummets toward the mouth of an (
) Riding a shark with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth of an active volcano
He pulls two grenades from behind his back, yanks the pins, and holds onto them as he plunges into the volcano
There is a
(
) It was glorious
:    - Lucy stares at Gru, confused
Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead
They never found the body
Oh no
All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair
(beat) But
that face
It has got to be El Macho
Lucy gets an excited look on her face
Then what do you say you and break into his restaurant
Tonight
Gru nods at Lucy's invitation
2              &     34
Yes, that's good, because 'm telling you--if anybody in this place has the -41 serum
Gru looks out the window and points at Eduardo riding up on the escalator, scratching his butt
(') it's him
: '  - Gru enters and pushes the girls into their beds like a tour guide anxious to finish a tour
Alright, alright, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed
What's the big hurry
just
have a lot of work to do
Work, what kind of work
Very important business
So
hugs, kisses
(hugs and kisses them) good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah- blah-- Gru turns to leave, but Agnes is standing at the doorway
But you said you'd help me practice my part for the Mother's Day show
Gru looks down at Agnes' puppy dog eyes
He
Fine, fine
Let me hear it
Quickly
2              &     35
: '   - On Agnes
She gives her lines
(robotically) She kisses my boo-boos She braids my hair My mother is beyond compare We love you, mothers, everywhere
Gru frowns
Wow
That was
something else really liked the way you smiled at the end
Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay
Okay
(still monotone) She kisses my boo-boos She braids my hair-- Perfect
Time to go
As he heads for the door-- don't think  should do this
This stops Gru
Well, what do you mean
Why not
don't even have a mom
Ouch
But Gru tries not to let this affect him
Well, you don't need one to do the show
mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant and you haven't been in combat
Agnes looks up at Gru
This is different
2              &       36
Okay, well, then
maybe you can just use your imagination
You mean  pretend  have a mom
Yes, right
You can do that, can't you
Agnes smiles
Yeah
do that all the time
Thanks, Gru
She gives him a kiss and runs off
Gru watches her go, deep in thought
:   - raise their ice cream sundaes and clink them together
Hey
Pull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing
We move through the crowd, passing by the mace-wielding minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs
We cut up to the rafters, where more minions are dancing and singing in formation, jumping and hopping all over the place in elaborate dance routines
Back on the floor, three arm-in-arm minions take the chorus
One of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being held up by the other two
Another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running up the other way
Several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream, lazily sipping at it through long straws
Gru enters and takes it all in
Other minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the canopy, drinking directly from the spouts
2             &      37
Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no, no
Hey, please
The Minions stop singing
(') Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay
(points) Dave, Stuart--come this way
With me
Come on
Dave downs a jar of maraschino cherries and sprays whip cream into his mouth before running after them, with a toothpick umbrella in his mouth for good measure
(
) (') Come on
Once they are gone, the Minions go back to singing and laughing
: '  - Margo, Edith and Agnes are fast asleep in their beds
Kevin and Jerry sing them a lullaby
Then smile and quietly close the door
:  - Kevin holds up a golf ball
Jerry happily jumps up and down
Hey, putt-putt
Oh
:   - Jerry puts the tee and ball in his mouth as Kevin stands on a dresser, preparing to take a swing
He asks Jerry if he's ready and Jerry gives a thumbs up
Una, doo-- (laughs as he lowers the golf club to Jerry's head) 2              &       38
noise comes from the backyard
The minions exchange looks
What was that
:  - Kevin and Jerry step out into the yard and look around nervously, armed only with the golf club and tee
Boca
(scared) Boca
They walk over to the garbage cans
The cans begins to rattle
Kevin and Jerry  as a  pops up from one of the cans
The cat
Kevin  at him and imitates Jerry's scared face
Looka too
Jerry slaps him
Kevin slaps him back
They start to slap fight until-- comes down from above, lighting up the terrified minions
Before they can scream
Jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted by aliens
Kevin grabs onto a flower, and then the cat to try and anchor himself down, but they both fly up into the air
The light goes out
few seconds later the light comes back on and drops the cat back down
It turns off again and the Minions are gone
:  - The mall is dark and the parking lot is empty, except for two minions and Lucy's car
:  - lone   walks through the dark mall, listening to music on his headphones
He passes by Eduardo's Salsa & Salsa
Shines his light inside
All clear
He moves on
2             &        39
Once the guard is gone, a floor tile is moved aside and Gru peeks out
After making sure the coast is clear, Gru calls down
(whispers) We're stealth ninjas
We make no sound
Right
Gotcha
: '  &  - Lucy kicks the door open
She enters
Gru reacts
Alright, El Macho, you're going down
But before Gru takes a step, Lucy stops him
Wait
Wait
What
She produces a   and sprays the air in front of her
Gru frowns
(') What are you doing
'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers
It's a restaurant
You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set
Huh
'mon
There are no booby traps
Gru takes a step and kicks a  attached to a tiny bell
--
Lucy points to the bell
2                &         40
Ha
Booby
Lucy  as a door begins to creak open
She hides behind Gru
tiny  hops out
It
Lucy is confused
(') Oh
There's a chicken
Are you lost little guy
You must be lost
Ha
Some guard dog
Suddenly, the chicken leaps into the air and lands on Gru, pecking his bald head
(') Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigh
Gru runs in circles, trying to get the chicken off
(') Get it off of me
Get it off of me
Get it off of me
Gru  as the chicken goes up his shirt and bursts out of his sweater through the chest, "Alien"-style
He grabs it
(') got you
It pecks him on the head, escapes, and continues to attack him
Lucy thinks fast and grabs a tablecloth from a table
She lunges and covers the chicken with the table cloth
got it
Ha
She tightens the tablecloth around Gru's neck, trapping the chicken and Gru's head inside
muffled scream comes from under the table cloth and Lucy realizes what she's done
Gru runs around trying to get the tablecloth off his head
Lucy does a karate flip/body slam on Gru and the chicken
She removes the table cloth
Gru's head has been replaced by the chicken
(') Ha
2               &     41
She goes to karate chop the chicken, but it flies off and she hits Gru in the face instead
(') Oh
The chicken regroups, , and attacks
Lucy acts fast and presses a button on her watch, squirting onto the chicken
The foam instantly hardens into a glass ball around the chicken
Only its head sticks out
It wobbles back and forth like a Weeble
Lucy turns to Gru
(dazed) Ugh
What is wrong with that chicken
(beat) Hey, that pollo
Es loco
Gru is unimpressed
(') (noticing Gru's wounds) No
Okay, let's go
:  - Gru and Lucy step into the kitchen
Lucy pulls out a - and aims it around the kitchen
You getting anything
No
Not yet
But hey, maybe you can find something with these x-ray goggles
Lucy produces a pair of   goggles
Gru shakes his head
(skeptically) Bah
Gru puts them on and looks around the kitchen
We now see the room from his -
2               &     42
(
) How're they working
Tell me, tell me
Gru turns to Lucy and sees her as a
Ahh
Ooof
What's wrong
Something wrong
Oh, that's an image 'll never get out of my brain
Blagh
Gru makes a face, disturbed
Then quickly turns away and spots something behind a painting on the wall
a safe
Sees something inside it--a
Smiles
(') knew it
He goes to the wall and removes the painting, revealing the (') The serum is in here
Ooh, then let's get it
He produces a -  and places it over the combination wheel
Lights blink and it goes to work
(gleefully giggling) Oh, this is going to be good
Ahh
The safe opens, revealing--a    ("' ")
(') -ha
(registering it's not the serum) What
It's
salsa
(disappointed) Awww man
2            &         43
:  - Eduardo enters the restaurant
Senses something isn't right
Frowns angrily
Oh
somebody's going to die tonight
He cautiously walks through the restaurant
Sees the chicken in the ball of cement
Gasps
(') Pollito
Eduardo runs over to Pollito and picks him up
(') What'd they do to you
Pollito
Can you hear me
Boc
Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken
What
Who's there
His eyes darken
:  - Gru and Lucy, who are ravenously eating the delicious salsa with chips, turn to the door
Uh-oh
:  - Eduardo, carrying the chicken, makes his way to the kitchen
Grabs a   off of a table
You coming out
Or am  gonna go in
:  - Gru and Lucy react to hearing Eduardo's voice
Gru pulls a out of his jacket
Aims it at the ceiling
The  fires, cutting a hole in the ceiling
2              &        44
:  - Eduardo approaches the kitchen, brandishing the knife
Ready to confront any intruders
He shoves open the door and sees chips and the salsa container sitting in the open wall safe
:  - Eduardo enters the room, just in time to see a pair of legs disappear into the ceiling
Stop
Lucy quickly pops down and hits him in the eyes with her foam- shooting watch
(') My eyes
He rubs his eyes, dropping the chicken and cracking its encasement
:  - Lucy and Gru quickly run through the mall
Gru, call one of your munchkins
Gru produces a communicator and calls into it
We've been spotted
Come get us
: '  - One minion sits on the hood of the car
The other leans against a tire, toothpick in his mouth
Huh
(to the other minion) Hey
Loo-koo-meow-plah
Ah
Koom-kwat
2              &        45
:  - The car crashes through the glass doors and speeds through the mall
They crash into a bunch of cleaning supplies being pushed by a janitor
Gru and Lucy watch them from the balcony above
Hm
Subtle
They both run over to meet the car at the escalators
The car heads for the escalators
As they reach the bottom, Gru and Lucy realize the minions are about to go up the other one
Over here, over here
Over
here
Too late
The minions shake as they go up the bumpy stairs
Once they reach the top they take a left and start driving in circles around the balcony
Gru pulls out a grappling hook and aims for the balcony railing
(') (grabbing Lucy) Hold tight
They shoot up and land right back where they started - at Salsa & Salsa
The minions zoom by in the car and Gru in exasperation
Just then, Eduardo emerges from the restaurant with fire in his eyes and a knife in his hand
Eduardo produces many more and heads straight for them
have you now
Eduardo is struck unconscious by Lucy's car
Just in time
Lucy opens the car door
One of the minions holds a toothpick in his hand and leans on the steering wheel, seductively
Rawr, rawr
The other minion revs the engine suggestively
Eduardo starts to wake up
The car zooms past him
2             &     46
:   - Lucy's car plummets towards the ground
Gru hysterically, but Lucy just hits a button and the car into a jet
They fly off into the night sky
: '  - It's a beautiful morning
An    makes its way down the street (playing the song the minions were singing earlier)
It stops and a couple of  run to meet it
Stuart opens Gru's front door, having heard the commotion
Two other minions approach as well
Stuart spots the ice cream truck and points to it, excited
Oh
Oh
Gelato
And then suddenly a    appears running for the ice cream truck alongside the group of children
The minions shove the children aside and clamor around the truck holding out their money
Gelato
Gelato
Gelato
Stuart pushes himself to the top of the unruly pack and tries to maintain order
Stopa
Stopa
hush comes over the minions
(') (knocking on the truck) Hey-ho
Gelato
Suddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms into a   and extends itself above the minions
Stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order gelato, but the it begins  the minions into it
One by one the minions (dozens of them, including the minion with his head still trapped in the jelly jar) are sucked into the truck until there is only one left
He tries to make a break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of him
2             &        47
He licks it, his tongue sticks, and he is yanked back into the ice cream cone
The it closes and the truck drives away
The children look on puzzled
:   - The hole that Lucy's car crashed through last night has been patched with plywood boards
:   - that Gru is inside a Next to him is Lucy, also in a , using binoculars
(
) All right, there he is
Suspect #8: Floyd Eaglesan
Floyd Eaglesan attempts to entice a customer to visit his business, Eagle Hair Club
Oh
Okay
See if you can get closer
Go
go
Gru quickly stands up, revealing his legs, and takes several steps toward Eagle Hair Club
Floyd looks over his shoulder, and Gru stops
Floyd enters Eagle Hair Club and Gru inches closer
Alright, what do-- Suddenly a  approaches the trash can with a steaming cup of coffee
The binoculars readout says " " (') (to himself) Oh no
That's not good
The man goes to throw the coffee in the trash and we see Gru's legs pop out from beneath the can
2             &        48
The man looks confused and tries again
Gru dodges and takes off running
The man chases after him
Gru accidentally knocks into a bent-over woman's rear end
Insulted, she turns around, sees the man with the coffee, and slaps him across the face
Unfortunately, Gru doesn't see the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs
Finally, Gru pops out of the trash can and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a
Flat on his face, he hears a familiar voice call out
(
) Hey Gru
Gru looks up and sees Margo, Edith and Agnes
Oh
Girls
What are you doing here
Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work
(looks at Gru and the trash can) So, you're saving the world in a garbage can
(sarcastically) Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
funny
Lucy arrives on the scene, joining them
Hey, there you are
Oh, who's this
Lucy, these are my girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes
Girls, Lucy
Lucy, girls
Hello
Hi
Agnes gazes lovingly at Lucy
magical glow appears around Lucy, who smiles back
2              &      49
Are you single
Oh
Goodness
Gru, immediately uncomfortable, claps his hands together
Oh
Hey
have an idea
Since Lucy and  have lots of work to do, why don't you girls go and explore the mall
Gru quickly shuffles the girls away from Lucy, trying to get out of the uncomfortable situation
Gru pulls out his wallet
(') Here is some money
Go buy some useless mall junk
Some headbands, and-- Are you gonna marry Lucy
Are you out of your gourd
No
She just works with me
Plus you love her
(sings) You love her, you love her, you really really love her, and you're gonna get married, and  will be the flower girl, and-- Okay, stop
That is a song of lies
don't even like her
(points to mall) Now go have fun
Gru
The girls run off, but quickly return to hug Gru
Almost forgot
Hugs
Good luck saving the world
Bye
Bye, Gru
2                 &      50
Lucy watches the group hug
Smiles
Gru heads back over to Lucy, embarrassed by Agnes
Ha, ha, ha
Kids
right
They're
funny
Those girls totally adore you bet you're a fun dad
Huh
(beat) am pretty fun
:   - The girls are at the
Agnes has her eyes closed and a very intense look on her face, as if she's really concentrating on something
There is something in her tightly clenched fist
She tosses a
Then opens her eyes, waiting for her wish to come true
Then Edith emerges from the water wearing a , hands full of
Is that stealing
Not if my wish was that  would get a lot of free coins
Margo is busy texting
Then something offscreen catches her eye
It's a boy
This is
Suave, cool, and a bit dangerous
We watch in   as he strolls behind the fountain, and then disappears in its spraying water
Margo looks for Antonio
Backs into the fountain and nearly falls into it
Whoa
Antonio catches her
Cool glasses
Margo  nervously
He helps her back up
2               &     51
(') 'm Antonio
'm
Margo
was just going to get a cookie
Care to join me
Uh, sure
'm
Margo
They begin walking away together, then Margo is reminded of her sisters when Edith loudly clears her throat
(') Um
'll catch up with you guys later
Bye
She turns and runs after Antonio
Can  be the first to say
Ewwww
Agnes grabs Edith and shakes her
We gotta go tell Gru
:    - Gru approaches Eagle Hair Club
All right, 'm going in
( ) If it picks up any traces of the serum the sensor in your belt buckle-- Gru activates the high-tech scanning device on his belt buckle
:    - Lucy is in the cupcake shop monitoring the scanning device results
She can hear him and see from his
2              &     52
--will make a sound like this-- - ----
(annoyed) Okay
get it
get it
:    - Gru fumbles with the automatic door, then enters Eagle Hair Club
(
) (chuckles) Welcome to Eagle Hair Club
At the reception desk, a large chair shaped like an eagle spins around
Sitting in the chair is Floyd, looking sinister and petting a   that looks like a cat
(') It's about time you showed up
Mr
Gru
His pet   perched next to him
You
know my name
(chuckles) When someone moves into the mall who is follically challenged, make it my business to know all about them
You are bald
And that is bad
He strokes the furry object
Kisses it
Then places it on a It's a

:    - Lucy monitors the chem-tracking device from inside the shop
'm getting nothing so far think you need to move around
2             &        53
:    - Gru listens in on the headphones
He steps over to a wall on which hangs a  of Floyd flying with eagles
Wow, this looks interesting
What is it
Gru thrusts his hips at the painting
Floyd watches him, suspicious
take it you're an art lover
( ) No serum
Yeah, not so much
He walks over to a podium with a
He thrusts his hips at that, too
(') Oh, how about this impressive trinket
'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr
Gru
(in headphones) Nothing
The International-- Yeah,  don't care
Floyd  in frustration
Gru moves to a shelf filled with
He straddles it
(in headphones) -----
Hold on
'm picking up something
Behind that wall
2              &      54
Ah
And what do we have here
Floyd grabs a sample
These are my trial wigs
(holds out wig to Gru) You should take one
Gru sticks his head into the shelf to investigate
No thanks
So what's on the other side of the wall
Here you are
Look at me
Focus
(in headphones) Gru
promise that this wig will transform you from ugly to irresistible
Gru stares at the wig
Clearly getting caught up in what Floyd's saying
Gru is about to respond when suddenly Edith and Agnes burst in, out of breath
'
Gru stares at them
Date
Boyfriend
(yells at Floyd) What
Floyd shrugs
:   - Gru, Edith and Agnes race across the mall
Then Agnes points over to the salsa restaurant as Margo and Antonio walk in
2               &      55
There she goes
: '  &  - Gru enters to see Margo and Antonio sitting together in the back of the restaurant together
Margo laughs at something Antonio said
Oh, you're so funny
Gross
Look, they're in love
These words hit Gru like a smack in the face
Oh, no, no, no
Do not say that they are
no no no, no
He storms in
Edith and Agnes follow
(
) and my dream is to one day play video games for a living
Wow
You're so complicated
Gru storms over to Margo
Attempts a smile
Margo
What is going on here
Oh
Gru, se llama Antonio
Me llamo Margo
Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares
Let's go
begins to play and a curtain opens across the room
Someone leaps out, spinning like a tornado, then lands in the middle of the restaurant with a flourish
It's Eduardo
Whoa
Everyone in the restaurant cheers
Gru frowns
Not this guy
2             &        56
The music continues and Eduardo dances across the floor and out into the mall where he grabs a passing  and pulls her into the restaurant
The confused woman holds on for the ride    as Eduardo twirls and dances her all around the floor
He     dips her and she melts, as do all of the women watching
Eduardo gazes into the woman's eyes and produces a business    card
Kids eat free on Tuesdays
The woman grabs the business card from his hand with her teeth
Then Eduardo flings her across the floor and she twirls back out into the mall where she knocks over her confused husband
Then the song comes to an end and Eduardo strikes a final pose
Everyone in the studio cheers
Yeah
Wahoo
Cool
Awesome
Everyone except Gru
Eduardo walks over to him and gives him a big warm hug
So good to see you again, mi compadre
Gru tries to get out of the hug as quickly as he can
Oh,  see you have already met my father
What the-- Father
Si
Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh
Come, sit, let me get you something
Gru looks down and sees Eduardo's chicken glaring at him
It It's unsettling
Oh
look at you
Eduardo scoops the chicken up
2             &       57
(') (nervous) Haha
He likes me
Gru tries to pet the chicken but Pollito lunges at him
Oh, oh, 'm sorry, Pollito is usually very friendly
(cradling Pollito) He had a rough night
The chicken stares relentlessly
Gru  nervously
Well, we really should be going
Girls, come on
Gru tries to gather the girls, but Eduardo stops him, pushing Antonio and Margo closer together
That is a pity
Young love is beautiful, no
No
(chuckling nervously) You know, they're not in love
They hardly know each other
Eduardo suddenly lights up, having an idea
You are right, Cabeza de Huevo
They must get to know each other better
Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party
No, no,  am-- Si
The girls are all thrilled at this, as is Antonio
As if on cue,  begins playing and they all begin dancing together
Antonio takes Margo's hand and twirls her across the floor
Gru stares at Antonio with a look that could kill
waiter comes by to give Gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes the glass with his bare hands
His eye twitches

:   - Gru and Lucy sit across from Silas at headquarters
'm sorry, El Macho
Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect
After the whole salsa incident
Yes, but there has been a new development, and 'm telling you, this is the guy
You need to arrest him immediately
And his deviously charming son
'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too
The son also
You've got to get the son
Gru approaches Silas
(') (whispers) think that the son is the mastermind
There's a look
There's a devilish look in his eyes and  don't like it
Yes, but  don't really see any evidence for-- Evidence schmevidence
go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho
Lock him up
Lock up the son
Don't forget about the son
The kid gives me the creeps
Silas takes a deep breath and rubs his temples
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear
Lucy jumps in, trying to save the situation
Uh, but, on the less
(whistles) "crazy" side of things, uh, Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club
2             &     59
Hm
Interesting
Yeah, and you know who made that happen
Huh
(points to Gru) This guy
Nailed it
Amazing, right
No
mean, sure, but it's not him
It is
(whispers) El Macho
Mr
Gru
Please-- No
It is him
And  will prove it
And Gru storms out
(calls after him) Gru, c'mon
Once he's gone, Silas gives Lucy a look
(') (laughs nervously) He really thinks it's El Macho
Can you tell
Silas is not amused
:  - The minion with the popsicle stuck to his tongue wakes up on a beach, disoriented
He slowly sits up-- --and sees hundreds of minions partying
This is where all the abducted minions were taken
There are minions sitting at a Tiki bar, being tended by a bartender minion
The French maid minion and a ukelele-playing minion are dancing in the sand
They wave at him
2                  &     60
Meanwhile, Jerry approaches the popsicle minion with two bananas
He gives him one, does a Hawaiian dance with the other, then runs off for the water
Popsicle minion tears off his overalls and follows suit
Koonga
The Popsicle Minion, now nude, runs across the sand and jumps into a clear, blue ocean
We pull back to reveal that unbeknownst to any of the minions, this is all happening inside a large terrarium, and they are being watched by a mysterious figure in silhouette
:   - Gru sits with his laptop
He's on the eVillain site
He clicks through various images of El Macho
Edith chases Kevin, who has the wig in his mouth
minion sets a stack of magazines on the coffee table
Then "       " appears on Gru's screen
He grimaces and calls out
Kevin, the wi-fi's out
Kevin
He looks to the minion at the coffee table
(') Hey, Lance
Where the heck is Kevin
The minion just shrugs and walks away
(') Alright, we need to revisit the number of vacation days you guys get
can't find anybody anymore
-
Someone's at the door
Gru turns to it
(
) Gru
It's Jillian
Gru pretends to shoot himself
(
) (') 've got good news
2              &     61
: '  - Jillian and her artificially beautiful friend  stand outside on Gru's porch
Shannon texts on her phone, looking bored
have my friend Shannon here with me
was thinking you two could get some grub, you know, tear it up
See what happens
: '  - (
) Uhh, open up
He sees Agnes walking by, singing softly and playing with her unicorn
He whisper-shouts to her
Agnes
Agnes
Tell Jillian 'm not here
Agnes turns to the door
Gru's not here
Are you sure
Yes
He just told me
Gru, panicking, shakes his head and wags his fingers
(') mean no, he didn't just tell me
(laughs) Agnes--where is Gru
Gru makes the "zip your lips" gesture
He's putting on lipstick
Gru waves his arms
(') He's swatting at flies
2              &       62
Gru waves his hand around his throat, making a "cut it off" gesture
(') He's
chopping his head off
Gru clenches his fists and grunts in frustration
(') He's
pooping
Outside, Jillian and Shannon look confused
(
) know you're in there, Gru
There's no way you're getting out of this
Kyle enters the room, carrying the bag with the wig in his mouth
:  - Establishing
:  - Shannon sits at a table talking to Gru, who's offscreen waiter drops off a plate of spaghetti
have to tell you,  was so nervous about tonight
mean there's just so many phonies out there
Gru sitting across from her
Wearing a ridiculous from Floyd
And looking extremely uncomfortable
Yes,  hear you
(awkwardly laughs) Oh, so do you work out
Well
mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it
Huh
() 2               &      63
(') Physical fitness is very important to Shannon
As you can tell, right
Huh
Shannon drops to the floor and starts doing push-ups
Ah
can tell
(mid-push-up) Solid
She switches to one-armed push-ups
We are in a restaurant, you know
Gru looks even more uncomfortable
Just then Lucy (unseen by Gru) enters the restaurant
She approaches the
Hi
Takeout for Lucy
Sure, just a sec
The Hostess leaves
Lucy looks around and then spots Gru
Sees him with the wig and Shannon who is now doing crunches on the floor
Lucy narrows her eyes, then has an idea
She presses a button on her watch, which transforms into a , and puts it in her ear
Now she's able to hear Gru and Shannon talking
She watches them, intrigued
Shannon has returned to her seat
Your accent is so exotic
Ah
Well, thank you very much was-- know someone who can fix that for you
And you'll be talking normal in no time
Gru is starting to sweat
Hahaha
Hoooo
Is it hot in here
Oof
How's the food
2              &       64
He wipes his brow and accidentally shifts the wig on his head
Shannon stares at Gru's hair
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Are you wearing a wig
(really sweating it) What
Ah
(readjusts the wig) don't think so
knew it
You're a phony
hate phonies
Oh
What
No
These locks are all mine
No they're not
You know what 'm gonna do
'm gonna rip that thing off your head and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are
don't think so, Miss Lady
Lucy presses a button on her watch and a target sight pops out
Gru watches in horror as Shannon reaches across the table for the wig
Quickly Lucy presses another button on her watch which fires a -  at Shannon
The mini-dart goes into Shannon's butt, knocking her out instantly
And saving Gru from certain humiliation
Gru stares at the now sleeping Shannon, confused
Hello
Hello, are you
(
) Hey, Gru
Gru quickly removes the wig
Hello, Lucy, how you doin'
2              &     65
(noticing Shannon) Wow, looks like your date's out for the count
It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer
Shannon  like a , then passes out again
(') (winks) Yeah, 'm winking `cuz that's what actually happened
approaches
(re: Shannon) `Scusi, whassa happenin' here
She no like
Oh, she's just uh-- (makes drinking gesture) The waiter nods and leaves
(laughs) Oh, oh, si, si
Lucy turns to Gru
Shall we take her home
:  - Gru and Lucy carry an unconscious Shannon out of the restaurant
Her head gets stuck in the swinging doors on the way out
They try to dislodge her and accidentally end up throwing her headfirst into a lamp post
They pick her up between them, Weekend at Bernie's-style
They wave to a passing
The cop tips his hat
:   - Gru and Lucy get in her car
But it's cramped with Shannon in there too
She doesn't really fit
2             &       66
:   - Lucy's car drives down the street
Gru and Lucy now have plenty of room in the car
We boom up to see that Shannon has been strapped to the roof like a deer
: '  - Gru and Lucy arrive at Shannon's house
Lucy comes to an abrupt stop and Shannon flies off the roof and slams into the car in front of them
: '  - Gru and Lucy sit on the front steps of Shannon's house
Well,  think you did it
You just officially had the worst date ever
Huh, tell me about it
Don't worry--it can only get better from here, right
But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun
've had to use it on one or two dates myself
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go, think 'm good with just the one
Gru and Lucy exchange looks
He
Time to go
Well, good night, partner
She pats his shoulder and walks toward her car
Gru gets up to walk beside her
(') This was fun
Yes
Surprisingly, it was
Oh, and uh, just between you and me
You look much better bald
2                 &      67
They smile at each other, and she gives him a peck on the cheek and walks away
(') See you tomorrow
Gru smiles a big smile
Shannon slumps over on the porch behind him
Could he be
falling in love
: '  - Gru's   goes off
He reaches out and turns it off
Ready to greet the day
:  - Gru happily washes in the shower, acting out a puppet show with his rubber ducky
Quack
Quack
Quack
:  - Gru brushes his teeth with two toothbrushes
He jokingly arranges them in his mouth like walrus tusks, then  like a seal
:  - -  are served to the girls sitting at the table
Edith makes a face at getting hers
Yeah
So  take it the date went well
No
It was horrible
He laughs gleefully
The girls exchange looks
What
Then he skips out of the room, dancing with a minion in the kitchen
Agnes's face lights up
Yes
2               &      68
:  - Gru makes his way to work--on foot: --he strolls down the sidewalk
--he passes a  and gives him a high five
High-five
Then a , with whom he exchanges mimed gunfire
Then a , with whom he bumps rumps
(') Bump it
Seeing something offscreen, Gru
--he stops traffic so a happy family of  can cross the street
--he plays ultimate frisbee with a bunch of  , balancing the spinning disc on his pointy nose
--he joins a group of   doing Tai Chi
--he "air" drums with a couple of   on the curb
--he picks a flower, then walks by a  and a  sitting alone with their backs to each other at a cafe
He quickly turns their chairs around so they find each other and hands the man the flower for the woman
They smile and Gru goes his merry way
:   - Gru continues happily dancing through the mall on his way to the cupcake shop
He shimmies with a   on the escalator, then  and stops suddenly upon seeing Eagle Hair Club closed
The  abruptly ends
Gru sees Silas speaking with an
Gru approaches him
(confused) Mr
Ramsbottom
Oh, hello
2              &      69
What are you doing here
We got him
Got who
Floyd Eaglesan
Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night, and uh, discovered this
He snaps his fingers and an  agent hands him a in a ziploc bag
Silas holds it up
(') It's empty, but we found traces of the -41 serum in it
He's our man
So somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one
carry Floyd away in handcuffs
was framed
You won't get away with this
Get your mitts off of me
am a legitimate businessman
Gru turns back to Silas
He is stunned by this
Ah
Alright
So
what now
Well, now you're free to go back to your "business
" Mmmm
Jams and jellies
And it looks like Agent Wilde will be transferring to our Australian branch
(in shock) Australia
Yes
But thank you--for everything
And by everything of course  mean
nothing
(beat) Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr
Gru
2             &      70
Silas walks away to join the  agents
Gru stares blankly, sadly
And then Lucy approaches him
Hey there
Hey
So
we got him
Yay
That's great
(beat) And now you're going to Australia
Well, it's not definite yet
Still figuring it out
Already been working on my accent
(Australian accent) Wallaby
Diggeri-doo
Hugh Jackman
(beat) So
um
Pretty excited
Great
Well
good luck
Thanks
You too
(remembering) Oh
Here
wanted to give you this
She holds out her lipstick taser
Your lipstick taser
Yeah, it's just a memento
Just, you know, from the first time we met
Oh
Thank you, Lucy
Gru accepts the lipstick taser
(
) Agent Wilde
2              &        71
Lucy ignores this and just waits, not wanting to leave
She and Gru stand there awkwardly
Well
it looks like they need you, so
Yeah,  uh,  better go
Bye, Gru
And she leaves Gru
He stands there
Completely miserable
:  - Gru walks back home, completely depressed
Walks past the college kids playing frisbee
Catches the frisbee and tosses it down the sewer
Walks past the group of bucket drummers
As he passes he one of the buckets
Walks past the old ladies doing Tai Chi
As they balance on one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over
: '  - It's pouring rain
Gru sits alone outside his house
Miserable
And then an  approaches him
It looks like it's traveling on its own
But when it gets closer it lifts up, revealing Agnes
brought you an umbrella
Gru takes the umbrella and Agnes joins him
They both huddle under it
Ah, thank you
What're you doing out here
Remember when you said that  liked Lucy
Well, it turns out
you're right
Agnes's face lights up
2                &     72
Really
Yes, but
well, she's moving away
(sadly) 'm never going to see her again
Agnes's face falls
All her hopes and dreams shattered
But she tries to encourage Gru
Is there anything  can do to help
Oh,  don't-- don't think so, sweetheart
Well, is there anything you could do
Gru thinks
: '  - Gru is on the
"Hello, Lucy
This is Gru
know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for Australia and all, but

"Would you like to--to go out on a date
" Dave the minion standing across from Gru, pretending to be on a cell phone on the other end of the line
And wearing a -
He shrugs
Eh, no
Okay, that's not helping
He hangs up
(') All right
Here we go
For real this time
2               &        73
He stares at Lucy's card
Then turns to the phone
It's a stand-off
He does stretches and calisthenics to psych himself up
He
(') can do this
He stares down the phone again
It sits there, taunting him
We cut back and forth between Gru and the phone, until finally-- (') Agh
hate you
He produces a  and burns up the phone
Dave dives out of the way
(') (satisfied) Ah
The   goes off
Suddenly  chop through the wall
Several minions in '  enter
Another minion imitates a siren through a bullhorn
Beedo
Beedo
Beedo
Beedo
One continues chopping everything in sight with his axe, then chops his way right through the wall of the house and falls outside
Another minion brings in a  , turns it on, and goes flying around the room as it whips around like a snake
Dave tests out a fire extinguisher
(') Beedo
Beedo
Beedo
Beedo
Gru takes away the bullhorn from the Siren minion
But he keeps on making the noise
(') Beedo
Beedo
Beedo
Dave fires the extinguisher at the Siren minion
He makes the noise again and Dave sprays him with the fire extinguisher, sending him flying offscreen
2            &       74
:    - The minions enjoy another day at the beach
Kevin the Golf minion drifts out in the water on an inner tube
He fixes his coconut bra, then unpeels a banana and eats it
:   - hand pulls a lever in a control room
:    - Suddenly a  appears in the water right next to him
He gets sucked into it
Kevin is pulled down to the bottom of the habitat and into a :  - Kevin pops out of the tube and lands in a waiting metallic chair
His hat follows him down the tube and lands on his head
metal strap fastens around his waist
He shrugs and continues to eat the banana
(
) Kevin
Kevin looks over and sees the French Maid Minion strapped into a chair nearby
He has a banana too
Tom
They raise their bananas in the air
& Bello
Compai
And then a   appears, looking like a huge, scary filled with purple liquid
The needle comes toward the French Maid Minion
(to the needle) Compai
The needle is injected into him and administers the serum
2             &           75
The French Maid Minion starts to shake
Contorts
Then into a

Kevin points and  at him

It injects him with the serum as well

The girls sit in the back, dressed up for the Cinco de Mayo party

Cinco de May- yay-yo
Cinco de May-yay-yo
Gru's expression doesn't change
They pull up to the front gate
: '   - Gru's vehicle pulls up in front of the open gate in front of Eduardo's house
His car almost knocks a bunch of parked cars off the cliff
The grounds are set up for the most elaborate and fun Cinco de Mayo party of all time
Sumptuous spreads of everywhere
hanging from trees
having a great time
Gru and the girls enter the compound
Whoa
This place is awesome
Okay
Let's party
Ah
But first let's go over the rules
Because what is fun without the rules
On Agnes with her mouth and arms full of churros
2               &     76
(') Agnes, easy on the churros
On Edith, swinging her ninja sword
(') Edith, try not to kill anyone
Hai
Margo-- As Gru turns to Margo he sees that she is holding hands with Antonio, face-to-face, almost close enough to kiss
Hello, Mr
Gru
Gru furrows his brow
Aghhh
Okay
He grabs Antonio and drags him far away from Margo
Gru
There must be the standard six feet of space between you and boys
(re: Antonio) Especially this boy
Gru turns and sees that Antonio is back next to Margo
(laughs) You are a funny man
There are no rules, Senor
It's Cinco De Mayo
(to girls) Come on
They're starting the dance
He grabs Margo's hand and takes off
Edith and Agnes follow
Agnes explodes with delight
(rolling her r like crazy) Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba
Gru watches them go
Frowns
2            &         77
: '  - Gru, sneaking through the party, spots Antonio and Margo dancing
Gru sneaks up on Antonio, using the flashing strobe lights to cover his approach
Suddenly Antonio is gone and Gru is the one dancing with Margo, who has her back to him and is oblivious to what's going on
Antonio reappears and kicks Gru in the crotch from behind
He dances once again with Margo while Gru hunches over in pain
Gru then gets the upper hand and starts choking Antonio and shaking him
Margo turns around and sees this
Gru and Antonio see they are being watched by Margo and start casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong
As the song ends, Margo takes Antonio's hand and pulls him away from Gru off the dance floor
Gru is defeated and all alone
: '  - Gru sits by himself in the corner, sulking and staring at Lucy's lipstick taser
walks by and places a tortilla chip sombrero on his head with the rim filled with guacamole
He breaks off a piece, dips it, and eats it
(
) So glad you could make it, mi compadre
Gru looks up and sees Eduardo standing there
Gru quickly hides the taser
(') (sensing something's wrong) Hey, what's wrong
Oh, nothing
Nothing is wrong
'm just chilling with the guac
from my chip hat
Gru takes another scoop of guacamole, smiles, and gives a thumbs up
glob of guacamole falls from the sombrero
Eduardo puts his arm around him
2               &     78
Gru, please
know that look all too well
It is the look of a broken heart
How did you know
Believe me, my friend,  too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole
You
Yes
But we are survivors
There's much more to us than meets the eye
Enjoy the party
Eduardo gives Gru a meaningful look
And then walks away
Gru watches him go
Deep in thought
Gru notices Eduardo suspiciously sneak away from the party and head into the house
Gru gets up from the table and follows Eduardo
As he walks through the party, several partygoers break tortilla pieces off his sombrero to eat
:   - Eduardo enters a dimly-lit room
Gru sneaks behind and peers through a crack in the door
:    - Eduardo stands in the center of a secret room, which is lined with Mayan-style totem poles
He dances on the tile floor, which lights up and plays "La Cucaracha" with each strategic step
The musical pattern is a code which opens a secret passageway through the largest totem's mouth
Eduardo enters and the mouth closes behind him
Gru tentatively enters the room
He pauses at the tile floor
He tries to replicate Eduardo's "La Cucaracha" code, but a glob of guacamole from his sombrero falls to the floor and hits the wrong tile
This activates a booby-trapped totem pole, which halves Gru's sombrero with a spear
2               &     79
What the--oh
Gru observes the destroyed sombrero in his hands
(') Huh
Gru attempts the code again, but missteps
An axe from the wall swings at him and misses
(') Oooh
Gru missteps again and one of the totems lights up and spits fire at him, burning his face
(') (dazed) Aaaahhh
He missteps again and a club whacks him over the head
(') Oh
One of the totems shoots darts at him, piercing his nose
(') (in pain) Aaaahhh
Gru falls to the floor
(') Oooohhh
His head hits the correct tile, and the Mayan passageway opens
Gru walks to the door, pointing at the totems and gloating
(') Aha
Ha ha ha-- The passageway doors slam on his arm
(') (in pain) Oh
He pulls his crushed arm through the doors
(') Ouch

Depressed
She She grabs an in flight magazine and opens it up to an ad for wristwatches
It reads; "  , " and shows a picture of Gru giving the thumbs up in a cockpit
Say what
Lucy reacts, shakes her head, and now the picture is just a regular airline pilot in the cockpit
Lucy turns the page
It's another ad, saying simply "Gru Now
" and showing a picture of a muscular Gru diving from a waterfall
She  and slams the magazine shut, then slowly reopens it to find the picture is really just a random muscular guy diving
It says "  -
" (
) Would you like some peanuts or pretzels
Lucy looks up from her magazine to see the flight attendant, who looks like Gru
She
Then looks across the aisle and sees a lady that looks and sounds like Gru, talking to another man who looks like Gru
Ha ha ha ha ha
That's a good joke
Then Lucy looks behind her and sees the young mother looks like Gru
The baby turns around and also looks like Gru
just did a boom boom
The flight attendant tries to get Lucy's attention
really need you to make a choice, hon
Close on Lucy as she has a moment of epiphany

choose Gru

Air rushes throughout the cabin

The flight attendant stands up, recovering from her twirl
You're welcome
The other passengers wave as the plane's oxygen masks fall from each overhead console
And with that, Lucy jumps from the plane, holding her purse

It's awesome and terrifying

Gru turns around and sees Eduardo dressed in El Macho's old wrestling outfit, like we saw in the flashback
Ha ha
knew it
You are El Macho
That's right
Nobody believed me
Ho ho
But knew you weren't dead

Nefario pops a celebratory noisemaker in the background
Woo-hoo
El Macho eagerly awaits Gru's reply
Gru just stares at him
How does he get out of this
Uh
yeah
probably
El Macho is taken aback
2                   &     84
Probably
Gru realizes he's in danger and quickly tries to backpedal

Yes
Of course, yes, just have a lot going on right now

Gru turns and sees Antonio dancing with a
Gru frowns
Yes
they stink
Sorry, honey, we've got to go
He takes her hand and leads her offscreen before popping back into frame and firing the freeze ray at Antonio
We see he is now frozen in a block of ice

: '  - Lucy looks around, but doesn't see Gru
She maneuvers her way through the crowd
Oops, sorry
She makes it through, but still no sign of Gru
Suddenly Pollito appears and exchanges looks with Lucy
He and flies towards her
She strikes a martial arts pose ready to defend herself
As she does, her purse falls to the ground
The attack never comes and she looks down to see Pollito pecking at her purse
(
) Pollito
What's the matter
El Macho appears and picks up the chicken, petting it
Oh, hey
Eduardo
Lucia

Pollito, he's usually not like this
The same thing happened the other day with
with Gru and
El Macho drops off, deep in thought
Connecting the dots
Lucy is oblivious
Oh, speaking of Gru

Yes,  think he's somewhere around here
You two are close, no
Oh,  don't know
mean close
wouldn't say we were close
Why, did he say we were close
Did he say that
2              &        87
It's more what he didn't say
For instance, he never mentioned
that you were both working for the Anti- Villain League
Suddenly El Macho turns Pollito around revealing that he has her  credentials in his beak
El Macho grabs Lucy
(') (threateningly) You're coming with me
He leads her away
Hey
We see Dr
Nefario watching this, in shock
He's holding a drink and a Mexican flag cupcake

It's Dr

Lucy
Wha--that's impossible
She's on her way to Australia

Nefario looks nervously offscreen
El Macho's coming
( ) Sorry, gotta go
Nefario disconnects the camera
The screen goes blank
Agnes  and turns to Gru
He's got Lucy
(determined) Not for long
Gru begins to walk out of the room
He turns to the minions
(') Come on
(beat) We're getting her out of there
Gru marches out of the room, fire in his eyes
man on a mission
To save the woman he loves
The minions are visibly disappointed to leave their video game
One of them clutches the controller in his hand and continues to play until the moment he exits the frame

He is scared by his own reflection in a shiny parked car
He spots a tricycle and eats it
Then Kyle spots him and

He stops when he sees the front door
: '  - Margo and Agnes sit on the floor playing a princess board game
Next to Agnes is her unicorn
They hear a   outside the window
Agnes looks scared
What was that
Margo stands up
Makes her way toward the window, which is covered with drapes
Then reaches a nervous hand and pulls back the drapes

Suddenly, evil minion Kevin appears at the window, looking really scary
Margo
2                 &     90
Evil minion Kevin crashes through the window and lands in the family room surrounded by shattered glass and tangled up in the curtain
He turns to the girls, who slowly back away
He looks at Agnes and

Margo grabs Agnes and they run out of the room, accidentally dropping the stuffed unicorn behind
Agnes stops and runs back for it
My unicorn
Agnes, no
Agnes stops and sees evil minion Kevin already has it in his mouth
Agnes screams a crazy -
It  all the glass in the room, including the glass in evil minion Kevin's goggles
He spits out the unicorn
He is slowed him down for a bit, so Agnes safely grabs the unicorn, and Margo grabs Agnes's hand
They run for the elevator to the lower level, with the purple minion hot on their tails
The elevator drops just in time
Evil minion Kevin slams into the glass door
: '  - Margo and Agnes run into the lab to find half a dozen minions milling about
'mon
Hurry
Whoa
Edith plays ping-pong with the minions using nun-chucks like Bruce Lee
Margo shuts the big iron door
Edith and the minions stare back at Margo
What's the matter
The purple minion has eaten its way through the ceiling

Whoa
It drops down into the lab and lands on a dazed yellow minion
The girls  as it jumps up and dashes towards them
Evil minion Kevin stomps toward the girls
They are backed into a corner

Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use
He pours the antidote into the vat
:  '  - Gru makes his way up the road leading to El Macho's house
He is wearing handcuffs, and being led at spear-point by Dave and Stuart, who have been painted purple to look like Evil minions
But they are goofing around and giggling
And they still have a few yellow spots
2               &     92
Hey, guys
Come on
Stay focused here
The minions somber up
Okay, okay
Gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint
They approach the front gate, which is closed
Dave boosts himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the intercom
He hears Evil Minion gibberish in response
He responds back in Evil Minion gibberish
The intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open
The gate opens and there are  of   milling about
They eye Gru and his captors suspiciously
Dave and Stuart poke Gru with a spear
(attempting to act) Curses
Foiled again
These guys captured me
The Evil Minions  at seeing this
Gru, Dave and Stuart have to walk all the way to the house surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions
The painted yellow minions are very nervous
The purple minions eye them as they pass
They  and the yellow minions attempt to back
It's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to make it
Then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at one of the painted ones
They get into a raspberry fight until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the slobber off him
It rubs off the purple paint
One of the evil purple minions points and
They're exposed
All of the purple minions run towards Gru, Dave and Stuart
Teeth bared
Ready to chomp

They take off running

:  '  - Gru and the yellow minions burst into El Macho's backyard
The Evil Minions give chase
Up that tree
Hurry, hurry
They climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be pursued by more minions up there
And the Evil Minions have devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either
With no escape, Gru and the minions run up a tower until they reach the top--a dead end
Here come the purple minions
They're trapped
Gru kicks them away and the yellow minions try to fight off the purple ones
But they are clearly doomed
And then Gru's ship appears hovering above them
Modified as a jelly-dispensing weapon and with Dr
Nefario at the controls
The minions hang on the sides holding The ship opens fire on the evil minions, transforming them
One by one they transform back into yellow minions
One of the Minions wipes the horrible tasting jelly off his tongue
Dr
Nefario sticks his head out the side of the ship
Hello, Gru
Hey, hey
Nice work, Dr
Nefario
Gru leaps onto the ship
put an antidote in the jelly
(beat) mean, 'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world, but nobody messes with my family
Thank you, Doctor
Now let's go get the-- Gru looks over to see Margo, Edith and Agnes onboard the ship, holding jelly blasters
2               &     94
Hi
Gru is flabbergasted
He turns to Nefario
You brought the girls
Yes
(beat) Oh
Was that wrong
Gru's ship flies toward El Macho, blasting purple minions all along the way
From behind a large jelly gun Edith unloads round after round
Wooooo
Yeeeaaahhh
El Macho witnesses his evil minions being converted back to regular ones
Oh no
What's happening to my minions
(beat) Gru
Gru turns to Nefario and the girls
You guys take care of the rest of the minions
(beat) 'm going to find Lucy
Gru leaps out of the ship down to the roof El Macho is on
He has two big jelly weapons in his hands
Meanwhile the ship flies off with its jelly blasters firing, and comes to land on the ground below
The minions and the girls start jumping from the ship
Agnes takes aim
Eat jelly, you purple freaks
Waaaaah
2            &       95
Agnes' gun is a little too big for her and the kick sends her a bit out of control
But she still manages to hit a number of Evil Minions
The tide is turning
Meanwhile, Gru has gone ballistic on the evil minions
He takes the remaining few out
El Macho kicks an evil minion at Gru, but he manages to hit it with jelly and transform it back to yellow
Gru holds his gun up to El Macho and gives him a threatening look
It's over, El Macho
Now where is Lucy
(chuckles) Let me show you
He turns to a computer and pushes a button
fountain stops spewing water and underneath it open from the ground
And out of them rises a
Strapped to it is Lucy
Tied to a  with strapped to her
Gru is horrified
He
Oh, hey Gru
Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh
(unconvincingly) Yay
El Macho calls to Gru, brandishing a remote
One push of this button and  send that rocket straight into the same volcano where  faked my death
Only this time--it's for real
(horrified) No
Dave swoops in on a rope and grabs the remote, Tarzan- style
Tally ho
2             &      96
But unfortunately he smacks a roof support and drops the remote
It bonks a bunch of minions on the head and lands on the ground
El Macho stares down Gru
Fire in his eyes
We could've ruled the world together, Gru
But now--you're gonna die
He pulls out a vial of -41 and drinks it
Gru
El Macho transforms into a giant, purple, furry creature
He Gru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun, but he is out of ammunition
He then pulls out the   and fires, encasing El Macho's fists in blocks of ice
El Macho and slams his fists to the ground, shattering the ice and knocking Gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding
Gru The scaffolding tips over
El Macho grabs the scaffolding and holds it above his head, ready to crush Gru
Suddenly Gru pulls out Lucy's lipstick taser and fires it at Purple El Macho
The jolt of electricity has him shaking and dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking, until he finally collapses on the ground
Lipstick taser
Lucy smiles at this
Aw
he copied me
Gru runs off to save her
The minions surround El Macho, cocking their jelly guns
(dazed) am not afraid of your jelly guns
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine
Dr
Nefario fires the Fart Gun directly into El Macho's face, causing him to pass out
The minions , firing their jelly guns into the air
2             &       97
One of the minions stands on top of El Macho and poses for a big game hunter-style photo
Dr
Nefario smiles for the camera as well
Gru runs toward the rocket
Don't worry about me, Gru
'll be fine

(beat) Okay, that's not entirely true
'm actually kind of freaking out up here
Don't worry-- will get you out of this
Gru attempts to untie Lucy
And then sees Pollito has walked over to the remote
Gru and Lucy
The chicken looks at Gru and Lucy, then pecks the button

The Minions and Girls watch in horror as Gru and Lucy fly off on the rocket

To no avail

Gru , realizing they are approaching the
Time is running out
Death is imminent
He looks Lucy in the eyes
2              &      98
Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of this alive, so  need to ask you a question
Uh, better make it quick
If 'd asked you out on a date, what would you have said
Are you kidding me
Yes
Gru smiles
Then realizes that the rocket is still careening toward the volcano
He grabs Lucy
Gru and Lucy grab hands and leap off the rocket
The rocket plunges into the volcano
Gru and Lucy plummet through the air
-
The volcano explodes in a massive tempest of fire and smoke and lava
The impact of the blast hits Gru and Lucy and sends them flying
They hit the water
The volcano continues exploding
Gru emerges, soaking and out of breath
Fire and lava flying all around him
He can't find Lucy
(') Oh

(looks around, panicking) Lucy
Where are you
After a few moments, Lucy also emerges
Gru is incredibly relieved
(') Oh, Lucy
Gru

Lucy smiles and hugs Gru
They both go underwater
