-Net executives chill
Um, that would be
Legal
Eyes land on withering
Change it back to the way  wrote it
With the launch of -Net, this company guarantees one hundred percent secure data transmission
If we can't deliver on that promise, we deserve to be out of business
Rush appears from a building

What can't wait, Rush

What's she doing here
This is an operations meeting
You and Meg still, eh
At it
There was never anything between us
Kelter and Phlegman trade a look
Sure
She's Advanced Projects
This has nothing to do with her
Sinclair storms in
Room falls silent
This company's existence depends on the flawless launch of -Net in twenty- two hours, fifty-one minutes
Now somebody - some hacker, some competitor, somebody - just proved they're smarter than us
Breaking into -Net is theoretically impossible
Everybody looks at Rush
This creep's the best 've ever seen
He crosses platforms, cracks 128 bit encryption, cloaks every move, never leaves a trace
When you find him, 'll be sure to hire him
11 23   :    (2) Chuckles around the room
Mood chills: Sinclair's not laughing
Boys and girls, we cannot sell a secure network that is not secure
We delay the launch
And the world assumes we've got a faulty product
And they'd be right
We ramp up our encryption schemes - Thicken all firewalls - We can't win playing defense
And it's a bigger job than just swatting an intruder program
Somewhere, there's a human mind behind this thing
We have to get to that User and shut him - or her - down, or the game never ends
Meg listens quietly
Studies Rush
What do you need, Rush
20 guys for 20 days - We don't have 20 hours
This problem needs to be gone before tomorrow 9AM
Come on people, this company's future is at stake
It's time to think without a box
Minds ponder grimly
Finally, a lone  rises
It's , the company Archivist
At a time like this, let's seek inspiration in the past
We should ask ourselves: What solution would spring from the inspired mind of our departed leader, Flynn
() 12 23   :    (3) He's got an obituary photo of , Encom's legendary previous - and deceased -
Groans around the table
Execs rolls their eyes, disses Rudy's idea
Flynn has become a stale company joke
Rudy sheepishly sits
But Sinclair stops behind Rudy, eyes fixed on the photo of Flynn
An idea takes hold
He looks to Meg
Is the -401 is operational
Um
Midway into phase one testing
Confusion among execs
Nobody knows what a "-401" is
Not even Rush
If we can't fight this intruder from the outside, then maybe we need to fight him from the inside
Meg's mind races
'm ready to do my part
This company needs a hero
Who among you is the smartest, most resourceful and courageous
Looks trade around the table
Meg slowly rises, indicating her choice
Who else could it be
She's singled out Rush
24
-   - Meg leads Sinclair and Rush to a
Her retinal scan  opens the door
They step in
25
-   - Somebody going to tell me what 've been volunteered for
() 13 25   : Rush, you're the only one  can trust to eliminate the intruder
But you won't be doing it the way you thought
Meg's been working on something down here that's, well
Beyond Top Secret
Rush drills a look at Meg, but she keeps it all business
26
- Out the elevator, Meg leads them into a maze of ultra-tech gear
This is where Flynn worked
And where he died
Amid sleek new equipment, there's a glass cabinet housing a of strange machinery
Meg has reconstructed Flynn's last project
This time it works
Mega signals lab assistant
He pokes buttons: unfolds and boots up
You didn't pick this up at Circuit City
What is it
Quantum Digitizer
Prototype, only one of its kind
Flynn designed it to break down physical objects into high resolution data
Luckily, we salvaged his key components and back-engineered the system
She opens a cage, places her   (Jo-Jo) on a target stage
Dewey boots controls, presses commands
Beam array scans the rat into the computer, forming a 3D rat-image on screens, dematerializing the physical rat
Device revs down
Rush runs his hand over the empty target stage
That's
Not possible
Lab rat has vanished from the physical world
Its digitized image rotates on monitors
() 14 26   : Flynn was trying to take it one step further
He wanted to transport a human being into cyberspace
You mean the urban legends computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace a long time ago
We think it happened
Meg agrees
Rush gets a chill
It was a fluke
But Flynn worked for years, down here, trying to make it happen again
One day a test went bad
plasma reaction destroyed this lab
Flynn was reduced to ash
Rush views the charred remains in the glass case
Photos of the destroyed lab
Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene
was never told how he died
It was all just weird, you know, because Flynn's the guy who hired me
But he was strange, kept to himself, didn't know what job  was supposed to be doing
(to Sinclair) Then you came onboard, the company woke up, we had a direction
It was kind of pathetic, because by the time Flynn died, everybody was too busy to care
He was brilliant in his way, but genius without discipline leads to nothing
His reckless habits nearly ruined this company
And for sure got him killed
last look at the charred remains of Flynn's machine
That kind of accident can't happen again
We've upgraded the system in ways Flynn never could
The chips didn't exist until now
() 15 26   :    (2) She presses commands
Beams re-materialize the lab rat on the target stage
Jo-jo is as good as new
Hey, Jo-Jo
Have good trip
She puts the rat in on her shoulder, feeds it a tidbit
Then she scrutinizes Rush
Rush considers Meg, then turns to Sinclair
You want her to send me into cyberspace to catch that jerk who hacked us
The future of this company depends on it
Rush looks to Meg
She offers a reassuring nod
You can bring me back okay
Ask Jo-Jo
Lab rat is perched happily on her shoulder
Destroy the intruder by 9AM tomorrow, Rush
know if anyone can, it's you
've had my eye on you for a long time
Score this hit and 'll make you my full partner in this company
Rush is awe-struck
Ready, willing, able
He shakes Sinclair's hand, sealing the deal
won't let you down
Let's do it
Meg removes target stage, swings a custom   in place
Rush lowers in place
Meg buckles him in
Last chance for a private word: promise 'll get you back safely by 9AM tomorrow
But you have to promise me something too - () 16 26   :    (3) You're a piece of work
You dumped me because you said  was too much about the company's needs and not enough about yours
Well here we are, the company needs their best guy, and you just can't admit how much to hurts to nominate me
This bigger than us, Rush
Listen to me
don't know what you're going to find in there, but whatever it is, promise you'll follow your heart and do the right thing
Rush stares at here, in shock
Oh
So you think  have a heart
Meg breaks away, retreating to the controls with Sinclair
Rush's trails her with his eyes - he can't stop looking

You are in error
Zero match
Exactly
That's how he's getting past you
You don't see him for what he is
He's one of your own, gone bad
Tron was a crude security program from Encom's old days
Strictly low-rez, right
Archived and forgotten
But his source code contains all the architecture of every Encom system, including -net

Oh geez
There must be a way to link him into this
Rush touches Plexor's command console, but his energy the system - -Takks pull Rush away
Zero match for a "Sinclair"

Krod gawks at the image, but he's stumped
The green guy faked out the red guy, but the red guy double-faked the green guy
Bingo
Okay
And the green guy splattered big time
It was awesome
How could  forget that
Splat happens in Rush's memory image
All goes white

She pulls her disk off her back and raises it above her head
Data energizes around her
She clenches hard, trying to make the connection
converges off her disk, reaching skyward

-     - Meg and Dewey work to dismantle the lab
Meg walks past, stops
Comes back
Reads fresh text on a computer screen:
Dewey
This your idea of a joke

-Net Specialists drops the sides on a cubic cage
frozen dog-like   stands like a statue
Plexor nods
-Net Specialist activates
Cybavor comes alive
Circuits
Eyes pulsing
Plexor summons an -Net Worker Drone
Install yourself over there
Worker Drone does as he's told
He freezes in place
Attack
Cybavor leaps like a hyena, bounds the length of the hall
at the Worker Drone
And   mercilessly
Energy sparks fly, circuits zap, as the Cybavor digest the energy,  , then     (like ), then regrows the missing halves
Now the Cybavor is a  of nasty, snarling Cybavors
End routine
Cybavors sit
Elegant
Surveying his perfect defenses, he notices one thing missing
Where is Mega

92 114   :    (2) -Takks file out in perfect lines, turn perfect corners, dispersing into the compound
Each one moves in exactly the same way
Plexor turns sharply to exit, encountering
Mega
Standing there obediently
115
- On the fortress perimeter, -Takks stand watch at the base of a deep security moat
They turn, eyes scanning
Behind them, a   extends into the canyon, then swings across
It's "tronified" Rush, using his vaulting pole to ferry Fighters across the moat edges
He returns to the far side, landing momentarily on a lone central pinnacle to make the distance
Rush vaults back to gather Krod, who's the last to cross
Don't take this the wrong way
Don't drop me
He hugs Krod and vaults them across
Krod clings and struggles, then  - -Takks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edges
On top of the pinnacle, Rush and Krod hunker
Flynn signals from the far side "stay down
" -Takks patrol below, pausing to gaze up
Atop the pinnacle, Krod's circuits energy-zap with fear
Rush holds him down
At last, -Takks move on
Rush extends his light pole to the moat floor - vaults to the far side with Krod
Krod stabilizes, looks around
Yeah,  recognize this place know where everything is
93 115   : He heads off, encounters a dead end
Quantz pulls him the right way
116
/ Boole and Code Monk B3t help Flynn to a secluded data buffer
Rush, up there
See it
Rush leaps to a high circuitry nexus
hope you're right about Mega
Rush touches circuitry, energizing it with data
Mega's image appears in circuitry energy patterns
You
Where is Flynn
We're all here
arranged for your entry
An encryption portal has been left unlocked
Path 4786324BXY
Do you know the way
Rush looks down to Code Monk J2r
He gives a high sign
117
-   / Mega watches glowing circuity image of Rush
We got it
Hurry
She deactivates
Rush's image vanishes
Mega thinks for a moment - we're not sure what - then walks around a corner
Bumps smack into: Plexor
Flanked by his two snarling Cybavors
94 117   : You contacted them
Yes
And
gave them the portal address
They will attempt entry soon
Perfect
We will be waiting

Rush leaps to a vantage point them
Scouts a route, signals Flynn, Krod, Boole, Quantz and the Code Monkeys
Fighter team scales a narrow ledge near the
It's like a sheet of molten lead, pouring endlessly before them
lethal barrier
This is all yours, Rush
Rush pulls his disk, holds it over his head and steps under the molten data flow
He struggles against raw power, disk , splashing aside the molten data
Go
Quick
Code Monkeys, Flynn and Krod, Quantz and Boole dive between Rush's legs, emerging on the other side
Barrier overcome
Rush leaps out of the firewall, clutching his white-hot disk
No sweat
(to himself) N1J That way to the portal
Let's do it
95 118   : They head for the fortress along a surreptitious route, avoiding -Takk patrols
119
- Plexor - with Mega and the Cybavors two paces behind - leads an army of -Takks
Cybavor growls at Mega
She growls back
There it is
That's the portal
Plexor masses his forces around a closed
It is a dark semispheric aperture, left unlocked (but closed)
Converge on all levels
Outside patrols close in behind these coordinates
-Takks come from all directions, all levels
120
- Flynn pauses to see -Net Patrols in motion, across bridges, through tunnels
All around
Something's up
Keep moving
They come to a dark encryption portal, seen from their exterior view
Portal 4786324BXY
This is it
Flynn withdraws the
The sooner Rush gets this into the main power supply, the sooner -Net shuts down
And the more of us come out of here to tell about it
Rush takes the hologon, stows it
Pumped looks between Code Monkeys, Boole and Quantz
Krod trembles
96 120   : Oh man,  think 'm leaking
Krod
You'll do great
Think so
Your recognize patterns better than any of us
You'll know Plexor's moves before he does
hope you're right
Rush
Yeah man
Are you really a "User"
Is there such a thing
Is that what makes you so good
All Programs hang on Rush's answer
Flynn too
Flynn and  come from a realm no better or worse than here
One thing  know, neither place works unless you're looking out for the other guy
And we've got a word for what all of you are
Obsolete
Heroes
Cool
B3T 'm ready
Let's do it
Fighters hustle under the shadow of the portal
Approaching the closed semispheric aperture
97 121

Plexor marks time
Cybavors poise to attack
Mega, emotions rising, takes a step back
122 Flynn falters on his wounded leg
Fighters steady him
Rush steps forward, places a hand on the semispheric aperture
Mechanism activates

Gathering near Rush - , revealing a stunning view of: The inside of the fortress
Not an -Takk in sight
Nothing to it
Rush leads group inside

Senses trouble

Semispheric aperture irises open to reveal: -Takk Patrol
Charging in from outside
No fighters in sight

Many crash, zap and fizzle
Cybavors leap in, devouring corrupted -Takks
The two Cybavors use energy "food" to bifurcate into
They do so, instantly
Plexor fumes
You've been tricked
He spins to find Mega gone
Mega has betrayed me for the last time
She is with the fighters
Find them
126
- Mega  from the scene
Around a corner, she collides with Rush, Flynn, Krod & Fighters
Breathless: Flynn
Keep moving
This way
'm proud of you, Mega
linked with
Users exist
She instructed me
Go, Meg
She glances over the new "tronified" Rush
Despite herself, she's impressed
But there's no time for talk
Which way to the power supply
(scanning) Ummmm
That way
99 126   : Rush leaps to a high ledge to confirm: Massive throbbing power supply   lies at the center of the fortress's concentric squares
High sign to Krod
You're right
There it is
And here they come
Rumble precedes:     of -Takks, coming to get them
J2R Break out the toys
-Takks are upon them, and the battle is joined
-Net disks fly by the hundreds
Krod and Code Monkeys fire a  projectile, which opens mid-air into a super-wide circular magnetic field "net"
field sucks in -Net disk and zaps them to ash
-Takks charge
Rush flips down from above, throws tron-disk - Disk ricochets of ten -Takks, mows them down
Rush retrieves his disk, lands near Krod and Fighters
Block this choke point, slow them down
Can you guys do it
Not a problem
He throws his disk behind his back, takes out an approaching -Net goon
Rush hurries away with Mega and Flynn
Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys are besieged by a hundred -Takks
Whoa
Retreat
That way
Keep firing
Plexor enters the battle arena with his four
He scans keenly, then heads off another direction
100 127
-  / Flynn hobbles, helped by Mega
Rush leads them around a corner, in sight of: Massive reactive
Rush comes to the edge of a deep, narrow moat
Bottom is      a channel of ,
No bridges
We have to get across
Six -Takks are upon them, disks flying, NegaByte eraser beams swinging
Flynn Takes a hit in the chest
Rush and Mega dodge, fling their disks with lethal accuracy - -Takks crash and fall, tumbling into the moat abyss, flashing as they hit the molten bottom
128
- Krod, Boole and Quantz bait a phalanx of -Takks, Code Monkeys spring a  , which cuts off a column at the base
Column tumbles, crashing -Takks, blocking the way
High fives among Krod and Fighters
One Small -Takk breaks through,  through the air, reforming,
Fighters turn to blast him
But Krod recognizes the pattern: Wait
know that dude
Quantz stuns an -Takk Soldier - Code Monkeys hack his -Net Armor
Armor powers down, revealing: -beem
-beem shakes off his brainwashing
() 101 128   : - Krod my friend
Who are these guys
We're taking out Plexor
You with us or them
-Takks attack the group, including -beem
-beem zaps away, reappearing next to an -Takk
He steals the -Takk's   and mows down three -Takks, saving trapped Boole
- With you
-beem joins Fighters as they press deeper, engaging the next -Takk onslaught
129
-     - Rush and Mega haul Flynn along a narrow ledge
There
You can make it across
He points to a thin ledge on the other side, far below
Rush extends his Light Pole to the ledge, moves to gather Flynn for a vault-crossing
No, take Mega
'll stay here and run interference
You haven't got a chance by yourself
Ah, these guys are wimps
It's bravado: They know his odds are dismal
Flynn slumps into an alcove, which is only big enough for him
He pulls a supply of  -, ready to defend himself
We're not leaving you
My body is weak, but my will is strong
promise, no matter what they do to me, 'll survive this
Trust the bigger plan
() 102 129   : He's fading fast
But Flynn - -Takks attack along the ledge
Rush throws his arm around Mega and  across the moat, landing on the far side - gaining a slim foot-hold below a core
Flynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws
His mini disks take out -Takks on the ledge
Their bodies tumble into the moat, flashing as they hit
Flynn spins, the wall behind him opens
At the end of a square corridor stands: Flanked by his four snarling Cybavor beasts
Flynn
Your moment of obsolescence is upon you
Across the moat, Rush and Mega climb to the entry point
Flynn plays for time, stalling Plexor so he doesn't catch sight of them
Freedom, Plexor
It's the better idea
That's why Mega chose my side
If an idea is erased from all memory banks, it can be neither good nor bad
When each alternative has been removed, -Net will simply
With a hand signal, he commands his Cybavors
They raise up, poised to attack Flynn
Crash me
Hack me
Do what you want
The yearning for freedom will last forever
Nice speech
He flicks a finger
Cybavors gallop at Flynn
103 130
- Rush and Mega gain footing at the entry point
They turn at the sound of
Across the moat, a gut-wrenching sight: All four Cybavors pounce on Flynn, hurling him off the ledge, mauling him as they go down, dividing into eight - Plummeting toward the   far below
Plexor steps out of his corridor, relishing the view:      Remains of fallen bodies  into the inferno
Noooooo
Plexor sees Mega and Rush on the other side
Over there
Surround them
Bridges instantly extend from outer square to
-Takks stream across, firing - 131 Rush and Mega duck inside entry point, pelted by disks
Before them:  vast, brilliant, energized
Power surges in rings, drawing down huge columns
Every piece of geometry is based on perfect squares, made of mirror-finished rare earth elements
Rush pulls the   into view
Facets resonate with energy patterns like those in the core
We plug this into the control cell, -Net is history
Let's do it for Flynn
They share a heartbeat of solidarity
Rivalry gone
-Takks stream in, firing
Rush and Mega charge the center, throwing disks, fighting back-to-back
() 104 131   : Problem is,   move continuously down the columns - and the columns are spaced close - leaving just enough time between ring-passes to jump through
He and Mega , nearly raked by down-flowing
-Takks fire   - but many of the beams are caught in the energy flow and sucked away
That's how intense this place is
-Takk Soldier is grazed, stumbles into rakes down and  him nasty - reducing him to bits, sucking his energy to the levels below
Rush and Mega encounter oncoming -Takks - they must split up
They fling disks, taking out -Takks, dodging fire - working their way deeper
Meg and Rush throw their disks simultaneously
Both disks score hits, then arc to return
Rush and Mega catch each other's disk
They each look at the strange disks - it's just not the same
The do a quick swap and keep fighting
Over there
The
Dead center
132 Rush and Mega battle off three -Takks - the way is clear
Rush leaps, crashes planes of silicon
Stows his disk, pulls out the
Spots the control cell's key receptacle -
Rush moves to insert the hologon
his arm -  flies wild
drops from above, riding an
Where did you get that
No one knows this code but me
() 105 132   : Your software has the biggest flaw there is, Plexor
You can't see you own mistakes
Plexor snatches his Death-disk, corners Rush for the kill
Mega's disk crashes silicon, comes at Plexor - But his defense field repels it
He slams it aside and it's raked away by downward flowing energy rings
Rush  at
He's like a statue
But this time holds him and infuses tron-energy, breaking down Plexor's defense field, eating into his body circuits
It's fractal zapping fireworks - evenly matched foes battling face-to- face
Do it Mega
Mega scoops  off floor, makes for   - Plexor's hand shoots out,  , stops her like iron
Plexor exerts his power, holds Rush and Mega by the throats with his two hands, backing them toward a surface ripping with
Rush and Mega struggle, an inch from death - - Plexor stops, annoyed
Turns and sees: Krod, Fighters and -beem have arrived, firing blasters at Plexor's
It hardly makes a dent, but it creates a fleeting opportunity for Rush - Rush ducks forward,  his disk off his back, smacking Plexor in the throat
Mega falls clear - Rush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down his body, but he fights the effects an
He step away, shakes off the damage, retrieves his disk into a hand
Mega snags the hologon - She tosses it to Rush, who's already airborne - Rush catches hologon, sails to the control unit - 106 132   :    (2) Jams hologon into its receptacle
Plexor cocks his death disk,   - - Hologon  with   - Shockwaves  - Energy rings go dim, then dark - Silicon shatters to ash - -Takks power down
-Net armor de-rezzes, leaving innocent civilian Programs
They shake off the mind-control and rise unshackled
And Plexor, like all things -Net, chatters and glitches
His code erodes, his bits darken, the fiber of his being erodes from inside
Now who's obsolete
Rush executes a final leap, extending his feet for the final blow, straight at Plexor -  - shattering him to bits
Rush finally breathes
Sees -beem, Krod, Quantz, Boole, Code Monkeys
Thanks guys
'll never let you forget it
Boole tosses Rush his tron-disk
133 Rush, Mega, Krod, -beem, Fighters and liberated Programs stow disks and step to a high vantage point
Before them expands a vista of cyberspace
Power-down of -Net radiates in all directions, leaving everything else intact
Beautiful, exotic old data networks instantly begin to regenerate into the open space
We're free
At last we're free
107 134
-    - Sinclair commands the podium: In a world exposed to increasing data corruption,  hereby switch on the first global network offering 100% guaranteed data security
Flawless performance, zero downtime
The world works hard, the world deserves
He throws a switch
monitors blaze with -Net logos and graphic portals
Countdown 3,2,1
-
-Net instantly
All screens jam, glitch and
Crowd is stunned
Sinclair is mortified
135 Krod, -beem, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys
Mega embraces Rush
Energy sizzles between them
underestimated you
Thanks
She presses her lips to his
It's electric
(to -beem) You knew she always liked him
B3T Is she pinging his
J2R can't see from here
But out of triumph, a sudden concern - Rush's body shoots   into Mega, into ground circuits
Lightshow overload intensifies and spreads
Mega backs away in pain
108 135   : Whoa, ouch, what
Ahhhhh
Rush, what is it
Rush's body   into the energized circuitry
Guys
Mega
He reaches a hand to Mega
her, but she clasps his hand anyway
Help him
Code Monkeys attempt desperate measures, but soon it's over
Bits of Rush dissipate into surrounding circuitry, then in blazing curtain, like a quantum aurora borealis
Mega is left with a handful of nothing
It's the way it should be
He's going back to the place he belongs
136 Rush's energy body hurls across cyberspace
Bits streak, light bends - 137
- Rush materializes in the target chair
Human flesh, real clothes
Same as the moment he left
He bolts up, realizes where he is
Looks at his hands
Sees Jo-jo the rat staring at him
Meg and Dewey hurry over to unstrap Rush
Meg holds his hands, checks the integrity of his body
Rush
You made it
109 137   : Like a bad cold, 'm always coming back
He made it
Rush
You okay
Rush looks around
Miles ("Krod") and a group of oddly- familiar Co-
People who look just like -beem, Quantz, Boole and the Code Monkeys
(double-takes on Meg) met a program you wrote
She's just as incredibly beautiful and confusing as you
know
Mega told me all about what you did in there
She gave you my coordinates
That's how you uploaded me
Yes
Your coordinates
and his
They look across the room
At the control console stands a  with his back to us
He's curiously examining Meg's equipment
She's done an amazing job here, Rush
He turns
It's
In the flesh
Leg healed
Flynn
told you to trust the bigger plan
'd come to suspect Flynn was alive, inside
But  had no way to know for sure
You picked the right guy to send in
110 137   :    (2) Working down here,  became convinced someone tried to murder Flynn
But the only person  could confide in was the guy  suspected most
Elevator opens
Sinclair charges in, furious
Trailed by
What are you people doing down here
Get back to work
-Net has
We'll all be ruined
Speak for yourself, Sinclair
Sinclair wheels to see Flynn: Alive, standing in front of him
Trapped by the ugly truth, Sinclair turns rage on Meg
ordered you to destroy this equipment
Rush gets in Sinclair's face
Hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty work
Neither do
Not anymore
You lied to me, to all of us
You want to deal with somebody
'm the guy who crashed -Net
Sinclair goes for Rush
Rush delivers a solid punch
Sinclair grabs his bloody nose
You're fired, everybody get out
No, Sinclair
'm back
And 'm the boss again
You're fired
Not only are you fired, you're going to have a lot of explaining to do to the , the Justice Department and the
(to  ) Hold him until the police get here
1 Yes Sir, Mr
Flynn
haul out Sinclair
() 111 137   :    (3) Flynn addresses the group
-Net is dead
But Encom lives
We're going to bring this company back to its place as the leader in finding the next big thing
'll need to be free to do the dreaming
So, effective immediately, 'm appointing two bold, bright, courageous people to head worldwide operations
He presents Rush and Meg
They're stunned
You both earned it
Cool
love it
We'll take it
(to Miles - "Krod") You get a division to run
Yes
(to Phlegman) Does that mean a bigger cubicle
Cheers all around
Flynn approaches Rush and Meg
Put on some coffee
You two are going to be putting in a lot of overtime together
Meg turns to Rush
Do you remember how, along time ago, you used to give me a professional congratulatory peck on the cheek
Rush goes for the lips
