Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas
Tuffnut mocks Snotlout with a mugging grin
Nope
Still hates you
Let's blow this place, Belch
Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke
As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut  her sheep into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap crossing
Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding dragon
The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep

What are you doing, Snotlout
They're going to win now
She's my princess

Only for a few hours

But that was five years ago
Now they've all moved in
And, really, why wouldn't they
The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon stables
They exit through the far side and circle back through the village, blasting past many of its dragon- friendly additions

In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting one of the Viking houses aflame

And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward them,
Get `em, Astrid
It's  glory
No sheep, no You're always ruining glory

Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and into the trees of a neighboring peak
They tumble down the uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau
Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings
He switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and stows his leather wings
(') That really came out of nowhere
The blown up sea stack collapses
(') We gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud
That locked-up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh
Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet, revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete with a Viking braid
He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea- stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the dappled afternoon sunlight

Well

Picking up on all my heartfelt remorse
Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge

Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground

Toothless playfully retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head

Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter --
Toothless rests his head on Hiccup --    out of him
Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup, lapping at his face and covering him in slobber

He unfurls it to reveal an  , modified with added strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding world
Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new dragons
Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick
Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge, then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his forearm
(') So what should we name it
Toothless  as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied
(') "Itchy Armpit" it is
Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline
(') Whaddya reckon, bud
Think we might find a few Timberjacks in those woods
The odd Whispering Death or two in the rocks
Who knows

Where have you been
Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless rushes up to greet them
Winning races
What else
The real question is
where have  been
Avoiding my dad
Oh, no
What happened now
Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to the map
Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a play fight

Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him
Okay, first of all,  don't sound like that
What is this character
And second

Okay

Oh, my gods
She jumps to her feet, beaming
(') Hiccup, that's amazing
And socks Hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up
She laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously
You're gonna wear out the spring coil
The calibration is very sensitive

this is what 'm dealing with
Astrid helps him up and dusts him off
() What did you tell him
didn't
By the time he turned around,  was gone
Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him, processing it all
Well, it's a lot of responsibility
The map will have to wait for sure, and 'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy
She pauses, wincing in sympathy
She turns to Hiccup
He nods knowingly, taking the map from her
It's not me, Astrid
All those speeches, and planning, and running the village
that's his thing
think you're missing the point mean, chief
What an honor
'd be pretty excited
Hiccup shakes his head
'm not like you
You know exactly who you are
You always have
But
He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land

He sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless
Astrid approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out at the distant horizon
She weaves another braid into his hair as she speaks
What you're searching for
isn't out there, Hiccup
She places a hand on his chest
(') It's in here
() Maybe you just don't see it yet
She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless' slobber
She grimaces, wiping it off
Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly
Maybe
But, y'know
there is something out there

They fly deeper, through ash and wafting smoke

Astrid struggles to free her as they toward a collision
Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless  her at the last second
Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net
Trappers rush out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons
She whips her tail, sending spikes flying
Watch the tail
large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her down like a rodeo cowboy
(') Tie those legs up
Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into submission -- clearly a pro among pros
He looks up, revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that search the sky as Toothless' tell-tale  scream rings out

Toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and landing with a

Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward Stormfly
Eret's men immediately draw weapons
Hiccup extends and ignites his   -- a telescoping fiery sword -- impressive enough to wow Eret's men
Back again
Eret steps forward, focused only on Toothless
(') Soil my britches
that is a Night Fury
Thought they were all gone for good
(to his fellow trappers) Looks like our luck's had a turn for the better, lads
Don't think Drago has one of those in his dragon army
His men sound out in agreement
Hiccup eyes Astrid, confused
Dragon army
Look, we don't want any trouble
Ha
You should've thought of that before you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits
Wait
What are you talking about
Astrid and Hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it together
2 (
DeBlois) -   - 05/05/14 17
You think we did this
Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do-gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them
What do-gooder -- there are other dragon riders
You mean, other than your thieving friend from last night
You tell me
Eret approaches
Toothless snarls, protectively
(') You may have an ice-spitting dragon on your side, but we still have a quota to fill
How do you suppose we explain this mess to Drago Bludvist
Drago what-fist
Does anything you say make sense
He's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow
- And Drago don't take well to excuses
Eret parts his tunic, revealing a large branding-iron scar on his torso, in the shape of a dragon skull, split by a sword
This is what he gave me last time showed up empty-handed
He promised to be far less understanding in the future
() Look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting dragon, or your lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay

DeBlois) -   - 05/05/14 18

Eret lunges toward them

Making quick use of the distraction, Hiccup re-ignites his dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding Stormfly

Stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold, and hands Hiccup pencil
Exasperated, Hiccup begins tracing an outline as he speaks
We didn't stick around to find out
These folks weren't particularly friendly
Oh, really

Toothless, stay
Hiccup flips the latch, lowering the grate as Eret watches, confounded

Hiccup thrusts his Dragon Blade through the grate
Oops

How is this a plan
He retracts the blade and offers it up
crewman cautiously takes it, looking it over
The pommel of the hilt is expelling green gas
Just what every dragon trapper needs

The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas

Hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck

Stormfly bolts after it

No game
We just want to meet Drago
And returns in a flash, dropping it at Eret's feet like a fetching dog, tongue wagging
Eret throws it again, frustrated
Stormfly returns with it just as quickly
Why
Because 'm going to change his mind about dragons
Eret and his crew
Astrid pokes out of the well

She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace, overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring waterfalls

Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of dragons -- nearly all of Valka's rescues -- are close on their tail
He turns back to his mother, confused
Hey,  thought we were going to eat
(with a mischievous grin) Oh, we are
She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense shoal of fish near the surface
Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface
It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing back down into the sea
Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air
Hiccup gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a mouth full
- Hiccup has his map spread out in the snow, explaining the various lands he's discovered during his explorations
And from Dragon Island,  found this archipelago

She returned to Hiccup's side with a smile
But his amazement is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over Valka's map with a giant icicle
Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper sneers
- Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff
One by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong updraft, popping their wings open like kites
They ride the wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric dance
It's clearly a form of dragon play
Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind, laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip to wing tip
She then drops out of sight, reappearing a moment later standing atop Cloudjumper
Hiccup is in utter awe of her
Valka breathes in the frigid air

Toothless descends steadily with him, hovering protectively
Hiccup grins, pleased at having impressed Valka
until he realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with a fast approaching mountain top
(') Oh no
Toothless
But, with his tail locked, Toothless can't make the tight jackknife turn skyward to rescue Hiccup
Realizing that they're in trouble, Valka and Cloudjumper pour on the speed
All four of them collide just as they reach the mountain top, sending them crash-landing in an explosion of snow
They all  head over tail to a messy landing on the wind- swept ridge and pop up

Toothless raises his snow-packed face, glowering

Toothless shudders, as if experiencing a much-needed chiropractic adjustment
He bounds over to Hiccup, giddily retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a new toy

Stormfly drops Eret to the snow, but before he can flee, she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg
Agghh
Okay

Never take a toy from a dragon

Stormfly crushes him in place under her weight

Why does this keep happening to me
Astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal

Drago whirls his bull- hook overhead and  it into the deck planks

The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront
Toothless unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeast's face, not letting up
He's challenging the alpha
To protect you

Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control
