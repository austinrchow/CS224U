Written by Harold Ramis, Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg October 18th, 2007 1 an infinite void but at the center a , a particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains all the potential matter and energy in the universe
blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes, particles expanding in all directions until they fill the screen, a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust
Then the particles start to attract one another to form atoms, the atoms elements, the elements form molecules, the molecules compounds, the compounds cells, then a cell twitches and a   starts booming out a Dolby heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms
Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a much bigger fish, and we rapidly rise from the depths and pull back to reveal-- 2 Vast, blue, rolling toward the shore, brilliant sun rising in a cloudless azure sky
emerges from the sea like Aphrodite, strongly backlit to obscure her nudity, but we can see she is full-breasted, long-limbed, toned and tanned-- perfection
Then a  rises up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily in the surf
Even in silhouette we can see he's far from perfect-- short, overweight
They turn to each other and embrace
It's paradise-- for him
(looking deep in his eyes) 'm so hungry
(wanting her) Yeah
Me, too
The  get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to kiss her, but she turns and walks away
What should we eat
Oh, you actually meant you were hungry
thought-- forget it
Official White                                                     2
He follows her
They walk toward the trees that fringe the beach
When they reach the line of vegetation, the woman, , kneels, pulls berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth
The man, , grabs a handful of berries and they squat there noshing like Adam and Eve
Mmmm, these are so good
Mmrrunm, they really are
When she turns away he spits them out in disgust
Maya smiles and puts her face very close to his, their lips almost touching
(very sexy) You know what 'd really like
() What
Some fruit
(frustrated, but hanging ) Yeah, fruit's good
(he stands up) You want an apple or a pear
() No
He scans the nearby trees
Orange
Tangerine
(she shakes her head) Umm, mango
Kiwi
Peach
She shakes her head coyly
He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully pointing out various options
She follows him
Official White                                                      3
(cont'd) Plum
Nectarine
Passion fruit
() Nuh-uh
(fake smile) Okay, don't tell me-- papaya
Pomegranate
Lemon
Lime
Kumquat
Uh, cock
Cockfruit
-- The game is no longer cute but he still plays along
Watermelon
Honeydew
Grapes
-- (this is a lot of work to get laid) Starfruit, casaba-- tangelo
Nope
(he doesn't even like her ) Okay,  give up
Which fruit do you want
() That one
Zed looks
It's a beautiful tree with lush, apple-like   red fruit hanging from it
() Yeah, right
Okay
Why not
Official white                                                           4
Because that's the fruit we don't eat
It's forbidden
Why not
Because we don't
It's a rule
That's the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil
You don't eat from that one
Nobody ever has
Why not
Stop saying why not
told you-- it's a rule
So do you always follow the rules
No-- yeah--  don't know
We don't have that many rules
In fact, we only have one rule-- ' Okay, fine
We won't
Forget mentioned it
understand if you're afraid-- 'm not "afraid"-- No, really, it's all right
just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks, crawls, swims, flies, or grows in the ground, but not that particular fruit
And  thought you might be the kind of man who's willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself, but  guess  was wrong
She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away
It's not Paradise anymore
Then like every man that ever lived and will ever live, he caves
Official White                                                             5
Okay
Fine
You want to try the Good and Evil fruit, you got it
He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands her one
They both stare at the fruit
You first
No way
It was your idea
You go first
We both bite at the same time
Zed considers for a long moment then decides
Okay
Ready
One-- two-- three
Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him out and stops before her teeth break the skin
(cont'd) (with his mouth full) Got me
That's a good move
'm going to steal it
He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste of Good and Evil
Then his face contorts in disgust and he spits it out
(cont'd) (gagging and spitting) Yuchh
That's horrible
Yecch, ptui
Ughh
He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his fingers, trying to get the terrible taste out
So you're saying it's not good
Yes
'm saying it's not good
He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp
Then a loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up
(cont'd) Oh, no-- 6
Official White He runs for the bushes
Maya's attention gets diverted
(noticing something) Ooh, banana
: 3
- Dozens of huts surround a mmunal fire pit where  in loincloths roll flatbread and cook it on heated rocks
The drums start pounding out a celebratory rhythm as the  enter carrying a on a pole, their faces marked with boar's blood, ritual signs in honor of the kill
The lead hunter , is a hulking thug with a bony, Neanderthal forehead
He cuts off the boar's head and drops it at Maya's feet
(blunt grunt) For you
(forces a grateful smile) Thank you, Marlak
4                                                               ' Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut, his guts still aching
His best friend  sits next to him sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy, jealous of the attention they're getting from the women
If Zed is over-confident and reckless, Oh is his polar opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the kind of guy who would apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear
He may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been invented he'd be wearing them
() Look at them
Hunters think they're so cool
They don't think gathering is dangerous
There are thorns-- bees-- those big stingy ants
could hunt--  just don't want to
And what's with the blood on their faces
They think that's sanitary
Official White                                                             7
(miserable with pain) Do me a favor
Just kill me
Why did you eat that fruit
It's forbidden
Everybody knows that
couldn't help myself
Maya was just staring at me with those pouty eyes-- and those perky breasts-- opposable thumbs
And how about the name
"The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil"
You don't think that sounds tempting
They should've just called it "The Tree with the Fruit that Tastes Like Shit
" Then for sure nobody would eat it
Zed notices a  squatting in the bushes right behind his dwelling
(cont'd) (shouts testily) Hey
Squanto
Give me a break, would ya'
You got the whole forest
(to Oh) Why does everyone have to crap right behind my hut
think, and  could be wrong, that all the poop makes the ground more fertile, which in turn, gives the leaves in the area a softer feel
It's a vicious circle
Oh notices a very pretty young woman, , standing near the communal fire with
His heart leaps
(cont'd) (calls out eagerly) Hi, Eema
Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave, then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh that makes them laugh
Official White                                                            8
(cont'd) She doesn't even know  exist
(-) want to lay with her so badly
don't see it
mean she's cute, but  don't think 'd lay with her
Of course not
She's your sister
It'd be like sleeping with your mother
which was a big mistake
see that now
You think it won't be awkward the next morning but-- trust me, you just want to rip your eyeballs out
(shakes off the memory) Listen, if you want to impress Eema, tonight at the feast, do the fertility dance with her, then drag her back to your hut
My hut's a mess
And what if she struggles
So you give her a little tap on the head
Women respond to that-- () No
She only likes hunters-- not gatherers
They look over at Eema, who is now slowly stroking the shaft of a hunter's spear
wouldn't read too much into that
She kisses, then tongues the spear tip
(cont'd) Okay, that might mean something
The hunter Marlak walks by and stops
He's clearly half a rung lower on the human evolutionary scale
Official White                                                             9
You didn't hunt today
Yes, Marlak
Very observant was indisposed
Got that intestinal thing that's been going around
Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the walls of Zed's hut
(points at a drawing) What's that supposed to be
It's a bear
That's not a bear
That's just some lines on a skin
() It's not a real bear
It's a "representation" of a bear
You know, a "picture
" That's stupid
Yeah
Like you'd know
And what's that
He picks up a skin with another of Zed's drawings on it, this one of a big-breasted naked girl
Zed quickly grabs it and holds it upside down
That-- would be an antelope-- or a deer-- a deerpalope
(trying to look at it upside down) It looks like Maya
Official White                                                                  10
(hides it away) How could it be Maya
It's just some lines on a skin
Stay away from my woman
Your woman
'm not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual "thing" going
Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head
(walking off) Stay away
(calls after him) Hey
Nice supra-orbital ridge, fartface
: 5 The  kick up another notch as the huge boar roasts on a spit over a roaring fire
- The tribe is gathered around the big fire pit
The tribe's , their medicine man and spirit leader, dances around the fire in a boar's head mask, accessorized with way too many bones, beads and feathers
Zed and Oh are sitting near the fire, smoking something in a long, decorated pipe
Hey, Oh
Did it ever occur to you that there may be more to life than this
(taking the pipe from Zed) Okay,  think somebody's had enough
Official White                                                                               11
No,                                                            'm serious
We're born into thisworld, we hunt, we gather, we eat,we sleep, we make babies-- You make babies-- --but why
What's the point
You always get like this when you smoke
Oh takes a big toke on the pipe, chokes, and starts coughing uncontrollably
No
Last night  couldn't sleep, so  just laid there looking up at the sky, counting the stars
There were over seventy
Kinda makes you think, doesn't it
(looks up at the sky) No
Really
've been thinking about it ever since  ate that fruit
Don't you ever wonder what's on the other side of the mountains
There's nothing on the other side of the mountains
Everybody knows that
The world just ends
You'd fall right off the edge
(makes a sharp gesture) But what if it doesn't
What if it just goes on and on forever
Or what if it's round
(he picks up a round )) And if you keep walking you eventually come right back to where you started
He traces the circumference with his finger
Official White                                                            12
() Oh, yeah, that's plausible
Zed flings the rock away
(
) Oww
(waves apologetically) Sorry
(tries to cheer him up Will you stop with that crazy talk
We're at a feast
You love feasts
There's women, there's boar meat, there's an assortment of berries-- there's women-- Oh looks over at Eema
Zed picks up on it
Do it, man
Go dance for her
You think
They're playing the Jackal Dance
don't do that one so well
Are you kidding
Go
Jackal Dance
Oh summons his courage, gets up and crosses to where the girls are sitting
Zed makes subtle eye contact with Maya, waggles his eyebrows and licks his lips
She laughs and looks away
Oh starts dancing timidly right in front of Eema, subtly jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool
Eema just stares at him for a moment, then goes back to talking to her friends
Oh looks over at Zed for help
Zed mimes clonking her on the head
Oh picks up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin
However, instead of submitting, she gets really pissed, stands up and decks him with one punch
Official White                                                                             13
Eema glowers at Zed who feigns innocence
: 6                                                              - hunter is slicing off hunks of boar meat for the other tribesmen
Zed pushes through the small crowd waiting for food and goes to the front
Excuse me, hunter coming through
Hey
Wait your turn
There's a line here, buddy
For your information  was in line and  just stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady
Suddenly a  is thrust inches from his face, stopping him
It's Marlak, who towers over Zed
His cohort, , short and stout, stands beside him
Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the garden with Maya
Oh, really
And what if  called Enmebaragesi a liar
'd kill you
Calm down
said "what                                     if"-- it was a hypothetical
Marlak gets right in Zed's face
Enmebaragesi doesn't lie
Villagers gather around them, Maya and Eema among them
Marlak puts his spear point to Zed's throat
(cont'd) The truth
Official White                                                       14
Zed, just admit it
You're just making it harder on yourself
(instantly annoyed) No, you just made it harder on myself
(to Marlak) Okay, fine, you got me
(gingerly moves the spear ) Maya and  lay together on occasion
We're consenting adults and we have an adventurous sexual relationship
Maya looks shocked, and tries to signal Zed to shut up
() You laid with my woman
Isn't that what we're talking about
Maya rolls her eyes
No,  saw you eat the Forbidden Fruit
Oh, that
Yeah
did eat the fruit
was just kidding about humping Maya
Marlak knocks Zed to the ground
The  stops
Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed
() Hey
What's going on
Marlak growls at him
(cont'd) (quickly looks up at the ) Oooh, shooting star
Official White                                                                                15
Zed gets to his feet
Look, Marlak, this is crazy
You're two of me
'm not gonna fight you over a girl, okay
Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose
Zed                                                            (cont'd) (to Enmebaragesi) And let that be a lesson to your big friend- Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid- section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends him sprawling to the ground
(standing over Zed) Your father was a great hunter, but you're like-- a girl
The hunters laugh
Good one, Marlak
Zing
Now  kill you
He's about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and jumps between them
The villagers step back as the Shaman howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed
(leaning close to Zed) We need to talk
: 7                                                                -     7 Zed and the Shaman sit side by side on a log, talking privately
Official White                                                         16
The Shaman is covered in skins, feathers, bones, beads, animal teeth, antlers and horns, his hair a mass of long, muddy dreadlocks, his face painted, his cheeks, nose, and ears pierced by shards of bone
But if not for his outlandish getup, zed could be talking to his pastor
You really ate the fruit
One bite
What's the big deal
(halfheartedly shakes a chicken-foot rattle at ) You don't eat the fruit
That's been the number one rule from the beginning of time
Since the Great Turtle climbed from the sea with the Earth on his back, drank the ocean, pooped out the mountains and the first man fell from the stars
've always had trouble with the Great Turtle Theory-- too many unexplained gaps
Whatever
You're screwed now
Really
How screwed
Like  knew it was a rule but 'm a little fuzzy on the exact details
You're cursed, man, and if you stay here then we'll all be cursed
You have to leave
Where am  supposed to go
Up to you
From now on you're completely on your own
() Oh, really
() Official White              17
(cont'd) Am  detecting a little jealousy here because  now have the knowledge of good and evil and you don't
Well, you know what
say what  did was a good thing-- a very very good thing-- and 'm not leaving
What do you think of that
comes flying in from off-camera and lands at his feet
(cont'd) Okay, is that supposed to be funny
He stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing around them in a wide circle
Marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal-hide shield, starting a rhythmical beat
The other hunters join in, keeping the beat, staring at Zed with lethal intent (to Zed, re the hunters) You should probably get going now
You better take this knife
He hands him a flint knife with a leather-wrapped handle
(cont'd) And some of the guys got together and they want you to have this bow
He hands him a strong hunter's bow
don't want to seem ungrateful or anything, but you wouldn't happen to have any arrows, would you
An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head
(to Zed) You'd better get moving
Zed looks around at his fellow villagers, trying to summon what dignity he has left
() Okay, but before  go  just want to say something
know 'm not the greatest hunter-- Official White                                                             18
(
) --Or gatherer-- Yes, or gatherer-- but there's got to be more to life than this-- (to Hunters) Kinda hard to concentrate with that rhythmic drumming, fellas
The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed
(cont'd) (rolls his eyes; "these guys are hopeless") Anyways, 'm going away, not because you're forcing me to-- which you are-- but because choose to
Yes,  ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil-- major misunderstanding on my part-- and believe me 'm not recommending it unless you're interested in a very powerful laxative-- but it got me thinking about some pretty heavy stuff -- life questions, you know
So 'm out of here, and anyone who wants to join me is welcome
He looks around the circle and sees Maya
She sees Marlak staring at her and averts her eyes
(cont'd) -- Zed looks at oh, who suddenly becomes very interested in an imaginary piece of loincloth lint
(cont'd) (looks directly at Oh) don't know where we're going or when we're going to get there, but will lead the way-- (he picks up a burning ) lighting up the darkness-- pointing us in the right direction, and keeping us entertained with humorous anecdotes from my childhood
Now who's with me
He enthusiastically thrusts the torch in the air
Official White                                                               19
Oh looks at Eema, then at Zed, and lowers his eyes
(cont'd) Okay, then  guess 'll just have to go it alone, which is fine with -- (to Oh) --better, in fact, because having a partner would just slow me down
Oh can't look at him
Zed shakes his head, failing to notice that the torch he's holding has ignited the roof of the hut next to him
The Shaman shouts and points at the now blazing roof
(cont'd) Oops
They all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to roof
(cont'd) know there's a lesson in here somewhere
Any thoughts
The villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts
It's chaos
(raises his spear, to Zed) Now you die
Marlak throws his spear and misses as Zed takes off running into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the whole village ablaze
: 8
-    8 Zed runs for his life through the dense forest
The hunters chase him, shooting arrows at him on a dead run
Zed dodges as the arrows zip around him
He veers left, then right, then trips and tumbles down a muddy embankment
The hunters stop at the top of the embankment
Marlak listens for sounds of movement in the forest below, then silently signals for the hunters to fan out
Official White                                                            20
Marlak nimbly makes his way down the embankment, reaches the bottom and sees something in the moonlight
It's Zed lying on the ground, badly camouflaged with sticks and leaves, thinking he can't be seen, but the shape of his body is clearly discernible
Marlak raises his spear
see you
(long beat) No, you don't
Yes,  do
How can you see me if 'm not here
You're trying to trick me
Okay, then tell me this-- who's standing right behind you
(nobody's fool) You think 'm going to turn around and look, but 'm not
(pulls his knife) 'm going to gut you like a pig
He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is struck from behind by a heavy tree branch
He falls heavily, knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the makeshift club
Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh
guess 'm with you
Was it my speech
No, the fire
lost everything
Official White                                                                                       21
But the speech was pretty good, right
mean, even  was moved and  was the one speaking
Can we talk about this later
Oh pulls Zed to his feet, and they sneak off into the deep woods
: 9
-      9 Zed and Oh walk through the moonlit forest
This is nice, out here, the two of us
() Yeah, it's great
Come on, those hunters are idiots
In an hour they'll forget the whole thing
don't think they'll forget the fire
You know what we should do
You and me should kill the biggest boar ever-- just huge
-- and take it back to the village
Just to show them
And we won't let anyone else eat it
They'll have to watch us eat it
If it's that huge how would we carry it back
() Fine, we'll just start with something small
squirrel or something
Official White                                                            22
Yeah, we'll make everyone watch us eat a squirrel
Will you get real
There's no going back
There's, nothing to go back to
It's just ashes
() Yeah, like it's so hard to build a new hut
It's just a pile of sticks and dung-- () You're a pile of sticks and dung
Suddenly, Zed stops and stands perfectly still
(through clenched teeth) Oh
What are you doing
Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head
Oh looks up
crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap
Oh freezes
They talk like ventriloquists
Don't move a muscle
Will that work
(without moving his lips) don't know
There's two different opinions on this one
Some say run, some say don't
What are you going to do
'm going to--
He sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh
: Official White                                                                23
10
-    10 Zed is holding a stick over the fire, cooking what looks like a squirrel or a muskrat
Oh comes out of the forest carrying a huge armload of sticks and branches
One of Oh's sticks falls, and as he carefully reaches down to grab it, the rest spill out on the ground
Oh sighs
His body is covered with long claw marks
You really should put some maggots on those scratches
They look pretty deep
() just want to know why you told me not to move, and you ran
Because  honestly thought he'd go for me
thought  was doing you a favor
Apparently not appreciated
Yeah, big favor
You didn't have to come with me, you know
didn't ask you to come
Yes, you did
You looked right at me-- twice
Yes, that's a technique of public speaking, but  didn't ask you specifically
You chose to come
You gotta take some responsibility for that
And there's no point coming if you're just gonna keep whining about every little-- cougar that attacks you
(pulls the cooked rodent from the fire) You want some or not
Official White                                                                          24
() No, eat your weasel
You deserve it
He turns his back to Zed, and starts sorting through the pile of sticks
You making your own fire
No, arrows
We're going to need them
(perks up) You're still coming
() Yes
Zed claps him on the back and hugs him exuberantly
Oh winces in pain

-    11 Zed and Oh are hiking uphill, the lush, dense verdure of the forest now thinning to evergreens and mountain heather

Finally, they reach the top and look out at the vista
From their vantage point they can see a high plateau and wooded land stretching far beyond it
() knew it
Still think you're just gonna fall off the edge of the world
Official White                                                                25
(in amazement) Incredible
He takes a step forward, the rock shelf gives way beneath his feet and he falls a great distance, screaming all the way down, bouncing painfully off the big boulders, then a long, tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom
() Oooh
- (then calls out) 'll go around
Wait for me
: 13
-    13 Zed is following a trail downhill through the forest on the other side of the mountains
Oh is limping along behind him, bitten, clawed, cut, scraped and bruised
Say what you want, but that was no accident
You don't see a pattern here
see a pattern
Every time something terrible can happen to me, it does
Yeah, but why
Why'd the cougar go for you and not me
Why did you fall and  didn't
Hard to believe it's all just random
Think about -- ;                                                              avdganly    ,          )   ia htintI

(cont'd) (sniffing the air) People-- more than one-- walking-- (he guesses) that way
(looking around) You think
There's about a thousand footprints here
Official White                                                                                                     26
He indicates the heavily trampled forest floor
(ignores him) Yes
There
He drops to one knee and examines something in the bushes
Zed                                                             (cont'd) They stopped here to poop
Look
No, thank you
Four men, maybe five
And a child-- or a small women maybe
(a little disgusted) Okay
(poking at the evidence) Looks like they had some nuts-- dried fruit-- some kind of green leafy vegetable-- Okay
Enough
Can we just go
Maybe we can find where they peed

Oh creeps up beside him and they peer through the bushes
are grazing in a green pasture
Beyond it, well- tended fields of growing grain
Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals Oh to be quiet and stay put
() This one's mine
He takes his bow, pulls an arrow from his quiver, and slowly draws the bow, taking deadly aim at one of the cows
He shoots
The blunt, pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and bounces off
The cow looks up
Official White              27
(cont'd) (to Oh) We're gonna need some arrowheads
Zed draws his flint knife, then suddenly bursts out of the forest, dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back
Oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends Zed flying
Lying on the ground, Zed looks up and sees dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring at him
Did you just shoot my cow
(getting painfully to his ) Yeah, well-- we're hunters
(covering for himself) He's a hunter
'm more of a "maker
"  made this loincloth, do arrows--  made a shelf unit for my hut-- What do you guys do
What does it look like
We're farmers
He's a farmer; 'm a herdsman
You're a suck, is what you are
(ignores him) My brother, Cain
am called Abel
You are called suck
My brother is angry because God looked on my sacrifice with favor
Official White                                  28
(mimics him) "God looked on my sacrifice with --" (to Oh) Okay, is he a total suck or what
Well, it's hard to say-- we just -- Why are you dragging them into this
What do they know
They're morons
() Hey
Easy
(to Abel) You think you're so superior to everyone else
Superior-er than you
Really
Let's see how good you are at getting your ass kicked
(shoves him) Yeah
Bring it
(shoves him back) Okay, boys, that's enough
We just want to-- (won't let it go) No
This smug asshole insulted you and  want him to take it back
We're not really that insulted-- (pushes Abel hard) Take it back
Official White                                                           29
(pushes back) Make me
Zed steps between them, trying to make peace
Boys, boys
You're brothers
Let's just relax and-- Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight is on
They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and wrestle each other to the ground
Shouldn't we do something
Just let them settle it
Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head with all his might
Abel falls heavily to the ground and lies there, not moving
Cain stands over him, breathing hard
(cont'd) () guess that settles it
(turns on him sharply, still holding the bloody ) What
Nothing
Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground
He's all right
Probably just -- (humoring him) Probably just tuckered out from the fight
(looking around nervously) Yeah
() Official White              30
(cont'd) Maybe  should throw some dirt on him-- keep him warm 'til he wakes up
He starts kicking dirt over Abel's body
(cont'd) (getting worried) This is bad
This is really bad
We're in serious trouble
Hey
What do you mean "we" don't want to play the blame game, but you're the one who hit him
(turns on them) You could've stopped me
There's two of you and only one of me
We didn't know you were going to kill him-- You calling me a murderer
(he clutches the rock) Did  say that
It was an accident
(to Oh) Right
Right
You were holding the rock and he-- accidentally ran into it-- really hard-- with his head
(calming down) Okay-- yeah-- good
But it might be better if we don't mention the "accident" to anyone
People might get the wrong idea
Understand
Oh, yeah, people could so easily misinterpret that
Official White                                                                      31
() Why even bring it up
() like you guys
You're all right
Why don't you come with me
Have supper with the family
Unfortunately we already have dinner plans
think you should come with me
(his idea) why don't we go with you
: 15
-      15 Cain finishes loading bushels of grain onto an oxcart while Zed and Oh closely inspect the big, heavy, solid wooden wheels on the cart
What are the big round things for
They're wheels, numbskull
They make the cart roll
(blown away) Wow
That is like the greatest invention since the vagina
Cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward
Oh screams as the

Woooo
Yeah

, dour, hard-working and long-suffering, but still strong and upright, trudges home with a metal scythe over his shoulder
He could be Max Von Sydow
(hailing Cain) Cain, my son
Hail, Father
Cain stops the cart and dismounts with Zed and Oh
(cont'd) Can these guys stay for supper
(off Adam's questioning ) bring strangers who would sojourn with us this night
Cain turns to Zed and Oh and furtively mimes an elaborate lip- sewing gesture, ancient precursor to the modern lip-zipper
Greetings, strangers
am called Adam and you are welcome to share the fruits of our toil
Thanks, but 'm kind of staying away from fruit for the time being
Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them into his crude dwelling

Official White 17 17
'  - The rude dwelling has a stark, somber, almost Amish feeling to it
Zed and Oh sit at the table sharing a simple meal       youngest with Adam, Cain and his Adam's wife  and h them, Lilith's tunic gaping open to reveal her breasts every time she leans over to put something on the table
Zed and Oh can't take their eyes off her
(to Cain) Where is thy brother, Abel
(badly overplaying) Abel
Haven't seen him
thought he was with you
(to Zed and Oh) You guys see him
They shake their heads and cough nervously
(equally unconvincing) Nape
Not that  remember
Never seen anybody-- anywhere-- anytime -- ever
(to Cain) Your sister Lilith said she saw him in the field with you
think that was yesterday
No, this day
She said you both made offerings
That might've been Boaz--- No, you and Abel
She said it looked like you were arguing
Hey, we're brothers, we argue sometimes- it's not that big a deal
Official White                                                           34
And his flock was untended in the -- () Okay
What am -- his keeper
Get off my back, will you
He smashes his plate against the wall and storms out
An awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks
fear the worst for Abel
am sorely vexed
Yeah, that's got to be pretty vexing
Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly on his sorry circumstances
For my sin the ground is cursed
Thorns and thistles does it sprout for us, and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives
For as the Lord has commanded, by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken
For dust you are, and to dust shall you return
Wow
That's kind of a downer isn't it
It's the way of the world
Boy,  hope not
(rises abruptly) You are welcome to stay the night and lay with my daughter Lilith
Zed looks at the luscious Lilith, then back at Adam
Official White                                                                                   35
'm waiting for the punchline
She is without a husband, and as the Lord has said, thou shalt be fruitful and multiply
Lilith nods demurely and exits through a curtain
Zed starts to follow her out
Hey
What about me
You may share the bed of my son Seth
Yeah, there you go
(he exits) Oh looks at Seth
multiplied with a sheep
(Oh just stares at him) My thingie smells like lamb chops

'  -    18 Zed enters the room
Lilith reclines on a cot with a straw mattress
(making room on the cot) My bed is small but you're welcome to share it
It's the way of my people
(lying down beside her) And that's a good way to be
In fact, 'm kind of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway
would've thought guys would be lined up at the door
don't like men
Official White                                                                                 36
(moving closer) Maybe you just haven't met the right one
like girls
() So we have that in common-- (stares at him for a beat) 'm attracted to women
(a beat) don't even know what that means
What does that mean
like to have sex with other women
(stares at her for a long ) 'm really not getting this
Lilith shakes her head, turns away from him, and pulls up her blanket
Zed shrugs and rolls over to sleep
They lie there quietly in the dark for a long beat
Then-- Zed                                                             (cont'd) You're kidding
Whoa
That's amazing

'  -     19 Oh is lying next to Seth, wide-awake, trying to stay as far away from him as possible
Oooh, listen to this one
Seth lifts his knees to his chest and farts a surprisingly long cadenza
That's really good

Do  have to

'  -    20 In the yard behind the house, Oh is helping Cain as he chops firewood with a metal axe
Oh now wears a tunic like the farmers
It's been the same damn thing my whole life
(swings the axe-- thwack
) "Why can't you be more like Abel
" (thwack
) "Oh, your sacrifice was good, too, but Abel's was-- wow
" (thwack
) (trying to change the ) Your brother Seth is an interesting guy
Did you know he can put his penis in his mouth
Adam and Zed come out of his dwelling
from other dwellings start gathering
Cain
Yeah, hey-- where's everybody going
To look for Abel
() Good luck
What did you say
Official White                                                            38
(louder, mock sincerity) said good luck
'm really worried about him
He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's benefit
You're not coming
Yeah,  am
just have to finish toiling over here, then 'm right behind you
Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone, Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart
(cont'd) (to Zed and Oh) Now listen, 'm getting out of here, and you better come with me
have a feeling they're going to try and blame this whole "Abel- killing-thing" on you
Why would they blame us
Because when they find him and his head is all bashed in, they're going to start pointing fingers, and you guys are drifters, so they'll put two and two together and that makes-- He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh
(cont'd) Four
It makes four
Now stop asking so many questions and hop on
We gotta get out of here
He urgently whips the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart lumbers forward

The farmers shout and race back to the hamlet

- 22 Adam and the other farmers jump onto two more oxcarts and set out after Cain, Zed and Oh
: 23
-              23 Cain's cart lumbers along
He looks back over his shoulder
(urgently, to Zed and Oh) They're gaining on us
Zed and Oh look back
The other oxcarts are a hundred yards back, "chasing" them at maybe two miles per hour
Cain whips his oxen and they step up the pace to 3
() Hah
They'll never catch us now
An aerial view shows Cain's cart slowly pulling away from his pursuers
Suddenly a bolt of lightning splits the bright blue sky and strikes Cain right on the forehead, knocking him back into the cart
He sits up stunned, with a still-smoking, jagged burn mark on his forehead
Official White                                                                                   40
(cont'd) (dazed but exhilarated) Wow
What are the odds of that
(feeling the burn mark) Am  lucky or what
Zed and Oh exchange doubtful looks and glance nervously at the sky
: 24
-           24 The ox cart approaches a small trading settlement on the seacoast, a kind of makeshift tent city around a central marketplace
Several dhows are tied up at the shore, camels and pack animals are tethered on the fringes, while and  inspect newly arrived goods and haggle over prices
25
-  -    25 Zed, Oh and Cain wander through the crowded market dressed in all manner of exotic garb buy, sell, and barter goods from distant lands
Zed and oh gawk like a couple of yokels
Look at all these people
And this stuff
Oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the bread
(to the Merchant) Can  have one of those
He reaches for a loaf but the  strikes his hand with a cane
(cont'd) Ow
Two silver pieces
() We're gonna need some money
Official White                                                             41
Yeah, we're gonna need money
(an afterthought) What's money
They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around a raised platform
are lined up on the raised wooden platform while  examine those waiting to be auctioned
The  brings up a fnuscular male slave in a loincloth
(cont'd) It's Marlak
Marlak's hands are bound and he's restrained by a chain attached to a thick leather collar around his neck
(addresses the crowd) Next up, an unusual item-- looks like a Caucasian-- he's big, he's strong, he's a good breeder, so 'm going to start at                                               100        gold minas
Do  hear                                                       100
As the bidding starts, Zed spots Maya, his sister Eema, and Enmebaragesi among the chained-up slaves waiting to be sold
Zed and Oh push their way through the crowd and go to them
(amazed to see them) Eema
Maya
The women embrace him with relief and excitement
() Hi, Eema
Oh
What happened
How did you get here
Official white                                                             42
Well, after the fire-- (she shoots him an accusing look)) --the hill tribes raided the village
The men fought them but they were too many
They took us captive, marched us to the sea, then traded us to the boat people who brought us here
(to Eema) Are you all right
Did they-- rape you
() Just a little
Zed and Oh look at her curiously
The   sees them talking to Eema and approaches
You interested in some slaves
(like a prospective buyer) Yeah, this one looks pretty good-- He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's buying fruit
Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's breasts
She punches him
Zed                                                             (cont'd) Ooh, feisty
So how does this work if we want them
The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes
You have money
() Well, that depends on what you mean by money
Look, pal, money talks and bullshit walks
don't have time for looky- loos
Official white                                                                     43
Cain steps up and intercedes
() Perhaps  can help
(confidentially to Zed and ) Let me talk to the guy
Maybe can make a deal with him
You guys wait here
Cain puts his arm around the slave trader's shoulder and walks him away
(cont'd) (to the slave trader) So what are we lookin' at here
From a distance, Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can't hear what they're saying
(to Eema) What an amazing coincidence-- running into you and Maya and them
You still think it's all just a coincidence
All of us here right now, at this particular place, at this particular time
() don't know
Why do you think
'm not sure yet, but 'm starting to believe that everything happens for a reason
Like, why did  eat the forbidden fruit
To get laid
Hey
Official White                                   44
Okay, that might have been what was thinking at the time, but what if some omnipotent force put the fruit there because  was supposed to eat it
which omnipotent force
What do you mean "which" omnipotent force
How many omnipotent forces could there be
don't know
What's "omnipotent" mean
Work with me-- 'm just speculating here
Let's call this force "God"; and let's say this "God" is controlling everything
Maybe God wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil
Why would he want that
How do you know God's a "He
" Zed rolls his eyes
Don't you get what 'm saying
What if we've been chosen
You think we've been chosen by God
Well, no offense, but it's possible that  was chosen and you all just happened to be there
Why would God choose you
Why wouldn't he choose Marlak
He's stronger
Official White                                                          45
chosen doesn't need to be strong
'm big this way
(points to his temples) You do have a fat face
Not my face, my brain
It's enormous
'm the smartest guy in the village
() You're not even-- 'm smarter than you
What
(to  ) Which one of us is smarter
You're both idiots
Oh yeah, then why are we free and you're chained up
Because of you
(calls them over) Hey
Come here
think we worked something out
(confidently, to Maya) Sit tight
'm going to get you out of here
Do you trust me
() want to trust you
Fair enough
She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to Cain and the slave trader
Official White                                                                                      46
(cont'd) (to Cain) Good work
What's the deal
The slave owner smiles
: 26
-      26 Zed and Oh are dragged onto the platform in shackles and leg irons
They see Cain riding off on a donkey
He holds up a bag of coins and waves goodbye
never trusted that guy
(                                                     ) Why
Just 'cause he murdered his brother and got hit by lightning
They are pushed to the front of the platform
(to the crowd) All right
Next up is a twofer-- 'm selling them as a pair--  know they don't look like much-- but 'm starting the bidding at sixty gold minas
Do  hear sixty
() Remember, it's two for one here
Do  hear fifty
Anyone
That's only twenty-five apiece, folks
() Zed looks out at the crowd, starting to get offended
(cont'd) You're breaking my heart here
How about forty
Do  hear forty
() (to Oh) It's not like  want to be a slave or anything, but this is embarrassing
Official white                                                                                 47
Thirty-five
Thirty
() Come on, people
We're a steal at thirty
They probably don't know how smart you think you are
Finally, a Bedouin  raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk and waves it at the slave trader
Yes
Sold to Sheikh Hassan for                                  30 gold minas

Bringing up the rear is   - , basically a cage on wheels into which have been crammed, jammed together like sardines
Zed and Oh are in the middle of the body pile, literally cheek by jowl with the other slaves, barely able to move Eema is right next to Oh, her body pressed tight against his
Oh shifts around, repositioning his arms and body trying to get more comfortable and give Eema a little space, but he just ends up touching her even more
() Excuse me-- 'm sorry-- (his hand gets stuck between her breasts) That's not good-- He jerks his hand away, elbowing Marlak in the face
Official White                                                             48
Marlak growls and grabs Oh by the throat, but the struggle forces everyone else to shift which causes even more discomfort
Ow
Hey
Cut that out
Zed tries to turn his head to see who's behind him
(') () Hey, pal
You can take your foot out of my ass anytime now
() And your foot is still there
If turn around, you will be sorry
Zed twists violently and manages a full turn which brings him face to face and crotch to crotch with Maya
(cont'd) That's better
For you maybe
Look,  want you to know  blame myself for everything that happened
So does everybody else
(over his shoulder) Get away from my woman
() don't think that's going to be possible
And  told you before, she's not "your woman
" 'll kill you
Marlak starts muscling and squirming his way through the body pile trying to get to Zed
Hey
Watch it, jerk
Official White                                                                                                    49
It's too cramped to even throw a punch, so Marlak uses a '  as a weapon to bang against zed's head repeatedly
() Why
Suddenly Zed feels Marlak's hands around his neck, grabbing him from behind
Zed struggles but Marlak manages to pull him into a full headlock, forcing Zed's face into his hairy armpit
() Ecchhh
Oh is vaguely aware of the fight going on but can't move
(calling to Zed) Hold on
'm coming
Oh tries to maneuver to Zed, but can't move an inch
(')                                            (cont'd) If everyone could just move to the right
Please
Thank you in advance for your cooperation
(then, giving up hope) You can do it, Zed
Use his weight against him
Marlak now has Zed locked in a lethal choke hold

- notices the commotion and bangs the bars of the cage with his staff
(shouts at the slaves) Knock it off
Don't make me come in there
() 'd like to see you try
The Bedouin is just about to respond when suddenly He drops to the sand, dead
Official White                                                                    50
comes flying over the crest of the wadi followed by wearing bronze helmets and breastplates
The soldiers attack the caravan, slashing and slicing the Bedouin guards
Their commander, , his helmet topped with a magnificent plume, rides up in the chariot and with one mighty stroke of his sword cuts the head off
Marlak reaches through the bars, grabs the fallen Bedouin's sword and hacks off the lock on the door of the slave wagon
The door flies open and the slaves tumble, jump and stumble out onto the ground
Zed and Oh look around, gawking at the massacre taking place
Then Zed sees Marlak, sword in hand, looking for him
(shouts an order) Take the slaves
Marlak starts for Zed but two soldiers ride up and throw a heavy restraining net over him
Zed grabs oh and takes off running over the nearest sand dune
Sargon watches them flee
Sir, shall  pursue them
No
Let the desert have them
They won't get far
: 29
-    29 The soldiers are camped for the night
The slaves are back in their cage
Sargon the commander stops to instruct the Official White                                                                 51
Tend to the slaves
We leave for Sodom before daybreak
Yes, sir
30 30 They lie hidden behind a sandy ridge watching from a short distance
() wonder who they are
Their hats are really great, aren't they
Their hats
'm sorry, but when that one guy cut the other guy's head off, my first thought wasn't, "Gee, what a great hat
" It wasn't my very first thought, but 'd be lying if  said it wasn't up there
() Now we just need to figure out a way to rescue Maya and Eema
How are we going to rescue anybody
They're killers
() Patience, my friend
Even killers have to sleep sometime
He keeps a sharp, wakeful eye on the enemy camp
: 31                                                                31 Zed and Oh fast asleep on the ridge
They slowly wake up
Official White                                                              52
() Well, that was refreshing
How'd you sleep
() Not that well
think  was over- tired
Then Zed suddenly remembers Maya
He looks and sees that the soldiers and slaves are long gone
Shit
He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction
Now where do we go
Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes the sand
have no idea
: 32                                                                  32 trudging across the desert in the blistering heat, growing weaker, stumbling and falling
(too weak to move) Why do  listen to you
Now we're going to starve to death or die of thirst
Will you stop being so negative got your back, man
Who saved you from those lions when you were a baby
They were going to pounce, had you surrounded
Took the mama lion--
-- kneed her right in the face
Papa lion comes flying at me--
-- dropped an elbow, knocked his ass out
() Official White                           53
(cont'd) Took his legs--
-- tossed him in the river
And the rest just ran off
You know, 've asked people about that and no one else seems to remember it
Yeah, because nobody else was there
You're lucky  was walking by
() Okay, it's possible  dreamed that-- but who practically raised you after your father was dragged off by those raccoons
Not a dignified death
(practically delirious) He was a small man
Oh collapses face down in the sand
Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry jackals, vultures and hyenas
We've got to keep moving
(hauls Oh to his feet) 've got you, buddy-- just like always
He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on
33
-    33 in his sixties, tall, full beard, piercing eyes and fierce nose, dressed in a robe and kafiyya, arranges firewood on a large flat rock
His   looks around curiously
They are  and
Hey, Dad
We making a burnt offering
Yes, Isaac
As God has commanded me
Official White                                                             54
() don't see the sheep
The Lord will provide the sheep
Abraham takes a cord and starts tying Isaac's hands together
() Uh-- is this like a magic trick
Without another word Abraham takes strong hold of Isaac and lifts him up onto the firewood
(cont'd) (really scared now) Okay, if this is because  didn't clean up my tent, you can stop now
get it
Then Abraham pulls a long slaughtering knife from beneath his robe
(cont'd) () All right, this isn't funny anymore
Abraham raises the knife
(cont'd) 'm telling mom
The knife flashes in the sun as it descends toward the boy
(
) Abraham and Isaac both turn to see Zed and Oh step out from behind the rocks
Their clothes are tattered and they are burnt raw by the sun
(cont'd) What are you doing to that kid
() Nothing
Official White                                                  55
What do you mean, nothing
You were just going to kill him
No,  was going to sacrifice him
There's a difference
(indicating Isaac) Not to him, 'm guessing
Isaac nods gratefully
By what right do you interfere
Art thou an angel of the Lord
(good question) What do you think
(nods sagely) Verily, thou wast sent to stay my hand by the Eternal one, blessed be He
() Whatever you just said
Oh helps Isaac off the altar stone and unties him
(confidentially to Oh) He's nuts
'm telling you-- he's totally lost it
(to Zed) am Abraham, son of Terah of the house of Nahor
am Zed and this is Oh, sons of-- people you wouldn't know
Official White                                                                                56
The tents of my kinsmen lie just beyond
There will you find all that you desire
Come
: 34
34 Abraham leads Isaac, Zed and Oh past the colorful               tents of his people
The camp is alive with activity
35
'  -    35 The spacious tent is lit by torches, and a feast is in progress
in skullcaps and long robes lounge on cushions or sit cross-legged in a circle on the carpeted floor
An    shakes her hips for the pleasure of Abraham who occupies the place of honor
Zed and oh, now also wearing robes and skullcaps, are sitting right beside him eating and drinking everything in sight
Isaac sits beside them
claps his hands for attention
Zed and Oh look up as the music stops
(to the assembly) My brothers, let us give thanks unto God for staying my hand on the mountain this day
(humoring him) Best dad in all the land, everyone
(a ritual response, in ) Praise be to God, hallowed be His name
And for the bounty which He hath bestowed unto us
Official white                                                         57
(in unison) He hath increased our wealth and blessed us with His loving kindness
Zed and Oh mutter along, trying to fit in
(a beat late) --mumble mumble mumble loving kindness
Abraham looks at them
Friends, whence comest thou
Zed and Oh look at each other blankly
() He wants to know where you're from
() Thou comest not from the cities of the plain
From Sodom or Gomorrah
Zed perks up at the mention of Sodom, recalling the destination of the soldiers who took Maya and the others
Sodom and Gomorrah
Never been there
But 've heard of them
Are they nice
The Lord has cursed them for their abomination
(nods gravely) i didn't know that
What kind of abomination are we talking about
They bow down before false Gods and worship graven images
Official White                                                        58
(clicks his tongue) Abominable
The men of the city are weak and soft, fat with rich food, intoxicated by strong drink
(sounds good to him) Really
Tell me more
Their women are whores; their shameless lust knows no bounds
They flaunt their flesh without shame and any man may have knowledge of them
(he's sold) And where exactly are those cities
(off Abraham's stern look) We just want to know so we can avoid them
() Walk not the path of Sodom
For surely will the Lord send his holy fire to destroy the city and all who dwell within, to smite them and all their seed for their iniquity
() When do you think all this smiting is going to go down
We may have some friends there
(getting up) Accompany me
Abraham sweeps out of the tent
Zed and Oh jump to their feet and follow
Isaac tags along
Official white                                                                              59
36
-    36 Abraham walks to the edge of the desert
Torchlight from the camp flickers on his face as he gazes across the desolate moonlit landscape
Abraham, 'm a little worried about the city being destroyed
Their fate is sealed
But for my faith and devotion, the self-same God has given unto me the whole of this land, from the Jordan to the Negev, from the river of Egypt to the great Euphrates
This did He grant to me and my seed
He raises his arms and spreads them wide
() This is all your land
For eternity
() Yeah, God just forgot to tell anyone else
we're having a war with someone like every five minutes
(scowls at him) and my kinsmen have vanquished our enemies by the mighty hand of the Lord, praised be He
Zed and Oh fake their way through a ritual response
His name is praise and love his whole graciousness-- --of his wealthy bounty
Abraham gets a strange faraway look in his eyes
Official White                                                        60
Therefore, to signify my Covenant with the One True God, on this night will  circumcise the flesh of my foreskin, and of you and every male who dwells hereby
Excuse me
'm not clear-- Here we go again-- we will grasp the foreskins of our penises and cut therefrom the extra flesh
() 'm not sure  have any extra
Couldn't we could just get our ears pierced
(aside to Zed) Okay, what did  tell you-- nuts
You know, Abe, it's late, and we've all had a lot to drink, and  know this whole foreskin thing sounds like a good idea now, but you may just want to sleep on it
we could always cut 'em off in the morning, but if we do it now, there's just no putting it back on later
No
So it shall be written, so it shall be done
(to Isaac) Get my big knife
Zed and Oh both reflexively cover their crotches
: Official white                                                                            61
37
-    37 Zed and oh stumble over the rocky hills
They hear a from someone being circumcised back at Abraham's camp
You have any idea where we're going
To the city
have to find Maya
The city
He said God's going to smite them with holy fire
And you're going to listen to him
You think he's more chosen than me
He seemed to know what he was talking about
Yes, and he also wanted to give his dick a little trim
(
) Hey, wait up
Zed and Oh turn to see Isaac running towards them
(out of breath) 'm coming with you
You don't even know where we're going
You're going to Sodom, right
No
Your dad specifically said Sodom and Gomorrah were evil
Yeah, whatever
If  show you how to get there, will you buy me a bottle of wine
Official White                                                                                     62
No
told you, that's not where we're going
Fine
Then we'll just stand here
Fine
They stand there for less than a beat
(cont'd) Okay, you win
Take us to Sodom
Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points off in the distance
Shining in the moonlight, the magnificent city of Sodom set atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls
knew it was right around here
Me and my friends sneak in on the weekends
We hang around, pick up on the babes, drink some wine, get wasted on killer hash-- You shouldn't be smoking either
Thanks, Grandpa, but 've been smoking for four harvests, so think 'm okay
They start down toward the city
: 38
-             38 Zed, Oh and Isaac gape at the high masonry walls as they approach the massive solid wooden gates
Official White                                                             63
Gee, they're not open
We should probably come back later
You just have to knock
They always let me in
(to Oh) Go ahead
Me
Why do  have to knock
What if we're waking somebody up
Let's just get out of here
Where
Back to the penis-cutter
Besides, Eema and Maya might be in there
You want to get them out before the city's destroyed, don't you
Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the door
() Hey
Anybody there
Hello
Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries
Isaac quickly runs away
(shouts at him) Halt
Isaac stops a safe distance away and turns back to taunt the guards
You gonna make me
(dancing and dodging like a boxer) You and what army
(shouts to Isaac) Get help
Tell your father
(shouts back) Yeah
() Official White                           64
(cont'd) Like 'm really gonna tell my father  came with you to Sodom
So long, suckers
He takes off running
(to Oh) kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him
The sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner of the city gates
: 39
-    39 The sentries shove them into a small guard post and throw them up against the wall
look up at the new arrivals
What's this now
They were banging on the gate
Hebrews, from the look of them
We're not really Hebrews-- The guard smacks him in the mouth
(cont'd) Okay
Lesson learned
No talking
Should we wake the Sergeant
You don't want to do that
He gets pretty mean when you wake him
Meaner than this
The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists
Oh  loudly
The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room
Official White                                                             65
(from behind the door, ) ' Zed and Oh exchange worried looks
Then the door flies open and the , a huge, angry, sadistic rhino of a man, fills the door frame
(cont'd) Who the hell screamed
They all point at Oh
(cont'd) (glowers at him) thought it was a woman
He lumbers over and gets his face very close to Oh's
(cont'd) You don't look like a woman, but maybe you want to kiss me anyway
Is that right
You want to kiss me
Oh turns away from his foul breath
The sergeant grabs Oh by the throat and practically lifts him off the ground
(cont'd) By morning you'll be sorry you were born
Don't have to wait 'til morning
Hey
Why don't you pick on someone your own size
The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed
(cont'd) (quickly backpedaling) Which would be difficult since there are probably very few people around who actually are your size-- He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head
Official White                                                                                   66
(to another guard) Get my big stick
'll deal with the fat one first
() Relatively fat one
wouldn't be talking about fat, if  were you
Another blow from the sergeant
(cont'd) Right
Enough said
The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then steps up behind Oh and does the same
guard hands him a lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes
(to Zed and Oh) Welcome to Sodom
As he takes a big backswing, Zed and Oh shut their eyes and prepare for the worst
(
) Stop
Zed and Oh turn to see Cain at the door, dressed like the other guards in breastplate and helmet
Wait
know these guys
Cain
Brothers
He embraces them
They look confused and doubtful, but relieved
: 40
-  -    40 Cain leads them through the narrow crowded streets
People avoid Cain's gaze and part like the Red Sea to allow him through
Official White                                                            67
You know, you guys are lucky that sergeant is a friend of mine let him sodomize me once right after  got here and he's been real nice to me ever since
() Yeah, thanks for saving us
What are you going to do to us now
Cain stops and looks at them
wait a second
Do  detect a tone here
All right, honestly
You did sell us into slavery
(instantly offended) Whoa whoa whoa
Hold a grudge much
That was like a fortnight ago
That was way less than a fortnight
Half a fortnight, maybe
Give me a break
was dealing with the death of a close family member and  needed some space
But now  realize that you guys are like my brothers
And it's so rare to find a brother that you love
Right
He embraces them
() Right
() Now, you guys hungry
Watch this
Cain walks up to a food vendor's stall and stares menacingly at the
He raises his fist
The vendor cowers
Official White                                                             68
(')   (cont'd) (to Vendor) That's two for flinching
Cain grabs two lamb kebabs and hands them to Zed and Oh
(cont'd) That's the kind of love 'm talkin' about
As they eat hungrily, Zed makes eye contact with a prostitute lounging in a doorway
Check out that woman across the street
She's looking at us
The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth
We are so in
She's eye-knowing us like crazy
You're gonna love Sodom
Trust me
It's crazy
This morning,  almost got a handie behind that pita stand
Well,  kind of have a girlfriend-- not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl like, so  shouldn't-- Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays in Sodom
He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a
The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut
(cont'd) You know, if you guys are staying you should join the guards
The pay's not great, but there's tons of perks
'm telling you, it's the only way to go
Cain grabs a piece of candy from a   and stuffs it in his mouth
The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the ass and she runs away
Official White                                                                      69
(to the child) Sorry
Come on, 'll introduce you to the captain
: 41
-     41 military drum roll and the blare of trumpets rouse the garrison
come double-timing out of the barracks and hurry to line up in formation
Last to emerge are Zed and Oh who step leisurely out the door now dressed as Royal Guards
Zed actually looks dashing, but Oh's breastplate is too big and his helmet keeps slipping down over his eyes
This is great
How do  look
You look good, but  think my hat's too big
They notice an  staring at them
(cont'd) (to the officer) Do you happen to know where  could get a smaller hat
The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon
() Line up
Zed and Oh hustle into line, orders are shouted and the troop marches off
: 42
-           42 Zed and Oh are on patrol with Cain in the heart of the city
Official White                                            70
So is this it
We just walk around
Pretty much
We just look for troublemakers and kick the living shit out of 'em
What kind of trouble
If we see a thief or a pickpocket, we just slap him around-- maybe cut off a finger or an ear, or the tip of his nose, lower lip-- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion-- then we take our share of the loot and let him go
Mostly what we worry about are activist types, rabble rousers, getting people all riled up against the King or the Temple Priests
That's death for sure
Pretty harsh, isn't it
Harsh times, brother
We're in the middle of a famine
People are starving
If we don't get some rain soon, it could get ugly
(looking forward to it) Then we'll get to start kicking ass big time
He stops to flog a  with his hand out
(cont'd) Beat it, you filthy beggar
You can't blame people for being hungry
Yeah, well, just remember, it's the palace that pays you, not the people
Official White                                                             71
Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets and turn to look
At the sound of the trumpets falls to the ground and prostrates himself
Cain pulls Oh to the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the approaches
Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only one standing
enter the square carrying an ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy
On it is the  , a stunning young woman, richly dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red lips
rides along fanning her with a big ostrich plume fan
Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty
Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice he's the only person in the square still standing
She gives him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously
As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at Zed
He doesn't recognize her, but we do
It's Maya, now elaborately costumed and made-up
Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a   knocks him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the entourage passes
(on the ground, excitedly to Oh) Did you see that girl
think she liked me
She looked right at me
Gee,  wonder why
The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all get back to their feet
Who was she
The Princess Inanna
She's totally hot, but don't even think about it
Official White                                                                                       72
Why not
Because she's royalty and you're scum
The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the royal entourage
Where's everybody going
To the temple
Let's go
(starts walking) You have to see this
() Will she be there
Everybody will be there
: 43
-     43 At the center of the square is a magnificent temple adorned with elaborate carvings and monumental statues of pagan gods
Before it is a great altar in front of a
The idol's mouth is a gaping fiery furnace
Behind the temple, is a towering  still under construction
blast a solemn fanfare as ceremoniously climb the stairs to the altar
stare at the spectacle
44                                                                                   44 The Princess Inanna takes her seat near the , the , the  and other
Maya stands behind the Princess and continues fanning her
Zed spots the Princess on the pavilion
Official white                                                                                 73
Hey, there she is
He starts edging toward the royal pavilion
45 45 Under a broad awning, the King and Queen snack from a table covered with platters of exotic fruits and sweetmeats
The King, an imposing man with Shakespearean gravity, wipes his mouth and glances at the Princess Inanna
The Princess isn't eating
find it hard to eat when so many are hungry
(as if ) Your concern is enviable
() And besides, 'm so fat
The Queen,                                                    40's, still beautiful, reacts
(for the hundredth time) You're not fat-- Yes,  am, mother
Those new linen pants you got me from Egypt make my ass look just huge
Well, you can't keep starving yourself
Why not
Everybody else is starving-- present company excluded
Official White                                                                    74
Careful, Princess
You may be my step-daughter, but these are dangerous times and those are dangerous words
weep for the suffering of my people, but the spirit of rebellion is alive in the city and if necessary  will crush it with every means at my disposal
() For the good of the people
(warning her) For the good of everyone who enjoys the favor of the throne
Whatever
'm just so incredibly bored

They walk in solemn silence to ritual positions around the altar
The High Priest is even more elaborately costumed than the nobles, ridiculously so, standing very tall on high platform shoes, with heavy eye makeup, his hair and beard even oilier than the others
He turns to the altar, raises his hands to the heavens and begins his invocation
(intoning pompously) El, lord of Heaven and Earth; Baal, the Sublime; Shapash, goddess of the sun; Hadad, the storm god, over-ruling son of Dagon, the bountiful, god of grain, our earthly sustenance-- He makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion and stares up at the Princess Inanna
She sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice
Official white                                                           75
Isn't that the idiot who was standing up in the street
Maya sees him, too, and starts fuming
The High Priest continues
We come before you in humble supplication, invoking your blessing, the sweet rain which waters our fields, enriches the harvest, fills our storehouses, makes mighty the house of Ish-ka-bi- baal and the city of Sodom-- The King nods graciously
(cont'd) --and feeds us, your children, with the bounty of your grace
She glances at Zed again, but this time a slight smile crosses her lips
Zed grins back at her
The Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and subtly points Zed out to her
Maya nods obediently, glaring at Zed, and starts fanning the princess a little too vigorously
Accept now this humble sacrifice to the power and glory of your magnificence
He starts inspecting the Vestal Virgins, beautiful young women in diaphanous, almost transparent white gowns
have no idea what's going on
Zed turns to the Official White                                                            76
What's happening
He's picking a virgin
() Oh yeah
Uh huh
Uh huh
the High Priest is moving down the line of beautiful young maidens
He comes to one   who seems so obviously not a virgin, he does a double take and kicks her out of the line
watching curiously
What do they want a virgin for
To throw into the fire
() Why
(like talking to an idiot) Offering to the Gods
There's a famine going on
If we don't make a good sacrifice, it won't rain
No rain, no harvest
No harvest, no food
Get it
It's pretty self-explanatory
You throw the virgin in the fire so it'll rain
Duh
Seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin to me
Official white                                                             77
() These virgins-- it's always a girl, right
great cheer goes up as a girl is chosen
She swoons as the priestesses slip off her vestment and two priests escort her to the fiery mouth of the furnace
For the love of the Gods and the glory of their Creation, the great dome of Heaven, the green growing Earth, we commit this maiden to your Holy Fire
Another great cheer from the crowd as they throw her into the fire
() This is just crazy
Maya approaches them but Zed and Oh still don't recognize her
(eyes downcast) The Princess wishes to see you
(staring at her cleavage) Her wish is my command
Not you
Him
(points at Zed) Me
Cool
(then, motioning to Oh) We're kind of a package deal
Can he come with
The three of us are inseparable
We're like brothers
Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an artificial smile
Official White                                                              78
Maya ignores Cain and points to Zed and Oh
The two of you follow me
(to Cain) 'll try to put in a good word for you
Cain fumes as Zed and Oh head off with Maya
: 47 47
- stands guard at the massive iron palace gates
is pressed against the gate pleading for food
Zed and Oh approach led by Maya
The guards brutally push the beggars aside and they enter
48 48
-  -- Maya leads Zed and Oh through the gate and into a beautiful atrium where they are met by a fat bald  wearing the royal livery
(to Oh) This is Zaftig the Eunuch
You go with him
Oh is led away by the Eunuch as she takes Zed off in the opposite direction
Can't  go with him
Why
Is he your lover
(laughs at the thought) Hah
No
That would be weird
-- The Eunuch just shrugs, apparently not that weird to him
(cont'd) () So what do you do
Official White                                                                                    79
serve the royal family-- little of this, little of that
've been a palace eunuch since  was nine years old
You've been living here since you were nine
(looks around, impressed) should look into that
How do you get to be a eunuch
(--) They cut off your testicles
() What
What's up with all the genital mutilation
() Trust me, after a while you don't even miss them
() No, 'd miss them-- 'm sure hardly got to use them yet
The Eunuch leads him down the corridor
: 49                                                               ' ,      49 land with a wet splat on a polished marble table
- The High Priest, an extremely vain, officious, and fussy man, still over-dressed in sacramental drag, pushes back his sleeves and starts examining the entrails as the King and his look on, deeply concerned
Six sacrifices in the last ten days and still no rain
What do the entrails predict
Official White                                                             80
(nervously poking at the sheep heart) Well, the liver is streaked with gray-- that's not a favorable sign-- but the heart looks good
See how nice and red it is here
That's always a good omen
What does it mean
Usually it means that the sheep took very good care of itself, probably sticking to a high-fiber diet of grass and hay
What does it mean for us
Well, it could mean either a surprise visit from a former friend or sweetheart-- or that you're going on a long sea voyage
Wouldn't that be fun
() How did you become High Priest
Because 'm your brother
Perhaps it's time for a new High Priest
(his eyes go wide) Perhaps it's not time for a new High Priest
Aaaahh
He dramatically flings his fingers out at the Prime Minister, as if wielding the power of the Gods
Nothing happens
(cont'd) And let that be a warning to you
Next time,  will hurl a lightning bolt at your face
() Official White                            81
(cont'd) () Or a fire-ball
(ignores him) Majesty, there's talk of revolution in the streets
Grain and oil are scarce, prices are high, starving peasants are pouring into the city looking for food-- Poverty has a bitter taste, but it's the flavor they were born to
It's the will of the Gods
The Queen and Princess Inanna are lounging on cushioned divans, listening
() Can the Gods really be so cruel
don't think that's cruel
It's just practical
If everybody was rich, who'd wait on us
Maya approaches and whispers something to the Princess
Good
See that he's bathed and dressed, then bring him to me
Maya frowns and exits
(cont'd) (to the queen) This should be amusing
: 50
-    50 Maya leads Zed down a grand hallway
Zed is now wearing a long flowing robe of silk brocade, fine sandals, and jewelry
His hair has been combed and pulled back into a loose ponytail
He stops to admire himself in a mirror
What do you think, ponytail or no ponytail
You know what
() Official White              82
(cont'd) 'll start with the ponytail, see where the night takes me
Maya rolls her eyes and leads Zed to the entrance of the Great Hall
Cain and another guard are posted at the door
(cont'd) Hey, you made it
What's it like inside
() wouldn't know
- 'm just a guard because my "brother" didn't pull any strings with his friends in the royal court
Look, first of all, we're not actually brothers--- Just like Abel
oughta just bash your head in-- Hey
You didn't let me finish
As soon as  get in there 'm going to talk to somebody and get you invited, okay
() Yeah, sure
Have a nice orgy
Cain pulls open the big doors and Zed steps through the portal
Cain tries to steal peeks inside as the heavy doors slam shut
: 51                                                            '         51 full-scale  is going on in a magnificent hall
As Maya leads him into the room, Zed pulls his hair out of the ponytail
Feels like a hair-down kinda scene, don't you think
Official White                                                          83
As you wish
() Be sure to try the fruit
Zed looks at her and finally recognizes her
Maya
What are you doing here
had no choice
'm a slave, remember
was going to rescue you
Really
In fact, we came here to find you
(not buying it) Wait here until you're sent for
This wasn't my idea, you know
Of course not
You were just chosen again
Maybe after you and the Princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself
She walks off before he can answer
Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then walking past a row of " ," semi-nude men and women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint, frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful bodies
Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude "", then furtively reaches out and fondles her breast
The goddess slaps his hand, then resumes her pose
watch it, jerk
Hey
You're a real girl
That is so cool
Official White                                                             84
He moves down the row of living sculptures, mugging at them, mock humping, and waving his hands in their faces trying to make them move, but they remain frozen
(cont'd) Amazing
He comes to the   and does a double-take
This one is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like someone waiting for a bus
He is also painted gold, but unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long, shifting his weight uncomfortably and looking around in obvious embarrassment
(cont'd) (recognizing him) Oh
Oh looks down from his pedestal
(through clenched teeth) 'm not supposed to talk
'm a statue
Yeah, you look so-- gold
How's it going
How's it going
just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls, and believe me, he was very thorough, if you know what mean
How's it going with you
Not bad
Had a little rub and a scrub, now 'm up for some grub
That sounds nice-- for you
Hey
You'll never guess who's here- - Maya
She's working here-- and she looks great
But she's kinda mad at me
Oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed's sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of food
Official White                                                           85
There's Eema
Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a household slave
She stops to serve some rowdy  who take the opportunity to tease and fondle her
She tries to pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm
Stand still, wench
want to see what's under that skirt
As he starts to lift her hem, she drops the whole tray of food on him
His cohorts laugh
'm sorry
It was an accident
That was no accident
Sargon grabs her and raises his hand to hit her
Zed steps in quickly
You
Slave girl
(he pulls her away from ) told you to fetch me more wine
Apologize to this officer--- now
'm sorry
Now go-- fetch
Wait by that-- skinny statue
'll deal with you later
As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and shrugs
(cont'd) Slaves-- what are you gonna do
Try using a hot poker
That they understand
Ouch
Helpful hint
will keep that in mind
Official White                                                          86
Zed bows, then leaves him and joins Eema who is waiting at Oh's pedestal
Zed                                                          (cont'd) What are you doing here
We were sold to the palace
But won't serve these people
'd rather die
Keep that up and you will
What are you doing here
(notices his clothes) Have you joined them
haven't joined anything
(re the gold body paint) Does this look like fun
They both look accusingly at Zed
Okay,  know what you're thinking, but 'm just checking it out
We kept hearing that this place was so evil, but now that  look around 'm thinking maybe it's not all bad
There's a lot to learn here
What
Like human sacrifice
No
Like the wheel, for instance
That's pretty awesome-- the way it just goes around in a circle
And farming
And metal-- writing, money, pottery-- hot baths
Come on
Back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough
(to Oh) What happened to him
Official White                                                        87
Look,  think 've been chosen to do something great with my life-- Here we go again-- --and  don't think it's hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets
Maya returns for Zed
() She wants to see you-- now
hope you don't think 'm interested in her
() Why would  think that
Just because you couldn't take your eyes off her-- 'm just using her, Maya
It's part of my plan
'm going to get you all out of here as soon as can
() What's your plan
(not a clue) It's a secret
(not buying it) Forget it
Maya sees   watching them and reverts to her slave attitude
(cont'd) (bowing to Zed) The Princess awaits you
Official White                                                                    88
And  await her
(to Oh and Eema) You two await me
(then confidentially to Eema and Oh) Stay out of trouble
'll be back
He exits with Maya
He has no idea what he's doing, does he
don't know
So much has happened
Sometimes  think-- She walks away
(cont'd) (wistfully, to himself) love you

Oh walks by still painted gold
(to Oh) You there
Golden boy
Rub me with oil
The High Priest dismisses the young men, then stands and lets his rich outer robe fall to the floor
His chest, back and shoulders are incredibly hairy
'd rather not, if you don't mind
'm not really a slave
'm a guard
Then maybe you'd rather  speak to your commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life
Or perhaps  whip you myself
How would you like that
Are those my choices
Official White                                                           89
'd say so
The High Priest lies back down
Oh looks around, finds a pitcher filled with precious oil and dribbles some on the High Priest's hairy chest
How's that
More
(splashes a few more drops on him) That enough
(getting angry) No
More oil
Much more, you insolent dolt
Oh pours oil liberally over his chest, back, and shoulders
(cont'd) That's good
Now rub it in
() With my hands
Do it
Oh grimaces and starts gingerly massaging the oil into his hairy chest and shoulders
(cont'd) (in ecstasy) Mmmmm,  love it
The sweet scent of precious oil
The oily-- oiliness
Eema walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees Oh massaging the High Priest
She gasps
() Eema
This isn't what you think
Official White                                                                                                 90
() No, it's fine
understand
This really explains a lot about you that  didn't get before
No, really
'm just-- rubbing oil on this man
She exits
Mnum imam
have an idea
Why don't we go back to my place and see what's under all that paint
() Ughh
: 53
'  -  -     53 Maya ushers Zed into the dimly lit room
Good luck
-- She leaves him
haze of heavily scented incense hangs in the air
(
) Come to me
Zed turns and sees the Princess standing on the terrace
54
-  -           54 Zed steps out onto the moonlit terrace
He crosses to the balustrade and stands beside the Princess, gazing out over the twinkling cityscape
Beautiful, isn't it
You can see Gomorrah just over the hill
Official White                                   91
didn't know it was so close
They're called the "twin cities
" Looks pretty from up here, but some people think God is going to wipe them out because they're so evil
(toying with him) And what do you think
Am  evil
don't really know you
But you don't look evil
Do you find me attractive
Well, yeah
think you're-- incredible
(moving closer) have body issues
No, you're perfect
Your face, your hair-- (looking into her eyes) Your eyes are like the sea
(a beat) My eyes are brown
Well, it's kinda dark
took a shot
know they're big, though-- and wet-- She pulls him close
(cont'd) Can  ask you one thing
What would a girl like you want with a guy like me
Official white                                                    92
don't know
just find you-- interesting
They say it's the will of the gods that some men should suffer while others rule-- that we're all just victims of our fate
And  believed that until this morning when  saw you standing up, alone, in the square
And  said to myself, finally here's one man who refuses to bow down to anything-- -- (considers explaining but just lets it go) Yeah
That's me
Yes, finally a man who has the courage to question the order of things--- a man chosen by the Gods to do something great
() That's exactly what 've been thinking
You wouldn't believe the things that have been happening to me lately
just didn't know why
(gets very, very close) know why
To bring you here-- to this place-- to me
() couldn't agree more
'm trying to agree more, but  can't
That's how much  agree

She takes his hand and leads him away
watches them from behind a curtain

56
-     56 The High Priest is giving Oh a personal tour of the inner sanctum
Oh is scrubbed and dressed like a junior priest
My life is devoted to the service of the Gods and the good of the people
take nothing for myself
He has a huge gold ring set with precious gems on every finger, and a gold tiara on his head studded with rubies and emeralds
That's so-- unselfish of you
Yes, it is
It's just so-- lonely
Sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being
() Here's a riddle: what has two thumbs and wants another oil rub
(pointing thumbs at ) This-guy
Ohquickly changes the subject
So where does that hall lead to
(his eyes light up) Come, 'll show you
He takes Oh's arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing and arcane religious symbols
(cont'd) Behind those doors is the Holy of Holies-- the earthly domain of the () 94
Official White (cont'd) Gods-- a place so ineffably sacred, so powerful, that to enter is instant death for any mortal
Wow
(a long beat) So who cleans it
it needs no cleaning
No, of course not
(can't let go of it) Kind of makes you wonder though-- the guys who built it, did they just die the minute they finished, or did the Gods give them a second to get out
(starting to get annoyed) assume they finished it, then the Gods descended
Yeah, that's probably it
(another long beat) So you're saying we can't go in
just told you
To enter is instant death
Only  can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings
() Right, right, right
() What if we just open the doors and stick our heads in
Fine
Enough
'm sorry  brought it up
Let's go
(pushes Oh along) Move
Move
He shoos him down the hall

- Zed and Princess Inanna stealthily enter the temple
(looking around nervously) What are we doing here
want you to enter the Holy of Holies
Yes
Finally
Now you're talking
Should  enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom
Does the Holy of Holies like to be entered from behind or--
() That's the Holy of Holies-- you have to go in there and talk to the Gods
The Gods are in there
So they say, but the only one who ever goes in is the High Priest
They say it's instant death for anyone else to enter
Then why am  going in
() Because you were chosen
If the Gods wanted you dead they would have killed you already
-- This is what you've been chosen for
To speak to the Gods and plead with them not to destroy the city
Then come back out and tell me what it's like inside
Official White                                                                        96
(mulling it over) Right-- right
Then again, if the rules say-- Do you always follow the rules
What is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules
You-all have this bad boy complex---- She kisses him fiercely on the lips
Do this for me
'm going in
He enters the Holy of Holies
darts between the columns and hides in the shadows
beam of moonlight reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead
: 58
-    58 Zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates himself, face down on the floor, arms outstretched in supplication
He lies there with his eyes tightly shut, expecting to be vaporized any second
long moment passes in total silence
Then he opens his eyes and looks around tentatively
The inner chamber of the Holy of Holies is a bare room with marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights above
(takes a deep breath and starts improvising) Thank you, -- Merciful ones, for-- not like-- killing me, and letting me receive the, uh, blessing of your holy-- godliness
He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine response
Nothing comes
Official White                                               97
(cont'd) (props himself up on his ) Okay,  don't know the right words-- so 'm just going to say what have to say-- if that's all right
(waits for a response, gets none, proceeds) know  haven't always done the right thing
Eating the fruit was bad,  know that-- and the Cain thing-- and  have done somethings with women--  do love the ladies-- well, you probably know all that because you're watching everything-- (a thought occurs) Do you really watch everything
That's got to be a little disgusting sometimes-- but probably pretty hot, too-- () Not that you would get off on any of it-- okay, 'm getting off the subject
Anyways, the word is you've been considering destroying this place
So 'm asking you not to-- as a personal favor
() Feel free to jump in anytime could use a little guidance here
Still no response
He rolls over onto his back
(cont'd) Look,  know you think this place is evil and it kinda is--  see that-- but that's not everybody
There are a lot of good people, too
So what if there were, like, fifty really good people
Would you still destroy the city
() Okay, you're right, that may be a reach
How about twenty
could probably get you twenty extremely good people if  really looked around
() How about five
Five awesome people-- including myself personally know at least five people worth saving
Does that sound good
() Official White                                                                               98
(cont'd) () Hello
little help
Am getting warm here
Okay, is it me
Are you punishing me for stuff did
(an insight) Or setting me up for what  need to do
Or both
Or neither
() Could you give me some kind of a sign-- please-- anything
Zed listens but hears only a profound silence
Then a revelation
He sits up on the floor
(cont'd) Okay, wait
Is that the sign
The silence
Is that it
(waits for confirmation) It is, isn't it
Just this really silent-- silence
() You're not going to tell me what to do; it's up to me to decide what's right and what's wrong-- right
Is that it
You're not going to speak to me-- you're going to speak through me
If that's right, don't say anything
(listens for a beat) Okay,  read you loud and clear
Thank you
(an afterthought) Oh, and if things don't work out with Maya would it be okay with you if me and the Princess had a little "carnal knowledge"
Not in an evil way or anything-- (he listens; silence) Okay
You're right, probably not a good idea
Thank you
He backs out of the Holy of Holies, bowing all the way
: 59 59
- The doors to the Holy of Holies opens and Zed comes backing out, still bowing and muttering
Then he turns and his face falls

The High Priest, the King, the Queen, and a dozen Temple Acolytes are staring at him in amazement
Oh stands beside the High Priest dressed just like him
was just looking for the bathroom
() told him not to go in
() Seize them
(scared, points at Zed) Seize him
The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up and takes hold of Zed
() Should've invited me to the party
: 60 60
- In the dim torchlight, we see Zed hanging spread-eagle five feet off the ground, his arms and legs stretched out wide and tightly bound to iron rings imbedded in the stone
Oh is shackled to the wall beside him, hanging upside down
They hear the faint scream of a man being tortured somewhere deep in the prison
wish  was upside down
Looks fun
Oh won't talk to him
(cont'd) So this is it
We're not friends anymore
After all 've done for you
Official White                                                           100
What have you done for me
've been attacked by a cougar, 've fallen down a mountain,  almost had the tip of my thingy cut off, 've been greasing up the High Priest all night, and now 'm hanging upside down in a dungeon
And  have to pee real bad
All because of you
You call yourself a friend
Name one good thing you've done for me
've helped you come out of your shell
(in distress) really have to pee-- Listen,  know 'm not perfect, and may have made a few wrong turns, but you have to understand-- 'm a chosen
That's a lot of responsibility -- you can't even imagine
() The only one who thinks you're chosen is you, so shut up already
() Okay, be mad, but 'm going to get us out of here, if it's the last thing  do
Zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no avail
(cont'd) That was just my first idea-- and 'm also accepting ideas
() Guard
have to pee
Now
Seriously
(can't hold it anymore) Oh, no-- Official White                                                                                       101
Because he's upside down, the streams runs down his stomach, over his chest, down his neck, onto his chin and over his face
(cont'd) hate you
: 61 61
- curious, jeering  is gathering as Zed and Oh, in shackles, are led by a    to a raised platform in the middle of the square
The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd
Cain presides over the execution
He addresses the crowd
For the crimes of blasphemy-- (the crowd grumbles its ) -- (grumble, grumble) -- (serious grumbling) -- (admiring oohs and aahs) And the murder of my brother Abel-- Oh, come on
Shut up
For these and other crimes they may not actually have done yet but we're pretty sure they were thinking about, the prisoners will be stoned to death
The crowd roars as  stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to grab stones to throw
Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other
The King, Queen, High Priest and Royal Ministers observe the stoning from their vantage point above the square
Princess Inanna refuses to look
Official White                                                             102
Observe, my dear
It seems the least you could do, since it was you who lured him to his death
She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed
didn't intend for this to happen
The people move in and surround the platform on all sides, baseball-size rocks in their hands
(to Zed and Oh) Anything to say before the sentence is carried out
(to the crowd) just want to say this is really messed up-- -- () The people fling their rocks with all their might
Zed and Oh duck
The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on the opposite sides, several bystanders taking painful hits in the head, some falling down unconscious
Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks from all directions
(cont'd) Okay
Stop
Halt
Hold it
This isn't working
Can  make a suggestion
() What
Official White                                                             103
Why don't you just pick one person to throw
The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement
(cont'd) (pressing the advantage) In fact, don't you think it would be fair for us to get to pick the person who stones us
Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently fair
(some eagerly raising their hands and waving like school children) Yes
Ooh, me
Pick me
Me
The King grabs Sargon
(re Cain) What is that idiot doing
Zed spots a good candidate in the crowd
We pick him
Cain points at a  , heavily muscled, eagerly waving his hand
Him
No, next to him
He points at a , about nine years old and not very big
He's just a kid
Official White                                                             104
So
You got something against kids
Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval
(cont'd) This guy hates kids
Yeah
What's he got against kids
Children are the future
Give the kid a shot
The kid
The kid
On the balcony, the King shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by the power of the mob
He nods to Sargon who signals to Cain
All right
All right
We'll try it
Kid
Grab a rock
The boy picks up a good-size rock
Zed turns to Oh
Good thinking, huh
They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws
The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that smacks Oh right on the forehead
The crowd cheers
(cont'd) Holy shit
That kid's got an arm
() think he hit me
The boy fires again
Oh spins and tries to duck but takes the rock right on the head
(cont'd) Hey
There's two of us
The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back
Okay, everybody on this side now
On the count of three
One-- two-- Official white                                                            105
Wait
have a question for the King
The crowd goes silent
All eyes turn and look up to the palace balcony
(cont'd) (shouts to the King) Why didn't  die in the Holy of Holies
On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question
One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be stumped
In the square, the crowd starts muttering
Zed seizes the initiative
(cont'd) entered the Holy of Holies and, lo,  did not die
Why
Because am chosen by the Gods
He is chosen
He is the Chosen One
The Chosen One
Zed gives Oh a look: "See
told you
" (starts chanting) Spare the Chosen One
Spare the Chosen One
Spare the Chosen One
And his friend
Don't forget his friend
On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer with the High Priest
Could it be
Is he truly chosen
don't--  suppose it's possible- 'd have to examine some new -- Imbecile
Official White                                                                            106
Majesty, with respect, whether he's chosen or not is no longer the issue
To kill him now, given the public mood, could inflame the situation enough to prompt a radical "regime change," if you take my meaning
The King looks grimly at his ministers, all of whom have lean and hungry looks
Princess Inanna smiles contemptuously at him
: 62 62 addressing the crowd in the square
By order of the King, the sentence has been commuted
The crowd cheers
Zed and Oh exchange hopeful looks
() Can't we just stone them a little
It is the judgement of our most merciful King that the prisoners are to be enslaved to toil at hard labor until they die of exhaustion or starvation
(exuberant fist pump) Yes
: 63
-    63 Oh is up to his knees in a mud pit, trampling straw into the thick mud
Guard cracks a bullwhip which flicks painfully across his shoulders
Official white                                                                107
Okay, you think that actually makes anybody work harder
It just makes them resent you
Is that what you want
(whips him again) Faster
Can  just ask when lunch is
The whip lashes out again
Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace
64                                                                64 Marlak and Enmebaragesi are stacking bricks when zed approaches
(greets them) Hey
Boys
Long time no see
They glance up, but ignore him
(cont'd) Don't tell me you're still mad about Maya
That's so over have a thing going with the princess now-- well, almost had a thing
'm a slave now-- just like you
No
You're not just like me
Okay
We do have our differences-- like about a cup and half of brain tissue-- but that doesn't mean we can't work together
Another  approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick
#2 Take those bricks to the top
The masons are waiting
Official white                                                           108
Marlak and Enmebaragesi glower at the guard as they pick up ropes and harness themselves to a cart loaded with bricks
#2                                                      (cont'd) (to Zed) You
Help them
He grabs another rope harness off the cart and throws it to Zed
You know, 'd like to, but  did something to my neck-- (massages his neck) must've slept on it funny-- those dungeon pillows are like rocks-- well, they are rocks-- so  should probably take it easy or 'll be no damn good for work tomorrow
#2 (strikes him across the back with his stick) said move
Okay
But  should tell you, this isn't really my area
'm just on a break from the mud department-- The Guard draws his short sword and raises it over Zed
#2 One more word and you die-- (putting on the harness) Okay, okay
'm going
(to Marlak and ) Okay, boys, on the count of three
One-- two-- three
Marlak and Enmebaragesi lunge against the ropes, but Zed makes no effort to pull
They glare at him
(cont'd) Learned that from Maya
Good trick, huh
Okay, together this time
Go
Official White                                                                                     109
They pull together and the heavy cart starts to move
: 65
-    65 Zed, Marlak and Enmebaragesi haul the heavy cart of bricks to the very top of the tower
are working on the wall
Zed leans against the wall next to them tb rest
How high you guys think we're going with this
Up to Heaven,  guess
That's how tall they usually build 'em
(looking up) That's ambitious
We worked on the Tower of Babel
Now that was a ziggurat
Incredible erection
Zed looks down at his crotch
() That's nothing
You should see it when 'm excited
The tower
Oh, right, the tower
Incredible erection
(snickers to himself) See, the Egyptians are working on an entirely different concept
Four sides, slanting walls, pointy top
Official White                                                                  110
Like a pyramid
Exactly
Wow
Far out
Yet timeless in a way
approaches with a water bucket
(to Zed) Want some water
As the child offers him the ladle, Zed recognizes her
You're from the village, aren't you
The child nods
(cont'd) bet you wish you were back there right now, don't you
The child nods again
(cont'd) Well, don't give up
You're going to get home someday
Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over
(standing over him) Who's going to take her there
The Chosen One
Marlak kicks gravel and dirt in Zed's face
Zed just lies there and takes it, feeling like he's failed everyone
Then he hears the beating of drums and trumpet fanfares coming from the temple square below
: 66
-     66 Oh and the other slaves are mustered by the guards
Official White                                                                                   111
Get in line
Now
Move
Where're we going
To watch the sacrifice
The King demands it
Is that compulsory
Because  saw one when  first got here and it made me a little sick-- The guard's whip catches him across the back
(cont'd) Ow
Why don't you try using your words for a change
: 67
-    67 The square is filling up with people
The is moving to the seats of honor to watch the sacrifice
Cain is now among the Royal Guard having been promoted for his treachery
He bows and helps the Queen to her seat
(leering seductively) At your service, my lady
Anytime, anywhere
() There's a depraved thought
You're so delightfully low
Absolute filth
() Thank you, your majesty
He touches his tongue to the tip of his nose and waggles his eyebrows
The King arrives with Sargon to loud booing from the crowd
Official White                                                        112
Are they booing me
How dare they
Your Highness, with all due respect, those were "Woos
" They love you
They were "wooing" you
The King looks doubtfully at the hostile crowd
All is in readiness, Majesty
(glares at the King) What now
More virgins to sacrifice
Yes, two, followers of the Chosen One, discovered by this loyal soldier
Cain bows to the King
Just doing my duty
And one more to demonstrate our own faith and charity
The King stands and makes a proclamation loud enough for everyone to hear
(cont'd) In supplication to the Gods, for the love of the People, we offer a humble sacrifice to the sacred temple fire-- our own step- daughter, the Princess Inanna
The crowd gasps
(cont'd) (to Inanna) For the good of the people
(stands in protest) You wouldn't dare
Official white                                                                                   113
Wouldn't
If you like,  could arrange for you to join her
The Queen slowly sits back down
(cont'd) (to Inanna) How long did you think 'd tolerate your insolence
(to Sargon) Burn her
- Sargon and Cain seize Inanna, but she shrugs them off and rises with dignity
'll see you all in Hell
: 68                                                                              68 The flames are starting to build inside the idol's mouth
69
-     69 Oh and the slaves are confined behind a barrier, watched by a squad of guards, waiting for the ceremony to start
open slowly, and the High Priest appears holding a long jewelled staff
Oh turns to the   next to him
(casually name-dropping) See the High Priest
know him
Dear friend of mine
Now the procession of   is led out by the Maya and Eema are among them, their hands tied
They look like they've been drugged
Oh spots Eema and Maya among the virgins
Official White                                                                        114
() That's Eema
And Maya
know them
() guess you know everybody, don't you
Oh shoulders his way right up to the barrier where a stops him with a spear to his neck
That's far enough, slave
Oh stops right there, frustrated and frightened
Inanna is led out last, now also having been drugged
70                                                                    70 Zed, Marlak and the sharp-eyed Enmebaragesi look down, trying to see what's going on
They're bringing out the women
() How are you seeing that far
see your sister, Eema-- () It's Maya
: 71                                                                           71 The drums and trumpets kick up the tempo and the High Priest starts leading the virgins to the idol's fiery mouth
Oh pushes against the barrier, restrained by the guard
Official White                                                                        115
We have to do something
Somebody has to stop it
(turning to the other ) We can't let them do this
The slaves start to mutter
The guards draw their swords and heft their spears, now on high alert
: 72                                                                    72 Zed looks around desperately, trying to figure out what to do
(to Marlak) have to get down there
#2 () Over my dead body
All right
Without a moment's hesitation, Marlak grabs him and tosses him off the top of the ziggurat
He screams all the way down
Wow
Who saw that coming
Thanks, Marlak
Now what
Zed looks around quickly, grabs the end of a long coiled rope attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak the other end
(looping the rope around his waist) Lower me down
Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top of the ziggurat holding the rope
Official White                                                                   116
Marlak looks at the rope in his hands, pulls it a little and sees that it's not attached to the rope Zed was holding
: He's descending rapidly, rappelling off the side of the ziggurat
He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and slow him down
() Any time now, Marlak
Marlak and Enmebaragesi watch his descent, dumbly interested in what happens next
Zed sees he's not slowing down and tries to swing himself onto one of the upper levels of the ziggurat
However, when he swings in, he hits a cart loaded with bricks and bounces off painfully
The sudden jolt dislodges the wheel chock that was holding the cart on the sloping ramp of the tower
The cart starts to roll down the ramp, gathering speed as it careens toward the edge
: 73                                                                  73 He raises his staff and invokes the Gods
We implore the great Gods of heaven to show us a sign that we may honor your divine will and be worthy of your blessing
: Official White                                                                 117
74                                                                  74 The brick cart explodes through the scaffolding on the side of the ziggurat and sails into the air
: Everybody turns at the sound of the crash and looks up at the ziggurat
: The   who whipped Oh earlier glances up and is instantly crushed by a ton of falling bricks
Zed is still descending as the broken scaffolding starts to give way
The whole crowd watches in amazement as the 250                 foot scaffolding slowly collapses and crashes to the ground, bringing tons of debris with it, sending up a great cloud of dust
He looks shocked
He seizes the opportunity
sign
It's a sign
The Chosen One comes
The other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his excitement
Official White                                                                             118
The Chosen One
sign from the Gods
He doesn't quite know how to respond to the growing fervor of the crowd
Yes
Well and truly, the Gods are with us-- The crowd drowns him out
75                                                                     75 guard is standing there staring at the rubble of the scaffolding as Zed comes screaming down the side of the ziggurat and lands right on top of him
Zed quickly strips the unconscious guard of his weapons, starts to run off, stops, comes back and grabs the guard's helmet, then takes off running to the temple square
: 76                                                                                 76 The High Priest is getting frantic now
Burn them
Now
He grabs Maya and starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth of the idol and the raging fire within
She struggles but is too drugged to put up much resistance
He grabs the sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing her
(cont'd) () May the balm of this healing oil soothe your journey through the sacred fire
() Don't fight it
It's the will of the Gods
Then, a voice from above
Official White                                                             119
() don't think so
Zed is standing atop the idol's head, brandishing a sword and shield
She sees him and starts to revive
Zed
looks up, unable to hear Zed over the crowd noise
(cupping his ear) What did you say
() said, ' don't think so
' (shakes his head) Still not getting it
Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively climbing down from the top of the idol
He jumps the last few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the High Priest's way
Said, ' don't think so
' () You don't think what
Whatever that last thing you said was
() forgot
() Guards
Official White                                                                            120
Guards rush toward Zed from all sides, but he fights like a demon, slashing, spinning, stabbing, fending off their blows with his shield
Oh is inspired by Zed's courage
(to the Edomite slave) know him, too
Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of him
The other slaves see that and start fighting with their guards, a genuine slave revolt
Guards start moving to help their comrades, but the spirit of insurrection takes hold of the crowd and people start grappling with the guards
comes double-timing into the square
Suddenly,     throws off his cloak and pulls a sword
It's Abraham
Death to the idolators
Abraham's small army of  reveal themselves, draw their weapons and attack the reinforcements
The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands there observing the growing chaos
(shaking his head) Just fucking nuts
77                                                                   77 They come running into the battle swinging clubs, randomly bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike
Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground
Tough guy, huh
You want a piece of me
Get ready to have your head bashed in
Official White                                                               121
As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak - him
(cont'd) (nose bleeding, stunned) Nice move
He passes out and goes down
78                                                                    78 He starts to panic at the full-scale revolt and rises nervously
His ministers surround him, he thinks to protect him
knew  could depend on your loyalty
The ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in for the kill
(cont'd) () Assholes
He falls to their flashing knives
79                                                                  79 Oh fights his way to the temple stairs, runs up and confronts a  who is trying to drag Eema away
He fights with very little skill but tremendous energy, finally overwhelming the guard and grabbing Eema
(suddenly shy again) Hello, Eema
(still a little dazed) Oh
He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes
(suddenly forceful) Eema, you're my woman
You hear me
Okay
Official White                                                                    122
Really
It's okay
He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the mouth
Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard rushing at him
Oh whirls and falls off the platform, accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him
80                                                                   80 While Zed is busy with the guards, the High Priest pulls Maya toward the fire
Zed sees him, finishes the last of the guards, and starts slowly moving toward the High Priest who starts backing away until he sees Oh moving toward him from the other side
He holds the helpless Maya close to the flames
(screaming and crying) Keep away
Let her go
(his mascara running) No
The Gods demand a sacrifice
And you ruined it
He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire
(trying to keep him calm) Why don't we just sacrifice something small-- a rabbit maybe
Or a duck
That'd be good, don't you think
() No
duck would not be good
(
) Then how about this
The High Priest turns to Oh
Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher
(cont'd) More oil
Official White                                                             123
He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him from head to toe
As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp
The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's fiery mouth
Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the mouth of the furnace
() Hot
Everyone goes silent, stunned by the incredible turn of events
All eyes turn to Zed and Oh, now standing before them on the center stage of the temple
They look at each other
Someone has to say something
Finally, Zed clears his throat
'm the, uh, Chosen One,  guess, and on behalf of, well, the whole city,  want to thank the High Priest for his incredible sacrifice
That was really something, wasn't it
He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the people in the square are applauding
At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in the eye
He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady rain starts to fall
The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they all roar in celebration
Then the rain stops as suddenly as it started
The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied muttering begins
(cont'd) (jumping in quickly) People
Friends
Sodomites
Okay, that was a little confusing, wasn't it
() Official White              124
(cont'd) Was that a sign from God
Wasn't it a sign
What's the deal
We all want to know
But 'm not sure anybody really knows-- and 'd be real suspicious of people who say they do
If 've learned one thing, it's this: the world and everything in it is a miracle
And what that miracle means is for each and every one of us to figure out for himself
Are the Gods going to destroy us
Maybe--  don't know-- guess it's possible
But if we keep going the way we are, they won't have to
We're doing a pretty good job of destroying ourselves
So maybe we should all just go home now, and think about what happened-- and be very, very good to each other
know 'm going to try
(raises his hand in salute to the people) Peace
The crowd stares at him blankly
Nobody knows what to make of it all
Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear
All hail the Chosen One
With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers
In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks around and scowls
What am
Chopped liver
At the altar, Maya, revived now, embraces Zed
You're incredible, you know that
That's what 've been trying to tell you
Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on
: Official white                                                                                              125
81
-       81 caravan is assembling, making ready to leave the city
Marlak, Enmebaragesi, Maya, Eema and the other villagers are there, as well as a great number of freed slaves and Hebrews
Isaac is checking out Maya's breasts
Hey, babe
Ever made it with a circumcised guy
Marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife
(cont'd) () Is she with you
did not realize that
Sorry
Marlak and Maya cross to Zed who is loading a packhorse
Marlak looks at him for a long moment then punches him hard on the shoulder
() You did good
Zed waits for more, but nothing comes
(rubbing his shoulder) Well said, Marlak
You really have a way with words
They clasp hands
We'll tell stories about you around the fire
Not much to tell, is there
Just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire
No big deal
Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one is listening to him
Zed joins him
(cont'd) Everybody ready
Official White                                                          126
() Yeah, just about--  guess so
The Hebrews are going to lead us to the sea and we can get boats from there
We can trade all this stuff everybody gave us for the trip home
() don't think  should be the leader
Nobody's listening to me
(by his side) 'll listen to you
Oh swells up with pride
(turns to Zed) Come back to the village sometime
Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace
Stifling a tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel
(cont'd) (shouting at camel) Hee-ya
(beat, quietly to camel) Come on
People are watching
The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off
Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow
As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet
Maya joins him
Where will you go now
Might head down to Egypt
hear it's a happening kinda place
Are you going alone
Not necessarily
You want to come
Official White                                                             127
'll get my things
She gestures off and he sees a small train of camels and horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions
(cont'd) The Princess gave me a few gifts when she freed us
Traveling light, huh
Okay, here we go
() To the west
(correcting him) That's west
knew that
Just wanted to see if you did
Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of sheep and goats, tended by  , going in the opposite direction
As       passes, we notice something masculine about her build and posture
Zed nods politely to her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him
(in a high unconvincing woman's voice) Peace--- brother
zed does a double take at the voice, shrugs, and walks off with Maya-- as a torrential rain begins to fall
