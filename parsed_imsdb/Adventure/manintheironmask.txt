href <b>// --> </b> The Man in the Iron Mask - 9/18/95 First Draft by Randall Wallace by Randall Wallace September 18, 1995 : From the  before the first images, we hear a young woman's tortured , muffled by her own will
We see her mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat
Her name is , and she is Queen of France
She lies in The royal  kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal mother grips her hands
On the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are royal  sweating and anxious for any word to take to their king
They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain of childbirth
Her fingers claw out for help, but her Doctor ignores her need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for the baby
Only her ,  , sits at her head, stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers
The head is born
One arm
the other arm
it is a boy
The advisors, disregarding the Queen's privacy, scurry around the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby, wet with birth
The mother -- the Queen -- is still in agony, yet she struggles to lift her head
1 shall tell the king
2 shall tell him
They hurry for the door
But their race to be first to bring this great news to the King is interrupted as the Queen emits another cry; it surprises the doctor
'lady
He kneels again to examine the Queen
Another
It is another
The joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors
They look gravely at each other, as they hear a second '
: - door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard and into the darkness steps a dashing figure
His face is hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his cloak and plumed hat that he is a
He carries an
carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the courtyard
The Musketeer steps into its interior, with a sharp word to the driver -- Away
The whip  and the carriage plunges into the night
: - On a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison, like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean
Just off a coastline renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and foreboding
As we : 1662 - With the camera as our moving , we survey the prison
It is a horrible place:  dungeons where prisoners lie in their own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which prisoners whimper, or moan in madness
Up a long winding staircase our  moves; we push through the barred window of a cell
It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places we've seen, but still a prison
We  the cell
And we see a man
It is terrifying, to think of anyone imprisoned in this way
We push in on his eyes
They are blue, childlike
greasy jailer -- the prisoner's  -- puts his face to the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty
You dead yet
No, Keeper
: - : - Through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing figure, his cloak flying behind him and catching the moonlight, his horse's hooves clattering along the cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy shadows
He is a magnetic sight, riding the horse as easily as if they were racing across an open field and not through a cluttered street, and guiding the stallion as if its grace and power came not from the animal but from the rider
Sitting lightly in the saddle is ' famous Musketeer, Captain of the King's Royal Bodyguard
He is still handsome at mid-life, still erect, unambiguous in his courage and his loyalty
He rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the streets breaking windows and scavenging for food
When they see d'Artagnan, some throw rocks at him
They sail by d'Artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding
'Artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence beside Notre Dame Cathedral
Priests are dispensing food to beggars gathered in the courtyard
As d'Artagnan reins his horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at the royal symbols on his uniform
But d'Artagnan is not a man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and moves toward the doorways the people part for him
He pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old residence, a big rickety carriage
'Artagnan smiles
' Porthos too
'Artagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the staircase of the tower above him
'  -   - Four people are moving up a winding stairway; three are women, bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses; the fourth is , the former Musketeer, now a nobleman of great wealth and even greater girth
He and the women are drinking wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing Porthos like rowboats tugging a ship to dock
Porthos is not so drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip their bodies as they walk and giggle
Ah ha
Here we are
Aramis
Porthos is here
They reach a doorway
Porthos kicks it open, staggers back, and begins shoving the women inside
'  - The first of the partying women tumbles inside; she stops short at what she sees
The second and third stumble in after her and they too stop dead still, sobered by what they see
Then with a great roar Porthos barrels in
Aaaaaaaramis
Porthos is -- He stops dead in his tracks
From the , we see
Always the most theological of the Musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and powerful
And still handsome, or at least he would be; but now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar, wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer
Sorry, my dears
You would have enjoyed it too
He's hung like a donkey
1 So are you
Really
haven't been able to see it for fifteen years
Go on now, leave His Holiness alone
'll bring you back tomorrow when he's in a better mood
He whacks their bottoms, herding them out, then swaggers to Aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend
Please revel with me, Aramis,  need my spirits lifted
'm old, 'm weak, my strength is gone -- Be quiet, you fat fool
Can't you see 'm praying
just said you're praying
Are you deaf too
know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes
(trying to ignore him) There are more important things than tits
Really
If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, will buy you a new cathedral
Aramis is still trying to pray, but rises to the bait
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
As if in reply, Porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart
(beat) Forgive me
Aramis' fingers clamp down on the rosary beads, as he tries to keep praying
Am  forgiven
Aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend
Porthos reels backwards, landing in a chair
observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple
Can't you see 'm praying, goddammit
Porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls
Aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it; Porthos picks up the whole table -- just as d'Artagnan enters
'Artagnan
Porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs d'Artagnan
How are you, you skinny little pup
Aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment
simple theological discussion
' Aramis -- the King wishes to see you
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem
Aramis lifts d'Artagnan's cloak as evidence:  near its hem, sure enough, is the remnant of a broken egg
' see your mind is sharp as ever
The King said, "Right away
"  Cut deep and hard, my friends
Deep and hard, 'Artagnan
'Artagnan clasps Porthos' hand, then that of Aramis, and leaves, as Porthos shakes his head
We were all Musketeers once, eh
Oh, forgot
For the poor, the ones you were praying for
He hands a purse to Aramis
Surprised, even touched, Aramis reaches for it
Just as he takes the money, Porthos throws a haymaker; but Aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks
Suddenly the two old warriors are circling again
wonder how Athos is doing
- stands at the dressing table in a modest room; dressed in a dark plain coat, he too is a former Musketeer -- gray haired and handsome, intensely intelligent, with a hard crust of manners masking seas of emotion
He opens a small wooden box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's looking for just as his son  enters
is in his mid-twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the French Army
He is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the mirror
Do  look all right
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you
care only about Michelle
Should ask her when we first arrive
Or
or when we're leaving could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace
get so confused
Perhaps this will help
He hands Raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box
Mother's ring
can't take this
She died giving you to me
And want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves
They embrace
Athos' eyes mist, but he smiles
Now go, and bring back your fiance
-    - The Palace glows golden in the Parisian sunshine
Carriages deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens
-  - Attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire of Louis 's France, the men like peacocks, the ladies in gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their bosoms
They laugh and smile and strike courtly poses pretending to talk with each other -- but all eyes are on the doorway, through which the king is about to come
the Fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by a flock of tailors
He is twenty-two, and would be quite handsome, except for the total self-absorption
He's checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his advisors,  and , try to speak with him
Your Majesty,  know it is a
a festive time, but before -- The blue sash
No, the burgundy
before the party begins -- The party has already begun -- so why are you delaying me
We do not wish to delay you, Majesty, but
as your advisors, we feel it is our -- our -- our duty
Yes
It is our duty to let you know
there are riots in Paris
Riots
My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth
Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and 'm sure they are content
except that
well, they are starving
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry
But why would they riot about it
As he says this, a replica of the Matterhorn made of fruits and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs
Majesty
We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week
If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before -- Aramis
have been expecting you
(to the tailors) We are satisfied, that will do
The tailors and advisors withdraw as Aramis -- still in his simple priest's robe -- strides forward and bows to the kind
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty
Next week
This is a mere garden party -- and  wish to join it, so will be brief
am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits
Well
perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty
have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves
Can you imagine the arrogance
Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order
No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold
Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France
He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself
How can  serve you in this
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is
You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God
Can you accept this mission, and keep it private
If  find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel
will kill both him and the man who told me
Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh
Aramis bows and Louis turns back to his mirror
There are mirrors everywhere in his palace, and he loves his reflection, adorned as he is all in golden cloth, like fabric from the sun
Aramis leaves and the advisors return
Ah yes, the riots
We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no
That food has spoiled
That is why it was not shipped to the army
Exactly why it should be given away
What
an excellent idea, your Majesty
- Among the guests are Raoul and , a stunningly beautiful young woman
Michelle is awed by the richness all around them, while Raoul sees only her
He holds the ring
Isn't it glorious
Michelle
But just as he starts to speak, trumpets blast and the King steps through the doors and out into the lavish gardens; the party goers give him a rousing ovation
Raoul returns the ring to his jacket, to wait for another moment
Everyone watches the King, who begins guzzling wine and telling jokes to his sycophants, who howl at the King's witticisms
Then Louis catches sight of Raoul and Michelle, and lowers his voice, to his
Who is that
1 Raoul, son of Athos
Not the soldier, you idiot
2 Her name is Michelle
The king is transfixed
' is presiding over a huddle of fresh faced young Musketeers, directing them to their positions around the gardens, like secret service agents protecting a president
He leaves them, and quickly moves to the King
' Your Majesty
What is it, d'Artagnan
Assassins falling from the sky now
The sycophants laugh loudly
' The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me
decided it this morning
' Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that -- am King, d'Artagnan
will change my mind as  wish, and  will enjoy my banquet as  wish
' But  deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous -- Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend  am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers
Let us behave as if my wish is law
And my wish is to enjoy this party
'Artagnan bows sharply as the young sycophants chuckle
'Artagnan retreats, then looks back to Louis and follows his gaze to the tender young beauty who caught his eye
'Artagnan recognizes Raoul, son of his friend Athos
As the guests mix and mingle, Raoul tries again
Michelle,
Ever since  returned 've been wanting to speak with you about
about -- gaunt  interrupts, presenting a tray of delicacies
Monsieur, Mademoiselle
No
Thank you -- Michelle,  -- They are interrupted by the  of a piglet, squirming in the hands of the king's dwarf, who holds the fat little animal above his head and runs among the startled guests
It pleases us to announce an entertainment for our guests contest of agility and cunning
He takes the pig from his dwarf; the pig is clean and perfumed, a colorful fake horn tied onto its head
Behold our unicorn
Whichever of our guests captures the unicorn shall win its treasure
With this announcement the King produces a diamond the size of a pecan, suspended from a ribbon; the guests gasp at its richness
The King ties the diamond around the pig's neck
Michelle is amazed at this
have never seen a diamond so large
It almost makes Raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in his hand
Into the maze
All of you
Disperse,  command you
The dwarf releases the pig, poking him through a tiny break in the hedge; the critter skitters as only a pig can, eluding the first laughing lunges of the guests
is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle of confusion
climbs to a platform above the top of the ten foot hedge that forms the maze
From his perch he looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement
Are you men or mice
squeals as the pig scurries by and Raoul dives for it
He almost has the pig
then it kicks free
The pendant will be yours
With that he races after the pig
tries to follow, this way, that way, through the maze
Then she stops, face to face with the King, entering through a gate hidden in one of the maze's dead corners
Michelle, isn't it
Speechless, she nods
would have said it was impossible, but  believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful
Sire,  -- You blush
You do not wish to be beautiful to your King
Her eyes go still; she understands what is happening
, we see d'Artagnan, watching as Louis tries to seduce the young woman
Even as d'Artagnan watches, the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement d'Artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the sureness of the farm boy he once was
The pig is quiet and comfortable in d'Artagnan's hands
'Artagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle, and she allows him to touch her cheek
The king leans to kiss her
Michelle does not move
The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground running, right at Louis' feet; it sets him dancing
The spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the pig scrambles away, Michelle backs away
Wait
Michelle,  -- Too late, he sees the shadow of the man looming above him, leaping down onto him from the observation platform
It is the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle; he has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat
The king is helpless, frozen
The assassin leaps, falling toward the king
and is impaled on the sword of d'Artagnan, springing through the gate to save his king
Michelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops, mortally wounded
They stare down at him now; the would-be assassin gurgles words through his agony
Feed
your
people
Party guests, having heard Michelle scream, are running in to find them
Michelle rushes off, to find Raoul; several people are coming up
Your people starve
Feed -- The king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the throat of the dying man, to stop these offensive words
The king looks at his stunned subjects
pitiful madman, nothing more
Come, let us continue our chase
Where is our unicorn
The King prances away
It takes the guests a moment, but they know that only gaiety will please their King, and off they go again, laughing as if nothing happened
'Artagnan stands still as the young Musketeers under his command come rushing up with swords drawn
Captain
Seeing the dead assassin, their eyes fill with admiration
You are the best -- 'Artagnan can't even listen; with a last glance at the King he turns quickly and walks away
The Man in the Iron Mask sits on the floor
key rattles in the lock and his keeper shuffles in, carrying food
Food, moron
Thank you, Keeper
Not watching what he's doing, the bulbous keeper trips on something and stumbles, dropping the food
The prisoner jumps to his feet, concerned
Look what you've done
He picks up the tray and slings it at the prisoner
'm sorry, Keeper
The keeper looks for what he tripped on -- a worn Bible
He snatches it up and grabs a hunk of pages from its middle
No, Keeper, it's my only book
Hearing the pleading in the prisoner's voice, the keeper looks squarely at him -- and rips out the pages
What number did you tear out
Eh
What number, on the first page
Two-thirty-seven
Two-thirty-seven:  "
And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah
" As the prisoner rattles off the names of Biblical genealogy, the jailer gawks at the pages in his hand
You've
memorized
What was the end page
As the keeper is speechless, the prisoner looks for himself
Six-two-one:  "
Though  speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not love,  am but a clanging cymbal or --" The Keeper staggers in shock; the prisoner bubbles with joy
We're playing, Keeper
game
Take another page, any page
Keeper and  are playing a game
And the prisoner takes the keeper's fat hands in his own and begins to dance and sing
game, a game, we're playing a -- The keeper's left arm goes rigid, and he clutches his chest with his right hand; he drops upon the stone floor
Keeper
The prisoner approaches the jailer; the man is stoned dead
No
No
Keeper, please, you cannot die
You're my only friend
The prisoner tries to wipe his eyes, but he can't get at them, inside the mask
He edges to the open door
Help
Someone
Keeper is dead
He slumps down beside the open door, and weeps
- ''  - 'Artagnan's room is spartan:  a cot, and weapons laid on a plain table
It has a single small window, and d'Artagnan stands at it now, looking out into the Palace garden below
The guests have all gone home; the party pavilions have been cleared away
And now in the blue dusk, a solitary lady walks
She is Anne of Austria, the Queen Mother, the lady we saw in the opening
Now, twenty years later, she is a slim frail figure
Her clothes are drab and simple, like the dress of mourning; she walks in silence, watched at a distance by nun attendants
She glances up, and sees d'Artagnan's form in the window
When he sees her looking, he pulls away from the window
- 'Artagnan's room is along the same corridor as the Royal Apartments
'Artagnan sits at the small table, going over paperwork
Through his open door he sees that Anne and her attendants are filing along in the corridor, and he rivets his eyes back to his work
Anne reaches the door to her apartment, and looks back to where d'Artagnan's door is open
'' The Queen Mother's  appears at d'Artagnan's door
She wishes a word with you
'Artagnan approaches the Queen Mother, and bows
' 'lady
understand you saved my son's life today
' God smiled upon us
And you were not hurt
' No, 'lady
That is good
Without a change of expression on her still beautiful but sad face, she enters her room
''  - 'Artagnan returns to his room, just as a young  of Musketeers (Andre) arrives with two of the Royal Guards
Duty lists of the day, Captain
' Thank you, Andre
They hand him the list and salute again, to leave
' Wait
There is an entry here -- "Messenger sent by King to residence of Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort
" Why was that
The young Musketeers try not to smirk
Well, Captain
'  - Athos sits alone, playing a haunting melody on a violin
It is a sad tune, played with feeling; he stops as he hears a at his door, and opens it to -- 'Artagnan
' Athos, my friend
They embrace with deep affection -- friends who have shared each other's darkest times
' It's been too long
Life is too long
Except when we have our friends
Look at you
You're still a boy
Sit, sit
'll open a bottle of wine
'Artagnan takes one of the wooden chairs, by the meager fire
The whole place is modest at best
' Thanks, but not for me
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months
' have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it
Midnight
Mon dieu
Driving the youngsters hard, eh
' They must stay sharp
There was an attempt on the King's life today
Another
How many times have you saved his life in this year alone
Three
Four
' heard your playing
was feeling sorry for myself
Raoul is getting married, he proposed today
love that boy beyond all measure, 've spent everything  own to give him education and opportunity
Now he has complete happiness, and  mope
cloud passes d'Artagnan's face; he has something to tell Athos
' Athos
But whatever it is that d'Artagnan wants to say is interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs
As Athos' face brightened with the arrival of d'Artagnan, now it glows as he jumps up to welcome his son
That must be Raoul
Raoul
Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit
What's wrong
You look awful
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace
Athos is stunned; d'Artagnan witnesses this with agony
But -- are you sure
We were at her door
was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother
Michelle cannot possibly accept
She cannot possibly refuse
Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do
And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet
Piglet --
What are you --
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now
She loved me once
want to die remembering that
Die
What
have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge
Fromberge
At the front
No
It is already done
have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you
Raoul, no
You cannot do this
No matter how your heart is broken -- But Raoul stops him, with an embrace
Goodbye, father
am sorry
Raoul -- Raoul breaks away, and runs from the room
Athos, so joyful moments before, holds his head as if his brain might erupt
This cannot be
Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king
' If the young woman truly loves Raoul -- She's a woman, d'Artagnan
From a poor family
You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but  am old and hard and 've seen too much
Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love
'Artagnan is silent, and even ashamed
Athos realizes -- You knew this was happening
You knew and that's why you came
' fear  know our King
came to try to bring you hope
What hope is there
wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that
Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul -- ' have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting
Raoul is everything to me
' know
Oh my friend
Athos grips d'Artagnan in gratitude and desperate hope
' will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused
You trust his character more than anyone else does
' Raoul is hurrying to the front, so must hurry too
Save my son, d'Artagnan
They embrace once more, and d'Artagnan leaves
- Magnificent public buildings -- palaces and cathedrals -- grace the city's skyline, but here in central Paris all is squalor
On a narrow, filthy street, beggars bother the sullen city peasants who are weak with hunger themselves
But interest perks up when two soldiers drive up in a wagon, and one of them, Lieutenant Andre, announces -- Here is food, the gift of your loving King, on his birthday
He gives to himself by giving to you, in that he loves you so much
Slowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward
As the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs -- bread, cabbages, tomatoes, eggs -- those nearest the wagon begin to jostle each other, and a large crowd gathers quickly
No need to fight, there is plenty for all
It's looking like a holiday celebration
until a breaks open a loaf of bread, and wrinkles his nose
This stuff stinks
It is rotting
The King gives us rotten food
He hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers
Other paupers sniff the food, and its stink set off an explosion of anger: they throw food at the soldiers
Then a paving stone crashes through a shop window, and suddenly it's a riot, with the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the streets in the direction of the palace
', riding toward the palace himself, turns a corner and sees the mob coming
And they see him:  the elegant, dashing Musketeer on the prancing stallion
And at that moment, two more soldiers race out of a side street, fleeing a similar mob, coming from another direction
'Artagnan understands everything at a glance; the second pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic
Back, toward the palace
We cannot hold them off
We will fire a volley into them
' No
Run to the palace and close the gates
But do not fire
The two new soldiers race away; d'Artagnan waits calmly on his horse, as the mobs from both directions converge on him
, seeing the dashing Musketeer wait so confidently for them, slow up; but the ruffian urges them on
Come on
To the palace
'Artagnan sits calmly in their way
He doesn't even draw his sword, though members of the mob grab the reins of his horse
Some of the mob recognize him, and murmur
It's d'Artagnan
Le Generale de Musketeers
The mob hesitates -- for the name d'Artagnan means heroism and patriotism to all of them
One Musketeer can't stop us
' Stop you
You are Frenchmen, are you not
am one of you
The King is a Frenchman, but he is not one of us
' Citizens of Paris
Give ear to me
We'll give you their ears
With that he draws a dagger from his filthy shirt and puts it to the ear of the young Lieutenant who is already bloody from being dragged through the street
' Wait -- and listen
beg you
They give us garbage, not fit for rats
They think we are garbage
With that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at d'Artagnan, who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement, he cuts the vegetable from the air
The display of expertise is startling
Someone else throws a head of lettuce; d'Artagnan slices it in half, and as the pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword
' 'm on my way to a salad
Doesn't anybody have any endive
The mob laughs at this panache, and the amazing display of swordsmanship that lies behind it
Someone tosses more lettuce, and d'Artagnan divides and skewers this one as well
This time the crowd applauds
' tomato
Can he do it
Someone fires a tomato right at his head, and sure enough d'Artagnan spears it
Then, with a victorious flourish, he takes a bite of it
His face contorts with the taste, and he spits the pieces out; the crowd is hushed
' You are right
It is rotten will speak to the King myself
You have my word
The mob is completely won over by d'Artagnan; the ruffian, angry that his riot is fizzling, raises his knife again over the soldiers, but now the point of d'Artagnan's sword flicks to the ruffian's neck
' And you will release those men -- for they serve France
and you
Three cheers for d'Artagnan
Hurrah
Hurrah
The soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart now stand and look at d'Artagnan in gratitude and awe
The mob has forgotten them; they see only d'Artagnan as he rakes his blade clean, returns it to its scabbard, reins his horse around, and slowly rides away, escorting the soldiers back toward the palace
- 'Artagnan strides into the long hallway leading to the royal apartments
As he reaches the door to the king's rooms, he finds a knot of royal advisors -- among them Pierre and Claude -- gathered outside the king's door
We already know about the riots
' Does he know
We will tell him, when it is
Convenient
Blocked by the advisors, d'Artagnan leaves them, turning down one hallway, and then another; he reaches the Hall of Mirrors and touches the golden frame of one mirror at its corner; the mirror becomes a door, revealing a secret passage within the walls
'Artagnan steps through and the portal closes again, leaving no trace of its existence
-  - Within a bed whose tapestried posts stretch to the sixteen foot ceiling, the king is making love; the   lying beneath him is doing her best to sound sincere
Oh yes
So good
Ooo, wonderful, Marvelous
Fan-tas -- Louis climaxes with a grunt
She tries to sound pleased
Oh, Louis, that was incredible
It was better than ever before
It -- 'm hungry
He hops up, throwing on a silk robe embroidered in gold
will have food brought
like to eat alone
He moves to what appears to be a wardrobe, standing against the far wall, and opens its door, revealing a secret staircase hidden within the thick walls of the palace
By the way, you'll be moving tomorrow
Leaving the girl without another word, he moves down the concealed stairs
'  - Louis reaches the bottom of the stairs, disguised behind a similar wardrobe in his own bedroom
He steps out -- and is startled as the lifesize portrait of Louis  on the other side of the room opens to admit d'Artagnan
Aaa
'Artagnan
These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death
' It is for your security that  have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor
already know about the riots, d'Artagnan,  heard them out there whispering
Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food will deal with it tomorrow
' Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature
personal nature
' Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort
She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations
The King begins to eat from the food laid out on the table
Betrothed
think not
' In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers
She had written him many letters of love
The King pokes at his food
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation
By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here
' Your Majesty has had many women -- That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner
' It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me
It is yours
know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle
But do they love you
Do you love them
What about a queen to love
son of your own
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan
But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me
' There is more to love than he knew, or that you know
You dare criticize my father
Or lecture me
' Not criticize -- plead
Love
Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry
Love women, and they will love you
Love yourself, and -- That is enough
You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place
' At least help Raoul
Silence
order you
' Order Fromberge to keep him in safety
It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor
will consider it
Now leave me
' Thank you, your Majesty
'Artagnan bows, steps to the lifesize portrait of Louis , touches a hidden button on its frame and moves into the secret passage the painting reveals as it swings open
: '
He is sweating, exceptionally pale, as he tries to project his voice past a huge lump in his throat
And  only say that
the rotten food was
all my fault
and  take
full responsibility
and beg the forgiveness of you all
He steps back, having accomplished something terrifically difficult, and glances toward who steps to his advisor and shakes his hand, whispering quietly
Well done, Pierre
It will be good for your soul, that you have taken responsibility for your errors
And don't worry,  will look after your family
Pierre can only nod
He takes two steps, kneels, crosses himself, and places his head between two upright rails of The King, Pierre, and other attendants are standing on a platform before a crowd of Parisians
The blade drops, Pierre's head hits the basket, the crowd cheers
The King raises his hands to quiet the crowd
Do not rejoice -- but know that your King does not tolerate blunders that hurt his beloved people
More food is on its way, and my advisors tell me the new harvests are sure to be bountiful
He shoots a glance at his advisors, and they are pale from the display they've just witnessed
And  have new joys to announce to you
Today we decree a fresh glory for Paris, and for all of France
The laying of the foundations to expand Versailles, and make it truly a palace of the sun
The advisors all applaud furiously, but from the crowd there is almost no reaction at all; the triple ranks of soldiers surrounding the square discourage any protest, and as the King leaves the platform the crowd begins to melt away
Aramis, watching the crowd disperse, hears behind him -- Aramis
Aramis turns to see the King, who moves up alone
Your Majesty
How goes that favor  asked of you
grow closer to my target, your Majesty
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own
The King moves away, followed by his fawning advisors
'   - young Musketeer ushers Michelle into the palace bedroom previously occupied by the King's last mistress
The Musketeer leaves her alone, frozen in the center of the room, awed by the opulence
Her eyes play over the details: -- The handcarved, richly upholstered furniture, beneath her fingertips
-- The carved figures of cherubic angels, gleaming with gold, upon the posts of the bed
-- The murals on the walls and ceiling
Her reverie is interrupted by a  who bustles in carrying a magnificent dress
After your bath put on this, it is the King's favorite color
That letter on the desk came here for you this morning
She tosses the dress onto the bed and is gone
Left alone, Michelle lifts the letter, and recognizes the writing
Raoul
She opens the letter and reads quickly
The army
Oh Raoul, don't despair
will always be faithful
She interrupts herself as her eyes fall on the gorgeous dress
She looks around at the sumptuous palace apartment, and gazes again at the murals painted above the bed
They depict naked gods and goddesses, in Olympian orgies
: -  , The Handmaiden has prepared a 17th Century bathtub for Michelle, and now retires
If you need me further, just ring
As the handmaiden leaves, exiting frame, we   on one of the murals on the wall
The eye of one of the figures there is no longer the painted eye it was before, but is a real human eye, disguised by the mural
, is spying on Michelle
' as Michelle undresses and steps into the bath
Louis catches tantalizing glimpses of her richly sensual body in the soapy water, and it stokes his desire
- '   - Michelle stands before the mirror, staring at herself, breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress
She stares for a long time, surprised at her own beauty
She reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out, blotting it around her neck, perfuming herself with its fragrance
She looks into the mirror, at her eyes
In guilt for what she is already feeling, she lifts Raoul's letter to read it again
Then she gasps -- the King stands right before her
Sire
-- How did you -- How did  get in
You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets
What is that
Nothing
letter
May  see
He takes the letter; she has no resistance against him
The King reads, his eyes hardening suddenly; but then he smiles
From Raoul
He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger
from your king
Raoul
is in love
Enough of this, our dinner waits
Tossing the letter aside, he offers her his arm
She takes it and allows him to escort her from the room
- The hall is alive with glorious light, fiery gold frames surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections
Musicians line the length of the hall, and when Louis and Michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the couple as they parade past
Michelle is speechless, as Louis smiles at her awed innocence
- Louis leads Michelle into a towering room surrounding a magnificent table, decked out with candelabra and sumptuous delicacies -- set for just two
Louis and Michelle sit opposite each other, attended by a dozen servants
Michelle stares at her plate
The food doesn't please you
It's lovely
It's just
This is more than you are used to
Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead
You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption
Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things
we are humble people
Wait, no
Do not be ashamed
The straits of your family need not be permanent
It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them
You would do that, your Majesty
My dear, 've already done it
She rushes to him and throws herself at his knees, weeping in gratitude
Louis smiles, as if embarrassed
Please, darling, that isn't necessary
We are friends now
Mademoiselle needs wine
servant quickly approaches with wine; the goblet at Michelle's place is quite large, and he pours it full
'  - Louis leads Michelle back to her room; she's a bit unsteady from the wine; but she grows alert as she notices him closing the door behind her
He stares into her eyes
You are beautiful
You know you are
Sire,  -- If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin
Where was it
Here
He touches his lips to her throat
She gasps, but then pulls away
She glances at the letter on the writing table
What is it
Raoul
If he really loved you, he would have proposed marriage
He didn't, did he
He sees her hesitation and uncertainty
He's smooth, gentle
You have never known love until you have known the love of a king
He kisses her; for a moment she seems frozen
and then she yields
Never having doubted that she would
Louis pulls the gown from her shoulders
She doesn't resist
The old Jailer, carrying a torch that barely pushes back the darkness, leads another guard up the winding stairs
It's a jolt at first, so brace yourself
The Man in the Iron Mask lifts his head as a key rattles into his door
The door opens, admitting his old Jailer, and a The New Keeper is just a younger version of the old one -- greasy, fat, and cruel
Ugh
He looks 'orrible
The Man in the Iron Mask rises and takes a step forward; the new keeper recoils and raises his club threateningly
Stay back
frighten you
It's okay
Keeper was scared of me too, at first
Scared
The New Keeper steps forward and clubs the Man in the Iron Mask in the shoulder, then kicks him as he falls
Scared of you
Not me
'll kill him if he gets near me
The New Keeper strides out
The Man in the Iron Mask pulls himself to his knees; his eyes, visible through the slits of the mask, look sadly at the old Jailer
miss Keeper
miss him so much
Moron
The jailer leaves the cell, locking the door behind him
Raoul has just received orders from General Fromberge, who sits at a map table, Raoul salutes and follows a young staff officer from the tent
As Raoul leaves, the General withdraws from his leather field pouch a royal letter -- parchment, with blue and gold seals
Fromberge touches the edge of the parchment to the candle, and burns the letter
- Two men move along a deep trench, the siege works of 17th century siege warfare
One of the men is Raoul, carrying a musket; in his new uniform he looks out of place among the dirty, battle weary men they pass
He is following the who is no older than himself, but whose eyes are already dead, while Raoul's are wide and wild
The trench is deep as a grave; by crouching, both men keep their heads below the surrounding ground
Thick smoke rolls over their heads; we can't tell if it is day or night
From all around come sounds of battle, with the sporadic fire of muskets and the rumble of cannons; officers shout orders in the distance; wounded men nearby whimper for water and the officer leads Raoul by them as if they did not exist
The young Staff Officer stops at a bend in the trench
Here
Without another word he goes back the way he came
Raoul grips his musket and looks around him; he finds himself among several dozen stark eyed men manning the forward curve of the trench
He has little time to wonder what will happen next
horn trumpets close by, and with a shout, the French soldiers clamber out of their breastworks
For an instant, Raoul hesitates in pure terror, then joins the charge with a shout of his own -- Mi-cheeelllll
-- On the stone wall looming above the French soldiers, orange blossoms of fire -- the muzzle flash of primitive cannons -- penetrate the smoke, and the ground at Raoul's feet explodes, hurling him backwards
He covered barely a few feet, and falls almost exactly where he started
Dead
: -    '  - gloved hand raps on the door
Athos opens it to a military messenger, who shoves at him a single sheet of paper, rolled and tied with ribbon
'  - The message slams onto the table as Athos staggers upon it, his legs buckling beneath him in shock and grief
''  - 'Artagnan is working at his desk, as the Lieutenant enters
Sir
a casualty report came
'Artagnan looks at the paper the Lieutenant hands him
' No, no, no
He sags for a moment, then grabs his cloak and sword
/
'     - The Musketeer's Gate is close to the stables where the Musketeers train and keep their horses
'Artagnan hurries from the Palace and snaps an order
' Saddle my horse
The grooms jump to work; several young Musketeers nearby stop their training, noticing their Captain's agitation
' Hurry -- But then d'Artagnan sees Athos coming, riding furiously through the Musketeers' gate
'Artagnan steps out to meet him as Athos reins in his horse and jumps from the saddle
' Athos, my friend -- Athos marches to the palace door; d'Artagnan cuts him off
' Athos, please
Get out of my way
' (grabbing him) Athos,  beg you -- Athos punches d'Artagnan with furious strength, knocking him aside
The young Musketeers reach for their weapons, but d'Artagnan is up quickly, throwing himself in front of Athos again, blocking the doorway into the palace
' Where are you going
To kill the king
At this, the swords of the young Musketeers sing from their scabbards
Athos wears a sword, but he has not drawn it
' Athos
know life means nothing to you at this moment, but  will not let you kill yourself
The King killed my son
' The cannons killed Raoul
The cannons, and love
But not the King
steps up
'll kill the old man for you, Captain, if you don't wish to -- Athos spins, striking like a rattlesnake, his sword whipping from its scabbard and slicing off the arrogant young Musketeer's ear
He flicks another's sword from his grasp, then brings the the point of his own blade up beneath the chin of a third, shoving him back
Come on
All of you
'Artagnan tackles Athos from behind and pins him face down to the hay
For a moment Athos bellows in rage -- Coward
Fight me
Fight me
Emotion spills up into Athos' throat, and he begins to sob
He killed my son, d'Artagnan
He killed my son
'Artagnan, dying inside, still grips Athos
Athos grows quiet, and the young Musketeers drift closer
' Get back, all of you
'Artagnan stands, and Athos rises, still holding his sword
He looks at d'Artagnan a long beat, then sheathes his sword and turns to his horse
The young soldiers move to him
' Let him go
Athos mounts his horse, and with a last glance back at d'Artagnan, he gallops away
'  - The King has just climaxed in his lovemaking, and lies spent upon Michelle
His rest is interrupted by a  at his door
The King scowls
What
Your Majesty
it is Andre
Louis groans, and pulls on a robe
Michelle whispers -- Shall  leave
No, you may wait behind the screen
Michelle rises and slips behind a painted dressing screen as Louis goes to the door and admits the young Lieutenant
, Michelle lifts a jeweled hand mirror and appraises her face; she begins brushing her long hair
She can hear the conversation
would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed -- Yes, yes, go on
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate
Behind the screen, Michelle pauses at the mention of Athos
Did they kill him
No
He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt
Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave
Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front
From behind the screen comes the sound of the mirror, shattering as it drops to the floor
It startles the Lieutenant, but the King goes on
Who was Athos seeking
Tell me
Did he try to enter the palace
He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way
You may go, Lieutenant
The Lieutenant moves back to the door
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty
Not by you
will order d'Artagnan to do it
The Lieutenant leaves, and Louis moves behind the screen to see Michelle stagger and grip the dressing table; her bare feet step onto the broken glass of the mirror, yet she is oblivious to the cuts
Louis sees this and grabs her
My dear
The glass --
He pulls her to the couch and draws a blanket about her, cuddling her as she begins to shake
Did you know
about Raoul
did not want to upset you
It was tragic
did everything  could for him
ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting
But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger
He cuddles her as she weeps
will order a Mass for his soul
It will guarantee his place in Heaven
Oh Louis, Louis
She clings to him in her grief
- The great cathedral rises next to the monastery where Aramis resides
We   and   on the cobblestones between the two structures, as if penetrating to -- Aramis leads Porthos through tunnels, twisting, descending
Aramis
is this the way to hell
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip
They reach an iron door and move through it, into , Candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes
The place is breathtaking
Where are we
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane
If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river
Porthos notices niches in the walls; he looks closely and sees the face of a corpse, enclosed behind glass
Mother of God
It is also a place of burial
tomb
We're in a tomb
Catacombs
Very holy
Porthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment -- then jumps out of his skin as the door opens
Yaaaahhh
hooded figure, looking like the Grim Reaper, enters
Relax, you big fool, it's d'Artagnan
And sure enough the hooded figure, whom we now see has been led in by a little monk, is d'Artagnan
Aramis nods to the monk, who leaves quickly
Before d'Artagnan can ask anything, Porthos jumps again; the back door has opened, and monks usher in Athos, who freezes as he sees d'Artagnan
It's all right
'Artagnan was the one who warned us that he'd been given an order for your arrest
Here you have sanctuary -- does he not, d'Artagnan
The escort monks disappear, closing the chapel door so that the four Musketeers are left to sit at a small table the monks have set up, Athos and 'Artagnan opposite each other
Look at us
We are old men now
But once we were young
And when we saw injustice, we fought it
' We have grown wiser with age
Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword
And some problems cannot be settled without one
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him
As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both
He has already picked the Pope
Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King
So they tell us
But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression
When no conscience is tolerated
No dissent, no objection
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be
Easy to say, but hard to do
For what  am trying to tell you is that am the Governor General of Jesuits in France
stunned silence
What do you propose to do
Replace the king
' cannot hear this
It can't be done
It can
know the way
am with you
' No
Stop -- will need you all
All for one
One for all
' (jumping up) You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king
have sworn to him
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor
' An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan
know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty
He is a monster
He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame
He has no honor
' No man is all bad
or all good believe --  must believe -- that Louis can learn
And perhaps  can help him
Athos leaps up from the table, and glares at d'Artagnan
Whatever the plan
am in it
The next time we meet, one of us will die
He storms out of the rear door of the chapel
Porthos, see to Athos, won't you
Porthos follows Athos; Aramis and d'Artagnan are left alone
have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan
But even if  were not a priest,  could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone
' The secret  carry  cannot share
Not even with God
'Artagnan moves to the door
' cannot betray Louis
will defend him with my life
know
God go with you
'Artagnan leaves Aramis alone in the secret chapel
- Aramis leads Athos and Porthos out of the catacombs
This way
They move into a moonlit courtyard of the monastery hooded Jesuit standing guard steps from the shadows, then recognizes Aramis and admits the trio to the monastery's forge, where more hooded Jesuits are working in secret, heating iron red hot in the bellows furnace
What are they doing
Making the key to the throne
They are very large keys
One of the blacksmiths uses tongs to remove something red from the fire; he hammers it in a shower of sparks and plunges it into water
Aramis pulls the result from the water and shows it to Athos and Porthos
It is an iron mask
-   - The carriage rolls through the long sweep of the French countryside, traveling fast
- The three Musketeers -- Aramis, Athos, and Porthos -- have been traveling for some time
Porthos is asleep, snoring
Porthos sleeps, and you plot
Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting
Soon enough
Here we are
Kicking Porthos' feet to wake him, Aramis opens the carriage door, and they step out
- Lying just off the coast is the forbidden island, where the imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore
The Prison of Belle Sur
Come, we have a boat waiting
As hooded Jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them, Athos and Porthos glance at each other; Porthos shrugs
- The guides lead the Musketeers down a hilly path to a long boat, hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast
Sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priest's garb; at his feet is a long narrow bundle, about the size of a mummy, with a rope tied at either end
The guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf
Aramis throws off his cape, and strips down almost naked
He's still fit and hard
With the guides helping him, he lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist
What is that
body
see that is a body
But where did you get it
Aramis ignores the question, and the guides dress him in priest's garb
With the robes spreading over the big bundle added artfully to Aramis' waist, it appears he is a very fat priest; the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds to the illusion of Aramis as a wild, reclusive monk
The sun is beginning to come up over the mountains
He gets one day of confession each year
Today is the day
Who does
Best not to ask
Shouldn't even talk about it
Aramis steps onto the boat
The little priest who first joined them gets in too, along with a couple of rowers
What do we do now
don't know about you, but  plan to wait here
The rowers pull the boat toward the fortress prison
- The pink light of the new day barely penetrates the gloom of the prison
The boat carrying Aramis and the little priest reaches the gate of the prison, which reaches to the water line
As Aramis steps out,  meet them
Who is this, then
The little priest remains in the boat, slumped over
One speaks to the little priest in Italian, and the little priest seems barely able to left his head; Aramis answers for him, in Italian, and the guard translates -- He says he's the replacement
Aramis rattles off more Italian
He says it is only one day a month when the prisoner gets confession, and the little one is too sick to move
The big one doesn't speak French either
Then let's get it done
The head guard gestures to let them pass
The prisoner has used the torn Bible to make all sorts of amazing origami, invented from his own head
He looks up as he hears the door open, and sees Aramis, the priest
My confession day
But where is the other one
Aramis says something in Latin -- the first words of the ceremony of absolution -- as the guards lock the door behind him and move off down the corridor
know you don't speak my language -- but is the other one all right
Please tell me he is not dead too, or  will have lost everyone
Aramis goes on mumbling Latin mechanically, for the sake of the retreating guards
The Man in the Iron Mask is desperate for someone to talk to
tore my Bible
Or someone else did
But it was all right
"Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in Thy sight, Oh Lord our God and My Redeemer
" Aramis has stopped talking, and stares transfixed at this sight of the prisoner, in the iron mask
'm sorry
You're never seen me before
must frighten you
Aramis puts his finger to his lips
What are you doing
Why do you -- Aramis clamps his hand over the mouth hole, and whispers -- am a friend, here to help you
Aramis hurriedly removes his robes, revealing the bundle
What --
It is an escape
To freedom
Freedom
He says it as if the concept is beyond him
Aramis undoes the bundle, revealing the limp body
Wh--
He is dead
Who is he
He is you
Aramis uncovers the head of the body
It is covered in a mask, identical to the prisoner's
- The Guards are sharing a bottle of wine, when they hear -- Hey
Hey
What now
The guards enter to find the Man in the Iron Mask slumped on the floor
Aramis, looking like the fat priest again, stands over him spouting Italian, as one  translates -- He says he just fell stone dead as he was reading him the Mass
never thought the bugger would last this long
But how could he just keel over and -- Aramis rattles off more Italian, and suddenly the guard who understands it stops examining the body and backs off
He says the prisoner has the fever, just like the little priest does
Plague
They brought plague in here
Get him out of here
Now
Aramis rattles off a protest in Italian
No, no last rites
Get away
- Aramis climbs into the boat; as he sits down his belly stirs, but the guards don't see it -- they are using poles to push the boat away, into the sea
- Athos and Porthos stand as the boat reaches the shore, and tucks in among the rocks
Sheltered from the view from the prison, Aramis steps from the boat and removes his robes
The prisoner dangles, tied wrist and ankle, from around Aramis' neck
My God
Athos, Porthos, and the others gawk at the sight of the Man in the Iron Mask, as Aramis loosens the ropes
As they back away from him, he sees the sky
Endless blue -- and bright
He shields his eyes
It's all right
Take your time
Aramis helps him up, and turn him slowly around, to face
The fortress/prison, in the distance
'     :   vast vista -- the sky, the sea, and the prison on the island in the middle of it all
The prisoner falls to his knees, and weeps
Athos
He needs a gentle hand
Athos moves over hesitantly, and puts his hand on the shoulder of the Man in the Iron Mask, who holds his hands against the mask as if to further hide his shame
- The guards are standing in the cell, looking down at the body now wearing the mask, the man they think was their prisoner
The guards are quiet, alone
1 You ever wonder who he was
2 No
Yes
But  never asked -- and you better not either
They wrap the body, still in its mask, in a weighted sack
- The prison's   stands at the wall of the fortress high above the sea and watches as his guards throw off the body, wrapped in canvas weighted with stones
As the corpse makes a long fall and crashes into the sea, the Warden writes a message on a royal scroll: The Warden seals the scroll and hands it to a messenger
- carriage pulls into a country estate, isolated among vast woodlands silver in the moonlight
Mysterious servants with shielded lanterns converge on the carriage as it stops
- Athos reaches for his sword, but Aramis stops his hand
Jesuits
- Aramis emerges quickly, whispering directives to the Jesuits; Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask from the carriage, his head shrouded by a cloak
Aramis has a blacksmith waiting; almost before he realizes it the Man in the Iron Mask finds his head placed on an anvil; but as the hammer rises he begins to scream
No
Please
What is wrong
We only mean to free you from the mask
But the prisoner is shaking, and Athos understands why
Prison was horrible but it was his home
He's been torn from it by strangers
He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar
Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow
Excellent, Athos
You have a keen sense of this man
His plight is obvious, isn't it
Athos, angry with Aramis' arrogance and insensitivity, leads the Man in the Iron Mask toward the house; then Aramis spots Porthos, looking downcast
And why are you so glum
expected action
There was no killing, no fighting,  was useless
In deep depression, Porthos climbs out and shuffles off
Aramis sighs, shakes his head, and walks to the house
- Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask onto the bed; the eyes behind the slits in the mask are darting, frightened
Are you hungry
Just
water
Athos pours a cupful from the water pitcher on the bed table; but when he tries to help the prisoner drink the liquid spills as the cup bumps the mouth hole
This way
The prisoner manipulates the cup in the way he must to get a drink, then falls back to the pillow
This place
once lived in a country house
had guardians -- an old man and woman
And tutors
But no friends
Then when  was twelve, they came and took me to the prison
Who came
man in black
never saw his face
He took me to the cell blacksmith came and they put me into the mask
For days  shouted, "What have  done
Why do you do this to me
"  But no one heard, so  just stopped shouting
And you never knew why
thought
there is something about my face that men do not want to see
Something that makes them cruel
But then  realized they were cruel even when  was wearing the mask
knew there must be some other reason, but  could not think what it was
What is your name
The old man and woman called me
Phillippe
Phillippe
Rest now
Athos moves to the door
Thank you
for your kindness
Athos nods, pauses a moment
and leaves
- The lock rattles, and the door swings open
'Artagnan enters, lifting a lantern to throw light on the dark room
It is Athos' apartment, the one he visited earlier; now he finds it empty, devoid of clues
He stands there alone
He turns to leave, then glimpses a familiar painting hanging beside the door
Lifting his light he studies the portrait: Athos, Aramis, Porthos and himself -- four Musketeers, beat friends, in their prime
Together then, inseparable
' My friends
Where have you gone
He lowers the lantern, and leaves
: has reached the court
Gloved hands pass the message from one advisor to another, and finally to the King
- '  - The King reads the message, rerolls it, thinks a moment, and hands the scroll to Claude
Take this to my mother
is again passed, this time into the hands of the Queen Mother's eldest nun-attendant, and then into the hands of the Queen Mother herself
The Queen is in her private rooms, and for the first time we see her with her hair down
She accepts the scroll, opens it, and reads
Her eyes fill with pain, grief, guilt
emotions she hides, turning away
'lady
are you
Please, just
go away
''  - 'Artagnan returns from his ride to Athos' place
He looks down at the Queen's door
He checks the clock on the wall; it is a few minutes past nine
He enters his room, moves to the window, and waits there, to catch a glimpse of her
-   - Aramis is digging into a hearty meal, while Porthos only stares at his plate
See
There is plenty of food in the country
But the King keeps it going to the army instead of -- Athos marches in, all business
He is sleeping
Now see here, Aramis, it's time you told us -- He breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to spoon food onto Porthos' plate; her breasts jiggle below his nose, and she gives him a smile
have no appetite for food,  am wasting away
Say goodbye to Porthos, for he is gone
Even women don't interest me now
The girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls, who seem fascinated with the roguish Porthos; their giggles and winks make Porthos even more morose; he tells his friends
tell you a secret
sleep with three women at once, not because my appetite is so great, but because now it take three to excite me
Porthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off; Aramis sighs, having heard all this before
Athos sits down
Who is he, Aramis
Tomorrow
Tonight
Right now
We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth
You are not my priest, Aramis
You would not be, even if  had one
You are bitter, Athos
You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy
He who is not with us is against us
Those are the words of a broken spirit
My spirit is whole
have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and  will never believe he is my enemy
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son
What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others
Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because  am so much smarter than everyone else
They are interrupted by Porthos' bloodcurdling
Porthos
He draws his sword and runs for the outside
- Aramis and Athos rush through the courtyard, surrounded by moonlight and trees, confused about where Porthos is
Then they hear bellowing    from the latrine
Swords drawn, they bang into the latrine, to find Porthos just finishing urinating
Kidney rocks
It hurts when  pee
It hurts when  shit
'm just a fat old fart with nothing to live for any more
'm going to hang myself, as soon as 'm sober
They watch him shuffle toward the main house
-   '  - Anne paces in her room, her hands trembling, her beautiful lips quivering with tortured emotion
With a sudden impulse she bolts from her room, through the outer room where her attendants sit, and into the corridor
'lady
The eldest nun follows her
- Anne rushes through the evening, toward her little chapel in the palace garden; she is a tragic, romantic sight, her long hair flying behind her as she runs
, ' has been standing at his window, for his nightly glimpse of Anne
Now he sees her, not with her retinue of nuns, but running to her chapel, clearly distraught
/
-   - Anne reaches the door, and finds a few nuns and an old priest praying in the little chapel
She staggers forward to the altar
and falls to her knees there
The nuns and the old priest, seeing the Queen Mother so distraught, stand silently and file out, leaving her in solitude
Oh God  -- Forgive me
' 'lady
She whirls to see him; the sight of her face, bursting with emotions she has kept buried, draws him nearer
' What --
No, stay back
Stay back
He freezes in his tracks; she holds her hands out toward him as if warding off a blow
He's desperate to move to her; she sees it on his face
'Artagnan
Her emotions break all her resolve to keep him away; she rushes into his arms
They clutch each other, in an embrace they have denied for many years
They kiss hungrily
' 'lady
if anyone sees, it is death
If  don't kiss you,  die anyway
' can't bear to see you cry
What is wrong
Nothing
Nothing
She draws back; he tries to hold her
But the thoughts of answering that question makes her stiffen
Nothing
This
didn't happen must go back now
And just like that, their moment is gone
- 'Artagnan and Anne move back to the palace in a stiff procession, she walking ahead, he trailing like a proper commoner, several feet behind
- They reach the Queen Mother's room; d'Artagnan reaches to open the door for her, and she keeps her eyes lowered
But before he can let her go, he must whisper
' Anne
know
know that to love you is treason against France
But not to love you
is treason against my heart
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan
With those whispered words hanging in the air, she enters her room
And d'Artagnan moves alone, back to his
'  - The King is trying to make love with Michelle -- but she isn't responding
He stops, exasperated
What is wrong
She says nothing
He tries kissing her again
What is wrong
She begins weeping uncontrollably, and turns from him
Raoul
Oh, Raoul
Listen, my darling
Raoul was a
a good friend
And now he is dead and that is very sad but -- We'll burn in hell
Both of us
The King stands; he's had enough of this
No, my love
You will burn in hell, for your sins
But  will not -- for  am King
My position is ordained by God
He snatches the gold coverlet from her bed to cover his naked body and stalks to his stairway; the embroidered coverlet trails behind him like a regal train in a royal procession
Leaving her weeping, he moves down into
'  - The King angrily stalks around his bedroom, too agitated to sleep
He grabs food from the table by the window, and starts to pop a grape into his mouth when he stops
He sees something out the window; it stops him dead cold
It is a man, standing in the gardens, wearing an iron mask
'Artagnan
Guards
-   '  - The apparition ducks into the shadows
- ''  - 'Artagnan is sitting on his cot thinking of all that has just happened when he hears the king's shouts of alarm
' Help
In an instant d'Artagnan is reacting, snatching up his sword and racing out into the corridor, toward the King's room
- The guards outside the King's room find the door latched from within, and they don't know what to do
'Artagnan, running up, never slows down; he crashes into the doors
'  - The King whirls as the doors explode inward and d'Artagnan barrels through
Out there
Look
Out there
He -- The garden is empty
' just left the garden, it was empty
What did you see
It
was nothing
nightmare, nothing more
Go away,  -- 'Artagnan guides his guards out, but glances back to see the King, ashamed and worried
'Artagnan tells his men -- ' Check the garden
-   '  - An old Jesuit priest slips back into the garden chapel where the nuns have returned to pray
He kneels at a back pew, tucking the iron mask deep within his robes
The young Musketeers who move through the garden glance into the chapel, see only the normal piety, and move on
The old priest crosses himself, bows his head, and smiles
: - ' , They are frightened
As we   we see the Iron Mask, in an
Phillippe is lying on his back, his head resting on an anvil
Athos stands close by, lending support; Aramis and Porthos look on
blacksmith stands over Phillippe
He positions the point of his chisel against the lock of the mask
It takes several ringing hammer blows -- which we experience from a     -- before the lock breaks
Athos, as gently as he can, pries open the iron mask
' is a wretched sight, overgrown with a matted tangle of hair and beard, and with a deathly pallor
Phillippe sits up, lifting his head out of the mask
He looks at the Musketeers, watching them for their reactions
At first they are frozen; then there is recognition, awe
Phillippe sees a cooling bucket beside the forge, and looks down into     , at his
Aramis
Athos
He looks exactly like
exactly like
will answer all your questions
But first soap, water, and a razor
'    - Aramis and Porthos are sitting at the table when Athos ushers in -- , The change in him is remarkable, and his face so identical to the King's that Porthos actually jumps
Phillippe takes a seat opposite Aramis, and looks around, wary, vulnerable
Yes
Identical
Aramis' eyes are aflame as he looks across at Phillippe
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are
Now  must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life
It began on the night when Louis was born
remember that night
'Artagnan was drunk, the only time 've seen him that way
The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos
But  was on duty
We see the shadowy Musketeer we saw in the opening, moving up the dark steps of the palace
We see now it was Aramis
' was summoned to the royal apartments
Arrange a carriage, they told me, and wait by the door of the stables
We see images of that night, as we saw in the opening
' They brought a baby from the back of the palace, into the black carriage had waiting
They had given the driver instructions about where it was, and  was ordered to make the whole journey with the blinds of the carriage drawn
In the flashback we see the young Musketeer Aramis, his face shielded in shadow, handing a living bundle over to someone at one of the back doors of a large country house
' carried that baby into the countryside, to a chateau, like this one
And there  left him
have never forgotten that night, or what  carried
don't understand
What does this have to do with
You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but -- Not just a baby, Porthos
carried the child of the king
The child of the king is
the king
Louis
No, not Louis
Athos, do you understand this
He confuses me -- carried the king's child
The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret
But why
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne
Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins
So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed
You, Phillippe
Phillippe is pale
We   a flashback of Phillippe's early education in the country house
' The old king ordered you be educated and well treated, but your identity kept from you and all those around you
The  moves to the palace, matching the narration -- ' On his death bed, he revealed your existence to Louis and your mother
Your mother had been told by her own priest that you had died at birth
Somehow she blamed herself for ever believing it, and she wished to restore your birthright
But now Louis was king
We see in  Louis wearing his new crown, plotting
' priest, even a Pope, he could kill without hesitation, but he was afraid to kill you, for his whole claim to power rests on the sanctity of royal blood
So he had you hidden in a way that only a monster could devise
know, for it was who took you to prison, and the Iron Mask
Someday  will ask your forgiveness
But not until we have restored to you what is yours
We are in present time again
All eyes are on Phillippe
Restored
We will replace Louis with Phillippe
No one but the King himself -- and now we -- knows Phillippe even exists
All we have to do is switch them
Switch
That is your plan
It is ludicrous
have it all worked out
Physical resemblance is but one small thing
Louis has an arrogance, a manner -- Those can be adopted -- And people close to him, who -- Do you think  have not considered that
have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours
It is Phillippe's as well
Yes, and he has a choice
Aramis stops thundering at Athos, and turns to Phillippe
What about it, Phillippe
All that time in prison, all that time you suffered, was it for nothing
You memorized the entire Bible, or so your priest told me
An act of survival, of defiance, of courage
Your years within the mask have given you reserves of strength that others could not imagine
Your home was a dungeon and now you may be a king, if you have the heart to make it so
Do you have the heart
Phillippe stands shakily, and faces them
will try
Phillippe walks -- nearly wanders -- from the room
You see
king
Athos, with a glare at Aramis, follows Phillippe
- The gardens are sun drenched, bursting with the beauty of a French summer
Athos finds Phillippe there, sitting alone
Recent hours have been a shock
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine
When tutors answered every question except those about who was
When  was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been,  knew there was something different about me
But a king
Phillippe
there is something hope you understand
Terrible cruelty has been used against you
And
you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it
There is
wrath
in me
have learned to hide it
Those years in the cell,  dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened
Now  am free
And with each free breath  feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all  lost
Look at this, all this that for ten years could not see
What if  become a king -- a king no different from my brother
The desire for vengeance
can be a poison
What is its antidote
suppose
it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it
Phillippe reaches to a flower, plucks it, and smells it
He looks around at the beauty of the garden, taking it all in
Athos looks around too; then Athos realizes Phillippe is no longer looking at the garden, but at him
You look so sad
Is it something have done
It is something  have done -- or did not do
What is that
did not share beauty with someone
who is no longer here for me to share beauty with
Before Phillippe can pursue this, Athos turns businesslike
We have much to do, we'd best get started
Now suppose you were to walk into a garden, as a king
- Aramis is having dinner; he calls toward the kitchen
More wine
Athos enters and sags into a chair, his energy spent
How is he
Resting, he's had a long day
Aramis -- (calling out) More wine
You must reconsider this plan
Phillippe is like a child, he -- You can do it
In a year, maybe two,  could teach him enough to -- Three days
Three days
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball
It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one
At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then
Remember France
Remember the poor
Remember Raoul
More wine
Where are those serving girls
- As Aramis and Athos are downstairs arguing, we   to the window of a candlelit bedroom
- We  from the window to the bed
where Porthos is making love -- or trying to
We see his huge, bare, broad back, blotting out all view of his partner
He grunts, then roles over in despair -- revealing not one but three serving girls lying beneath him, jammed side-by-side like firewood, all nearly smothered by Porthos' bulk
It's no use
My sword is bent
It'll be all right
You're just taking a while to get started
No, it's dead
am useless
Porthos heaves himself out of bed
- While Aramis and Athos are visible through the window, arguing and gesturing, Porthos -- still naked -- walks across the moonlit courtyard, to the barn
- Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil -- You grow fond of him
That's good
Don't play God with me, Aramis  -- Athos interrupts himself as he glimpses the naked Porthos moving across the courtyard toward the barn
Go on
But -- what is Porthos doing
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears
We  Porthos in the barn with Aramis and Athos in the house
Porthos, alone within the barn, finds a thick plow rope and fashions a noose
Now
You were saying
But -- what is he doing
About to hang himself,  should think
Porthos throws one end of the rope over the central beam of the barn, and ties the other end off
He shoves a milking stool up below the noose, climbs onto it, and fits the noose around his neck
: When we see him in full view it is only from behind -- and this angle is a sight to behold
Aramis' detachment only aggravates Athos' excitement
Hang himself
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months
We must stop him
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity
But -- but -- Athos jumps up and makes for the door -- but Aramis' hooded helpers, at a signal from Aramis, bar his way
Porthos, grave with drama, utters his last words
'dieu, cruel life
Farewell to useless Porthos
He steps off the stool
His great weight drops
The rope snaps taught
The beam it is tied to snaps like a twig -- right in the place where it has been sawn nearly in half already
Porthos falls unencumbered and slams butt first into the floorboards of the barn, cracking them
can hear the crack from where they're sitting
sawed the main beam in half
The chain reaction has just begun
The broken floorboards buckle, and the barn's walls, deprived of their central support, fall in on each other
Athos and Aramis watch wide-eyed as the whole barn completely collapses around the unfortunate Porthos
Athos gives Aramis a look
'm a genius -- not an engineer
They jump up and run out
The commotion draws others too -- especially the three wenches Porthos had been trying to bed
It's a tangle of debris -- and from the size and weight of the pile, it looks as if no one could live through the collapse
For a moment the whole pile lies silent; then suddenly it bursts apart and Porthos emerges, exploding with anger
Aramis
You did this, didn't you
You knew  would try hanging myself, and you sawed the beam
Admit it
Admit it, by God
Porthos' eyes are bulging; he's terrifying in his fury
And he holds one of the broken barn's timbers like a giant club, ready to bash in Aramis' brains
Aramis is totally casual
Well of course  knew it, Porthos
Porthos stands there, blinking
You've been moping for months
Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me
Now get some rest
Well
Well
Okay
Porthos starts back toward the house
Then one of the serving girls, heading back inside, sees in one of the upper windows -- the face in the Iron Mask
She  -- Phillippe shies back from the window now, but it's too late, everyone has seen him
Aramis, with cold intellectual curiosity, quietly observes the women's reaction, even as his hooded helpers scurry from the shadows to calm the frightened locals
Poor Phillippe
The mask is terrifying
especially when unexpected
Do you notice
All  noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal
Athos hurries in; Aramis looks at Porthos
See, Porthos -- secrets are hard to keep
We don't have much time
'  - Athos enters to find Phillippe in a corner of the bedroom, slumped and ashamed in the darkness, holding the mask
've worn this mask so long, couldn't sleep without it
will sit with you
can't sleep either
Athos settles into a chair, as Phillippe lays the mask aside on the table and closes his eyes
Athos looks toward the flames of the fireplace, and in their dancing shadows he sees the face of Raoul
Phillippe's voice interrupts -- Athos
Thank you for being my guide
back into the world
Athos had not thought of it that way
Phillippe closes his eyes again, and falls asleep
'  - Light falls on Athos' face; it is dawn
He hears the whinny of horses, and looks out the window to see a carriage about to leave
Reacting quickly, he hurries out quietly
- Aramis and Porthos are already loaded into the carriage, as Athos runs up
Where are you going
Paris
There is still much to do
We'll be back soon
Be ready
But Aramis --
Phillippe can learn in time, but -- He can learn to be Phillippe in time
But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days
What you're asking is impossible
offer you the perfect revolution
revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King
But -- You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King
So do it
Aramis motions to the driver, who snaps the reins and drives the horses away
Athos, wide-eyed and alone, watches the carriage roll away
He turns back toward the house, and see's Phillippe looking out the window -- without the mask
-   - Athos and Phillippe are having breakfast
No, wait, do not hold your goblet that way
With a king it is
so
He shows him, pinching the goblet between thumb and forefinger, as the other three fingers extend daintily
It is not to be dainty
Servants have touched the King's goblet, so he will touch it as little as possible
Phillippe tries it and the goblet slips from his fingers, crashing onto his plate and spilling onto everything
am so sorry
Forgive me,  -- No
Do not be sorry
Never be sorry
The King cares for nothing and for no one
There are no mistakes when you are King
What you do is right for every person King has contempt for everyone
Is that the king of king you wish me to be
Or do you say this because of your son
How did you know --
Porthos told me
For a moment Athos can say nothing; then he shoves back from the table and storms from the room
- '  - Athos is pacing in his room, all alone, rehearsing the things he wants to say to Phillippe
am not
am not angry with you
You understand
Good
Now, as to acting like a king, we wish you to be a good king
But at first
at first you must pass as Louis, and Louis is cold and cruel
So you must stop looking at people with such softness
It is
not Kingly
The eyes of a King say that all he cares about is himself, and your eyes -- how do  tell him this --
You eyes
ask so much
You shouldn't care about me, about my -- about
Athos' voice breaks, his body sags
Oh Raoul, my son
my son
Athos weeps
- Phillippe sits alone in the parlor; he looks up as Athos -- his face washed, no sign of grief -- marches in
Come, we have much to do
- -- They practice sword fighting, Athos being sure that Phillippe knows Kingly posture
-- They rehearse holding court, with Athos showing Phillippe how to sit in a chair like a King on his throne, and then Phillippe trying it, with Athos then playing the roll of a courtesan paying homage
-- They rehearse courtly dancing; and as they stumble, both of them feeling embarrassed and ridiculous, they laugh
- Aramis' carriage rattles to a stop, the hooves of the horses sounding hollow on the cobblestones
They are near the same area where the riots occurred; now, at night, everything looks deserted
Aramis steps from the carriage
Coming
What use am
We go someplace dangerous
Why didn't you say so
Porthos steps out with him, and Aramis leads the way down a dark, spooky alley
- They walk through the murky darkness of Paris' backstreets
It is good to be out on a mission again
We are out on a mission, aren't we
Aramis grunts non-committally, lost in thought
You're right
Tell Porthos nothing
He needs to know nothing, for he is useless
Just as he says this a sinister form steps from the shadows and blocks their way
He holds a knife
Another  with a sword rises from a doorway beside them
Your money or your life
Aramis looks bored; Porthos stands blinking in surprise
Then a third robber steps up behind them, cocking a pistol
Make it quick, old man
Old
Old
You're all trying to rob us because you think we're old
The man with a sword steps forward to hack Porthos down, but Porthos spins, slapping the pistol, making it  but miss; he kicks the swordsman in the groin, then smashes his head against the alley wall; he backhands the gunman
The robber with the knife tries to run; Porthos snatches a barrel from the street and hurls it into the fleeing robber's back; he falls in a heap
Porthos' fury has just begun
He picks the fallen gunman up by the throat, slams him stomach down across a broken alley cart, and with one sweep of his mighty hand Porthos snatches down the man's pants
Old
'll show you old
Porthos snatches the pistol from the cobblestones
We see the shock and terror on the robber's face as he feels something shocking happen behind him
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there
Come on
Aramis, acting as if nothing happened, leads Porthos away
have to tell you something love Paris
Aramis has found what he's looking for:  a filthy brothel
Here we are
Aramis leads Porthos inside
- Sleazy whores lounge around, women at the very bottom of life
They stir and try to look more appealing as the two well dressed gentlemen enter
Aramis
These are
these are whores
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her
Did she have tits like that
greasy, disgusting  shuffles over
What do you want
White
Black
Both
No
We want you, Father Belles
The pimp reacts with fury, drawing a pistol
Get out
Now
will kill you where you stand
Aramis slowly falls to his knees, before the pimp
Bless me, Father, for  have sinned
The pimp -- the former Father Belles, the same man we saw as the priest who prayed with the Queen at the royal birth in the opening -- shoves his pistol at Aramis' face
Don't
Get out
have sinned
And no other priest's assurance of forgiveness can mean as much as yours
Tell me that  can be forgiven, no matter what  have done
Aramis' eyes are hypnotic, staring deep into the fallen priest's soul
Porthos is bug-eyed, certain Aramis' head is about to be blown apart
He's going to kill you, Aramis
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong
He stares at the pimp
The pimp's finger trembles on the trigger
have come to help you make it right
have come to take you home
The pimp shakes convulsively; he drops to his knees, bows his head, and weeps
- Aramis' carriage rattles through the dark streets; we play these secret movement sequences with an ominous, Jack-the- Ripper quality
The carriage pulls into
- The priests scurry out to meet it
First Aramis emerges, then Porthos -- but the appearance of the pimp surprises the cathedral priests
They cross themselves
Father Belles
Crossing themselves, they embrace the prodigal priest; one kneels before Aramis
You have made a miracle
God makes miracles
You make dinner
As Aramis strides toward the dining room, a Jesuit hurries up to him
The ball has been rescheduled -- for tomorrow
As Aramis hears this in surprise -- : - The carriage thunders through the countryside, back toward the manor house
- Athos and Phillippe sit at a table in the shade of a tree; on the table is a model of the palace which Athos is using to drill Phillippe on the palace's layout
These rooms are yours
Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress
Michelle
Whose rooms are those
Your mother's
They are interrupted as the carriage bearing Aramis and Porthos clatters in
Aramis is out immediately
Change the horses
Clear out everything
-  - The three Musketeers, plus Phillippe, are hurrying back toward Paris
Aramis, this will never -- Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that
If we miss him now we may not get another chance
But -- It presses us but it is good for us too
Louis' whims make him more vulnerable
We are less ready, but so are his guards
'Artagnan, unready
At a ball, everyone watches the King
But what if something extraordinary happened
Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else
Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned
Who
The Queen Mother
Anne
And Aramis leans forward to tell them his plan
- Teams of servants are filing in and out of the palace with food and flowers, decorating the ballroom for the ball that evening
In contrast, Anne and her devout retinue of nuns move in single file toward the garden chapel
- The nuns kneel at the altar as Anne enters the confessional
- Bless me Father, for  have sinned
So have
He slides open the partition window between them
Father Belles --
He taps a silencing finger to his lips
They told me you were dead
was
see you are still a woman of faith
have come back to ask you if you believe that one lie can poison your whole life
and one truth can put it back together again
Anne stares at the eyes of the priest, back from hell
- '  - As Louis' tailors outfit him in a dazzling gold peacock costume, complete with a jeweled mask at the end of a wand, he amuses himself by looking out the window at the beautiful young women arriving early for the ball
It shall be interesting tonight
'Artagnan enters, looking concerned
' Your Majesty
This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking -- You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan
Through the window Louis sees more beautiful young women
By the way, Claude -- inform Mademoiselle Beaufort that she will be moving from her rooms -- He looks up to see that Michelle has entered through the open door behind him
Never mind, it seems we have already told her
But Michelle's appearance brings him up short
It is not the cruel brush-off; she is already harshly different:  her eyes are red from crying, her lips are tight in anger
Murderer
Murderer
She holds a letter, crushed in her hand
wrote Fromberge
Under your seal
wrote as you, demanding to know why he disregarded my order to keep Raoul from danger
He writes back: "But your Majesty
Your last letter ordered me to put him in front of the cannon
" She hurls the crumpled letter into his face
Everyone is frozen, silent
She staggers toward Louis as if to attack him, then falls to her knees, weeping
No one helps her
Except d'Artagnan
He kneels, hugs her shoulders, helps her to her feet, and guides her toward her room
But d'Artagnan looks back once, toward Louis
Hysterical woman
Sire, misuse of the royal seal --
She'll be gone tomorrow
As d'Artagnan and Michelle move out, they pass Anne, coming in
Anne and d'Artagnan exchange a look; he remembers to give her a respectful nod, but she moves past, into the King's dressing room
Louis is surprised
Mother --
May  speak with you
Alone
am preparing for a ball
We haven't visited in three years
And we should have privacy
Exasperated, Louis waves his attendants away
What is it, mother
wish to discuss your brother
He is dead
By God's choice
There is nothing to discuss
First they told me he had died at birth
Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret
But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner
am King, Mother
And  do not wish to discuss this with you
He was my blood -- and  demand to know what happened to him
Why would you ask now
You never asked before
Because  have dreamed of him
Not as the baby they took away, but as a man
You have prayed too much
Your mind is weak
Avoiding her stare, Louis lifts a plaster bust of his father, its eyes like the sightless pupils of Greek gods
believe in dreams, Louis
They are our souls speaking to us, from that world beyond our eyes
And that son  never saw in daylight was standing in the moonlight of my dreams
And he wore an iron mask
We see her from a low angle, from a  behind Louis -- and we see the plaster bust burst upon the marble floor
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother
He is dead now
Dead
Yes
Dead
Two nights ago
The night of my dream
And the night of Louis' "dream
"  Anne begins to walk out
If
if he was wearing an iron mask in your dream, then how could you know he was your son
Louis smiles; he thinks he has her
Then you did do it, Louis
You did put your brother in an iron mask
All the blood is gone from Louis' face
Anne walks from the room, past Louis' waiting tailors
He snaps at them
have a ball to attend
They rush in
As they scurry about, dressing him in gold, Louis' composure returns; he stares at himself in the golden mirror, likes what he sees
and smiles
- Aramis' carriage pulls off the road and into the trees
The Musketeers and Phillippe pile out, to find another much grander carriage there waiting
Aramis ushers them into it
Whose carriage is this
It was mine
But since you are about to be the king, it is yours
The new carriage lurches away
are bundles of elaborate clothes
Phillippe first
They begin to dress Phillippe in a masquerade costume
Remember, Phillippe
nobility is born in the heart
Hold your goblet with two fingers
And make love as if you don't care
The way Kings do
And fart whenever you wish
Aramis tucks a note into Phillippe's pocket
Remember, all you have to do is get through tonight
Smile and nod a lot, and if you get stuck just wave and announce, "Continue
"  In the morning you hand this note to d'Artagnan, pardoning Athos and instructing that he, Aramis and Porthos be brought to the palace as your advisors
And all is well
Phillippe nods; everyone's nervous
Aramis grabs more clothes and hands them out
Now the rest of us
- Carriages disgorge guests, wildly attired for the masquerade ball
Porthos' carriage pulls in among them
- magnificent masquerade ball is in full swirl; the dazzling light of chandeliers bounces off the gilt ceiling and sparkles on the jewels of swirling dancers, their numbers multiplied in the polished mirrors that line the walls
The King is dancing and laughing with sexy young ladies
'Artagnan stands to the side of the ballroom, ever watchful, ever remote
As the dancers swirl, each one wearing a distinctive mask in the garish style favored by the French nobility of the 1600's, we see one particular couple -- a large man, with an excessively large woman
They are dancing vigorously, and as they take a break behind a huge pillar, they lift their masks enough for us to see that the man is Aramis, and the "woman" is Porthos
From the folds of their elaborate costumes they both withdraw replicas of the iron mask that Phillippe once wore
'Artagnan watches everything
We have to be lucky
We will make our own luck tonight
if Phillippe holds up
Aramis peers across the ballroom, to where Athos and Phillippe mix among the revelers, using thin sticks to hold broad masks to their faces
Behind the masks we see their eyes -- Athos' intense, Phillippe's nervous and darting
Stay calm, you're doing fine
Then Phillippe's eyes go strangely still; he sees, for the first time in his life, his twin brother, the King
My brother
Louis dances the minuet, prancing as if he is the center of the universe; but this bliss is broken when one of the dancers who swirls by him -- it is Aramis -- lifts the baroque outer mask he's wearing and reveals an iron mask beneath
The King staggers, stopping
The sight stuns him, confuses him; he looks around but the wearer of the mask has disappeared among the weaving patterns of dancers
Louis' hands dart to his eyes:  are they playing tricks on him
Seeing his reaction, Phillippe whispers -- He knew
He knew what they did to me
The   dancing with Louis notices him falter
What is wrong, your majesty
Nothing,  -- continue
Louis rejoins the dancing
and then sees, on the balcony above him, a different person -- a huge "woman," Porthos -- who lifts off an outer mask to reveal an iron mask below
There
Do you see it
See what, Majesty
Porthos has slipped away from the railing when the King looks back up; the young beauty sees nothing, and turns back to the King with a look that questions his sanity
'Artagnan notices the King's reaction -- though he did not see the glimpse of the iron mask -- and is just as baffled as everyone else when the King turns and staggers away
' Your Majesty
tired
Must
lie down
The music splatters to an awkward stop; Louis hurries out, leaving his partner abandoned in the center of the ballroom, with everyone staring as if she just ruined the party
' Carry on, everyone
The music begins again, and the party goers, not knowing what else to do, politely continue
Athos draws Phillippe away from the ballroom, into a side corridor
Porthos waddles down stairs, and meets Aramis
Quick, to the passages
They hurry in the same direction Athos and Phillippe went
-   '  - 'Artagnan catches up to the King as he is entering the door of his royal apartment
' Your Majesty, is there anything --
The King shuts the door in d'Artagnan's face
'  - The King falls upon his bed, pressing his hands to his head
- The three Musketeers and Phillippe move quietly up a stairway and to the door of a room
Phillippe whispers
The room of the King's favorite mistress
She will be at the ball
'  - The door opens and they move in; it is in fact empty, though a mess
They move to the wall, where Aramis, after a little looking, locates the levers to open the wall/door to the King's secret passageway
Aramis enters first, the others follow
We half expect Michelle to pop up at any moment, but the Musketeers enter the passage without incident
- Aramis silently leads the others through the secret passage, to the portal into the King's bedroom
'  - The King is lying on the bed; we see him from the  of someone approaching him slowly, silently
When his eyes open in panic, it is too late
We see Aramis, Athos, Porthos from the '  as they swarm him
It is Judgment Day
His fist drops into frame
Louis loses consciousness
' as consciousness returns
He see Phillippe in Louis' clothes
Aramis, Athos and Porthos bow and say
Your Majesty
, still on his bed, now wears Phillippe's clothes
Wh-- Wha-- Don't look so shocked, Phillippe
Come, you're going back to prison
Phillippe
Why do you call me -- Now Louis understands everything
He tries to struggle, but instantly Porthos shoves a rag into his mouth
Aramis opens the main door a crack, and sees d'Artagnan has entered his room down the corridor, through whose open door he can guard the approaches to the King's rooms
Aramis shuts the door again and turns to the others
'Artagnan guards the hallway
You must go back the way we came
Athos puts his hands on Phillippe's shoulders
Now, your Majesty
It is time
Aramis and Porthos bow again to Phillippe -- now dressed and looking exactly like the King
Phillippe's mouth is dry; he swallows hard, and follows Athos up the hidden stairs
' Athos and Phillippe move to the door; they stop there, and Athos adjusts Phillippe's costume one more time
You know the way
Phillippe nods, tremendously nervous
You have your note
Phillippe pats his pocket, like a boy being sent off to his first day at school
He surprises Athos, hugging him
Then Phillippe opens the door and walks slowly down the hallway
Athos stands at the door and watches him go, all alone
Athos whispers, though Phillippe can't hear
You have the heart of a king
Reluctantly, he shuts the door behind Phillippe
, as he conducts himself through the ornate corridor, down the gilded staircase
and into -- - Phillippe enters the ballroom, and the reappearance of the "King" draws new attention
Everyone in the dazzling ballroom seems to stop and look straight at Phillippe
Phillippe freezes
Stares, everywhere, stares
For what seems an eternity, he can't move
But then he raises his hand and says -- Continue
As if by magic the music plays, the dancing resumes
Phillippe moves to the throne and takes his place upon it
He seems to have made it; people glance -- dancing ladies, young Musketeers, old advisors -- but no one gives him a second look
For a moment, Phillippe feels safe
And then he sees Michelle, her eyes glassy and riveted upon him
She wears her most beautiful gown -- the first one Louis gave her -- but one shoulder strap dangles sloppily
Her lips and cheeks are awkwardly rouged, her hair is mussed; she is drunk
She weaves her way to him and curtsies elaborately
My gracious noble lord
Phillippe's heart is pounding; he looks around for help
He can only guess who this woman is
The advisors have now noticed her; Claude quickly dispatches orders to keep the party going along, and waves guards over
How are you
Michelle
She doesn't react, so he must have guessed right; but Phillippe knows nothing of what happened just before the ball, and he's ambushed by her anger
How should  be
came to give this back to you
She starts tearing off her dress
Claude and the guards reach her; the young Musketeers grabbing her
Fret not with this, your Majesty -- But Michelle fights, slapping, clawing -- and when one of the young Musketeers grabs her from behind, his arm to her throat, Phillippe jumps up
Stop
You're hurting her
Phillippe's face shows something Louis' never did: compassion
He looks into Michelle's eyes
However  have wronged you  will make amends
Whatever the cost
Phillippe could not have said anything more unlike Louis; everyone who heard the remark -- Claude, the guards, and especially Michelle -- stare at him in frozen amazement
Phillippe realizes his blunder; they've caught him
The
But the attention is not directed at the throne; all eyes shift to the main doorway, where Anne has appeared
She is indescribably beautiful; she wears a bright gown, her hair is brushed and bejeweled, she radiates the light of a woman who felt old at thirty and who has discovered, at forty, that she is more stunning than ever
Her arrival draws even more attention than the reappearance of the King; everyone watches transfixed as she approaches
Phillippe sees her -- his mother
He stands on legs that seem to have no bones
His mother
She moves to him, her eyes filling with tears
When she is almost to the throne, Phillippe falls to his knees before her and kisses her hand
No one can believe it, not from this King
Yet the moment strikes them as beautiful, and they applaud happily
Phillippe and the Queen Mother rise, and guide each other -- depending on each other for support, to a seat, he on the throne, she on a seat the servants place beside him
Phillippe gives a wave
Continue
The ball continues, the music exuberant
Michelle wanders away, like a blind lamb
Phillippe and his mother sit side by side, holding hands, their reunion passing in private between their clasped hands, and glistening in their eyes
- Michelle, alone and forgotten, staggers down the corridor toward the King's rooms; she passes d'Artagnan's open door
'  - are tidying everything up; they have Louis gagged and trussed up hand and foot, his eyes flashing hatred
Don't worry, your Majesty
We have a prison for you, where you can rest peacefully
Porthos drapes Louis over his shoulder, and they move into the passages
Just as they close the portal behind them, the door opens and Michelle wanders in like a zombie
Suddenly, d'Artagnan is at her shoulder
' Michelle -- Then he sees the room is empty; he thought Louis was here
' Where is he
In
the ballroom
But he isn't the same man
- As a minuet ends, Claude raises his glass in a toast
To King Louis
And to Anne, the Queen Mother
The guests applaud and reach for wine glasses; servants present Phillippe and Anne with champagne, and they sip -- To King Louis, and the Queen Mother
Everyone drinks; Phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous fingers, hitting the floor with a crash
Dead silence; everyone is looking
Then Anne drops her glass too -- and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is part of the celebration
As the music begins again, Anne leans to Phillippe -- retire now
Wait two waltzes, then retire to your room; and spend the night in safety
We have much to talk about, and have the rest of our lives to do it
Good night, Mother
Good night
my son
She kisses him on the cheek; it brings tears to both of them
She moves to the door, everyone bowing as she leaves
Anne encounters d'Artagnan
He stops, so taken by the sight of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her
' Anne
You look -- Remembering himself, he bows deeply
' My Queen
'Artagnan
She takes his hand, not caring who is watching
' have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight
We have much to discuss
Tomorrow
She moves off, toward her room
'Artagnan enters the ballroom
- 'Artagnan sees "Louis" sitting on the throne
More baffled than alarmed, he grabs one of the Musketeer guards near him
' How long has the King been back
Some while, Captain
' He didn't pass my doorway,  was in my room
He must've, Captain, there is no other way here
'Artagnan stands and thinks; his mind begins to spin
sees d'Artagnan, staring at him
then calling more guards over and giving them quick instructions; the guards hurry away
Then d'Artagnan moves to Phillippe, and bows
He looks at him carefully, but seems to see nothing unusual
Continue
' Sire, we have an emergency -- of security
must ask you to accompany me
The ball
Continue
' must insist, Sire
Phillippe stands, and follows d'Artagnan from the ball
- Aramis, Athos and Porthos -- carrying Louis -- descend the secret passages to the foundations of the palace, into a drainage channel leading to the river
They have stashed a boat there; they plop Louis into it and climb in themselves
They row toward the archway that is the exit to the river; the moonlit waters of the Seine glow outside, like a beacon of safe escape
But the steel grate of the archway slams down just before they reach it, and blades point at them from every angle of the darkness
shielded lantern rises and its wick is turned up, revealing ' he stands with a small contingent of young Musketeers
His eyes are intense, his face in agony
' My friends
The only one they can see it d'Artagnan
They all look at each other, in the small circle of light from the lantern
' Only we four, the most trusted Musketeers, knew about the passages, meant to keep the King safe
Your Majesty
Phillippe steps out of the darkness; his eyes are full of shame and failure as he looks at Athos, but still he holds on, trying to maintain the charade that he is Louis
Yes
Why do you bring me here, d'Artagnan
The King
Look
It's the King
He means Phillippe
' Then who is that lying beside you
Porthos turns and looks at Louis -- then reacts as if he's totally surprised at the presence of this man tied up and gagged beside him
Wh--
Where did he come from
Athos grabs d'Artagnan's arm
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen
' cannot, Athos
Dearly as  love you,  cannot
'Artagnan takes his dagger and cuts the ropes that bind Louis' hands, and the gag that has kept him from talking
Aramis suddenly backhands Louis, knocking him flat on his back in the boat, and pointing to him -- Louis
This man is an impostor
We caught him trying to impersonate the King, and were just getting rid of him
Louis struggles upright
'Artagnan, arrest them all
Shut up, knave
Aramis slaps Louis again, and pleads with his eyes that d'Artagnan accept their ruse
'Artagnan is dying inside
' Before  came here,  insisted the King come with me
The real Louis would never have let me insist
Seeing they are about to be arrested, the old Musketeers in the boat spring into action against their younger counterparts
Athos swats one swordsman with an oar; Porthos seizes the guard who has grabbed a hold of the boat and flings the man back into two of his comrades; Aramis grabs Louis by the hair and puts his dagger to his throat
Pull them back, d'Artagnan
' You can't do it
Pull them back
' Everyone back
Phillippe, get into the boat
Into the boat
Now
Phillippe obeys
Open the gate
'Artagnan nods to his men, and they open the iron gate leading out to the river
The boat makes for the opening
Just as it is about to reach it, Louis forces Aramis' hand
You will not shed royal blood
He kicks at the boat and struggles to stand, making the boat tip wildly and throwing everyone in it all around
Aramis draws the dagger away from Louis' throat to keep from killing him, and d'Artagnan makes a grab at Louis and drags him onto the stone floor of the channel
The boat is almost through the opening -- and Louis snatches at his brother, Phillippe
The current outside the gate is rushing by, and the boat is already caught in the current; it's pulling away and the Musketeers can't stop it
Athos seizes Phillippe's legs and tries to hold him, but the pressure of the current is great, and now not only Louis but some of the young Musketeers are helping hold Phillippe
Phillippe's legs slip out of Athos' grasp, and the boat flashes downriver
Aramis, Porthos and Athos have escaped
but Phillippe is captured, looking into the hate-filled eyes of his twin brother Louis
- Louis is angrily climbing through the passageways, back up into the main floors of the palace, venting his emotions at d'Artagnan, just behind him; the young Musketeers with Phillippe, their prisoner, follow along further back
want all these passages sealed
Another stupid idea of my father's
Seal them all, every one
' It shall be done, your Majesty
Even the bedchamber passages
Let none remain
' Yes, your Majesty
They reach a doorway, and the King bangs through it, into his own bedchamber, still spouting anger
was told this impostor was dead
' You knew you had a double
He is my brother
'Artagnan is frozen in surprise
Phillippe and his guards move into the room; seeing him in full light, wearing Louis' own clothes, fans Louis' anger; he jumps forward and begins ripping the royal garments off Phillippe
'Artagnan forces himself between Louis and Phillippe
' --  thought he was but
an impostor who resembled -- My twin
Which has kept him alive
Until now
' No
They whirl to see the Queen Mother, who has entered through the main door
She hurries to the space between her sons, hugging Phillippe, then trying to hug Louis
Louis, please --
My guards are useless
Take her from me
He motions to the young Musketeers to restrain her; reluctantly they grip the arms of the Queen Mother
What had you to do with this, Mother
He is your brother
He is nothing now
Louis draws a sword from the scabbard of one of the young Musketeers -- but d'Artagnan steps between him and Phillippe
' Your Majesty
This man before you
He is royal blood, the same as you
To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do
It is against the laws of God, and of France
Get out of my way
' Not once have  ever asked anything for myself
ask now
Forgive this man, this prisoner
your brother
Forgive
' Aramis, Porthos and Athos too know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty
If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble
Forgive them
They have plotted against me
Me
The embodiment of God's will
'Artagnan sinks to his knees before the king
' Your Majesty
Every day of your life,  have watched over you
No angel could have stood a more faithful vigil
have bled for you, and have prayed, every day, to see you become greater than your office, better than the law
Show me now what my faith and blood have purchased
Show mercy
The words cut into everyone:  Anne, Phillippe, the young Musketeers
But Louis' eyes are cold, as he responds -- You take the side of traitors
Please, may  speak
'lord beg that you kill me
release you, before Almighty God, from any claim of sin in taking my life
In fact  will pray that God reward you for your mercy to do it
But do not --  beg you -- return me to the prison, where  have lived so long
Phillippe's plea makes Louis pause
then smile
'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or  will have yours
And as for you, Phillippe
Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate
No, Louis
No
Wear it until you love it
And die in it
Anne screams, and Louis waves to the guards, who draw her from the room, as d'Artagnan sags, on his knees before the King he has served so faithfully
Slowly, Phillippe lowers his head
'' 'Artagnan returns to his bare room; he sits down upon the bed and drops his face into his hands
Then he hears the sound, like a , but short and muffled, almost like the whelp of a kicked dog
He lifts his head sharply; where did that sound come from
He is almost too tired, too sad, to investigate
Then the King, already shaken by the night's events, hurries into d'Artagnan's room
What was that sound
Did you hear it
It came from Michelle's room
' 'Artagnan enters, ahead of Louis
They see nothing unusual, and d'Artagnan moves up the hidden stairs toward Michelle's apartment
' 'Artagnan enters the room, and finds it empty -- but the window is open
He moves toward it
' The King is pacing as d'Artagnan reappears
Where is Michelle
' There
He points to the window
Louis shoves open the drapes and leaps back in horror
Michelle has hanged herself outside Louis' window, the golden bunting of her bed tied as a noose around her neck
'  - Anne has changed; she is tormented, but alive with energy, pacing
There is a knock at her door, and the old nun opens it to d'Artagnan
The old nun leaves them alone; d'Artagnan moves to Anne and takes her hands, to look into her eyes
' There were two
Not one
But two
couldn't tell you
You had enough to carry
' Anne
The night we had together
always wanted more
But that one, it was enough
Enough to make me love you forever
want you to remember that
and go on
As strong as you are now
No matter what happens
He kisses her
She drinks in his love
Then he stands and moves to the door
He looks back, then stares out
'Artagnan --
He looks back once more; he seems to want to tell her something; but whatever it is, he can't find the words, and with a last loving look at her, he walks away
- sudden visual, establishing the Bastille, the horrific legendary prison of Paris
- Phillippe, his head covered in a burlap hood, is rushed through the twisting stairways of the prison
, The guards remove the hood, and Phillippe sees the cell
Then he sees the blacksmith there, with a new iron mask, and his eyes take on a fresh horror
No
Please
No
The guards seize him and the blacksmith places the mask over Phillippe's face, as he screams
They seal the mask with a small padlock, whose key is distinctive, and jeweled
- The two guards and the blacksmith are coming downstairs after completing their work
Far above them, in the prison tower, the cries of the prisoner echo; he sounds like a raving madman now
The two guards and the blacksmith enter an office at the base of the tower; the   looks up
Pay me quick,  want out of here
Soldiers, swords drawn, appear in the doorway behind them
What -- You saw the prisoner's face
Understanding, the blacksmith raises his hammer toward the soldiers; but he is stabbed in the back by the jailer, and the soldiers skewer the two guards who helped him
soldier lifts the jeweled key from the hand of a dead guard
is handed to the King by Andre, the young Lieutenant
Louis hangs the key around his own neck, with a thin gold chain
Now
Where is d'Artagnan
Out directing the search for the traitors
When he returns, watch him
When he leaves again, you tell me
The Lieutenant bows
Louis smiles, and fingers the key
- Squads of young Musketeers gallop along the river, and through the dark streets around it, searching
, three forms scurry through the darkness:  Aramis, Porthos and Athos, heaving, wheezing
They duck into a niche of the wall to avoid capture from another patrol galloping by
Then Aramis unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in
The three Musketeers struggle through the catacombs, reach the chapel, and fall gasping to the floor
Bloody hell
We can't
stay here
That traitor d'Artagnan
knows about this place
Can we eat
before we go
This excitement's given me an appetite
Bread and wine
in that cupboard
Porthos hauls himself to his feet and turns up the wick of the lantern
The rising light reveals a note, stuck to the cupboard with the blade of a dagger
note
Pinned with a dagger, like the old days
He removes the note, and reads
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon
At midnight tonight  will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes
That should give you ample time
Never have  needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one
'Artagnan
" He lures us to capture
He seeks redemption
You're a fool
Perhaps
But of d'Artagnan  am certain
What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King
So what has changed
Perhaps he serves a different king
What choice is there
If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go
You are right
But it is a trap
So what
'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss
Then to the Bastille
To the Bastille
And death
- The stone walls rising into the Paris night seem to ooze evil
The building looks impossible to get into, much less get out of; its doors appear to be solid blocks of wood, encased in stone ramparts
We hear a sharp, echoing ; Aramis, Athos, and Porthos stand outside the main entrance, Athos slumped between the other two like a beaten captive being delivered to jail
No one answers their knock; the three Musketeers exchange doubtful glance, and Porthos knocks again
guard inside slides open a view port of the massive door
Open up
We have a prisoner
The port shuts, bolts rattle, and the great door heaves open
The Musketeers glance at each other again, and play their roles, Aramis and Porthos dragging Athos inside
-   - The prison courtyard is murky in the darkness, and ringed by doors leading into mazes of corridors to its dungeons
Take him down to level three
The Captain will see to the documents
Aramis and Porthos drag Athos into one of the shadowy portals surrounding the courtyard
-   - The three Musketeers duck into the inky shadows; Aramis cuts the bonds that hold Athos' hands, and gives him the extra sword he had beneath his cloak
It worked
It's a prison, you idiot
They don't expect anyone to try getting in
The problem will come when we want out
Aramis shushes them, and leads them into another quiet corridor
They hear the distant bells of a church, then suddenly they must scramble, as a platoon of guards carrying torches troop up stairs into the corridor; the Musketeers dart like rats into dark nooks; as the guards pass, the Musketeers huddle, and the bells end their tolling
Midnight
We have ten minutes
They press on, deeper into the Bastille
- '  - Anne moves to the window, where she starts to kneel for her nightly prayer; but she stops
Outside in the garden, far below her window, is d'Artagnan on horseback, waiting
Their eyes connect
He has a single rose in his hand
Never taking his eyes from her, he places the rose on the stone bench of the garden, and reins his horse away
Then she understands what he was trying to tell her before, in the hallway; it was goodbye
- 'Artagnan rides away quickly, passing -- without seeing -- Lieutenant Andre, who has been watching him
- Through the night d'Artagnan gallops
We see his destination in the distance:  the Bastille
- The great gates of the palace swing slowly open, and out ride a whole platoon of young Musketeers, surrounding Louis himself, on horseback and dressed like a soldier
- The three Musketeers scramble down a flight of stairs, through another corridor, down another stairway
They pass cells; wretched prisoners look up, but none of them is Phillippe
Then the Musketeers surprise a
Hey
But before the man can say anything else, Porthos has crushed him like a bug against the wall
They rip the huge ring of keys from the jailer's waist, and take his torch
' He lies on the floor; he sees the light of a torch, coming to him like sunrise
and then he hears a voice -- Phillippe
How did you -- They open the door and release him -- from the cell, but not from the mask
He tries to hug Athos
They head back the way they came
- Louis and his platoon of young Musketeers ride through the streets, scattering the paupers who sleep there
-   - Back up the stairs
through one corridor
they start up the second flight of stairs, then stop and scramble back
(whispering) Someone's coming
They take cover on either side of the corridor, and lift their swords
It's a man coming down the stairs, with a hooded lantern
they raise their swords to strike -- 'Artagnan
' The way is blocked above
The Captain of the Bastille has turned back from the mission  sent him on, and is in the courtyard with a party of men
He lies
He is here to trap us
' came to see you safely out
Check for yourself
Porthos climbs the stairs to check; 'Artagnan looks at Phillippe, in the mask
' All you have suffered,  would gladly have borne myself, to keep it from you
Athos spits on the floor, in derision
But Porthos comes barreling back down the stairway
'Artagnan is right, the courtyard is filling with soldiers
' This way
He leads them quickly down a side corridor; the others have no choice but to follow
'Artagnan leads them around another corner, into a long corridor; at the end of it is a massive door
They reach it, and d'Artagnan produces a set of keys marked with the royal seal of the Musketeers; he begins unlocking the three padlocks that secure the door
' Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river
They will know you helped us, if we go this way
' That doesn't matter now
They open the door
and as they do they see Louis and his platoon of young Musketeers arriving outside
There
Stop them
Betrayed
The young Musketeers serving the King jump from their horses and grab for the door; but d'Artagnan leaps forward, his sword flashing
After a second of surprise, Athos, Aramis and Porthos jump forward too, and there is a brief, bloody skirmish at the door
But the young Musketeers have overwhelming numbers, and firearms too; protecting Phillippe, the old Musketeers draw back inside and succeed at pulling the door shut and latching it quickly
Back the way we came
They race back up the corridor -- the four Musketeers, and Phillippe, in the iron mask -- and turn the corner
They reach another inner door, pass through it -- and see the soldiers of the Bastille coming at them
Back
They retreat, and Porthos slams the second door
Like all the inner doors of the Bastille, it's heavy wood, a foot thick, and Porthos seals it with a huger iron bar
But there's nowhere else to run
Trapped
At the far end of the corridor, the King's young Musketeers have the same keys to the outer door that d'Artagnan did, and they are breaking through
Louis and two dozen of his personal bodyguard pour through the door
Charge them
The young Musketeers obediently charge down the corridor
Stepping up shoulder to shoulder -- Aramis, d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos -- the four veteran Musketeers meet the charge, first with pistols, then with swords, a wall between Louis' men and Phillippe
The battle in the cramped confines of the corridor is bloody and fierce; the young attackers can only get a few men into the fight at any one time, and those who step before the famous veterans are cut down
Louis' young Musketeers retreat, to regroup
' Louis is furious, jumping at Lieutenant Andre, who has dragged a wounded comrade back from the fight
Cowards
Twenty run from four
The corridor nullifies our number
And no one has stomach to fight the Captain
Louis is disgusted by this loyalty -- and he has a solution
'Artagnan
Louis' voice echoes down to the veteran Musketeers and Phillippe, in the Iron Mask
' am not angry with you
knew you would lead me to them, and so you have
Lay down your sword, and will not punish you
will let you retire in peace -- to live out your days in the countryside
And  will give your friends a swift execution, if you surrender now
The words bounce down the long corridor; then silence
'Artagnan stands holding his sword, staring away from his friends, toward the King and his gang of young Musketeers
'Artagnan
Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway
He is right, d'Artagnan
Athos says nothing; but when d'Artagnan looks at him, he lowers his eyes in shame for ever having doubted d'Artagnan's loyalty and friendship
Phillippe speaks up, from behind the Iron Mask
Wait
Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives
You have done your best
Let me go, and let all of you find peace
' No
Even if  could give up my friends,  could never give up my son
This hits them like a bombshell -- and suddenly it all makes sense; d'Artagnan's loyalty to Louis, his dogged hope that he could somehow influence him toward goodness
We see their stunned faces, each in turn:  Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Phillippe
' never had any idea you existed
until they found you
And in all that time,  never had a moment's pride as a father -- until now
'Artagnan and Phillippe embrace, lost father to lost son
From the heavily barred door to their rear comes a powerful pounding; the Bastille's soldiers are trying to break it down
Time is running out
Aramis looks back down the corridor toward the door to the outside, barred now by Louis and his young guards, their long muskets bristling like spikes; and yet that way is the only possible hope for escape to the outside
'Artagnan
Those are young Musketeers down there
They have been weaned on our legends
They revere us -- it is an advantage
Why don't we charge them
' trained those men myself
They will stand and fight
But if we are to die, let it be this way
He draws his sword and points it into the air
Aramis lifts the tip of his sword to join that of d'Artagnan
Porthos does too
and then Athos joins them
One for all
All for one
If  could have a blade, then would be please to run with you
'Artagnan gives Phillippe a dagger
They look at each other
Then d'Artagnan begins to scream
The others take up the shout
Then they step around the corner, and charge
We film it in all its glory, a visual feast:  the Last Charge of the Musketeers
Their capes swirl about time, their hair flies, their legs take on new life
At first the young Musketeers at the end of the corridor are frozen in surprise; their youthful Lieutenant is awed by the dashing, beautiful bravery of the thing
Magnificent valor
Shoot them
Shoot them
Louis grabs a musket from one of the reluctant soldiers and fires:
With the first explosion of gunfire the others pull their triggers; the powder in their weapons flashes and crashes
The musket balls fly down the hallway, sparking off the stone walls and floor, ricocheting, punching holes through the capes and flesh
but still the Musketeers charge like the young men they once were -- still are, in spirit
In the confines of the Bastille's stone corridor the noise is deafening, and the space in front of the guards is filled with the dense gray smoke of the gunpowder
None of them can see anything beyond it
and all is quiet
Draw blades
The King's Guards draw their swords, and wait; are all the old Musketeers dead
Slowly the figures emerge from the smoke -- in  , walking now, no need to run
All are wounded, but all are still alive
The Four Musketeers, along with Phillippe, move slowly and steadily toward the blades of the young Guards; a fight to the death
So be it
But the young Lieutenant will have none of it; as one of his men lifts a sword to plunge it into the chest of d'Artagnan, the young Lieutenant bats the sword down, with his own
Stop
He steps forward toward d'Artagnan; but instead of thrusting his sword he salutes with it
His men follow suit, saluting and bowing to the courage of these men they have grown up wanting to follow
King Louis, for the moment, is frozen
'Artagnan looks back at Phillippe; he has bullet holes in two different places at the edges of his clothes, but he is unwounded
Then d'Artagnan sees Louis, with his long dagger, leaping at Phillippe
' 'Artagnan throws himself between the two twins and hurls Louis backwards, then spins to Phillippe
' Phillippe
am unhurt -- Louis bounces off the wall and thrusts back again, driving the blade into d'Artagnan's back
'Artagnan's face jolts; he staggers, his legs buckle
'Artagnan falls into the arms of his friends
Louis stands holding his bloody dagger, everyone staring at him:  d'Artagnan, the old Musketeers, the young ones
You
Vicious
evil
He leaps into Louis, overwhelming him in fury, wrenching the dagger from his brother's hand and gripping his throat
' Phillippe
No
Don't
He is your brother
Phillippe releases Louis, who falls, choking, gasping
Lieutenant Andre is surprised by what he just heard
Brother
Phillippe darts to d'Artagnan, being cradled by Athos; Athos lifts a hand from d'Artagnan's back; it is drenched in blood
'Artagnan is dying
Athos, Aramis, Porthos
none of them can speak
They grip d'Artagnan, as if through their will alone they could keep his life from leaking away
The young Musketeers stand transfixed, watching their legendary Captain die
Phillippe sags; his voice from behind the iron mask is torn by grief
All this time
was a lost secret
But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love
You were the Man in the Iron Mask
'Artagnan
' Shhh
All my life, this is the death  have wanted
To die among you
One for all
and all for
He is gone
Phillippe rises with a slow, terrible resolve, and moves to Louis
When Louis tries to rise to his feet he finds the blade of the young Lieutenant Andre pointed at his chest
All my life, all  ever wanted to be
was him
He points to d'Artagnan
Phillippe rips away the key that dangles around Louis' neck
: where the soldiers of the '  are finally breaking through; working the massive door aside they find -- with his guards, and Aramis, Athos, Porthos, along with their prisoner, in the Iron Mask
We have recaptured the prisoner
No, no
am your -- blow in his chest from the Lieutenant stuns the prisoner and drops him to his knees
The King orders the -- You will put this madman where no one can hear his insanity
Let him be fed by a deaf mute
But feed him well, and let him have a long life within the Iron Mask
And them
He means Aramis, Porthos, and Athos
They are my loyal servants
No
No
But the guards are dragging him to the deepest, darkest dungeon of the Bastille
: -    - At the end of a lane of elms, where the markers of king's graves stand clustered, royal workmen place a mighty marble monument stone above the final resting place of d'Artagnan
Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and the King -- Phillippe, known as King Louis now -- stand gathered there, as Aramis in his priest's garments utters the funeral incantations
Aramis' voice breaks as he does so
Porthos' eyes pour out rivers of tears
Athos' grief is beyond weeping
Phillippe holds the arm of his mother
She holds the rose d'Artagnan left her
Amen
Athos moves up between Aramis and Porthos, and links them with his arms
He was the best of us all
Aramis and Porthos move off together, to walk the lane of elms; Athos remains by the grave, unable to leave
Phillippe pats Anne's arm
will be with you in a moment, Mother
She too moves down the lane of trees, touching the tip of the rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face
Phillippe moves up to Athos
After all you have done,  must ask you one more service to your king
have lost my father
And you have lost your son
Let me love you like a son to a father
And  pray you live for this, to love me like your son
Athos can't speak; he can only nod yes
Phillippe moves to join his mother, leaving Athos to take one final look down at the grave
Then as Athos moves off to join Aramis and Porthos, we  from the name "'" on the stone, to the pattern chiseled beneath the name
It is a mask, of iron
