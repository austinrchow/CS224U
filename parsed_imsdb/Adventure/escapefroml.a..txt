Screenplay by John Carpenter pounding, metallic beat begins
Twists of sound in a tightrope rhythm
The snap of a military snare drum
: "1998" Forces hostile to the United States grow strong in the late 20th Century
-   -   - Graffiti-smeared walls
Fires raging
Automatic weapons fire
Shadowy figures dash through the southern California night
great moral crisis grips the nation as social revolution and a breakdown of the criminal justice system threaten society
- They stand like sentinels
Black uniforms
Battle helmets
Gleaming military assault weapons
Bullet-proof shields with large emblems: the American eagle against a red background, and in bold letters underneath, "    "
To protect and defend its citizens, the United States Police Force is formed
Of Los Angeles, on the coast of southern California
: "1999" The population of Los Angeles grows to 40 million
The city is ravaged by crime and immorality
Presidential candidate predicts a millennium earthquake will destroy the city in divine retribution
The map of
now glows a dark red
- hot summer's day
Heat ripples distorts the towering shadowing buildings in the dense smog
An earthquake measuring 9
6 on the Richter scale hits at 12:59 p
m
, August 23rd, in the year 2000
Suddenly we are hit by the loudest, booming, rolling concussion you have ever heard
The buildings begin to shake, swaying wildly
The Bonaventure Hotel implodes, collapses inward in the thudding, slamming freight train of an earthquake
The 4-level Interchange as the Santa Monica Freeway shatters, crumbles, pulling exit ramps, cars, trees, and nearby buildings with it
Buildings shaking
Streets buckling
Cars rolling, crashing
People running
Gas mains exploding
Buildings convulsing and dropping like tinder against an inferno
As the tsunami sweeps in from the ocean, smacking into the shoreline like the hammer of God, plunging us into darkness
After the devastation, the constitution is damned, and the newly elected President accepts a lifetime term of office
Of the United States
line tracks along the Mexican border, like the Berlin Wall
Fearing a massive terrorist invasion from South America, the United States prepares for war
The Great Wall is built along the southern border, cutting off the flow of illegal aliens
-  - The ruins of
Rubble, smoke, a lethal wasteland
An army of terrifying figures climbs atop a mountain of debris
They raise their weapons into the night sky
Street gangs, South American terrorists and the criminally insane capture Los Angeles, the once-great City of Angels
An unrecognizable
After the big one
Surrounded by water, is now an island off the new western shore, tilting on the edge of the continental plate
Now an island on the border of civilization,
is a no-man's land of chaos, anarchy and darkness
red line tracks along the mountainous areas surrounding the island, defining the perimeter of the armed fortress
Police firebases and gun emplacements are indicated in the San Gabriel Mountains
The United States Police Force, like an army, is encamped in the San Gabriel Mountains
From the glowing, outlined canyons come the cries of rage of a million lost souls
The President's first act as Permanent Commander-in-Chief is Directive 17: protect and defend the United States from this island of the damned, Hell on Earth
: "2013 - " - low, across the top of the water's surface
Climb up the side of a massive, rusted supertanker, abandoned, years ago
Break over the railing to reveal a gigantic neon sign which screams "
" The supertanker has been transformed into a floating resort
The camera increases speed, moves past huge billboards displaying gigantic glitzy ads: "   " - an extravaganza with fabulous showgirls and laser recreations of Fidel's final night
"    " - a virtual reality tour featuring legendary Vegas entertainers
"  " - a virtual Disneyland for the whole family
Now camera flies low through glittering streets and back alleyways filled with gamblers, neon and glitz
-   , 2013 - An alley strangled with tourists, gamblers, hookers, hustlers, and con men - professional expatriates from the West mingling with excited visitors from all over the world
: "         0330 " Salesman with a chin-mike speaks non-stop, unintelligible Chinese
frenzied crowd gathers around him, waving money, placing bets
Two men sit at either end of a long table
They are in deep shadows, facing each other
We only get glimpses of them: One fat
Mirrored sunglasses
Chinese
His fingers tap on the table cockroach scurries past
Ammo belts
sheathed combat knife the size of your arm
45 automatics in holsters
The other, dressed in black
An eye-patch
Dangerous
flash of two six-guns in holsters
futuristic gunfighter
The cockroach dashes past his fingers
He squashes it
The crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a dozen languages
The salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in front of the two men
Then he leans over to
He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it out
The cobra hisses and squirms
Deftly, the salesman continues to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom into the first glass
He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass
Finally, he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart and liver
Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the heart and liver with his fingers
The juice drips into the third glass
Now the salesman stirs the glasses
The poison is clear
The blood is milky-green
The heart and liver are red
He places the glasses on the table between the two men
The two men stare at each other, motionless
The crowd continues placing bets at a fevered pitch
titanium white tube floats above the center of the table
laser beam of light shines from one end
The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger, sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead
The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses
His hand shakes slightly
He hesitates
Finally he takes the glass with the red liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then gulps it down
The crowd explodes
More bets
The salesman leans over and spins the light tube again, this time it lands on something black, an eye-patch
Pull back to reveal a man with an eye-patch
The man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused between the remaining two glasses
He takes the one filled with milky-green blood and downs it fast
The crowd roars
One glass left
The two men stare at it intently
The salesman spins the light tube with more force than before
It circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally stopping on the fat man
The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at the fat man
The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison
His trembling fingers hover above it
Then he quickly withdraws his hand
The crowd reacts, boos, as
The man with the eye-patch smiles
slightly, cynical smile
And without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and drinks it down
The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops them with a sweep of his arm
All bets are off
The two men stand from the table
Take several steps away toward the end of the alley
Stand facing each other
Two gunfighters
Flashes of the two men
piece of a black military boot
hand positioned over a six-shooter
Mirrored sunglasses
sweaty, trembling lip
And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day
The draw
It happens in an instant
The alley thunders with gunfire
The guns buck and flash
Then silence
The two men stand there for a beat, until one of them, the fat man, slumps, falls face first into the alley, dead
The crowd goes completely ape shit as   emerges from the shadows of the alley, holsters his guns, grabs his take of the money
Long hair
black eye-patch
tight-lipped grimace
The impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism
The toughest, most dangerous man on planet earth
legend
strolls out of the alley into the crowd
He counts his money, pockets it, as a cigarette girl approaches him stops her, pays for a pack of cigs
As she eyes him
' the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her fingernail
drop of blood appears
turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters rises from above in the night sky
The crowd suddenly starts to disperse
Helicopter searchlights blast down on the street
is suddenly caught in the glare
He starts to move away
Out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere
The net slams down on top of , trapping him, driving him down to the pavement with its weight
struggles inside the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers - rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it
More cops move for him as we
: "
1900 " -   -
- Searchlights sweep down across a column of policemen marching past a concrete wall
Camera begins to crane up the wall
Sound of roaring turbines
The howl of the Santa Ana wind
Camera reaches the top of the wall
Armed police troops stand on the battlements
Across what looks like an ocean is
The view is from the Newhall Pass
Hidden by the Santa Monica Mountains,
glows in the distance with a hundred fires
Smoke surges from the jagged horizon
Above, the sky is an angry orange
- Res sensor lights glow in evenly spaced intervals
Searchlights sweep into the darkness
Cannons are in place every 200 feet, manned by police guards
- Water stretches into blackness
This was once the San Fernando Valley, but now it's all underwater
Pieces of debris - tops of buildings, the tail of an airplane, a radio tower - stick up above the surface
We can make out the letters of an old, half-sunken sign: "   " - The wall stretches to the northwest up to the Santa Susanna Pass
Portions of the 118 Freeway arch up out of the water
-    - Firebase Seven is a fortified base camp in the San Gabriel Mountains
It is a sprawling police complex with low concrete bunkers, gun emplacements, satellite communications, vehicles, troops, the works
, opposite the main complex is Rotor City - row after row of black, multi-bladed, totally evil police battle helicopters parked like giant bugs on the ground
throng of policemen gather at the edge of Rotor City yelling and cheering, their fists in the air
Cops with camcorders videotape the event
police anchor reports
He's been the Force's Most Wanted Man for 10 years
Convicted of 27 moral crimes can tell you, the excitement around here is
(a great roaring skyward) Here he comes
7-, 40-   comes slamming down out of the black sky and lands
The growing crowd of cheering cops goes nuts like fans at a football game
They slap hands, dance wildly
-    - mammoth room filled with high-tech instrumentation
glowing holographic map of
fills one wall
Most of the control personnel have left their work stations and gather around  sets all showing the Police Channel: a view of the helicopter transport sitting on the asphalt and the cheering crowds at the edge of Rotor City
tall, steel-faced officer sits at his desk
This is Firebase Commander  " "
Hard, battle weary features
, a section Lieutenant, comes up
Commander Malloy
They're bringing him out, sir
Malloy rises from his chair, steps to a nearby  set, watches the scene from the Police Channel
So we finally got him
- The crowd of cops is growing to a frenzy of wild anticipation
Hold one
The door is opening
The door of the helicopter transport slowly lowers like a drawbridge
Out of its black belly comes
steel collar is clamped around his neck
Eight lengths of chain stretch to eight armed guards who escort Plissken down the ramp
Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care
line of battle-ready cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is marched into camp
An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police Anchor as he scampers along in front of , interviewing him
Hello, Plissken
Welcome to
Celebrating cops cheer as Plissken is lead to
- The bunker has one large opening, into which hundreds of deportees march
Guards in towers monitor the condemned as they trudge out of fenced-in containment areas, down walled corridors to the bunker entrance
The deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps, thieves, adulterers, atheists - the Morally Guilty, outcasts of society
Single mothers carry babies
Teenage runaways huddle together
There are abortion doctors, drug dealers, pornographers, the prisoners of a massive cultural war
As Plissken is marched toward the entrance, a loudspeaker blares out: (
) You are now entering the Deportation Center
You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United States of America
great cheer goes up from the cops as the Police Anchor conducts his interview
Bob Plissken
Special Forces, Black Light, Texas Thunder
Two Purple Hearts
Youngest man ever decorated by the President
Plissken's face remains so impassive as to be almost blank
-   - glowing, vaporous-orange corridor
More cops gather to watch Plissken as he is escorted into the bowels of the Deportation Center
You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes, Plissken
The murder of an Internal Revenue agent
The kidnapping of a bank president
Gun fighting for profit
The list goes on and on
-   - Deeper into the Deportation Center
Camera tracks along the deportees, some bleeding, some wrapped in rags
Plissken, the Police Anchor, camcorders and the armed escort move through the dark, low concrete passageway
You used to respect the law
Served your country like no man before you
Role model to a generation
The Police Anchor leans in as close as he dares to Plissken's face
What happened to you, war hero
You were the best we had
-  -   - Steel walls
Deeper into the Deportation Center
The deportees here are in worse shape
Some appear to be dead
Plissken and his entourage continue along, as the speaker echoes a pre-recorded message
(
) You are sentenced to permanent expulsion beyond the borders of the
You now have the option to repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises
If you elect this option, notify the Cleric Sergeant in your Processing Area
Plissken and his entourage pass deportees kneeling and praying in front of cloaked cleric cops, government holy men
Beyond, through opened doorways, see Death Row deportees being strapped into futuristic electric chairs
The whole world's watching
Every good and decent person who works and hard and follows the rules
What would say to them
Plissken's expression is blank
What would you say to all of us who believed in you, who looked up to you, who thought you stood for right over wrong, good over evil
Be my guest
What do you have to say, Plissken
(beat) Call me Snake
The guards move Plissken through a doorway, and the huge steel doors slam shut on the Police Anchor and the camcorders
-   - Malloy, Brazen, and a 3rd man, tall, charismatic, grim, move urgently along a corridor
ComStat did a psychosearch on him
Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities
He hit the bottom of the curve
Perfect for the mission
Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man
Zero emotional developments
Total lack of compassion
highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive
3RD Let's get this over with
- The cell door slams shut
Plissken turns around
Writ and leg irons
He looks around
In the concrete cell he sees a simple table with an overhead light above it
watch lies on the table
Plissken shuffles over, picks up the watch, examines it
The cell door opens
Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the room unarmed
The door closes
Malloy and Brazen move forward, to the edge of the light
The 3rd Man stays back in the shadows by the door
How you doin' Plissken
(no reply) You like the watch
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service
What'ya want
Malloy looks back to the 3rd Man in the shadows
3RD Get to it
Malloy raises a control unit, pushes the button
The lights go down and a computer-enhanced image appears on the wall
- From the point of view of a surveillance camera
The lab is huge
Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly areas
High tech
group of government officials is being given a tour
Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them
Pretty, virginal, she wears a "True Love Waits" button on her flowered dress
At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of government officials began a tour of the Livermore Defense Lab
The President's daughter, Utopia, was among them
Plissken continues to watch the image on the wall
An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to Washington
The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes
747 - From the point of view of a camcorder
Utopia stands inside the main cabin of a plush, government 747
In one hand she holds a black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on top
In the other, a machine gun
(to the camcorder) To the American people - it is time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror
At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane
We scanned the videotape on
Check it out
Inside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy presses a button
Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads out all around him
He is in a virtual reality re-creation
747 - Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin
group of secret service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates a camcorder
He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera
She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage
Today is Day One of a brand new world
The days of the empire are finished
(beat) To the President - my father, you know what this is
She holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it at the camcorder
You know what it will do
Unless you abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, will use it - on you
Utopia, please
Give us the prototype
If something should happen - It will be in my hands - and the hands of my lover
She says "lover" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can muster
The others are shocked
Yes, my lover
My man
The only real man 've ever known
'm on my way to his arms
She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small hatch in the floor, scrambles down
The  image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again standing inside the concrete cell
Malloy and Brazen stand in front of him
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device
We don't know how
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator
She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time
(hits a button) Somebody else was in there with her
In front of Plissken:  computer-rendered  picture of clouds and sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking
Garden of Eden
There, coming toward us, is
South American terrorist
Fiercest warrior of the Third World
He wears a gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet
Bandoliers strapped around him
Cuervo Jones
Shining Path
Peruvian terrorist
Runs the biggest baddest gang in
Cuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome, charismatic
He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to embrace it
The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's on a loop
The image disappears
The lights in the cell come up
Utopia made tapes of her  experiences, then tried to erase them
She missed this fragment on the end of her last tape
Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the master data bank - and then went prowling around for innocent blood, someone vulnerable to corrupt
Utopia was lonely, looking for something to believe in
Sad story
You got a cigarette
Shut up, Plissken
What's the little black box do
Top secret
Only on a need to know
And  don't need to know
So fuck you, 'm goin' to Hollywood
That's right, big shot
Unless you do what we want you're not coming back
So what's the deal, huh
Go into
, find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and 'm free
That's the deal
Tell the President to adopt
think 'll like
After a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and Brazen
He stares at Plissken for a moment, holds up some papers
3RD If you bring out the prototype, you'll receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in the United States
Just like in '97
Remember New York, Plissken
(looks at him) Who are you
It's the President, for Christ's sake
give you my word
Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man
can see you're real concerned about your daughter
Utopia is lost to me
My daughter is gone
Well, 'll think it over
You're running out of time
've been doin' that all my life
Might as well do it in
Everybody else there is
Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10 hours to live
Malloy, Brazen, and the President turn to leave
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about
Having second thoughts
Maybe
But you're not putting any shit in me this time
You don't understand
It's already in you
' As an image of the cigarette girl in New Las Vegas flashes suddenly
Her fingernail scratches his arm
He tightens
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop
She injected you with incentive toxin
Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream
It'll start to take effect in 9 hours
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus
Genetically engineered
100% pure death
Complete nervous system shutdown
You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig
Not a pretty sight
Plissken takes a step toward him
Malloy holds up a large hypodermic
Of course there's an anti-toxin
Neutralizes the virus immediately upon injection
(beat) We'll give it to you, but you have to do us this little favor
and then Plissken attacks the President, hurls himself across the room, throwing the chain around the President's neck
Plissken passes right through the President, causing his image to waver slightly, then falls on his ass
Didn't think we were that stupid, did you
The real Malloy, Brazen, and President stand in front of a laser camera in a small room offering a view of the cell through a transparent portion of the wall
We're holographs
Plissken stares at the three images in front of him, then at the camera lens on the wall
Get this crap out of me
guess we have a deal
Nice to be working with you, Plissken
(beat) Call me Snake
-   - Plissken checks through various tactical survival items and weapons laid out on a table
Brazen watches as Malloy show shim a high tech submachine gun
Very sweet little weapon
Core burner
Magnesium ammo
500 extra rounds
(moves on) Two 9mm handguns
(holds up a silver pill) Oral projectile
Mouth dart
Hold it in your mouth for ten seconds, the coating dissolves, it becomes a weapon
Malloy breaks open the silver pill
Inside is s small, lethal looking dart
Urolite
It'll stun the enemy for several seconds
Plissken picks up a small, computerized compass
Tracer
Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted in her arm
You can locate her with this
Brazen hands Plissken a large black clip
This clips right onto your 9mm
Ammo enhancers
Like miniaturized grenades
Blows through anything
Plissken snaps the clip onto his pistol, then unsnaps it
- Plissken suits up
Submachine gun, handguns, six-guns
He, Brazen and Malloy walk quickly across the complex
is in a constant state of warfare
Gangs fighting for the right to rule
Heavy Third World connections
They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south
Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre
- As Brazen's command helicopter takes off
- Plissken stares at a photo of the anodized prototype
'll need to know more about this thing
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence
Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon
Defense against what
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know
Plissken shrugs
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want
The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami
If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States
So what does this thing do
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a
m
-   - The Command helicopter lands near a large access tunnel inside the containment wall
- Plissken, Brazen and Malloy walk through the dark, dank tunnel
Armed guards stand at the ready
hatch in the tunnel floor stands open
ladder disappears down into the darkness
(points to the open hatch) You're going over by submarine
One-man submersible
Nuclear powered
Plissken arranges his gear, climbs into the hatch opening
Where do  put ashore
Cahuenga Pass
Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl
You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there
(beat) Once you go inside, you're on your own
(beat) You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you
(beat) We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason
So you want me to take her out
(Malloy nods) Is that an order from the President
Let's just say it's what's best for the country
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin
medical team will be standing by
Not you
No
Good
He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy
There's no damage
Malloy laughs
Thought you might try that
First clip is filled with blanks
Goodbye, Plissken
Malloy kicks the hatch and it slams down on top of Plissken
Brazen pushes a control button, sealing it shut
- Plissken climbs down the ladder into a small submarine bay
Below him on a launching rig is a sleek, black one-man submarine shaped like a dart
The submarine's hatch is open
Plissken climbs inside
- Plissken seals the hatch behind him
He has to lie flat on his stomach to operate the sub
He quickly hits various switches and buttons, powering up the cockpit
-    - Malloy and Brazen move to a surveillance-command post
(
) Com check
Malloy picks up the microphone
'm here, Plissken
- Plissken looks at the wrist watch
It ticks down ominously
Eight hours and counting down
(
) Stand by for launch
Ignitor
(Plissken pushes a button) Fuel rod injection
Plissken pulls a lever, watches his dials
deep humming sound grows louder inside the sub
She's in the green
(
) Lock fuel rods
(hits a switch) Locked
(
) Nuclear turbine to 75% power
Plissken turns a throttle-like control with his left hand
- Out of the rear tubes of Plissken's sub comes a roaring blue glow
75% power
(
) Hands on switches and counting
5

1
Launch
The rear tubes roar
Suddenly the sub is shot forward through a long, circular tunnel
Plissken braces himself as the cabin lurches, vibrates with the force
-   - door in the wall opens, revealing the circulator tunnel
In a roaring explosion, the sub rockets out of the tunnel, shot from the wall like a cannonball
The submarine is airborne for several seconds, then drops down, and slams into the San Fernando Sea
Plissken is rocked with the impact
He guides the sub with hand controls
In front of him on a screen is a schematic diagram of the underwater landscape of the San Fernando Valley
- 405  - In the underwater darkness, see the broken remains of the 405 Freeway, as the subs creams past, its nuclear wake churning in the water
-    - Malloy, Brazen and other cops follow Plissken's course on a gigantic computer screen
Plissken, watch your speed
Lots of obstructions down there
-     - As the sub rockets past the ruins of the Van Nuys City Hall, barely missing it
(
) Plissken
Plissken ignores him, carefully maneuvering the sub with his controls
(
) Plissken
do you copy
-    - Camera follows the sub as it streaks along just above the submerged ruins of the Ventura Freeway
See the ghostly shapes of cars, trucks, busses below, smashed and overturned
- They watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the freeway
Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%
&    -  - The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the Hollywood
sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads: "  55"
The sub screams past
- Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status
His reactor's starting to overheat
Plissken, slow down the sub
You're overloading the power plant
Plissken glances at the gauge
His nuclear turbine readout: green, moving to yellow, into red
He pushes it up to 102%
(
) Plissken
Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him
One the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right toward a building
Plissken pulls hard on the controls
-   -    - The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and wobbling
The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object
looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the currents
Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the Universal Studios Tour
The sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future, passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean
It slams into the open mouth of , shattering the model into a million pieces
The sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls - hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One
Plissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit through tiny cracks in the hull
-     - The sub suddenly tips upward, rising for the surface
-   - The sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside with a hard thump
Plissken presses the hatch controls
The sub begins to slide backwards down toward the water
Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out
The sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water
As the rear exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam
Plissken leaps out of the hatch
The sub sinks faster and faster
He scampers up the side, leaps for ground
and lands on the hillside, as the sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing
bleeping sound
He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the antenna
(
) Plissken
'm here
(
) Where's the submarine
It's disappeared off our screens
It's history
gotta go
Plissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the hillside when
Standing above him is a dark figure
Hooded
Carrying something huge and rounded at the ends
Plissken raises his submachine gun
as  steps closer
He's a surfer in a black wetsuit
Carries a surfboard
rifle is slung across his shoulder
Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the
Too bad about your boat, man
(Plissken doesn't move) Supposed to be some swells out here tonight
Big ones
(beat) You like to surf
Realizing Pipeline is no danger, Plissken moves past him up the hillside
You look kinda familiar
(beat) You hang out around here much
But Plissken's moved off into the darkness
-  - Plissken reaches old Mulholland Drive, now dark and desolate
Shells of houses stand nearby, black and empty
It has begun to rain
The sound of gunfire
Plissken ducks behind a tree
Two old cars come zooming up Mulholland, side by side
Windows down
Guns blazing at each other
They pass Plissken, continue down Mulholland, ripping each other apart with gunfire
Plissken darts across Mulholland, down the mountainside
-  - The rain pours down as Plissken makes his way down a steep incline
dark figure steps out from behind a tree
Plissken spins, submachine gun ready
It's Pipeline
Hey, man
know who you are
You're Snake Plissken
Man,  can't believe you're really here
More gunfire from above on Mulholland
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl
(points) Down that way
Plissken starts down
Be careful
Some real strange dudes hangin' out there these days
Plissken continues moving, now just a blurry figure in the rain
Hey Snake - what're you doin' around here, man
(as Plissken disappears) heard they busted you up real good in Cleveland
-  - The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way down the hillside
Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then stops
The trees drip with moisture
Suddenly, a huge  from above him
Plissken looks back
huge mudslide is roaring its way down the hill toward him
Plissken races down the hill, but the mudslide cascades downward like a freight train, catches up with him, sweeps him off his feet
and Plissken goes riding down the hill, rumbling and sliding in the mud
- The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out, slows
completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the goo
He's dripping with it
His one good eye shines in the moonlight
He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline when
() (
) Shut-up, fuck
Stop makin' noise
Plissken spins
He's standing right next to , the leader of the Black Cowboy Gang
Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle
He looks just like Charles Barkley
Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush
Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in
Take cover, fool
Plissken jumps behind a tree, looks down the hillside
'  - Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl
huge cross is on stage, and the cross is on fire
- group of white hooded men, the
, stand in front of the burning cross holding a ceremony
Next to the cross on stage, a hooded
string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto
Plissken reacts
Let's take him
Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others quickly race down the hillside
He fires
40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it rockets toward the burning cross and -
fireball blows pieces of the cross into the air
The
spin around
blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from the hills
They open fire
Grand Dragon is picked off his feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire hail of bullets hits the
They return fire, but are overwhelmed
They are hit, jerking and twisting
Fire from the Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts of lightning
The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it starts to rain again
Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight continues
Four
leap out from behind a row of seats and jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground
In a blinding flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying
As he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the rain is washing the mud off his body
, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is washed clean by the rain
Spinal raises his weapon, then stops
Hey
know you
Snake Plissken
Plissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand
Behind them, the firefight is almost over
The
scatter into the rain
Hey, what's going down, Snake
'm looking for somebody
Who ain't
Plissken pulls out his tracer
It is blipping red, just south of the Bowl
Say, is it true what they say about Cleveland, man
Plissken doesn't answer
He moves on through the rain
Later, Snake
Thanks for the help
You can always shift down and mojo with us anytime
- The ruins of the Capital Records building
The rain has stopped again
Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street
In the distance, the sound of thumping music
- Pandemonium
Music blares
It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is Like An Itchin' In My Heart
" Crowds dance in the street
It's like a block party
Black, Latino and Native American gangs celebrate
Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic
Plissken moves through the carnival
Gorgeous hookers stand under the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater
The marquee now reads: " ", "  ", " ", " " One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken
- Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff
polypropylene orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a small, pink balloon
She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the air
Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises
- is a caravan of vehicles
The crowd parts to let them through, cheering insanely
Plissken ducks into an alley, watches
The caravan passes Plissken's position
Two men on horseback lead a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard
Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired hooker joins him, rubs his arm
She has no polypropylene, at least none that we can see
It's winnin' time, baby
How about you and do some celebrating
What's going on
You must be new around here
(beat) You look familiar
Have  done you before
Plissken grabs the hooker
What's happening
Easy, man, easy
It's Cuervo Jones' gang
Mescalito Justice
He's the big boss man 'round here tonight
(whispers) He's gonna take down the police and make 'em kiss his fine ass
Plissken lets her go, stares
- is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels
Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of light and flicking them back into the night
Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least
And there next to him is Utopia
She's dressed in black lace underwear and bra, garters and stockings
Playboy fantasy
She holds the prototype
Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind her
He is huge and evil
Dressed like Pancho Villa
Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes
The hooker cheers along with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's moved off
Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan
Mescalitos ride with their women slung behind them
As the last bike passes, Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of the cycle, jumps on
The Mescalito biker turns to react
Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the bike, hops up on the seat
Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the other bikers, toward the head of the caravan
Plissken zooms along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan
- As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the corner
Coming right behind him are four Mescalitos on Harleys - chains, iron bars, and swords in their hands
Plissken stares up ahead
- is just a few feet away
Cuervo Jones and Utopia
Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either side of him
One of them swings a chain
Plissken grabs it with one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and fires
The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to the chain
Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire
He turns to see
As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain
Plissken swings his
The two chains snap together, intertwining
Then Plissken squeezes his hand-brake
He screeches to a stop
The Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own chain, off the Harley
Finally the Harley flops over, skids, explodes
Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac
Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken
They take aim at him with their automatic rifles
Plissken pulls a sudden wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the back wheel
The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other
They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement
Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on horseback who turns and fires
Plissken ducks and the bullet rips through the rear tire
The tire blows and the bike swerves out of control
Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the saddle
Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for control of the mount
Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst
Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the saddle, bouncing onto the pavement
Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head, pounding down on a biker
The lasso takes flight and finds it mark, the biker's neck
Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker
With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off, jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump
Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck
Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind
He swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk
Plissken climbs up to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car
Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps moving toward the Cadillac
Reaches out a car window and grabs Plissken's submachine gun
Plissken turns to snatch it back - Leaps from the Cadillac and takes Plissken down to the roof
Snake Plissken
They struggle
Cuervo raises his machete
Plissken grabs his wrist, flips him over, knocks the machete off into the street, smacks Cuervo in the face
- Comes roaring up on his bike, throws the bolas
As the bolas hit him, wrap around his neck, the balls thunking him in the face, sending him flying
Plissken hits the pavement hard
He skids, rolls, and at last slams into the edge of the sidewalk
The caravan rumbles away down Sunset
The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's submachine gun
Cuervo crouches on the roof, hissing at Plissken
Later, Snake
We finish it later
Lies there for several beats, then climbs to his feet
- disappears up Sunset
Stands alone in the deserted street
The ruins of a supermarket, cheap motels, liquor stores - all empty, desolate
He looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie
After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm handguns, slipping them into their holsters
- On the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the darkness beyond the intersection
slight wind blows litter aimlessly along
There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant clangs
Plissken approaches the intersection
He carries Utopia's compass homing device
It is silent
The small screen's blank
Then Plissken glances at his wrist watch
- Three hours gone
Plissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset
(
) Snake Plissken, right
He spins around
Sits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars sign in front of him
In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con man
He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life
Wow
Snake Plissken
Map To The Stars Eddie listens to   by Gogi Grant on a small, metal-plated portable radio
He clicks off the radio, rises, walks over to Plissken
You're a star in your own right, you know that
Hey, 'm Map To The Stars Eddie
How you doin'
Where'd they go
Man, 'd love to have your autograph, Snake
He searches around in his pockets, comes up with pen and paper
've been hearing about you ever since that New York deal back in the 90's
You're one smooth operator
(offers pen and paper) Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death's Head, one to Slasher Smith
Plissken grabs him by the throat
Where are they
Who
You mean Cuervo Jones
He's the man with the juice, Snake
Got the President's daughter
Setting up a citywide truce
Big doings
Plissken draws a 9mm and points it at Map To The Stars Eddie's forehead
Location
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly
Nice digs, too
've been there, y'know
Plissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps
On the device Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot
West
Nice little gizmo you got there
(whispers conspiratorially) Look, Snake
've got connections in this town
You need something, 'm your man
Without a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard toward Beverly Hills
Hey - you can't go there, Snake
You can't walk through Beverly Hills
Plissken's figure disappears
-  - The old Beverly Hills sign
It's been painted over in dripping red letters: " -   -  " Plissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark Sunset Boulevard
-   - Plissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset
Now they are dark, ruined
- As a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the wrist pulls aside a window curtain
The face behind the window is in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored features
The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie
(into walkie) Specimen moving west on Sunset
-     - Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive
The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his right
He stops, stares down Sunset
- Emerges from the shadows
This is the gatekeeper
Strange, mismatched body parts
black-skinned arm attached to a pale white body
His face is unnaturally smooth - too many face lifts
He carries a torch
Halt
(beat) Where are you going
(no reply) Are you here for the auction
Figures have suddenly moved out into the street, all with mismatched body parts - heads too large for their torsos, female body parts mixed with male heads, all sewn together with large, uneven stitches
Plissken is surrounded
Welcome to Beverly Hills
Plissken raises his gun, starts to move, when suddenly a figure rises behind him out of the shadows
- Raises a lead pipe, brings it down hard
' He goes out like a light
As Plissken slumps unconscious to the street, the figures move for him
Their arms lock around him, drag him away with amazing speed - a pack of wolves on a deer
-  - Plissken bolts awake, to find himself tied to a cross
It's lurching back and forth as though the ground is moving
-   - Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng of surgical failures
They carry torches
Dressed in tatters
Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly
Rodeo Drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts
The once beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles
Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice
Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together like sculptures in their windowfronts
giant rift runs down the street's center
Acrid smoke rises
The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is anchored in the middle of the street
Surrounding the intersection are patients of every size, age, sex
Plissken looks over, sees another cross being carried up and planted right next to his
beautiful girl is tied to this cross
This is , 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess
She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an  of around 50
Hi, Snake
It's so great to meet you
My name's Taslima
'm a fan of yours
Are you crazy
little bit
But pretty soon 'm gonna be dead
So are you, Snake
Plissken looks across the street
Our of the ruins of the once famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women facialists with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings wielding knives, saws, horrible-looking carving instruments
can't believe  got caught
(sighs) run with Midnight Jihad
Iranian gang
Only they kicked me out, cause  screw up sometimes
forget stuff
Plissken struggles with his bonds
left my boyfriend's place tonight, took a wrong turn
(sighs again) Oh, Snake, 'm really kind of out of it sometimes
come more interns and nurses carrying surgical pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts
The throng of facialists, patients, interns and nurses surround Plissken and Taslima on the crosses
They move back to the sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken and Taslima is about to begin
The gurneys are wheeled into place and set up as large cutting tables
The facialists take their positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat
What are they
They live here, used to be like us
But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly
The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again
(whispers) Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive
No screamin' shit
Oh no, it's the Doctor
Who
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills
, Steps out into the street
He appears incredibly gorgeous, a hunk of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination, he's got no lower jaw
Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work attached beneath each ear
It never moves
He can actually speak through a metal box attached to his windpipe
Stands in front of them
He raises his hands to quiet the crowd
He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before him
He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge
've never seen more beautiful specimens
There will be no auction tonight
These body parts will go to those who need them the most
The crowd gumbles
Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck
With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto his tongue, closes his mouth
The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward Plissken
What a beautiful blue eye
It's a shame you only have one
nurse brings over a small step-ladder
The doctor positions it in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face to face with him
The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good eye from its socket with his scalpel tips
Plissken spits the mouth dart
The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead
He freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding
He falls forward
The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the rope tied around Plissken's wrist
The rope's cut
Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off the step-ladder
Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time as the doctor hits the pavement
The patients are stunned
Motionless
They stare at their doctor lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly
Snake starts to run
Snake, help me
Why
don't know
Almost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free
Then he runs
Taslima follows him
Plissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees Taslima following
Don't follow me
You need help
Like hell  do
Then Plissken comes to a dead stop
- Comes a mass of patients right at him
Taslima grabs Plissken, pulls him with her
They take off down a dark cobblestone street
- Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives chase
They stop at another small alley between two large buildings
Down this way
They disappear into the small alley
-    - It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on either side
Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75 foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire
This is a dead end
(looks at her) You took us into a dead end
just thought you wanted to get away didn't know you wanted to go someplace
They turn
The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from his forehead
Behind him, the patients follow
Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window
Go
He follows Taslima through the window
- Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the balcony railing
torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting hangs crooked on a wall
Twenty foot high bright red letters - "" - lie strewn across the marble floor
Various offices are wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place
They stop at a dark hallway
Taslima moves cautiously ahead
Be careful of the bald cats
They live in these buildings
The what
Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands are trapped by the doctor's body
Closer and closer moves the claw dagger toward Plissken's good eye
Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two men
(yelling) Are you gonna stand there
Give me the gun
Taslima starts to hand it to him
Both Plissken and the doctor fight to reach it
Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp
He blasts three times - each one hitting
The doctor shudders, rolls away
Plissken gets to his feet
He blasts one more time for good measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway
-   - They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door
How do we get out of here
Sewers
Come on
She pushes open the door
- Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails rises
Patients swarm around the building in pursuit
Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street
Down there
Plissken lifts the grating
Taslima jumps in, followed by Plissken
- Dim, greenish light
Plissken and Taslima begin running down the sewer tunnel
Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving chase
Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain seeping with slime
They turn a corner into another tunnel, and run smack into a horde of patients
Instantly, the patients overpower them
Hands reach out and drag them down
Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld
It gets louder and louder
The patients freeze, then begin screaming and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping back down the tunnel
An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment
Snake - what is it
How the hell am  supposed to know
This is your damn city
Slowly, the light takes form
It is a single, gigantic eye - floating in pitch-black darkness
It continues coming - growing larger and larger
Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a blasting, ringing sound
Music
It's incredibly
From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart
On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an optometrist might use to advertise his services
Salsa music blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of the cart
At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask
lariat is hooked to his belt
He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down
He holds the gun on them
Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible
He is , a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask
He takes off the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye
He looks like Los Lobos' lead guitarist
What're you doing in here
Looking to get out
Good
want you out
This is my sewer
Which way
With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken
Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight
With it, he examines Plissken's face
You're Snake Plissken
Yes
Isn't he cool
There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished
Pendejo Bob extends his hand
An honor, Snake
Amigo
They call me Pendejo Bob
Plissken doesn't shake
From down the tunnel the shouts and footfalls of the patients gets closer
Those damn patients are coming back
You'd better climb aboard
Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart
Pendejo Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction
- The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage
The only light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle
use the eye and the music to scare em off
They're so whacked out, man, it works great
Chased a whole bunch of em right off the edge there a few months ago
He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the passage
(she peers over the side) How far down does it go
Don't know - never do hear em land
Earthquake opened it up
The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel
Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and sunglasses, line the walls
They watch as the golf cart passes
Up ahead is a door marked: "  " -   - The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control center
It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges and levers
few are still working - most are broken and covered with dust and grime
Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children, all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of sunglasses
Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade launchers - an amazing arsenal
Crates of explosives are stacked everywhere
The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off
own this whole place
Used to work here in the old days
was right in this room when the big one hit
What a mess
We were waist high in shit
(turns proudly to them) Everybody else ran, but not me
stayed at my post
Now it's all mine
brought my whole family, my amigos, down here to live with me
Gun runners
Hey, it's a living, baby
Why don't you get out of
Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil
(looks at Taslima) Earthquakes, death, shit
Why do you stay
don't know
Somehow,  just can't leave
'know,
's not such a bad place, Snake
We got our problems, sure - but this is paradise, man
Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to Plissken
Say, you need anything, Snake
Guns
Explosives
can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours
Yeah
So how do  get to Venice
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice
You have to go topside
Right up there
He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the darkness
line of men steadily climb up, one after the other, carrying crates of weapons
Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway
Just follow the signs
Get off at the Lincoln Exit, turn left
Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men
Plissken starts up the ladder, followed by Taslima
Nice to meet you, Snake
You too, Miss
You're welcome down here anytime
Anytime at all
- Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate
Taslima follows
The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in heavily-armed groups
They rumble off into the night
Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp
The freeway's over there
But, Snake - don't think it's such a good idea
Plissken starts toward the on-ramp
Taslima doesn't move
The freeways are dangerous
He keeps walking
Goodbye, Snake
Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile
It's as close to 'thank you' as he gets
Sun's coming up in a few hours
She walks up to him
's gonna be bad today
have a friend who's got a place near here
We can crash there if you want, Snake
(she moves close to him) 'd love to take care of you
Make you feel good
Without an answer Plissken turns and walks away
- As far as the eye can see there are lines of rusting cars and trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour
Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway
He strides past rows of junked cars
few of them have people inside
There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle
pickup truck full of old illegal aliens packed in like sardines
Someone cooks from a barbecue grill
An
An old man sits in the opened doorway, staring at Plissken as he passes
Two old ladies in housecoats stare at him through the windows
,
sound behind Plissken
He spins, 9mm ready
It's Taslima, running to catch up with him
changed my mind
'm going with you, wherever you're going
(gestures to the cars) What the hell is this
The freeway
know that
There are people in some of these cars
It's where they live
guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before
During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep
Plissken continues walking
Taslima catches up
What are you gonna do in Venice
Find Cuervo Jones
No
Stay away, Snake
He's mucho muerte
Suddenly a shot rings out
Taslima is struck and falls
Plissken drops between the cars and crawls over to her
Run, Snake
They're coming
Who
She touches his hand and looks at him softly
don't know
Taslima dies
Plissken stares at her for a moment
More shots ring out - landing very close to him
From out of the heavy bushes along the freeway storm a dozen Mescalitos moving quickly - firing as they go
Behind them grinds an ancient garbage truck mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun
Atop the truck is Delgado
He wears a flame thrower on his back
Returns fire, rolls under a car and begins crawling
All around him people jump out of their cars, begin firing back at the Mescalitos
Smashes through a rusting Volkswagen, heading straight toward him
Reaches the edge of the freeway, dives for the bushes
Roars past, firing into the vehicles on the freeway, the people running, screaming
- Clawing his way through the undergrowth, Plissken bursts onto a side street
Behind him come the Mescalitos on foot
Plissken runs, firing back every step of the way
Suddenly, in the blowing mist in front of him, a car screeches into view
It's a perfectly restored, 1966 Cadillac convertible
Candy-apple red
The stereo blasts "Last Night" by the Satellites
And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie
Hop in, Snake
As the garbage truck bursts through
Delgado is behind the machine gun, blasting away, burning up the street
Bullets are flying everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the back seat
He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke
Takes aim with his flame thrower
Shoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear
It streaks down the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves around a corner
- Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street
Plissken climbs into the front seat
Hey, Snake - that was great
They almost burned your ass off
Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself
Plissken is almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks
Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them
Finally, the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows down to a cruise of 70
Too many people know where you're going, Snake
That's not good
Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you
Delgado
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man
One tough hombre
You don't understand, Snake
Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island
We're on the move, man
Big time
- The Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old junked cars out of the way
- Plissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear
Stop the damn car
No way
said pull over
All right
Anything for you, Snake
(beat) Although  was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place
Plissken lowers the gun
Where is it
Right over there
He points
Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a button on the steering wheel with his finger
small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two- inch machine gun barrel
Before he can do anything, four rounds rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat
Grits his teeth and gasps
His gun drops
Blood runs from four holes in his shirt
His face grows red as he fights for air
Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel closes up over the barrel
Pretty neat, huh
This is Cuervo's car
He lets me use it sometimes
(looks at Plissken) Not to worry, Snake
You were just shot with a fun-gun
You feel it
Plissken gulps for air
Pure mesh, man
100-proof artery choker
Plissken slumps back, collapses in the seat
Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you down to one inch from death, that is living, man
'  - Kicks in hard
Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated streets of Venice
Plissken fights desperately against the drug, but he can't move
You should've talked to me first, Snake could've set this whole thing up
'm actually Cuervo's agent, you know
As Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's voice begins to fade
And 'd love to represent you, too
We could make a bundle together
know could really help your career
mean, you're a legend and all - but the last couple years, man, it's like you've fallen off the face of the earth
' As the world crashes to black
: - Like a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity of the  airport rises above the empty parking lot littered with the skeletal remains of burned-out cars and airport shuttles
The wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac
Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading: "  " ' Opens
Looks around fuzzily
- He is in Cuervo Jones lair
Huge
Torch-lit
Plissken lies in the center of the room, chained to a treadmill
He is surrounded by Mescalitos
In one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment
Computers
simulator
Most of the Mescalitos are gathered around a big screen
They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards from Carefree, Arizona
Cuervo Jones strides toward Plissken
Map To The Stars Eddie scurries along at his side
Come on, Cuervo
delivered him, didn't All 'm asking for is what you promised
We'll see
Cuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken
Sees that he's awake
Holds out a glass filled with red liquid
Carrot juice
(no response) Laced with tequila, Snake
Good for you
No
(no response) Your health
Cuervo Jones downs the carrot juice
Plissken lifts his head, grimaces
Sweat pours down his face
He gasps for air
You're coming out of it, Snake
It hurts real bad
(beat) That's good
He kneels down next to Plissken
Dying isn't good enough for you
You need pain
You'll never make it to where you want to go without a little pain
He stands, considers Plissken for a moment
Snake Plissken
American outlaw
So typical of American idealism
The old west, Snake
Cuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie
He's beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken
Man against the sky
The individual
Freedom
No wonder they hate you so much in America, Snake
You remind them of what they used to be
Cuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it
Beyond is a huge courtyard filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly, illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go
They are being fed and cared for by Mescalitos
Here is the real
, Snake
Plissken lifts his head to see
The poor
The old
The lost
People without hope
He crosses back to Plissken
Do you know what they want
One word
Liberation
(beat) They want a chance to live - before it's all gone
They've been hated for too long (smiles) Now it's their turn
He gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully unlocking him from the treadmill
Still wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet
As Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen
Still dressed in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss
She still carries the prototype with her
Cuervo
LaToya Jackson just won Best Actress
Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her
She holds on to it
You said  could hold it
He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected
Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken
Who's that
You never heard of Snake Plissken
Utopia takes a couple steps closer, squints
He doesn't look like his picture
(frown) bet he's fake
Now go get dressed
We have things to do
Are we going to eat soon
'm starved
Cuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia
Ooww
Go on now
Do as  say
Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal
'm going to show her what it means to be a woman - for the first time in her pathetic little life
(smiles) Given her love, Snake
Everybody needs love
He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close
You want to hook up with us
Join the revolution
We're all getting out of here tomorrow night
(holds up the prototype) We're gonna rule the world
Come with us, Snake
Plissken says nothing
His good eye glares
No
Too bad
Well,  told you we'd finish it later
So guess what
It's later
He motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away
- The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with machinery and hanging cables and wires
door opens and Plissken is hurled in
The door slams shut
Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man steps out of the shadows
It is Delgado
You're mine now, Snake
All mine
Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming machetes around his head
Plissken steps back, glances at his wrist watch
4 hours and 20 minutes gone
Shit
Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him
He just barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor
Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet
Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and wings it at Delgado
The machete is blocked with a direct hit
- Delgado is thrown sideways
Plissken runs, launches himself through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick right in Delgado's face
Delgado goes sprawling
One of the machetes  to the floor
Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises
Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws
The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest
He looks down at it in horror, then crumbles to the floor
- The caravan is starting up again
Wearing hot pants, a tank top and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on those monster truck wheels
The other Mescalitos mount up in their cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal
Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move
It's Plissken
He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the side
- Stands watching the caravan pull away
He doesn't see the wire dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it
Beat
Beat
Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the ground, takes his rifle
Plissken quickly moves down the dark street after the caravan
- Cuervo Jones' caravan comes rolling down Manchester, into a vast parking lot toward the Forum
Portions of the gigantic sports arena have been damaged in the earthquake, but crowds still pour into the entrances
The caravan pulls up at the Forum Club entrance
Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Map To The Stars Eddie and the others enter
Approaches, ducks behind an old junked car
- Plissken sneaks up to a crumbled, broken wall of the Forum, crawls inside through a large crack
-   - Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms
Hear cheering from the main arena
Slowly Plissken moves to a door, opens it, steps out
- The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy hallway
Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead
Plissken tenses
Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a body on a stretcher
As they pass, Plissken notices the body is wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes
He moves forward
- Plissken peers into the main arena
basketball game is underway
The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the other
They cheer wildly for their respective teams
Pipeline is in the crowd, enjoying the game
Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline
The whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting
Above his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down
There's blood everywhere on the floor
The referees wear bullet- proof body suits and helmets
Trainers with stretchers stand by
Ticks down: 5 - 4
Dribbles the ball towards the basket
Ticks down: 3 - 2
whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand and take aim
Pulls up into a jump shot, releases the ball into the air
It sails through the basket just as the horn goes off, beating the 24-second violation
The Black Muslim crowd cheers
The Korean Dragons sit down
Plissken watches
, Moving through the seats on the Korean Dragon side of the court
Map To The Stars Eddie stands near the baseline, listening to the game on his silver portable radio
Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard
The Korean Dragon dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off
The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off
Above Plissken's head ticks down: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1
Guard still has the ball - the shot clock horn has gone off - 24 second violation
whole row of Black Muslims with rifles stand up, take aim, and fire
The Korean Dragon guard is riddled with bullets
He falls dead on the floor
The Trainers with stretchers quickly collect his body and hurry off the court
Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops
(
) (sound of effect of breaking glass) Shot clock
The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming
" Love
" begins playing on the loudspeaker
The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot like the black leather that Plissken wears
One of the players, , notices Plissken
Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother Abdul
He was with you in Cleveland
The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand, thumping chests, high-fiving each other
Welcome aboard, Snake
But Plissken pays no attention
He sees: Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the court
- Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face
Utopia watches the game while the two men confer
Cuervo Jones has a firm grip on the prototype
The time is now
We are the strongest
If we go together, the others will come
(beat) We go for everything, Xi-Ping
But we go together
What do you say
Xi-Ping nodes
They clasp hands
Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court
He jumps into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good, cold eye
Your brother died owing me, so 'm taking it out in trade
need a favor
Sure, Snake
Anything
need to get across the court now
without drawing attention to myself
Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore thumb
But we'll do what we can, Snake
Use the clock
Screen and roll
Now let's kick some butt
The players knock fists
Plissken puts on a do-rag
Yelling, they move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken
(whispers) You play much pick-up ball, Snake
Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end
Whatever happens, watch the shot clock, man
The referee blows his whistle
Black Muslim guard inbounds the ball
The game is underway
Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover
They go into a set play
The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu
Players use slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands
It's full combat
The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him
Plissken knocks him flat
No foul
Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones
It's that weird guy again
Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit
Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them
when suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands
Snake
Shot clock
Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2
whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at Plissken
Cuervo Jones watches expectantly
Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot
The horn sounds just as it leaves his hand
Swish
Nothing but net
The Korean Dragons sit back down, put away their rifles, disappointed
Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their henchmen quickly leave
The Black Muslims go crazy, and Plissken dashes toward one of the exits
He stops, sees
With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding behind a crowd of Dragons
Plissken races through the crowd, grabs Map To The Stars Eddie
Hey, Snake, man
Great shot
Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw
Map To The Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry
Plissken grabs him by the collar, drags him off toward an exit
- Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their men rush out to the caravan of waiting vehicles
Xi-Ping has his own armada of vehicles and an army of evil-looking guards
Cuervo Jones pulls Xi-Ping aside
That man in black
He's very dangerous
- One eye
Yes
We gotta dump him
- What does he want
(glances at the prototype) 'm betting the cops sent him in
Man, do not need this
got a war to win
- As Plissken drags Map To The Stars Eddie out into the night, crouches behind a row of cars, watches Cuervo Jones' caravan start their engines
Plissken shakes Map To The Stars Eddie, waking him
Where are they going
(groggy) Oh, man
You didn't have to hit me, Snake
can help you
Plissken shoves the barrel of his pistol up against Map To The Stars Eddie's temple
Bankrupt City
The Happy Kingdom
(beat) Snake, Cuervo's hooked up with Xi-Ping
He is primetime, man - Mister Bad News
The rest of the city's joining up with 'em
(beat) You're shit outta luck, Snake
Plissken reaches into a pocket, comes out with the large black clip, slips it on his 9mm pistol
Not yet
could've helped you
We coulda made a deal with Cuervo
If you'd listen
Without looking, Plissken slams his elbow into Map To The Stars Eddie's jaw with a
He flops unconscious on the pavement
Cuervo Jones' caravan led by that huge Cadillac on monster wheels, moves away from the Forum toward an exit
Plissken moves after them, ducking behind the row of cars
The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit
Plissken appears behind an old truck, just as the Cadillac moves past him
He crouches on the balls of his feet, and as the rear of the Caddy drifts closer, he springs
And grabs on to the rear bumper
The monster wheels spin like huge, black scythes on either side of him
Plissken reaches under the Caddy, finds a purchase on the undercarriage, and swings under the Cadillac
He hangs dangling above the street by one hand as the caravan pulls out onto Manchester
With the other he raises his 9mm and aims it at the undercarriage, right about where the front seat should be
, , ,
- The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the driver and Xi-Ping instantly
In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia
The Caddy begins to swerve, the wheel spinning
Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the seat and grabs it
Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: , , , The front seat disintegrates
Metal, leather, padding fly everywhere
Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other
The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the Cadillac and hit the street below
The bodies of the driver and - Ping flop under the monster wheels
Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the opening that used to be the front seat
Cuervo Jones stares at him in total shock, but before he can speak
Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands
Then jumps into the back seat next to Utopia
Then grabs her and turns to the side door
Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab Plissken
But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia under his arm, slides across the seat
and sails out of the Cadillac
No
Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly
Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the Caddy
but fails
The Cadillac careens off the street, slams into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a hot dog stand
Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble
He still has a hold of her, and she fights him tooth and nail
Lemme go
The driver swerves, hits the brakes
and the car hops the curb, slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber
Are thrown forward
They tumble off the roof
across the hood
and land on the sidewalk in front of the car
They roll to a stop, as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the caravan suddenly puts on its brakes
Screaming tires
Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic collision
Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac
Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole in the street, pries it up
Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges into the street, pointing at Plissken
Kill him, kill him
Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole opening, and dives inside
just as the Mescalitos open fire
The street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot lead
- Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain
He gets to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through the water
The sound of gunfire echoes above them
Cuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the Forum
(grins to himself) Good thinkin', Snake
He heads off down the street
Plissken and Utopia race along through the water
He literally has to drag her with him
They turn a corner, go down another slimy drain away from the main tunnel
- The black belly of the sewer system
Plissken and Utopia move along, slow as they come to
, - One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our journey with Pendejo Bob
Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop- off, his eye burning into her
Her feet reach the very edge
Plissken holds her there
Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror
She gulps air in staccato bursts
Beat
Beat
Plissken can't do it
He can't push her off
He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims
My
father sent you
didn't he
(beat) He sent you to kill me
Plissken raises the pistol
She's dead in his sights
Didn't he
(begins to cry) But Plissken can't
He can't kill her
The toughest man on planet Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway
Shit
Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun
He stares at her
Get out of here
Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid
said go
Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken
She stares at the prototype in Plissken's hand
Don't take it back
Don't give it to him
Please
Let me have it
Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her
What does this thing do
(her eyes grow wide) No
Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh
He spins, drops the prototype
as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the sewer tunnel
He holds a gun in one hand, aims
He fires again, hits Plissken's leg
Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward
and snatches the prototype from the wet floor
Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound
He slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to raise it
So long, Snake
Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot
Plissken spins, and dives off the edge
down into the drop off
' Airborne
Falling through black space
Down, down, down, straight to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness swallows him up
Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel
Where is he
He jumped
Down there
(beat) He's dead, Cuervo
did it
killed Plissken
Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below
Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie
Give it to me
You said  could be Vice-President, Cuervo
Your right-hand man
(extends his hand) Give it
Sure, Cuervo, but look here
've done it all, man
killed Plissken,  got your girl back,  got it all
Just for you, Cuervo
Just for you
Dead silence
Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended
Finally Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the prototype
but slips on the wet floor
and drops the prototype with a
- red light comes on, blinks urgently
(tiny, filtered) am now armed and ready for use
Use extreme caution
The location of the effected blast area can only be determined by the orbital position of the SatStar Ring
Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move
Slowly Cuervo Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a smile
This is turning out to be my lucky day
(stares coldly at Map To The Stars Eddie) Get this asshole outta here
Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back along the tunnel
Cuervo, wait
Please
Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the drop-off
He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously, across the face
Utopia reacts to the stinging slap
Cuervo
You're my woman, you understand
You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight
tried
(in her face) Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones
Not unless you give your life
You fight till you're dead
Then  forgive you
(screams) Understand
(shakes her) Understand
Yes
He shoves her down the tunnel
Let's go
The others follow them
- As Cuervo Jones and Utopia emerge from the manhole cover, hear the sound of hundreds of helicopters rise
(looks up) Look, baby
They're all mine
- Above Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters
All models, all makes, mostly the older, discarded military Blood Phoenix 14-bladed attack choppers that scream through the blackness like scythe-slashing robot bugs
They are on their way southeast, toward Orange County
Looking out at
from above Mount Lee, see the Hollywood Sign, and wave after wave of helicopters thundering across the city
They're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to the sky
Chopper roar overhead
group of vagrants cluster around a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers
They're watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen
The sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building - the walls of the floors beneath have been torn away
Desk, furniture, rugs, everything hangs out over the empty space
- Pandemonium
Troops, vehicles, helicopters, everything is in urgent motion
loudspeaker voice blares: (
) Full stage battle alert
All personnel to battle stations
-    - Malloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into Command
The place is jumping
Full scramble alert
sky full of enemy choppers on radar
Moving over the city to the southeast
Officer rushes up to Malloy
Commander - massive vehicle and troop movement on the ground
All major streets leading to the southeast
What're they doing
Malloy looks at the President grimly
Getting ready to invade
(beat) So where's Plissken
Creaking
The  of something swinging through the air
huge blue eye opens
Looks around
Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh
And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness
Plissken's eye blinks
Begins to reveal details: slimy walls
Below, a black pit of hell
Wind gushing
And then a light stabs across the void
- The light hits Plissken's good eye
The light is from inside the eye of Pendejo Bob
He stands on a small ledge, at the mouth of a cave leading into the howling pit
Hey, Snake
You okay
(unhooks the lariat) heard gunfire down here
(begins to swing the rope) Never been down this far before
(swings the rope in a huge arc) Grab this
Pendejo Bob tosses the lariat
The noose flies across the pit, and Plissken grabs it with his good hand
Now hang on
Plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose, as Pendejo Bob jerks the line hard
Plissken is in mid-swing, and the rope jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction
Plissken's boot slips out of the wire mesh
And Plissken falls like a brick, stops abruptly as the line catches, and swings against the side of the pit
He dangles with only his one good arm holding on to the rope
Pendejo Bob pulls the line upward, straining against Plissken's weight
Slowly Plissken rises, a tug at a time, hauled up the edge of the pit toward the cave above
when suddenly he passes another opening, a storm drain below Pendejo Bob
He swings into the drain, grasps the side with his hand, and pulls himself in
Pendejo Bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of the pit
Hey, Snake
where are you
Plissken crawls into the slimy drain, pulls the rope off of him
Ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water
He turns on weak legs, back toward the pit behind him
Bleeding
Numb in one hand
His leg on fire
(yells) 'm in another opening
Storm drain
There may be another way up to you
Plissken crawls along the drain
The sound of rushing water gets louder
He comes to the edge of the drain
Right below him is another drain filled with water rushing through it like a river
Plissken is stuck
He turns, in great pain, and starts back toward the pit
when suddenly everything starts shaking
Booming
It's a small earthquake, a pre-shock
Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks, disintegrates
And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight
Stands silently above, listening
Snake
(no reply) Snake
Booming
The whole pit shudders, shaking
Another earthquake
Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the vibrating storm drain
-   - Black oil-slicked water rushes in the moonlight, out of a huge opening in what appears to be a canyon wall
As an arm shoots out, clutching the edges of the drain
Emerges from the hole, slides out, tumbles down to a water-filled canyon bottom
He lies there for a moment, trying to focus his eye
Stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg
Finally he rises unsteadily to his feet, looks around, trying to get his bearings
He finds himself at the bottom of
Straight down Wilshire Boulevard is an enormous canyon, a river bottom gouged out of concrete in the big earthquake
At least 30 feet deep, it is a vast trough leading past skyscrapers and buildings above, off into the distance
Plissken warily glances at his watch: 1 hour 10 minutes to go
Suddenly Plissken is struck by a pair of headlights
Pipeline's dune buggy comes bumping along the canyon bottom, sloshing through water, pulling up next to Plissken
Snake
Saw you at the game tonight
Great shot
(stares at him) You look like shit
Plissken hobbles over to the dune buggy as Pipeline gets out
You feel those pre-shocks, Snake
Pipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear of the buggy
He lifts one down and slings it under his arm
Could be a big one comin' any minute now
Where's
Cuervo Jones
Long gone
You'll never catch up with him now, Snake
Where
Anaheim
Headquarters for everything
The whole town's gonna be there
Things changin' fast around here, Snake
It's not the same as the old days, man
thumping sound skyward
More choppers thunder over them, on their way southeast
Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand
Take me there
But he's too weak
His hand slides off
Plissken sinks to his knees
Pipeline stares at him
You ain't doin' so good, Snake
You need help
(bends down, helps Plissken to his feet) You should talk to Hershe
She hates Cuervo
They used to be partners, but they split up
Who
Hershe
She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat
Down that way
Pipeline points down the canyon to the east
She's connected with the Black Cowboys, and they don't take shit from nobody
Suddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins
The canyon starts to shake
The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly
Yo', man
It's a big one
And the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer
The walls of the canyon crack
Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground
Skyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake
Pieces of the building sheer off, fall
parking garage caves in
Thunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline
The canyon floor splits open
Water pours into the cracks
Huge boulder-sized chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls
And then suddenly it all stops
The booming subsides
The earth stops shaking
Plissken and Pipeline get to their feet, look around
The water around them continues to slosh about violently
Tsunami, Snake
His eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to Plissken
Surf's up big time
Now there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west behind them:  bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on its way
Pipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands
Get ready, Snake
It's gonna be some kinda ride
Plissken looks behind him
- Is blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them
It is a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a thunderclap
Plissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over to Pipeline, kneels down
Let the front edge pick you up
Don't get on your board till it peaks
Behind them, the tsunami slams along the canyon, coming right for them
Don't lose it, man
You slip off your board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know what  mean
The roaring is so loud it's like being on the inside of a cannon barrel
The tsunami is 100 feet away
75 feet
50 feet
25 feet
It rolls up right behind them
Hang on, Snake
(yells) Of the tsunami sweeps under them
Pipeline and Plissken push off from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a cow catcher on a train
The water sweeps them up until they disappear under the blackness
Until suddenly Pipeline pops up on top of the tsunami, riding on his surfboard, arms outstretched, feet braced
And then Plissken pops up beside him, surfing clumsily on top of the tsunami wave, kneeling on his surfboard
They blast down Wilshire Canyon at 80 miles an hour
Plissken is wobbly on the surfboard, but he manages to stay on top of the wave
Finally, he gets the hang of it, glances over at Pipeline, who grins from ear to ear
Awesome, Snake
, man
Plissken looks up ahead
- Five feet from street level
An old van speeds along what's left of Wilshire Boulevard, right on the canyon's edge
It veers around debris in the street, changes lanes suddenly, hell bent for leather
Plissken and Pipeline move closer and closer to the van as the tsunami sweeps them along
Now they move alongside the van and Plissken stares over
- Behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie, driving like a lunatic, his teeth bared and set, madder than shit
Plissken's eye widens, burns
(to Pipeline) See you later
And suddenly Plissken shifts his weight, and the surfboard tips and slides sideways, across the surface of the tsunami all the way over to the edge, right next to the van
Map To The Stars Eddie glances to his left
- Is surfing the tsunami not 10 feet away from him
Map To The Stars Eddie stares in absolute horror
Plissken tips the board again, and slides another 5 feet closer
Jams the pedal, and the van screams forward
Stands up and leaps from the surfboard
For a moment he is airborne, leaping across the gap to the van
and slams into the side of the van
He grabs on to the roof, hangs on with one hand, his body whipping against the rocking, bucking side
Map To The Stars Eddie starts swerving, trying to throw Plissken off
- The van shoots back and forth across Wilshire, Plissken dangling inches from the tsunami-filled canyon
Plissken pulls himself up and crawls onto the roof
Map To The Stars Eddie pulls his gun, cocks it
When suddenly Plissken's hand snakes down from the roof, reaches in the driver's window, grabs his hair, and slams his forehead into the steering wheel with a
Map To The Stars Eddie goes out like a light
He slumps over in the seat
but his foot is stuck on the accelerator
Plissken grabs the wheel with his left hand, and manages to steer the van from the roof
The van lurches wildly, hits a chunk of concrete in the street, skids, fishtailing violently from the impact
It smashes against the curb, screeches and bumps along concrete
Map To The Stars Eddie's foot is bumped right off the accelerator, and the van slows to a wobbling, grinding stop
Plissken slowly climbs down from the roof, opens the driver's door, shoves Map To The Stars Eddie out of the way, and jumps in
- Plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down Wilshire
Map To The Stars Eddie starts to come around
Plissken grabs his gun, cocks it, puts the barrel up against Map To The Stars Eddie's temple just as he comes to
Listen up
need directions
Downtown
Somebody named Hershe
Sure, Snake
No problem
(groggy) You gonna kill me
Later
couldn't help it, Snake
had to shoot you
Cuervo made me do it,  swear to God, man
Cease fire with the bullshit
Right
Keep goin' straight
Two blocks down, turn right
Cuervo Jones' image fills the screen
He addresses the camera, holds the prototype in his hands
Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours
Have the news media standing by for my coronation
'm arriving in style
from the  screen to reveal we are in
-   - Malloy, the President, Brazen, and the other Controllers and Police Personnel stare silently at their  screens
He must be bouncing the signal from one of our communications satellites
That means CableNet has already picked it up
This thing's going live all over the country
(on the ) It's a brand new day comin' up this morning, and 'm just so proud to be leading the parade
See you soon, putos
The image blinks off into static
grim silence
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr
President
(the President nods grimly) Shall  begin evacuation
Does he know how to activate it
Well, yeah
All you have to do is push the button
What about Plissken
He could still be - Forget him
He's dead
That may not be true, Mr
President
(beat) He's one tough case
Plissken's been dead so many times  can't count
But he never stays down
long beat
There are two choices, Mr
President
Wait for Plissken, or surrender
It's your decision
The President sighs heavily
- Jammed next to the remains of the Bonaventure Hotel is the Queen Mary, permanently dry-docked between the broken skyscrapers by the Big One
The van stops next to a huge hole in the side of the ship
- The glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship
- They walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops
Their glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable dirt
- They enter a long, narrow corridor
At the end is a doorway
There is light in the room beyond
- Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas jets on the walls
In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool
heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over everything
At the far end is a group of people
Spinal and the Black Cowboy Gang
Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns
Mojo Dellasandro
Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor
brutal, scowling face
And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us
Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach
Hey, Hershe
How're you doin'
The woman turns and faces them
This is , an absolutely drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice
(eyes brightening) Hershe - it's Snake Plissken
Yeah, Hershe
brought him to see you
Plissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the transvestite
need a favor
What's in it for me
Plissken stares, a glimmer of recognition on his face
Wait a minute
know that voice
(beat) You're Carjack Malone
Not anymore
You two know each other
Plissken is seething
Hershe remains calm, glacial
You owe me
You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland
(astounded) Hershe, you were in Cleveland
Yeah
With me and Texas Mike 'Shay
was called away on urgent business, Snake
Don't lie to me
All right, so  made another deal
got a new deal for you
Plissken raises Map To The Stars Eddie's gun, aims it right between Hershe's eyes
You help me, you live
The others tense, hands on guns
wouldn't be doin' that, Snake
We have a little arrangement
Anything happens to me, you're dead
'm already dead
(long beat) see your point
What's the favor
(looks at his watch) Get me to Cuervo Jones
Get me to the Kingdom
got one hour
Dream on, blue eye
Say goodnight, Carjack
Plissken cocks his gun, starts to squeeze the trigger
Wait a minute
All right
Hold on
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies
No one gets near him
And he's got the prototype
And the girl
He holds all the cards
Exactly what is this prototype
What does it do
You push the button, it sends a signal to a ring of space defense satellites
They're orbiting bombs
Nukes
They explode
Huge space burst
(beat) Electromagnetic Pulse
It happens instantly when a nuke is airburst shuts down every power source below the satellites - instantly
All electrical devices, computers, cars, airplanes, cities
It's the dark ages again
So whoever has it runs the show
They were gonna use it on South America, Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the United States
Only Cuervo's got it now
And that ring of satellites will be in position over the
at 5:00 a
m
this morning
How do you know all this
used to represent the guy who invented it
swear to God, Snake
No bullshit
long silence
So what's the deal, gorgeous
We get the girl and the prototype
And we get out
All of us
Yeah
Me too
(stares at him hard) We'll see
Why should we leave
love
Where we gonna go
What's the payoff
'd like to get out but  don't have enough money
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars
Yeah
Greenbacks
got ten million of them
Uh-uh
Bluebacks
This gets everyone's attention
Aw, come on, Snake
Bluebacks
'm not bullshittin'
swear to God
don't know, sounds thin to me
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world
(grim) No, that sucks
(beat) How are we getting out
don't know yet
Shit
You always were a loser, Plissken
Makin' things up as you go along
That's why cut out on you in Cleveland
You're just a bum like the rest of us
Smoke has begun to drift into the pool area
(a soft voice) Use the air
They look at him
They're burning
Santa Anas
The night wind
What're you talking about, Mojo
Death from above
- Plissken, Hershe, Map To The Stars Eddie, Spinal and the Black Cowboy Gang stand on the top deck of the Queen Mary
Mojo Dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig
The wind whips around them
The hillsides in the distance are on fire
They look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the deck
The wind picks up Map To The Stars Eddie's rig
He bumps up and down, side to side, buffeted wildly until Mojo Dellasandro brings him back down to the decking
don't know about this thing
Don't like it, don't come
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy
As Mojo Dellasandro passes out various weapons to the men, Map To The Stars Eddie leans over to Plissken, their hang glider rigs thumping clumsily into each other
Eddie holds up that small, metal-plated portable radio he was carrying when we first met him
got an idea, Snake
(shows Plissken the radio) This looks like the prototype, right
Yeah, kinda
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo
If he lets you get close enough
The wind's up
Let's go
The men brace themselves
Map To The Stars Eddie looks like he wants to die
Hershe looks over at Plissken and grins
See you in hell, Snake
If 'm late, Carjack, don't start without me
With that Plissken launches himself off the deck, sailing out over open space, then down toward the street
Gliding through the air, as the wind picks him upward
He arcs away from the street level, up toward the remains of the downtown skyscrapers
Behind him, one after another, the group takes off into the wind, diving, rising with the wind
Map To The Stars Eddie makes a rapid suicidal dive right down toward the pavement below
He screams like a madman until the wind lifts him at the last possible second
- The group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings
bracero family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a sheer precipice, as the side of the skyscraper they live in has been torn off
They wave to Plissken as he passes
Two floors down, someone has hooked up huge speakers and a croaking male voice is singing a Barbra Streisand hit to a background track
beautiful girl in a sheer diaphanous gown dances far out on a narrow girder, waving a scarf at the moon
Plissken and the others now fly in formation, like avenging bats through the night, except for Map To The Stars Eddie who keeps rising and plunging violently, barely in control
- An army of vehicles and people pour into Disneyland - but it's a Disneyland gone to hell
huge sign reads: "  " The gates no longer exist
The overhead tram lies broken on the ground
Slowly vehicles drive straight inside
battered old limousine carries Cuervo Jones and a grim-looking Utopia past the ruins of the train and around the ghost-town square of Main Street
Ahead is the fairy castle, broken and crumbling, like some relic from a nightmare
Around it are the thrill rides, tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force of the original earthquake
Crowds are waiting
Gangs of every conceivable description
Ethic gangs
Female gangs
Gangs of children
Also families with hangers-on
As soon as the limousine appears, the crowds begin cheering
- Cuervo Jones stares out at the masses
They're simple people
They love a party
(turns to Utopia) We're gonna throw them one hell of a party when we get to America
Right
Utopia is silent, sullen
Cuervo raises his hand to her and she jumps, cowering
Put a smile on your face
terrified smile spreads across Utopia's face
- As the limousine inches down Main Street, suddenly a wall of headlights pop on
100 or so battered old vintage Chevys rev their engines, begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic lifts
Gangs begin cheering, firing their weapons into the air like New Year's Eve
At the end of Main Street is a huge open area - almost an arena, beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters
As the limousine stops, and Cuervo Jones emerges, Utopia on his arm, the cheering begins, a wall of sound through the park
Three Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo, dressed in turban-like headgear and sunglasses, wearing black capes and carrying old Thompson machine guns
They stop, give the right-handed power salute
One of them, , speaks to Cuervo
Cuervo Jones
Welcome, my Brother
Cuervo Jones turns to the crowd, extends his arms
Are you ready for the New World
And the loudest, longest cheer you've ever heard goes up
- Plissken and the group sail through the sky like silent avenging angels toward Disneyland below them and several miles away
Glances at his wrist watch
Only 20 minutes left
Map To The Stars Eddie swings wildly over in his direction, manages to stabilize his glider for a few moments
Is that what  think it is
Yeah
The place kept changing owners
Finally went bankrupt
That thing in Paris killed 'em
Hershe and Spinal sweep over next to Plissken and fly in close formation
Snake
We need some kind of diversion
beat later all of them look over at Map To The Stars Eddie
-   - Cuervo Jones leads Utopia toward a large attack helicopter out in front of all the others
The choppers are all starting up, roaring, blades turning
Suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes Cuervo Jones and Utopia
Cuervo
Hey, man,  made it
made it
Wait for me
Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food restaurant -
beat or so later he staggers out of the rig, dizzy and confused
Hey Cuervo
Cuervo Jones turns to Bivouac
Would you please kill him for me
My pleasure
Bivouac raises his machine gun
Cuervo, wait
got news
There's about to be an attack
Cuervo holds up his hand, stopping Bivouac
Everyone tenses
Map To The Stars Eddie races over
You're about to get hit, Cuervo
It's Plissken
You told me he was dead
thought he was, but he came back
Where
Map To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath, looking like he may faint
Oh Cuervo
(long beat) What
(stalling) It's so good to see you again
Where's Plissken
He's
near
You're stalling, Eddie
(grabs him) Talk, you little gringo
(eyes wide) Cuervo, look out behind you
Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him, and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand
At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an old storefront behind Cuervo Jones
The place is shredded
Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches
You've lied to me for the very last time
Cuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The Stars Eddie's face
No, not the pistol
huge explosion rocks Main Street
Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys dive right down across Main Street
Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover
Spinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it
Explosions erupt everywhere
Cuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead helicopter when
Plissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force
Cuervo, Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap
: Chaos and pandemonium
Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping hellfire from his automatic rifle
People running
Explosions
Map To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia
Plissken and Cuervo Jones get to their feet and have at it
Through flames and running people Plissken and Cuervo battle
In Cuervo's hand is a long black knife
Just as he's plunging it, Plissken steps aside and grabs him
Locked together, they battle savagely
The knife cuts Plissken's chest
Cuervo moves for Plissken's throat
Plissken smashes him in the face
They both grip the knife in a deadlock
From above, Spinal dives down and hurls a grenade
Cuervo and Plissken disappear in a huge flash of fire and smoke as the grenade erupts out of the pavement nearby
When the smoke clears, three things are on the ground
Plissken
Cuervo Jones
The prototype
Instantly Plissken and Cuervo dive for the prototype
Plissken has it, kicks Cuervo in the face, drags himself to his feet and takes off running (as fast as a man can run with one bullet in his leg) Map To The Stars Eddie drags Utopia toward the lead helicopter, as Hershe comes in for a landing
Spinal comes in for a landing, continues to throw grenades
The other Black Cowboys land, provide covering fire
Plissken races for the chopper
Behind him, Cuervo Jones is on his feet and in pursuit
Hershe opens fire at Cuervo
Cuervo dives behind a smoking, burning Chevy
As everyone scrambles in
Black Cowboy is hit by gunfire, slides down the bulkhead and out the door
Plissken jumps in the left seat, takes the controls
Utopia and Map To The Stars Eddie both climb in the right seat together
The others are in the back, firing back at the gangs
Plissken pulls in power
- The needle's at 100% plus
Full power
The lead chopper shudders, trying to get off the ground
Gunfire continues
The ship shakes violently
She's overloaded
We're too heavy
(screams from the rear compartment) Somebody get off
(glares at him) Who
All eyes quickly move to Map To The Stars Eddie
Bullets rip through the windscreen
- Is moving, through the smoke, charging the ship
The ship trembles
Plissken moves his feet, jams in the left tail- rotor pedal all the way
Rotates, turns around 180 degrees on the ground, pushed by the tail rotor force
As Plissken inches it forward
Begins sliding across the ground, skids grinding along the pavement, sparks flying - slowly at first, now picking up speed
In the cockpit, the ship lurches and jumps and slams
Everyone is bounced around
The helicopter moves fast now - faster - As they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a foot - Cuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper
As it lifts - five feet - climbing
The helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's sprinting figure
See the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer
Hershe leans out the door
We're not gonna make it over the fuckin' mountain
The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15 feet
10
Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way
8 feet
5
The helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge
horrible cracking sound, and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging half off the ship
On the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off into the sky
Finally Cuervo's chopper lifts off
- An alarm horn sounds
Everyone is on the move
-   - crowd surrounds a computer screen with a small green blip moving over a grid of
Aircraft leaving the island, sir
It's passed into restricted space, heading this way
Malloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances
Is it Plissken
Nobody knows
Commander, 'm getting radio contact with the aircraft
Boost it
The  Officer flips a switch, and we hear Plissken's voice booming through
(
) Get ready, shitheads
We're comin' in
Thank God
(grabs a radio mike) Plissken - this is Malloy
Do you have the prototype
- (into his radio) Yeah,  got it
Plissken glances at the transistor radio in his hand, shoves it in his boot, reaches his hand out to Map To The Stars Eddie
(to Map To The Stars Eddie) Now give me the real one
Utopia stares into Plissken's eye
Map To The Stars Eddie shrugs innocently couldn't make the switch, Snake
don't have it
Suddenly Utopia reaches into Map To The Stars Eddie's coat and pulls out the real prototype
She hands it to Plissken Now we're even, Snake
Map To The Stars Eddie makes a lunge for it, but Plissken whacks him in the face
His head bobs slowly back and forth for a moment, then he slumps in the seat
-   - Malloy set up in the staging area for landing
Commander Malloy - he's got lots of company
Malloy and the others look at the computer screen
Plissken's green blip is followed by hundreds of other green blips all rapidly closing in on him
Battle stations
The room springs into action
- think we've burned off enough fuel
We may be lighter enough to hover
Just barely
Can you land
No
The right skid's broken
If  try to set it down she'll crash
have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off
(beat as Plissken looks at Utopia) Hey, Carjack
We gotta hide the girl
Give her your dress
(ice cold) My name is no longer Carjack
Will you please get that through your fucking head
Holy shit
They look, as suddenly the night sky on either side of them is filled with gang helicopters
- The lead helicopter is surrounded by enemy choppers
Above, below, on either side
Right next to Plissken, Cuervo's chopper pulls up just ten feet away
Cuervo grins out at Plissken evilly, unhooks himself from his seat
On the other side, another chopper with Bivouac and the Black Muslims pull up
In the rear compartment, a Black Muslim aims what looks like a huge harpoon gun mounted to the floor
The line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the side of Plissken's chopper, the prongs clawing in, holding
In the lead helicopter, the Black Cowboys, Spinal and Hershe aim their weapons
Don't shoot
They can drag us down into the sea
Cuervo Jones leaps from the opened door of his chopper, flies through space, lands on Plissken's door with a
He smashes through the side window and grabs Plissken
Gang choppers open fire, riddling the rear compartment with bullets
Spinal and several Black Cowboys are hit
Plissken fights Cuervo through the door
(to Utopia) Take the controls
Utopia stares at him
What do  do
But Cuervo wrenches the door open, grabs Plissken, and pulls him out of the seat
Utopia grabs the controls
The lead helicopter goes wild, lurching and swinging and dropping
Plissken and Cuervo are locked in a death grip, hanging on to the doorway, one foot in, one foot out
Plissken embraces Cuervo and throws them both over the edge
They fall through space, locked together, until
They are jolted to a dead stop, swinging in mid-air, Plissken's arm wrapped around the dangling right skid
The lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings, Plissken and Cuervo suspended below, struggling to the death, whipped back and forth by the helicopter's gyrations
In the cockpit, Utopia grabs the controls
The ship is shaking, swinging like a pendulum
Hershe is hit with gunfire, flops in the rear compartment
Map To The Stars Eddie slowly regains consciousness, stares in horror at Utopia
Where's Plissken
Outside, Cuervo clutches Plissken around the neck, struggling and thrashing
Plissken head butts him, dazing him for a second
-
The dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on the helicopter above
Plissken and Cuervo Jones stare up, then at each other, then both begin pulling themselves up the skid, climbing hand over hand, in a desperate race
Both men reach the bottom of the helicopter and leap across to the left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the San Fernando Sea
Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other
Plissken slides away from him, looks up
sees the grappling hook stuck into the side of the helicopter
Plissken swings up, straddling the skid
He reaches up and begins prying loose the grappling hook
Cuervo's coming right up behind him, reaching for him, a huge knife in his hands
He raises the knife - when Map To The Stars Eddie leans out of the cockpit door, lowers a gun and aims it right at Cuervo
Hey, Cuervo
Cuervo looks at him, starts to say something, eyes bulging
If you get to America - let's do lunch
The shots hit, and Cuervo buckles, falls backwards off the skid, plunging downward toward the surface of the San Fernando Sea
Plissken rips out the grappling hook
Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the water below
Plissken jumps back inside the cockpit
Snake, look
Police battle helicopters thunder toward them
In unison, the police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms
Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness and hit enemy choppers
The sky around the lead helicopter is filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water
It is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet
Huge black police gun ships circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and rockets spitting blue-white fire
The pound the living hell out of the enemy choppers
In f
g
Plissken's helicopter sweeps over the wall
- Malloy, the President, Brazen and the rest the Firebase watch as Plissken's helicopter approaches, then zooms right over Rotor City and heads for the distant treeline
Where the hell is he going
- Plissken's helicopter comes in, lower and lower, into a hover five feet above the ground
Inside, Plissken pulls in all the power he's got
It's taking all the power we've got to hover
- Shows 100% plus power
The helicopter is in a trembling hover
Inside
Jump out
Head for the treeline and disappear
Utopia stares at him
Go
Utopia jumps out of the helicopter
lands on the ground and takes off running into the darkness
Inside
All right, baby
Don't be too rough on me
We're gonna land
Plissken slowly drops the collective control
The left skid sets down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll
Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself
As the blades hit the ground, the chopper goes wild
The fuselage jumps and twists in a grinding fury
Smoke and debris fly
The blades snap off
- Looking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen, barely missing the top of Plissken's head
Plissken is splattered with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part of his biceps
Blood pours
The rear compartment explodes into flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank
Fire billows into the cockpit, engulfing Plissken
Outside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door
He is on fire
Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the flaming mid-section of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball
Plissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded
as Malloy, the President, Brazen, and a squad of police arrive in vehicles
They slowly get out
as Plissken limps toward them
Where's the anti-toxin
Give me the prototype
Plissken reaches into his boot, hands it to the President
Hold it, Plissken
Now give us the real one
Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To The Stars Eddie's transistor radio
The President hurls the real prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony
Plissken glances at it lying on the ground
Nobody moves
Plissken looks at their faces
Give me the goddamn shot
Suddenly everyone begins to smirk
couple cops laugh
It was all a fake, Plissken
Plissken stares at him
More laughter
You were injected with glucose
There is no Plutoxin 7 virus
You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you
'mon, Snake - it's
Everything's phony, you know that
Plissken moves toward the President, stops inches away
Relax, war hero
We took you for a ride, and you came through
Not bad for a dirtbag like you
You're free, Plissken
But if you even so much as break wind on a country road 'll crush you like a bug
The President glares at Plissken, turns, walks away
(
) Commander
(Malloy looks at him) Look what we found
Across the clearing come two policemen dragging Utopia along with them
They bring her up in front of Malloy
Utopia glances at Plissken
You didn't finish the mission, Plissken
We'll have to do that for you
Plissken, Malloy and Brazen watch as Utopia is taken away
Finally Plissken turns to Malloy
Got a smoke
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake
The United States is a no- smoking nation
No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language
It's a brand new day for you, Snake
The name's Plissken
Plissken walks away
Follow his feet as they stop next to the prototype lying in the grass
-  -   - Utopia is being strapped into an electric chair by her police guards
The guards step back from Utopia
One of them walks over to a huge switch on the wall
- He holds the real prototype, calmly pushes the button
- The ring of space satellites hover silently above the Earth
See the United States, North America below, as a beautiful sunrise is beginning
Suddenly the satellites explode into white
- As the sky is lit white
Malloy, Brazen, and the cops look up
All vehicles stop
Lights out
Sounds of motors running down
-  -   - Darkness
No power
Everyone looks around
Utopia smiles
- The daylight is coming as police helicopters fall from the sky, crashing
Panic
Policemen run everywhere
duty sergeant races up to Malloy
We're being attacked, Commander
The north wall
- All of
has arrive at the wall in boats
Gangs lean ladders, use ropes and hooks - they scale the wall
Pendejo Bob leads the charge
Pipeline is right behind him
- Gunfire
pitched battle as cops try to repel the horde of
invaders as they pour over the wall
- The Firebase is overrun by invaders
Hand-to-hand combat
World War  has begun
Panicked cops race for the trees, abandoning their positions
-  - The Third World warriors free Utopia from the electric chair
She joins them as they swarm through the halls
-   - Plissken is at the edge of the Firebase, moving out into the hillside
Camera tracks with him towards the rising sun
smile crosses Plissken's face
He tosses the prototype down a ravine, and walks away into the sunrise
