Written by David Lindsay-Abaire Screening script 9/6/12 125 - (
) Darkness
That's the first thing remember
It was dark, and it was cold
And  was scared
The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of light, refracted through water, which turns into
- The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above begins to spider-web and crack
- Snow-covered trees in every direction
The ice in the pond continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense moonlight
This is   - thin, pale, barefoot, his tousled hair frosted white
(
) But then
then  saw the moon
It was so big and it was so bright, and it seemed to chase the darkness away
And when it did
wasn't scared anymore
Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up underneath him
(
) Why  was there, and what  was meant to do - that 've never known
And a part of me wonders if ever will
Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight as it dims a bit
Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something with his feet
He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden staff
Curious, he picks it up
Almost immediately the staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands
Odd
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2
Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in contact with the ground
Frost shoots out and spreads across the ice
Jack is visibly confused
He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their trunks
Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as he begins to run across the frozen pond
Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the air
Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to earth and into the trees
Jack grabs hold of a tree branch and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance
-   - collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs
Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one
He stands up, still elated, and brushes himself off
As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their hands by campfire
Jack doesn't recognize anyone
(to the townsfolk) Hello
Hello
Good evening, ma'am
() Ma'am
The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him
Jack crouches down as a   runs toward him
Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me where  am
The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost
Jack staggers back in shock
He's speechless, as if the wind had been knocked out him
His emotions causing it to snow
Hello
Hello
Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his presence
Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest
(
) My name is Jack Frost -- how do know that
The moon told me so
But that was all he ever told me
And that was a long, long time ago
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 3
We pan up as the moon shines down over the snow covered trees

'  - We glimpse a familiar-looking   and  with white trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs  a block of ice onto a stone work table-- :   shears the block in half, spraying ice
North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo on his arm, the word  clearly visible
Three  huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies, each licking their own tasty morsel
(
) Still waiting for cookies
As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear
The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself across the floor on his rolling chair --  as his huge gropes furiously among his  , finally grabbing a miniature
As North's humming along with his music, delicately  into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve tatoo, the word  clearly visible-- His    magnified in a '  -- a delicate   cuts fine details into the ice-- His hands place the finished piece on a curving  : An ice
It belches ice vapor and chugs down the track, picking up speed-- Yes
North's hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two Elves
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 4
One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out onto the plate
Ah, finally
He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track
He chuckles as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair -- then  unfold --   sprout and ignite and the train lifts off the track-- Suddenly, the  is thrown open by one of North's concerned , sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the floor in pieces
Arghbal
Ach
The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame
North cries out, devastated
The yeti, equally emotional, lets out another whimper
North looks down at the broken toy and takes a moment to collect himself
How many times have  told you to knock
Warga blarghgha
What
The Globe
North leaps up -- draws a   from its sheath and -- '   - sea of tiny  on the heads of panicking elves part as North's huge boots stomp through
Shoo with your pointy heads
Why are you always under boot
He pushes his way past a couple of his   -- they're looking up in fear at - Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 5
Covered with  blanketing the continents
But North notices that all at once,    suddenly go out
What is this
Now  , in  , as if something is snuffing them out by the thousands
North's concern grows
( ) Have you checked the axis
Is rotation balanced
( ) Wardle bawddrel
Before the Yeti can finish, a  whips up from out of nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of , crawls over the lights, and shrouds the in inky -- The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates into the air -- As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to the ground, and the globes lights come back on, North whirls to see a   flash across the floors and curving walls of his fortress
It quickly disappears, leaving nothing but the distant  of
North is frozen, looking up into the darkness, gravely: Can it be
(then calls off) Dingle
group of elves step forward gleefully pointing to themselves, as if they're all "Dingle"
The excitement quickly turns to confusion
Make preparations
We are going to have company
North reaches out for a large  ,  and -- Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 6
The Globe pulses with , which lights up and the   toward the roof-- - From the tallest spire of North's fortress, radiates outward: for the first time in decades, the '

She quickly ducks under the pillow and comes out the other side with a tooth in hand

' Dozens of tiny  flit about
Teeth are filed away in tiny wooden drawers
Coins are handed out

) Chicago, Sector 6 -- 37 molars, 22 bicuspids, 18 central incisors
Moscow, Sector 9 -- 22 incisors, 18 premolars: Uh oh, heavy rain advisory

Head out
hive of activity, and at the center a winged figure barks out orders like a harried air-traffic controller
This is Mini Tooth Fairy flies up to Tooth as thousands of tiny    continue their work behind them
(
) Wait
And suddenly everything stops
Tooth whips around, and we finally see her beautiful
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 7
She's holding up a little tooth, and gazing at it with dreamy adoration
The surrounding fairies tweet with excitement
(') It's her first tooth
Have you ever seen a more adorable lateral incisor in all of your life
() Look how she flossed
The fairies' tweets turn to concern, turning Tooth's attention to North's   stretching across the sky
She gasps, and flies off like a rocket toward the source of the signal, accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies
(
) My fellow Guardians - It is our job to watch over the children of the world, and keep them safe - to bring wonder, hope and dreams
And so, 've called us all here for one reason, and one reason only - the children are in danger
Much of this we hear over the following
/
' We pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a stream of sand swirling overhead
It's a dream and it's taken the shape of a child playing soccer
We  the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into the sky where we see  of strands of sand descending to earth
Keep following up, through majestic
to reveal a small,    of Dreamsand shimmering among the clouds, trailing the golden threads
The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure, Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by
The Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned
Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud suddenly  around him, changing form into a small , with Sandy in the cockpit
He   the plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular cloudscape and flies off into the distance
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 8
(
) An enemy we have kept at bay for centuries has finally decided to strike back
We alone can stop him
Much of this we hear over the following
few   pop up out of the ground; their little legs carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object
Speeding along through a subterranean tunnel, we can barely keep up with a -  as it races at blinding speed, leaping and zigzagging through a series of  -- hole opens in the snow, and a pair of rabbit ears pops out
huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow, annoyed
The six foot tall figure is
Ah, it's freezing
He shivers with cold, then goes slogging through the snow

can't feel my feet
In the distance is North's ornately decorated and dimly lit palace built into the side of a mountain of ice
: 250 - - Sandy's biplane circles the massive chamber, leaving trails of Dreamsand
(
) Cookies
Eggnog, anyone
(
) Oh, this better be good, North
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 9
(
) (to her fairies) Montreal, sector six: ten premolars, eight incisors and twelve canines
Steer clear of the wild goose migration
Sandy, thank you for coming
Sandy descends from the plane and floats to the ground
He joins North, Bunny and Tooth as they walk through the Globe Room
Sand glyphs appear above Sandy's head communicating that he is busy and has a lot of work to do
( ) know,  know, but  obviously wouldn't have called you all here unless it was serious
North, Bunny, Tooth and Sandy reach the center of the room
Tooth does her best to shush her mini-fairies
(') The Boogie Man was here - at the Pole
North points to the globe
The other Guardians turn to look
() Pitch
Pitch Black
Here
Yes
There was black sand covering the globe
() What, what
what do you mean black sand
And then a shadow
Hold on, hold on,  thought you said you saw Pitch
Well, ah, not exactly
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 10
Not exactly
Can you believe this guy
Bunny turns to Sandy, who shrugs while forming a Dreamsand question mark above his head
Yeah, you said it, Sandy
Bunny goes back to painting one of his Easter eggs
Look, he is up to something very bad
feel it, in my belly
(his eyes narrow) Hang on, hang on, you mean to say, you summoned me here - because of your belly
Mate, if  did this to you three days before Christmas-- (to her fairies) Argentina
Priority alert batch of bicuspids in Buenos Aires
Please
Bunny
Easter is not Christmas
Here we go
North grabs Bunny's painted egg, casually juggling it in his hand as he walks off
Meanwhile Sandy, who is being served eggnog by a yeti, suddenly notices something high above
(
) () North, ,  don't have time for this
've still got two million eggs to finish up
The moon rises into view, high up in the ceiling; its rays of light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down the walls of the globe room
(
) No matter how much you paint, is still egg
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 11
Sandy points to the moon unsuccessfully to get the others' attention
Look, mate, 'm dealing with perishables
Right
You've got all year to prepare
(to her fairies) Pittsburg, boy eight, two molars
Saltwater taffy
Sandy puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle, a silent musical note forming above his head
( ) Why are rabbits always so nervous
And why are you always such a blowhard
(
) (to her fairies) Ontario, sector nine: five canines, two molars, and fourteen incisors
Is that all in one house
Sandy waves a sand flag above his head, pointing and jumping up and down as the moonlight continues to fill the room
(turning his attention) Tooth
Can't you see we're trying to argue
Sorry, not all of us get to work one night a year
Am  right, Sandy
Sandy tries to signal with a golden arrow, pointing toward the ceiling, but to no avail as the others continue their bickering
Sandy thinks Tooth has noticed for a split second, but then - (to her fairies) San Diego, sector two
Five incisors, a bicuspid and a really loose molar on stand-by
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 12
() Come on, mate, Pitch went out with the dark ages
We made sure of that - remember
(
) know it was him
We have serious situation
(
) Well, 've got a serious situation with some eggs
(
) Hey,  hate to interrupt the, "We work so hard once a year club" but could we concentrate on the matter-- Sandy can't take it anymore, grabs an elf by his hat, and vigorously shakes it's bell
The other Guardians are finally silenced and all turn to look at Sandy, who points up, a sand crescent moon forming above his head
The dizzy elf staggers away
Finally the others turn to see the shaft of moonlight as it concentrates on the circle between them
Aah
Man in Moon
Sandy, why didn't you say something
Sandy gives him a deadpan stare, Dreamsand smoke shoots out his ears
(to Man in Moon) It's been a long time old friend
What is big news
Everyone looks to the center of the intense spot of moonlight, the light ebbs away, leaving a dark spot -- -- which resolves into the shadowed silhouette of
The Guardians look on, stunned
It is Pitch
North pats his belly and gives Bunny a look
(back up to the moon) Manny
what must we do
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 13
In answer, the shadow of Pitch disappears and the circle of moonlight intensifies and , concentrating further illuminating an   on the floor, at the center of their circle
The symbol rises out of the ground revealing a large gem at the head of a pillar
Ah, guys, you know what this means
The moons light suddenly refracts through the gem casting light all over the chamber
() He's choosing a new Guardian
What
Why
Must be big deal
Manny thinks we need help
() Since when do we need help
wonder who it's gonna be
Dreamsand Four-Leaf clover forms above Sandy's head
(') Maybe the Leprechaun
Please not the groundhog, please not the groundhog
Then   , a rush of  - and a  resolves over the central pillar: slight, hooded, bearing a familiar hooked
Jack Frost
The Mini-Teeth all sigh and swoon as the Guardians stand there, stunned
Ah,  take it back
The Groundhog's fine
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 14
(caught admiring Jack) Well, ah, as long he helps to ah
to protect the children, right
Jack Frost
He doesn't care about children
All he does is freeze water pipes and mess with my egg hunts
Right
He's an irresponsible, selfish
Guardian
This stops Bunnymund in his tracks
Jack Frost is many things, but he is not a Guardian
As we turn toward the face of the hooded figure
: 600 - - hooded figure with a familiar looking staff rests atop a Post Office box on the opposite end of the street
The man touches the staff to the ground, sending a streak of frost across the street
approaches a water fountain, turns the handle and moves in for a sip
But as he does, the water freezes magically, and the boy's tongue is stuck to the frozen water
His friends can't help but laugh
(tongue stuck to frozen ) Aahhhhh
mail man walks across the street and a magically appears under his feet
He scrambles, and
- lands on his butt
Just behind the man, we see the climb up the side of a building
We stay on the frost as it moves up along a rain pipe, and through the windows we see
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 15
boy try to feed his gold fish, but a layer of ice suddenly forms along the water surface and prevents the fish from reaching its food
We move along the side of the building
writer in his study sits next to stacks of papers
The window suddenly swings open and a gust of wind sends the pages flying out the window
We move along the building, across clothes lines and power lines as they freeze
We continue to move up, and finally discover the culprit
Jack Frost makes his way atop a cathedral spire and takes in the view; the full moon bathes the city in moonlight
() Ah, now that, that was fun
() Hey wind
Jack chuckles as he calls the wind
The trees begin to sway and leaves fly into the air
Jack grabs hold of the spire, smiling as the wind blows past
Take me home
Jack lets go and the wind carries him into the air and through the clouds
Night turns to day as Jack flies from one horizon to the other
Woooooohoooooooooo
- Jack falls through the clouds, smiling, toward the town of Burgess
Jack continues on down and zooms through the streets
Pedestrians clench their jackets and reach for their hats as gusts of wind, snow, and streaks of frost are left in Jack's wake
Jack flies in, and with the wind behind him skates across an all too familiar pond
As the wind zips across the pond it knocks a  out of the hands of a little boy walking alone, this is
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 16
Whoa, whoa
Jamie goes to pick up the book and we get a glimpse of the cover - "'
- , " Jack flies into frame and lands beside Jamie
Huh, that looks interesting
Good book
Suddenly twins  and , come barreling past them, rough-housing and laughing as they slam each other into drifts (all the boys are 8)
Alright
Yeah
Waahoo
Snooow daaaay
Jack calls after the boys
You're welcome
(goes running after them) Hey guys, wait up
Are you guys coming to the egg hunt Sunday
Yeah, free candy
hope we can find the eggs with all this snow
Caleb stuffs a handful of snow down his brother's Jacket '  - The kids arrive at the fence of Jamie's house
Jamie opens up a secret plank, and heads into his yard
Claude and Caleb are still messing with each other
Meanwhile, Jack walks unseen along the top of the fence
() Stop
() No, you stop
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 17
Whoa, it says here that they found Big Foot hair samples and , in Michigan
That's like, super close
Here we go again
Jamie arrives at his front gate, sled in hand while (Jamie's 2-year-old sister in fairy wings) sits down on their Greyhound as it lies in the yard
You saw the video too Claude, he's out there
That's what you said about aliens
And the Easter Bunny
(grabs his sled) Wow, the Easter Bunny is real
Oh he's real alright
Real annoying, real grumpy, and really full of himself
Jack hops off the fence and walks amongst the kids, peering over their shoulders as they play in the yard
() Come on, you guys believe anything
() --
( ) Ow
Sophie begins to cry
Mom
Sophie fell again
'  comes outside
Caleb, alongside his brother, stands at the front gate and calls out to Jamie
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 18
' You okay, Soph
Are we sledding or what
' Jamie, hat
We don't want Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Jamie's mom plunks the hat on his head, tweaks his nose
Who's Jack Frost
' No one, honey
It's just an expression
(smile drops - offended) Hey
Jack jumps down from the fence as the boys head off
() Who's Jack Frost
Jack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the ground
With his palm open, Jack uses his magic to form the perfect snowball
He then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy breath
The snowball turns a light shade of blue
There's something going on here
- the snowball goes flying through the air and - - the snowball hits Jamie smack in the back of the head
Jamie looks up, peeved, and turns
Then we watch as his face changes
a mischievous sparkle comes into his eyes
big smile
Make no mistake, something magical has just happened
() Okay, who threw that
Jack flies in and lands amongst the group of kids
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 19
Well, wasn't bigfoot kiddo
Jamie scans the horizon for the culprit
His eyes land on a couple kids making snow barricades
(oddball with big glasses) with his back turned suddenly gets a snowball to the back of the head, knocking him face first into the ground
Ow
(brainy, pigtails, pink hat) steps forward and -
magical snowball from Jack hits her, knocking her back
Pippa's face changes - a mischievous sparkle
Jamie Bennett
No fair
() You struck first
Oh
Suddenly we see Caleb struck in the side of the head with one of Jack's snowballs; Claude can't help but laugh
Free for all
And just like that we find ourselves in a take-no-prisoners snowball fight, the kids pummeling each other mercilessly
Alright, who needs ammo
Jack supplies the kids with more snowballs
The kids are loving this
() Look at that
The mayhem continues as Jamie, using his sled as a shield, is knocked backward into a snowman, crushing it underneath him
snowball flies overhead and hits , a tough third grader as wide as she is tall, in the back of the head
Dread sets in amongst the other kids, Cupcake squints - gunslinger eyes
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 20
Grrrrrrrrrrrr
Crud,  hit Cupcake
She hit Cupcake
You hit Cupcake
Jamie is flat on his back, terrified
He looks up to see Cupcake standing over him
Then,
Jack hits Cupcake with a magical snowball
The kids gasp in horror
Oh
Did you throw that
No
Wasn't me
moment, and then Cupcake starts laughing as Jack's magic takes hold
Cupcake chases the kids down the hill, holding the head of her snowman in her hands
Jack, all the while, runs along side taking pleasure in the excitement
() Hey, come on
Stop
() You can't catch me
Ooh, little slippery
Jack jumps ahead, blasting a sheet of ice behind him
The kids fall to the ground, except for Jamie, who lands on his sled, and slides head first down the sheet of ice into town
Whooaaooah
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 21
() Whoaaa
Jamie, watch out
Stop
() Aha, whoa
() Jamie
Turn, turn
That's the street
What are you doing
Stop
There's traffic
Jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past a set of parked cars
Jack's path of ice covers the street
As Jamie turns, his speed only escalates, sending him directly into traffic
Jamie barely misses a moving truck, spinning it out of control, sending furniture out the back, and causing a four car pile up
Whoa
Whoa, don't worry kid,  gotcha
Jamie looks back, then quickly ahead as terror comes into his eyes
Jack can't help but smile
Hold on
It's gonna be alright
Ahhhh
No, no, no, no
Keep up with me kid
Take a left
Jamie rockets through a pedestrian intersection, narrowly missing those in the crosswalk
(
) Hey, slow down
Whoa, no, no, no, no
Jack flies over to the far side of the street, sending the streak of ice and Jamie up onto the sidewalk
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 22
Yeah
#1 (
) Is that Jamie Bennett
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
#2 (
) Hey
Watch it
There you go
No
No
#3 (
) Look at that dude
Jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the street, almost knocking over a postman
As Jack flies by Jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into Jamie's face
Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible
Jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead, carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail
Whoa
Jamie's sled suddenly turns, narrowly missing the oncoming truck and barrels toward Jack's newly formed ice ramp
Jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the street, high into the air, and toward the statue of Thaddeus Burgess, colonial settler - 1680
Jamie's friends stand in awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air
Jamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to joy
Jack looks on smiling
Jamie lands safely in a large mound of snow
Jack jumps onto the Statue of Thaddeus Burgess
(
) Oh my gosh
Yeah
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 23
Jamie's friends all come running to Jamie's aide, scared
But Jamie gets up
() Wow, that looks serious
Jamie
Jamie, are you alright
Is he okay
Whoaaa
Did you guys see that
It was amazing
slid -  did a jump and  slid under a car-
sofa from the moving van suddenly knocks Jamie down
Whoops
() Ooooh
There's a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if Jamie is okay
Then, Jamie rises up from behind the sofa grinning, a new gap in his smile
He holds up a tooth
Cool
Tooth
() Dude, that means cash
Tooth Fairy cash
love the Tooth Fairy
(his fun cut short) Oh, no
() That's totally awesome
You lucky bug
Lucky
No
gotta put this under my pillow
() wish  lost my tooth
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 24
Ah, wait a minute
Come on, hold on, hold on
What about all that fun we just had
That wasn't the Tooth Fairy, that was me
() lost two teeth in one day once - remember that
What are you gonna spend your money on
What are you gonna buy
How much do you think she's going to leave
As Jack looks down from the statue his frustration grows
Storm clouds overhead rumble and darken
Flurries of snow begin to intensify
() Let's go
'm cooold
My ears are freezing
can't feel my toes
Ah, it's hot cocoa time
Jack jumps down from the statue, trying to engage the kids
But it's too late, the kids take off
Jack blocks Jamie's way as the boy comes running at him
What's a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here
Jamie runs through Jack, as if he where a ghost
Jack is left momentarily shaken, then
(walla; mocking her ) "Oh, 'm cold, 'm cold, 'm co- old
" (
) () Somebody take a picture
Hey, stop
That was really awesome
They're gone
Jack is alone again
His temper subsides
He whips up a little wind and disappears
: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 25
700 - '  - Jamie plays with a   as    of mystery creatures hang on the wall behind him: 's, aliens, Bigfoot, you name it
There's even a drawing of Jamie flying in midair on his sled
(
) did this jump and it was amazing and  slide under a car and it was awesome
Then  was flying down this hill and  was like whoosh, whoosh, whoosh through all these cars, and then the sled hit this, this thing, and  was like way up in the air
He mimes flying in the air with his robot, then  to the bed as Sophie and their dog sit listening-- -- and then
The sofa hit me, and, and see
(opens mouth, tries to say `my tooth came out
) Ah hoo hay ow
We reveal '  in the room
Sophie  and tries to stick a finger in the gap in his gums
' Alright you, tooth under your pillow
Jamie sets the   on his nightstand, then grabs a stuffed rabbit next to his pillow to reveal a Yeah
'm ready
' Now don't stay up trying to see her, Jamie, or she won't come
But  can do it this time
You wanna help me, Soph
We can hide and see the Tooth Fairy
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 26
() Hide, hide, hide, hide
Jamie's Mom picks Sophie up off the bed and lifts her over her shoulder
Their dog gets up and begins licking Jamie's face
' Uh uh, straight to bed now, mister
Mom
We see Jack Frost, outside, hanging upsidedown watching them through the window
pang
The glass frosts over
'  - Jack flips onto the roof, a little pensive
He makes his way toward the roof's peak and looks up at the , in full view
It lights up the night sky
If there's something 'm doing wrong, can you, can you just tell me what it is
( ) Because 've tried everything, and no one ever sees me
( ) You put me here, the least you can do is tell me, tell me why
beat
The Moon shines silently down
Jack turns away in frustration
Jack leaps off the roof, onto a telephone pole, and begins walking across some telephone wires
stream of Dreamsand suddenly zips by behind him, then another, which swoops around in front of him
Jack turns and looks up, a smile now on his lips
Right on time, Sandman
The Dreamsand descends from the sky, and drifts into windows around the town
Jack runs along the telephone wire until he can reach out and intercept one of the passing streams
An adjacent stream takes the shape of a dolphin which turns toward Jack, before continuing on its way to a waiting child
Then, we follow one of the streams into a window
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 27
'  -  - Dreamsand floats into a window, where  is in bed, hugging a stuffed unicorn in her sleep
The Dreamsand swirls over her head, and morphs into a little girl riding a unicorn
The girl smiles at the lovely dream as it flies around the room
Then the room darkens as a wispy, shadowy figure with a familiar laugh crawls out from under the bed, and rises up
It's Pitch
He notices Cupcake's dream
Ohhhh,  thought  heard the clippity-clop of a unicorn
What an adorable dream
His face softens, seemingly moved
(leans down to Cupcake) And look
At
Her
Precious child
So sweet, so full of hope and wonder
Why, there's only one thing missing
a touch of fear
Pitch reaches into Cupcake's dream, and touches a bony finger to the unicorn
It turns ashen and black, and disintegrates
Cupcake flinches in her sleep
Pitch snickers, delighted
Hahaha
That never gets old
Pitch swirls the Dreamsand around and it all turns into black corrupted Nightmare sand
Feel your fear
Come on
Come on, that's right
The black sand morphs into a horrific, shadowy bucking horse - a
Yesss
What a pretty little Nightmare
Gleefully, he grabs the Nightmare's mane -- Now,  want you to go tell the others the wait is over
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 28
-- and sends it out the window, where it joins a posse of other Nightmares coursing through the streets
They take off and fly into the night sky
- Pitch steps out into the street from an adjacent alley, avoiding the rays of moonlight
He looks up to the sky and stares at the
Don't look at me like that, old friend
You must have known this day would come
My Nightmares are finally ready

- Jack walks along a telephone wire as the Dreamsand disappears from the sky
Suddenly a shadowy figure and an unfamiliar noise zips by behind him
Whoa
In the background, residents get ready for the night
(
) () Did you leave the windows open again
The garage door is wide open
Jack leaps over a house to an adjacent tree to investigate and again, something zooms behind him
Jack jumps down from the tree and onto a truck in a nearby alley

Jack jumps down from the truck and backs up out of the alleyway into a clearing

He squints, as into the light steps

Jack struggles out of the sack to see two elves staring at him

He then looks up to see North and Sandman looking down at him
The Tooth Fairy is surrounded by a dozen hovering tiny fairies who come and go as she blurts out orders
T0OTH (') Canine, lateral and central incisor
Ouch
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 31
North clears his throat
They all turn to a bewildered Jack
Hey, there he is
Jack Frost
As North holds out his arms to welcome Jack, a Dreamsand snowflake appears above Sandy's head
Wow, you gotta be kidding me
Two Yetis suddenly grab Jack by the shoulders and lift him up onto his feet
Hey, hey
Whoa, put me down
hope the yetis treated you well
Oh, yeah
love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal
Oh, good
That was my idea
You know Bunny, obviously
Obviously
Bunny stands off to the side, grumbling with his arms crossed
Jack suddenly notices the hovering near him, staring and twittering
And the Tooth Fairy
Before Jack can answer, she's gliding toward him
Hello, Jack
've heard a lot about you
And your teeth
My, my what
(moves in way too close) Open up
Are they really as white as they say
Yes

Several swooning Mini Teeth flutter around a confused Jack, batting their lashes and screaming like crazed Beatles fans
Tooth collects herself, and
Girls, pull yourselves together
Let's not disgrace the uniform
And Sandman

Sandy
Wake up
Sandy bolts up awake and steps up to Jack, smiling
Hey
Ho
Anyone wanna tell me why 'm here
The    above Sandy's head morphs into a That's not really helping
But thanks, little man

Jack walks away from the group, frosting an elf with a tray of cookies as it marches past, then turns around
Am  on the naughty list

Off Jack's confusion, yetis light   with a Elves leap from columns, unfurling homemade, celebratory  as they descend

Jack's voice is drowned out by the sounds of horns and drums
This is the best part
strikes up, marching into the room
Two yetis move Jack on to a designated spot on the floor
Jack looks down to find an elf pointing at his bare feet
The elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves, carrying a pair of ceremonial boots
Jack's confusion escalates
Huh
Yeti hands North an old large book
North blows off the dust, opens it, and begins clearing his throat
Jack clenches his jaw as he scans the room: The Mini Teeth continue to fawn, Sandy's smiling, Bunny's apathetic, and North looks on with pride
Jack suddenly  his staff down, sending a blast of and  across the room
The torches go out and everything stops
What makes you think  want to be a Guardian
North bursts out in laughter holding the book in his hands then stops and looks to Jack, stone faced
Of course you do
(to the elves) Music
The elves blare the trumpets again
Celebration
No music
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 34
The music peters out again
An elf throws his trumpet to the ground and storms off
North, displeased, glowers
Look, this is all very flattering, but ah
you don't want me
You're all hard work and deadlines, and 'm snowballs and fun times
'm not a Guardian
Yeah, that's exactly what  said
Jack
don't think you understand what it is we do
Tooth swoops in and turns Jack's attention to the massive globe behind him
Each of those lights is a child
Jack looks up at the Globe, taking in the enormity of this
North suddenly moves to Jack's side
child who believes
And good or bad, naughty or nice, we protect them
() Tooth
fingers out of mouth
We cut back to discover that Tooth is examining Jack's teeth
( ) Oh, sorry
They're beautiful

Okay, no more wishy-washy
Pitch is out there doing who knows what
() You mean the Boogeyman
Yes
When Pitch threatens us, he threatens them as well
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 35
North points to the lights on the globe
All the more reason to pick someone more qualified
Pick
You think we pick
No, you were chosen like we were all chosen
By Man in Moon
Jack turns and looks to the group
(stares, dumbstruck) What
Last night, Jack
He chose you
Maybe
The Man in the Moon, he talks to you
Jack looks up to the skylight, taking in the awesome sight of the moon as it shines down on Earth
You see, you can not say no
It is destiny
Jack is still confused by the news
What does it mean
But why, why wouldn't he tell me that himself
( ) After 300 years this is his answer
To spend eternity like you guys cooped up in some, some hideout thinking of, of new ways to bribe kids
No no, that's not for me
No offense
Jack turns to leave, the Guardians are stunned
How is that not offensive
Except for Bunny, who is relieved by this turn and looks to the others
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 36
You know what  think
think we just dodged a bullet
mean, what's this clown know about bringing joy to children anyway
Jack turns back
little pissed
Uhh, you ever hear of a snow day
know it's no hard-boiled egg, but kids like what  do
But none of 'em believe in you
(leans in to him) Do they
You see, you're invisible, mate
It's like you don't even exist
Bunny
Enough
Silence
Jack tries not to look stung by this
No, the kangaroo's right
() The, the what -- what'd you call me
am not a kangaroo, mate
Oh
And this whole time  thought you were
If you're not a kangaroo, what are you

It's nothing personal, North
What you all do, it's just, it's not my thing
Man in Moon says it is your thing
We will see
North storms through factory floor, Jack trying to keep up
An amazing place
Slow down, wouldja
've been trying to bust in here for years, want a good look
(peeved - still rushing) What do you mean, "bust in
" Oh, don't worry,  never got past the yetis
Jack looks over his shoulder; an angry yeti pounds his fist into his palm
Rwwarrrrrr
Oh, hey Phil
Keep up, Jack
Keep up
North charges ahead
North's factory is bustling with activity: Yeti's are building toys, moving packages, while Elves are test piloting the various flying toys
As Jack walks behind North, surveying the factory, a duck toy suddenly flies over Jack's head
Jack ducks just in time and continues after North
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 38
Whoa
() always thought the elves made the toys
() We just let them believe that
Jack looks over to see a group of elves eating Christmas ornaments and another electrocuting himself with Christmas lights
North smiles and calls to them
Very nice
Keep up good work
North continues through the factory floor
He passes a yeti putting the finishing touches on a blue toy robot
( ) don't like it
Paint it red
The yeti reacts in dismay as we reveal hundreds of finished blue robots
Step it up, everybody
As North and Jack move to the opposite end of the chamber, we finally glimpse the orchestrated chaos of the entire workshop, in all it's magic and splendor
'  - Jack follows North into his office
There are shelves filled with toys
Sketches and prototypes everywhere
North dusts his hands and turns to Jack
His sleeves are rolled
Jack notices that on one of North's forearms is tattooed the word , and on the other,
North grabs a plate from a nearby elf
Fruit cake
Ah, no, thanks
North hurls it - crash
pause as North looks at Jack
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 39
Now we get down to tacks of brass
( ) Tacks of brass
As North cracks his knuckles, Jack stands silent
The wind suddenly slams North's office door behind them
Jack looks to the door, it locks itself, and he turns back
North moves in close to Jack, backing him up against the door
Who are you, Jack Frost
What is your center
North pokes Jack in the chest
My center
If Man in Moon chose you to be a Guardian, you must have something very special inside
North stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he gives Jack a curious look
Hmmmm
North is standing in front of a shelf of Russian nesting dolls
One is carved to look like North himself
(') Here
This is how you see me, no
Very big, intimidating
But if you get to know me a little-- (hands the doll to Jack) Well, go on
Jack gives North a curious look, then sets down his staff
He twists the doll in half, and inside is another carved North doll, this one is a more typical Santa Claus - red cheeked and cheery
You are downright jolly
Ah, but not just jolly
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 40
The dolls get progressively smaller as he twists them open, all versions of North, but all slightly different
(') am also mysterious
(twist - smaller doll) And fearless
(twist - smaller doll) And caring
And at my center
Twist
As North approaches, Jack looks down and drops the final Russian doll into the palm of North's hand
It's the size of a jelly bean
There's a tiny wooden baby
Look closer
What do you see
Jack holds it up to examine it
You have big eyes
Yes
Big eyes
Very big
Because they are full
Of wonder
That is my center
It is what  was born with
Eyes that have always seen the wonder in everything
North raises his hands, and the toys on the shelves suddenly spring to life
Jack-in-the-boxes pop, toy trains speed around the room, soldiers march about, toy planes fly overhead
An elf gets carried aloft by a balloon
flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its way around the room
Christmas tree is ablaze with bright lights
Two double doors suddenly open as the flying car enters the factory floor
Eyes that see lights in the trees, and magic in the air
As it crosses the frame, dozens of other toys are now flying around the massive chamber
It's a truly magical moment
North now stands outside his office, with Jack at his side
This wonder is what  put into the world, and what  protect in children
() Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 41
(') It is what makes me a Guardian
It is my center

Jack looks down into his open palm, the wooden baby stares back at him
North closes Jack's hand
They exchange a look
Then, something suddenly jets past a window outside
Almost simultaneously, Bunny and Sandman come running down the hallway toward North and Jack
We have a problem, mate
Trouble at the Tooth Palace
: 1204 - - North shoves open a set of double doors, followed closely by Bunny, Sandy, and Jack
Several Yeti's rush by as they prepare the hangar for launch

There is no way 'm climbing into some rickety old
Suddenly: the  of

It's a huge, shiny, tricked out, jaw-dropping hot-rod of a sled
sleigh
Jack is understandably gob-smacked, so much so that he almost gets knocked over by one of the reindeer
Whoa
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 42
( ) Hey
Moi deti, moi deti
Quiet, quiet
The sleigh comes to a standstill as the Guardians prepare to climb inside
Several Yetis are still running around making last minute preparations
Okay, one ride, but that's it
Jack jumps aboard
North smiles knowingly, and climbs inside
Sandy hops up into the back seat
Everyone loves the sleigh
North grabs the reigns, wrapping them around his arms
He turns to see Bunnymund standing there, frozen and unnerved
(') Bunny, what are you waiting for
think my tunnels might be faster, mate
And um, and safer
Ah, get in
(hoists Bunnymund up) Buckle up
Bunny desperately looks around his seat
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are the bloody seatbelts
() That was just expression
North turns to one of the Yetis
Are we ready
The Yeti throws his hands up in a fit shaking his head no
Good
Let's go
Clear
(cracks the reigns) Hyah
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 43
The sleigh is off
Elves and yetis scatter out of its path
Sandy, Bunny, and Jack fly back into their seats
Bunny clutches the edge of his, terrified
Jack can't help but laugh
Out of the way
The sleigh heads down a luge-like track
North and Jack are enjoying the ride
Hyah
Ohhhhhh no
North cracks the reigns, the sleigh plummets, an almost vertical drop
Sandy grins calmly
Jack loves this
Bunnymund - not so much
() Slow down, slow down
North pulls a lever, kicking the sleigh into overdrive
He looks back as the sleigh enters a corkscrew
hope you like the loopty loops
() hope you like carrots
Here we go
as the sleigh reaches the bottom of the ramp, and shoots upwards, launching them into bright blue sky

Klasno

Jack, in his element, leaps up onto the rear of the sleigh to watch the North Pole fade into the distance
() Whoa
Bunnymund peaks off the side of the sleigh, then leans back, and holds on for dear life
Hey, Bunny-- Bunny turns to see Jack standing on the back edge of the sleigh
Check out this view-- Jack is   the sleigh and disappears
Bunny gasps in horror and looks over the side
only to see Jack lounging on the sleigh's skid
Awww
you do care
Ah, rack off you bloody show pony
Bunny glowers as Jack makes his way back into the sleigh
Hold on everyone,  know a shortcut
Oh strewth,  knew we should have taken the tunnels
North holds a snow globe up to his face
say, Tooth Palace
An image of the Tooth Palace appears inside the snowglobe
North throws the globe into the air and a giant vortex opens

Suddenly our heroes find themselves in the midst of mayhem, as hundreds of Nightmares and terrified Tooth Fairies jet past
It's like a meteor storm
North yanks the reins, and the sleigh veers sharply, dodging the oncoming Nightmares
What are they
Sandy and Bunny duck the onslaught
Whoa
Jack now sees that the Nightmares are actually the fleeing fairies and flying off with them
It's chaos
They're taking the tooth fairies
Jack looks up to see a lone fairy with a Nightmare snapping at its heels
Jack leaps into the air and rescues it before the Nightmare can snatch it away
Jack lands back in the sleigh
He opens his hand to reveal Baby Tooth, who's shaking with fear
Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay
As Baby Tooth nods, North steers the sleigh forward through the storm toward the entrance of Tooth's Palace
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 46
- vast chamber supported by pillars containing millions of tiny wooden deposit boxes from floor to ceiling
North spots a Nightmare up ahead and hands Jack the reigns
Here, take over
Huh
Jack, though surprised, quickly grabs the reigns and smiles as he snaps them
Hyah
North readies his sword and  the Nightmare in half -- Yah
spill out of the split Nightmare and rain down into the sleigh at the Guardians' feet
The Nightmare disintegrates into black sand
They're stealing the teeth
Sandy looks at his hands and sees the Nightmare sand take shape and drift away
He and Bunny exchange a look
The Guardians turn -- they're headed straight for a pillar
Jack, look out
Jack pulls the reins -- Aaaahhhh
-- the sleigh nearly misses the pillar and skids to a rough stop on a platform
They see Tooth up above
Tooth
Are you alright
Tooth is flying around, visibly frustrated
This is bad
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 47
They, they took my fairies
And the teeth
All of them
Everything is gone
Everything
Only then does it hit her
Tooth's wings drop in defeat
She's completely lost amidst the devastation
The Guardians rush to comfort her
Jack stays behind as Baby Tooth pops out from the hood of his tunic and flies over toward Tooth
Oh thank goodness
One of you is alright
(
) have to say, this is very, very exciting
Pitch's voice echoes across the open chamber
They look up to see Pitch, standing high above them with a satisfied smile
The Big Four, all in one place
'm a little star-struck
() Did you like my show on the globe, North
Got you all together, didn't
Tooth darts after Pitch, but he escapes into the shadows
Pitch, you have got thirty seconds to return my fairies
(
) Or what
Tooth follows the sound of Pitch's voice and finds him near one of her tooth box columns
You'll stick a quarter under my pillow
Why are you doing this
Maybe  want what you have
To be believed in
Jack takes this in
Pitch moves along the walls and shadows of the chamber and emerges from behind a column
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 48
Maybe 'm tired of hiding under beds
Maybe that's where you belong
Ah, go suck an egg, rabbit
Bunny looks down past the edge of the platform to find Pitch upside down, staring him in the face
Pitch disappears again
(
) Hang on, is that
Jack Frost
() Since when are you all so chummy
We're not
Oh good
Jack turns and sees Pitch standing in the middle of a column
neutral party
Then 'm going to ignore you
But, you must be used to that by now
Pitch
You shadow sneaking rat- bag
Come here
Bunny goes after Pitch, but he disappears and reemerges on an opposite column
Tooth spots him, grabs one of Bunny's boomerangs and flies at Pitch in a rage
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Pitch looks at Tooth with a smile and before she can reach him, a huge Nightmare darts out of hiding and rears up at her
Tooth falls back
Baby Tooth hides in Jack's tunic
() Whoa
Hey, easy, girl
Easy
Pitch draws a wisp of black sand from Onyx's mane, twirls it in his palm, and turns toward Sandy
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 49
Look familiar, Sandman
Took me a while to perfect this little trick
Turning dreams into Nightmares
Pitch notices the shocked Guardians
Don't be nervous, it only riles them up more
They smell fear you know
What fear
Of you
No one's been afraid of you since the Dark Ages
Pitch's eyes flash with anger
But then he smiles
() Oh, the Dark Ages

It makes its way up the side of a mountain to reveal Pitch, smiling as he stares up at the moon

Miserable
Such happy times for me
Oh, the power  wielded

) Lifting their hearts
And giving them hope

Pitch, thinner and weaker than he is now, slips back into the shadows after children run through him while playing in the streets, laughing as they go
(
) Meanwhile, everyone wrote me off as just a bad dream
"Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of
There's no such thing as the Boogeyman
" Pitch leans toward the Guardians, showing nothing but contempt
(') Well that's all about to change
behind Pitch: one of the  of the Palace begins to crack and crumble, as if decaying
Tooth is stunned
Oh look, it's happening already

Jack, mystified, moves closer to Tooth as the palace continues to crumble
What's going on
They, they don't believe in me anymore
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 51
Didn't they tell you, Jack
It's great being a Guardian -- but there's a catch
If enough kids stop believing, everything your friends protect - wonder, hopes and dreams - it all goes away
And little by little, so do they
Jack's realizes now the magnitude of Pitch's plan
No Christmas, or Easter, or little fairies that come in the night
There will be nothing
But fear and darkness and me
It's your turn not to be believed in
Bunny throws his boomerangs at Pitch, who quickly ducks out of the way as they fly around the chamber columns
Pitch then jumps onto the back of Onyx down into the depths of the Palace
The Guardians dive after him, followed by Jack
Bunny grabs a set of egg bombs and launches them at Pitch, exploding seconds before Pitch hits the ground
: 1325 - ' -  - The Guardians land -- He's gone
Tooth, deflated, sits on the ground with an empty tooth box in her hands
Baby Tooth, resting on a nearby broken tooth box, looks to Tooth with concern
Jack walks up and crouches down alongside Tooth
(
) Okay, alright  admit it, you were right about Pitch
(
) This is one time  wish  was wrong
But he will pay
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 52
'm sorry, about the fairies

They put up such a fight
Why would Pitch take the teeth
It's not the teeth he wanted
It's the memories inside them

Tooth leads Jack across the pond, the water freezing under his feet as he walks
That's why we collect the teeth, Jack
They hold the most important memories of childhood
Tooth directs him to a , which illustrates this

Jack, confused, is trying to process all this
That night at the pond
just, why  assumed
Are you saying, are you saying  had a life before that
With a home
And a family
You really don't remember
Jack's expression says it all
Finally the key to all his questions
All these years, and the answers were right here
If  find my memories, then 'll know why 'm here
( ) You have to show me
Jack, using his control of the wind, lifts up off the ground and flies across the pond
can't, Jack
Pitch has them
Jack floats down onto a rock, overlooking the Guardians
Then we have to get them back
Suddenly, a patch of Tooth's feathers fall out, and disappears
The Guardians eyes fill with worry
Oh no

Jack is stricken

Yeah right, look, 'd tell you to stay outta my way, but really what's the point -- because you won't be able to keep up anyway
Is that a challenge, cottontail
Oh, you don't wanna race a rabbit, mate

Each one of them revealing their own bag filled with teeth to Tooth
Tooth is overwhelmed by their collective effort
Wow
You guys collect teeth and leave gifts as fast as my fairies
Their eyes widen and Tooth is suddenly panic stricken
(') You guys have been leaving gifts, right
The rest of the group turns to each other, sinking their heads and biting their lips in embarrassment

They're collecting the teeth
The   perk up at this, and start twittering excitedly, which echoes throughout the lair
Oh pipe down, or 'll stuff a pillow with you
The Mini Teeth begin to settle down
looks at the Nightmare, frustrated, and scowls
The Nightmare winces and disperses into tiny particles
strand of   from the Nightmare twirls in the air, and Pitch twists it with his fingers, turning it into a crude image of the
Fine, have your last hurrah
For tomorrow, all you pathetic scrambling will be for nothing

() Kids, huh
He watches as Tooth reaches under the pillow
She hovers over Jamie as he stirs in his sleep

This was always the part  liked most - seeing the kids
() Why did  ever stop doing this

It's a little different up close, huh
Tooth gives him a look: he's right
Thanks for being here, Jack wish  had known about your memory, could've helped you

Yeah, well, look let's just get you taken care of
Then it's Pitch's turn, huh

North, carrying a large sack over his shoulder, struggles to climb in through the small window
Sandman and Baby Tooth climb in after
Everybody whispers
Oh, what gives slowpokes
Jamie is still sound asleep
How you feeling, Toothy
Believed in
() Haha
That's what  want to hear
(
) Oh  see how it is
Bunny comes in through a rabbit hole in the floorboards

North now holds his index fingers up to his lips
You think  need help to beat a bunny

Jack lifts up his sack of teeth

You call that a bag of choppers

Most of us

You guys, he's still awake
Sandy
Knock him out
They all look to him, scandalized
Jamie looks concerned
Huh
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 65
With the Dreamsand, ya gumbies
But then Jamie's  rises up into frame, fully awake, its nostrils flaring at the scent he's picked up
No, stop that's the Easter Bunny
What are you doing, Abbey
Down
The dog is nose to nose with Bunnymund
Alright, nobody panic
( ) But that's a um, that's a greyhound
Do you know what greyhounds do to rabbits
think it's a pretty safe bet he's never met a rabbit like me - While Sandy forms a Dreamsand baseball, Jack rolls his eyes and notices an alarm clock on the bedside table
(') Six foot one, nerves of steel, master of tai-chi and the ancient -- Jack can't resist: he reaches over stealthily and with his staff
Crikey
Bunny is off like a shot, the greyhound right on his tail, running laps in the small room, the dog barking like crazy
Stop
Sit
Sandy, amused, makes a Dreamsand baseball to stop the dog, but bobbles it as the dog brushes past
Down girl, down
The others stand out of the way as Bunny and the dog run up the walls and over the bed
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 66
As Tooth tries to silence the alarm clock, Jack can barely contain his laughter
Sandy takes aim as Bunny and the dog run circles around him-- Sandy, Sandy
The dog jumps past North, knocking him back
Ah
As Sandy winds up, the dog suddenly  right into him
The Dreamsand goes flying
Hey, this is not proper Tooth Fairy behavior
North ducks out of the way as the Dreamsand sails toward him
The Dreamsand baseball smacks Tooth right in the face and explodes into golden dust
Tooth and her fairy fall to the ground as a golden tooth takes shape above their heads
Streams of Dreamsand make their way around the room
(
) Ah, this thing's rabid
Get this dingo off me
Bunny gets a whiff of the golden sand
The image of a carrot quickly takes shape in front of his face
Oh no
Bunny falls over asleep
So does the dog
North tries to scramble out of the way, but there's no escape in this tiny room
Candy canes
He teeters for a moment as Dreamsand candy canes appear before him, then falls like a giant Sequoia, landing -
- on the end of Jamie's bed, which sends Jamie catapulting through the air
Whoaaaaaaaaaa
Luckily he lands --
-- in Sandy's arms
He starts to wake up , but Sandy is there with a fistful of sand -- -- and Jamie too is out cold
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 67
Jack and Sandy look down at the sleeping boy, relieved
Then they look around -- a heap of sleeping, snoring bodies
Whoops
Bunny is snuggled up next to North
carrot and candy canes, made of Dreamsand, hold hands as they dance above Bunny and North's head
Jack comes down off the dresser and turns to Sandy, who has put Jamie back in bed
Sandy lifts North's arm and lets go, it's completely limp and falls flat
Sandy smiles at Jack, who chuckles
Oh,  really wish  had a camera right now
Sandy eyes suddenly widen
There's a Nightmare behind Jack
Jack turns to see   staring through the window
Without hesitation, Jack jumps out the window after it
(
) () Sandy, c'mon
We can find Pitch
Sandy pauses for a moment, then follows Jack's lead
'  - The sleeping Guardians are where we left them
Jamie's bedroom door opens, and Sophie toddles in
She takes in the scene, amused
She toddles over to North, giggling
She pokes at his rotund belly
Then she notices something
She reaches into his pocket and pulls out a snow globe
Pretty
She looks over to see the Easter Bunny, sound asleep on the floor
Bunny
Hop
Hop
Hop
Suddenly the snow globe lights up
Sophie's eyes widen as she looks at the beautiful vista inside the globe
It's Bunny's warren
She takes the globe and toddles off for the door, when she trips - again - and the snow globe smashes on the floor

The Nightmare then veers up the wall of the alley and onto a Jack whips a blast from his staff and  the Nightmare before it disappears from view

Jack jumps up onto the roof and prods the frozen Nightmare with his staff
Sandy
Sandy, did you see that
Look at this thing
Jack can barely contain his excitement as he calls out to Sandy -- but suddenly Pitch lurches out from behind an air conditioning unit on the rooftop
Frost
Jack blasts a    across the rooftop, but Pitch easily dodges it, reappearing behind Jack on the adjoining rooftop
You know, for a "neutral party" you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos
() This isn't your fight, Jack
Jack's eyes narrow
He holds out his staff, ready to strike
You made it my fight when you stole those teeth
Pitch regards him curiously
Teeth
Why do you care about the teeth
When he notices something and turns to find Sandy calmly standing on the rooftop next to him
Pitch quickly sidesteps, moving away from Sandy

Jack ducks, avoiding injury as Sandy's pushed back against a ledge
Sandy quickly grabs Pitch with another   and yanks him off his feet, slamming him repeatedly against the tops of the buildings until finally throwing him off the rooftop
Pitch bounces off the ground as he crashes into an As Sandy dusts his hands and calmly steps off the rooftop to follow, Jack looks on, astonished
Remind me not to get on your bad side
- Pitch shakes off the crash, trying to back up as Sandy touches down and moves toward him, Jack following
Pitch cowers on the ground in fear as they approach
(looks up, pleading) Okay, easy
You can't blame me for trying, Sandy
You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated
It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams
So 'll tell you what- Sandy continues forward, grim faced
but suddenly Pitch stops cowering and stands up
His tone changes
(') You can have `em back
Before Jack and Sandy can react, a Nightmare shoots up through a storm drain as several other Nightmares gather in the alley behind him
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 71
Jack and Sandy look around as hundreds of Nightmares descend from the surrounding rooftops to encircle them
This doesn't look good
Jack, worried, looks to Sandy and mutters
You take the ones on the left, 'll take the ones on the right
Meanwhile, Pitch rises up from off the ground as Onyx takes shape underneath him
Pitch grabs onto Onyx's mane as it snorts and snarls
He then leans forward
Boo
Pitch's army of Nightmares begin to charge
Then suddenly, the sound of  and  echo in the distance-- '  bursts through the clouds
Jack and Pitch look up into the sky as it circles overhead
The sleigh turns toward Pitch, only to fly a few feet over his head
Pitch turns as it passes over him, slightly confused
' North's asleep at the wheel, along with Bunny and Tooth
Suddenly, the sleigh clips one of its skis as it flies over City Hall, jolting North to attention
Ah
Bunny awakes with a fright from a bad a dream
Get outta my warren
(realizes he's awake now) Huh
- Still battling Nightmares, Sandy propels himself and Jack into the air with a stream of Dreamsand and launches Jack away from the Nightmares
Jack quickly orients himself and knocks an oncoming Nightmare with his staff
Tooth quickly jumps off the side of the sleigh toward Jack and Sandy
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 72
Jack, knocks away a few more Nightmares with his staff, and looks up
Tooth suddenly flies into view through the swarm of Nightmares, slicing them apart with her wings, causing them to  into
Pitch gives a signal and leaps into the air, leading another wave of Nightmares after the Guardians
Back in the sleigh, Bunny jumps out and lands on a nearby roof
Bunny quickly tosses his boomerang which disintegrates every Nightmare in its path
Bunny catches the returning boomerang, leaps off the roof, and grabs the skids of the sleigh as it passes by
North stands, drawing both his scimitars, and dices the oncoming Nightmares to bits as they attack
Ha
Ha
Ha
Come on
Jack heads back to the sleigh by dodging two Nightmares as they attack
As he continues his descent, Jack is suddenly blind sided by another Nightmare, which knocks the staff from his hands
For a moment, Jack is in a state of panic as he finds himself in free fall
Aaaaaaaah
He finally manages to hook onto the staff, control his descent, and land on the sleigh as it flies past
(coolly, to Jack) You might want to duck
Jack  as a Nightmare rears up behind him, but one of Bunny's  blasts through it and zips back to Bunny's waiting paw
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 73
Sandy high up in he clouds, does his best to contain the that are swirling around him
Pitch rises from behind a group of Nightmares
He stretches his arms as an  of   forms behind him
Jack and the Guardians watch as more Nightmares speed away to join their herd
Sandy looks overwhelmed by the onslaught
We gotta help Sandy
Hyah
North cracks the reigns, turns the sleigh, and heads toward the swirling cloud of yellow and black sand
Pitch takes aim and releases the arrow
It flies through the air and into ' back, exploding on impact
The Guardians look on, horrified
Noooo
Jack leaps ahead of the sleigh and flies toward Sandy
Jack
Sandy feels the shock and turns around
patch of blackness starts slowly spreading across his body
Pitch laughs as he and Sandy lock eyes
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 74
Hahahahaha
Don't fight the fear, little man
The Guardians continue to speed toward Sandy, but Nightmares begin colliding with the sleigh, slowing their progress
Hurry, hurry
Pitch relishes this moment of triumph
'd say sweet dreams, but there aren't any left
Sandy, his eyes filled with terror, falls to his knees as the patch of blackness continues to spread
Jack presses on, trying to reach Sandy as fast as he can
Sandy stands up, accepting his fate, and closes his eyes as he and his Dreamsand cloud are consumed by the writhing blackness of the Nightmare sand
Sandy
Horrified, clenches his staff as he flies toward Pitch
No
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 75
Sandy's gone
His beautiful Golden Dreamsand, now black, merges with the rest of Pitch's Nightmare sand
Is beyond delighted
His plan actually worked
Pitch then notices Jack flying towards him, glowing energy emanating from Jack's staff
Pitch raises his hands and sends a massive wave of Nightmares toward Jack
The Guardians are stunned
Jack quickly realizes that's he's in over his head as the attacking Nightmares begin to overtake him
He's engulfed by Nightmares and there is nothing but silence
Pitch looks on with a smile until a bolt of lightning suddenly erupts from within the writhing black sand
Ahhhhhh
gust of wind blows past Pitch, quickly followed by a massive wave of ice and frost that rockets back up the stream of Nightmare sand toward him, culminating in an explosion of ice and snow
- Jack free falls back to Earth, unconscious
Jack
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 76
Tooth quickly rescues him and sets him back down in the sleigh
Jack, how did you do that
( ) ,  didn't know  could
- Pitch pulls himself laboriously from the mud and weeds amongst the trees where he's crash-landed, oddly, he seems delighted
He looks up to see a   -- North's
The sleigh zooms into it and it
Pitch shakes the  from his arms as scores of Nightmares swarm behind Pitch, regrouping after the blast
Pitch, at the center, seems as pleased as can be
Finally
Someone who knows how to have a little
: 1700 - -   - We're in the midst of a somber ceremony, marking the passing of Sandy
Burning candles line the perimeter of Sandy's stone emblem
Tooth sets down a candle and stands shoulder to shoulder with North and Bunny
The three hold hands in solace
The ringing of somber bells can be heard echoing throughout the chamber, as we reveal the elves and a yeti ringing the elf bells as part of a ceremonial dirge
-   -  - Jack, facing a window,     with his finger to form a symbol of Sandy
North slowly walks up behind him
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 77
Are you alright
Jack remains still, his eyes fixed on the image of Sandy
just,  wish  could've done something
Done something
Jack, you stood up to Pitch
You saved us
But Sandy wo-- (putting his hand on ' ) Would be proud of what you did
Jack pulls back his hoodie and stands up
(') don't know who you were in your past life, but in this life you are Guardian
But how can  know who  am, until find out who  was
You will
feel it, in my belly
Jack and North approach the globe which is losing lights at an alarming rate
Look how fast they're going out
( ) It's fear
He's tipped the balance
Jack drifts up closer the globe
He looks at the lights going out, then back to the Guardians
There's a nervous tension in the room
(twirling his boomerang) Hey, buck up ya sad-sacks
Come on
We can still turn this around

Bunny is right
( ) As much as it pains me to say old friend, this time Easter is more important than Christmas
Hey
Did everyone hear that
We must hurry to the Warren
Everyone, to the sleigh
Ohh no, mate
My warren my rules
Buckle up
Bunny directs the groups attention to the ground
He taps his foot and a rabbit hole opens up under their feet
Shostakovich

' Jack, Bunny and Tooth arrive gracefully in the warren's antechamber, while North and the yetis comes to a crashing halt
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 79
() "Buckle up
" Is very funny
Welcome to the warren-- Bunny stands before them when suddenly, he shifts his attention
He turns, his ears perk up and his nose sniffs the air
Something's up
Something's amiss
faint scream begins to echo from within the depths of one of Bunny's egg tunnels
Tiny eggs come scuttling out from the tunnel
Bunny grabs his boomerang, North draws his sword, and Jack readies his staff as the sounds of booming footsteps, screams, and the rustling of foliage grows louder
Ahhhh
Bunny begins to charge toward the tunnel
At his side are the Guardians, yetis, and sentinel eggs all bellowing their loudest battle cries until
Sophie bursts out
All momentum comes to a halt
Sophie
They immediately withdraw their weapons, mildly embarrassed
Sophie giggles and immediately runs after one of the elves
Elf, elf, elf
What is  doing
North looks down at his coat pocket - ooops
() Ah, snow globe
Crikey
Somebody do something
Don't look at me, 'm invisible, remember

Sophie giggles as she drags the elf by the bell atop its uniform
() Don't worry, Bunny

(flies up to Sophie) It's okay little one
( ) Pretty
Awww
You know what,  got something for you
Here it is
(she pulls something out) Look at all the pretty teeth with little blood and gum on them
Sophie runs away screaming
() Blood and gums
When was the last time you guys actually hung out with kids
Meanwhile, Sophie is running around the warren, exploring and playing
Sophie pokes her head into a small tunnel
Peek-a-boo
We are very busy bringing joy to children
We don't have time
() for children
Jack walks toward her, forming a , which floats over toward Sophie
She tries to grab at it
If one little kid can ruin Easter, then
we're in worse shape than thought
Sophie follows the snowflake as Jack leads it over to Bunny
Weeee
Weee, weee, weee
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 81
The snowflake lands on Bunny's nose and his concerns suddenly seem to slip away
Jack's magic is taking affect
'  -  - Close up on a flower, that opens to reveal an egg
The egg stands up wobbly on its spindly little legs
We pull out to reveal Sophie and Bunny's faces looking on, Sophie amazed, Bunny proud
You wanna paint some eggs
Yeah
Okay
Come on then
We pull out further to reveal a massive stone spire, covered in moss, as thousands of unpainted eggs stream down the side of it toward a green meadow
North and Jack stand in the midst of it all, slack-jawed, as the eggs rush towards them
Rimsky Korsakov
That's a lot of eggs
Uh, how much time do we have
Weeeeee
Woooohoooo
Bunny hops into view, Sophie clinging to his back smiling, leading a huge mass of eggs down a wide

) Alright troops, it's time to push back
That means eggs
Everywhere

North looks out over the eggs as they get sorted
() Single file
Sophie, on her back, is carried by the eggs through the sorting stones
She giggles as North waves at her while she passes by
(
) Heaps of you in every high-rise, farm house and trailer park
Baby Tooth flies across the screen, diverting our attention to a multicolored stream off in the distance
(
) In tennis shoes and cereal bowls
Baby Tooth joins an elf, who stands alongside an egg at the edge of a cliff
The elf pushes the egg over the cliff, into the stream, and celebrates with a victory dance
(
) Oh, there will be bathtubs filled with my beautiful googies
The elf turns just in time to see a stampede of colored eggs come barreling toward him
They knock him off the cliff as he and the eggs spill into the multi-colored stream below
Colored eggs wade through the water, emerging with and intricate  of all kinds
An unlucky egg veers off and gets stuck in a
We see a hand fish it out to reveal North, who looks at the egg curiously
It's now got a   on it and its little  kick madly
Okay, that's little strange
Naw, mate -- Bunny's surrounded by butterflies and cute little eggs
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 83
(') That's adorable
As a technicolored elf climbs out of the stream, North sets the egg down and lets it rejoin the herd
As Sophie leads a parade of eggs, Bunny jumps to an adjacent rock and sits up to address the eggs as they walk in stride
Meanwhile, Jack rides atop a group of sentinel egg that are marching in the back ground
There will be springtime
On every continent
And 'm bringing hope with me
- : a line of eggs running down curled vines as yetis sprinkle them with glitter
They continue on down various vine corkscrew-like shoots, decorating the eggs with stripes
confused elf emerges from the vines, striped with paint and walks off
- The striped elf walks past a Yeti, painting a mound of eggs red
Bunny enters frame and hops across the screen
Too Christmas-y, mate, paint `em blue
The Yeti throws its arms up in defeat and tosses the eggs
- beautifully painted egg hides in the grass
(
) Oh, what's over there
Sophie appears, spots the egg, and delicately lifts it out of the grass
She holds it close to admire the intricate detail of its shell
Sophie brings the egg to Bunny for him to inspect
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 84
(') That's a beauty
Bunny takes Sophie by the hand and leads her through a stone archway
(') Now all we gotta do is get him and his little mates through the tunnels, to the top, and we'll have ourselves Easter
Bunny looks out proudly at the eggs gathered in front of the in the distance
Jack approaches from behind and makes his way alongside Bunny, who holds Sophie in his arms
Its our first real vista of the whole warren
It's a spectacular sight
Not bad
Sophie yawns and begins to fall asleep
Bunny turns to Jack with a smile
Not bad yourself
Look, 'm sorry about that whole, you know, the "kangaroo" thing
It's the accent, isn't it
North comes up from behind with Tooth at his side
They turn toward Bunny, marveling at the sight of Sophie, fast sleep
It's touching
Bunny's face softens, as if remembering a distant memory
Ah, poor little ankle-biter
Look at her, all tuckered out
love her
They look up from the sleeping toddler toward Jack
He's taught them something today
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 85
think it's time to get her home
Bunny hands the sleeping Sophie over to Tooth
How about  take her home
Jack, no
Pitch is-- --no match for this
(twirls his staff) Which is why we need you here, with us
The Guardians look at Jack with concern
Trust me, 'll be quick as a bunny
: 1804 - '  - Jack tries to lay a sleeping Sophie down in her bed, but she won't let go of his neck
Finally, she releases her grasp only to roll over and fall out of bed
Baby Tooth gives Jack a scornful look
'  (
) Sophie

Jack and Baby Tooth's eyes widen
Sophie, asleep on the floor, is quickly covered with a blanket and given a squeaky stuffed animal

We should get back
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 86
Baby Tooth nods, when

) () Jack
Jack stops, confused
Where is that voice coming from
He looks out across the town, toward the woods, and the sound of the echoed voice
That voice,  know that voice
Baby Tooth looks to him, worried
(
) Jack
With that, Jack leaps off the window ledge
- Jack, carried by the wind, flies across town toward the sound of the eerie voice
Baby Tooth follows, trying to keep up
Jack takes a moment to orient himself and lands, settling on a rotating vent; as the momentum slowly spins him around, the voice calls out to him again
(
) Jack
Jack turns, looks to the woods, and takes off
-  - Jack and Baby Tooth land in the middle of a thickly wooded area
It's spooky
Jack scans the forest when again he hears
(
) Jack
Jack gives chase
He sprints through the thickets and enters a clearing only to find the decrepit remains of a rotting frame from a child's bed
Very creepy
What would that be doing in the woods, and how long has it been here
Don't worry, there's still time
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 87
Baby Tooth desperately tries to get Jack's attention by tugging at his tunic, and tweeting desperately
Jack takes his staff, and breaks through the damaged frame, revealing a hole leading deep underground
(
) Jack
What to do
Jack jumps down the hole, reluctantly followed by Baby Tooth
: 2100 - ' Jack continues along a long dark tunnel with Baby Tooth close behind
Eventually the labyrinth opens up to reveal a huge underground cavern
Baby Tooth continues to tug at Jack's tunic
(waving Baby Tooth off) Baby Tooth, Baby
come on
() have to find out what that is
'   - Jack can't believe his eyes
Dozens of huge bird cages hanging from the ceiling, and in them are the mini tooth fairies
They see Jack, and immediately perk up, tweeting and flitting like crazy
Jack jumps up onto one of the cages, then quickly leaps and holds onto the side of another one
() Shhhh
keep it down
(leaps to another cage) 'm gonna get you out of here, just as soon as  -- Jack
Jack turns away from the fairies, distracted
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 88
Jack
(under his breath) As  can -- Jack looks down and sees the tooth drawers from Tooth's Palace
Mounds of them heaped to the ceiling
And inside the drawers are the missing baby teeth
He drops down to a mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at the names on the boxes
In an instant he forgets his duties, and the fairies, and the Guardians and everything except those teeth, and the chance to finally get his memory back
The cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was
Jack finally looks up, as a shadow of Pitch crawls up a nearby column
(
) Looking for something
Jack swings around with his staff, shooting off a blast of ice, but Pitch isn't there
Jack takes off, following the sound of Pitch's cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber
Jack rounds a corner as he sees Pitch's shadow glide across the walls into a shadowed corridor
(
) Don't be afraid, Jack
'm not going to hurt you
Jack continues along a shadowed corridor
Afraid
Jack sees Pitch on a bridge across the cavern and heads after him

It's the one thing always know
Pitch finally turns to face Jack
(') People's greatest fears
Yours is that no one will ever believe in you
Panic flashes in Jack's eyes
As he backs away, the chamber fills with shadows, and Jack is spun around
He's disoriented as he thuds into a wall, which flips to reveal that it's actually the ground
Pitch, unseen now, chuckles
Jack's unsure of where he is
He looks back to see the cavern entrance -- he's right back where he started
(
) And worst of all, you're afraid you'll never know why
Why you
Why were you chosen
to be like this
Jack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks as Pitch's shadow encroaches on him
Well fear not, for the answer to that
Pitch is now directly in front of Jack, holding out a tooth box
(') Is right here
Jack's eyes widen at the sight - the face of a young boy etched into the box, and under it is the name "Jack Frost
" Do you want them, Jack
Your memories
He holds them out to Jack
Jack stares, fighting the impulse to grab them
He closes his eyes, struggling to make a decision, but when he opens them again, Pitch has disappeared
Pitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 90
Jack heads down a corridor, cast shadows from the Mini Tooth cages everywhere
(
) Everything you wanted to know
Pitch's face moves in and out of the shadows over the following
in this little box
Every time Jack turns, Pitch disappears
It's like Jack's trapped in a fun house
Multiple Pitch shadows have appeared on the wall around Jack
They're closing in on him
Why did you end up like this
Unseen
Unable to reach out to anyone
() You want the answers so badly
You want to grab them, and fly off with them
But you're afraid of what the Guardians will think
Jack's breath quickens
He's been pushed into a corner
You're afraid of disappointing them
() Well let me ease your mind about one thing
They'll never accept you
Not really
The shadows have overcome Jack
(trying to scramble away) Stop it
Stop it
Almost reluctantly, the shadows back away and Pitch appears before Jack
After all, you're not one of them
Jack aims his staff at Pitch
You don't know what  am
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 91
Of course  do
You're Jack Frost
You make a mess wherever you go
Why, you're doing it right now
Pitch tosses the box to Jack, who instinctively catches it
Jack looks up
Terror comes into Jack's eyes, as he realizes
What did you do
More to the point Jack, what did you do
Pitch begins to back away, becoming one with the darkness, laughing as he disappears
Jack charges towards him only to be swallowed whole by one of Pitch's black holes
: 2200 - - Jack flies out of Pitch's shadow, ready to strike
Suddenly, Jack realizes he's forgotten something
Baby Tooth
He turns to re-enter the hole in the wall only to find himself face to face with one of Bunny's stone emblems
(
) Happy Easter, Jack
Jack turns around
Suddenly, his eyes fill with dread as he realizes where he is
Thousands of broken egg shells lay strewn about, forming a path toward the light at the end of the tunnel

Bunny checks the eggs in his basket, then looks back toward the kids
Maybe he just hid them really well this year
Bunny, egg basket in hand, approaches a group of kids who seem to be wandering around searching halfheartedly, disappointed and listless
(
) Kids
Oi

There's nothing

There is

Jack turns to see Bunny, disheartened
( ) What
We should never have trusted you
() Easter is new beginnings, new life
Easter is about hope
() And now it's gone
Bunny turns away and moves toward the park, looking at the sign that reads, `Easter Egg Hunt
' This is like a punch in Jack's gut
He looks back to Tooth and North, both of whom look away, too hurt by Jack
He looks at them with a pained expression
This is exactly what Pitch said would happen
Jack reaches into his pocket, pulls out the tiny Russian nesting doll that North had given him, drops the doll to the ground, and takes off
As Jack leaves, carried off by the wind, we see the tiny Russian nesting doll laying on the ground

The ladder totters and Jamie loses his balance, beginning to fall
Whoaaa, whoa, whoa

Jamie grabs the gutter but it breaks loose, sending Jamie crashing down into a mound of snow
As Jamie gets up off the ground, he sees that the Easter egg was in fact a dirty old tennis ball
Jamie stands up, bewildered, and dusts himself off as his friends few have empty
Let's check the park again

But  understand
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 97
Jack whips around and shoots a burst of frost at Pitch, but it's quickly deflected by the Nightmare sand
You don't understand anything
Jack continues to attack, lashing out with his staff
Pitch blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength
() No
don't know what it's like to be cast out
Pitch strikes back, putting Jack on the defense
Jack jumps in the air
Their show of force escalates until they're shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind
As the wind and snow settle, Jack looks around stern and alert

Jack looks at the fractured reflections of themselves cast in the icy sculpture

Pitch, realizing how this looks, clarifies
And Jack Frost too
They'll believe in both of us
Jack stares at him, considering the offer
Then finally
No, they'll fear both of us
And that's not what  want
Jack turns and walks away
(') Now for the last time, leave me alone
Pitch looks confused and hurt
This is not the response he was expecting
Then
his eyes flame with anger
He made himself vulnerable, and Jack rejected him
No more negotiating now
Very well
You want to be left alone
Done
But first
Suddenly Jack hears a familiar twitter
Pitch reaches into his coat to pull out
Baby Tooth
Jack charges forward
There's terror in Baby Tooth's eyes
She squeaks as Pitch clenches her tight with his fist

The staff, Jack
Jack settles and the winds and snow subsides
(') You have a bad habit of interfering

She can hardly breathe
Jack has no choice

Pitch twirls the staff
(re: Baby Tooth) Alright, now let her go
No
You said you wanted to be alone
() So be alone
Baby Tooth squirms until she's finally able to peck Pitch in the hand with her beak
Pitch shrieks and throws Baby Tooth in the air and down into the mouth of a crevasse
No
Jack, enraged, can't believe what he's seeing
Pitch lifts the staff, and breaks it over his knee, cracking it in two
Light  from the staff and terror comes into Jack's eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain
Suddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him
As the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the chasm below
Pitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling
He throws the broken shards of Jack's staff down into the crevasse and casually walks away, disappearing on the horizon

Battered from the fall, Jack slowly looks up and notices Baby Tooth, lying lifelessly on the ground
Baby Tooth
He pulls himself to her and cradles her in his hands
You alright
Baby Tooth nods, but she's hurt, and cold
Jack does his best to shield her from the cold
Sorry, all  can do is keep you cold
Jack sits up and holds Baby Tooth in his hands
Pitch was right -  make a mess of everything
Jack is devastated
Baby Tooth's never seen him like this; it's heart breaking
then she gets a thought
Her expression hardens with determination
She wriggles deep into his pocket
Hey
Jack leans back and begins to close his eyes when he hears -- Jack

Jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two rudimentary ice-skates, leaving him  on the surface of a familiar  pond
And now we see what he sees, a girl of about  (with an uncanny resemblance to Jamie's sister Sophie) stands in her skates, rooted to the spot spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands
' Jack, 'm scared

She wobbles as it starts to separate

Jack's sister pauses a moment, then smiles through her fear
And just like that, Jack's demeanor changes
light is switched on inside him and the last thing that could be happening is what is actually happening

And Jack shows his sister the first leap, but mugs for her, almost losing his balance then catching himself
She laughs

But the movement propels him into the cracked ice
He looks up to see his sister safe - smiles - and then plunges into the dark cold water

Jack looks down at the two halves of his staff, and picks them up
He tries to fit them back together, but nothing happens
He tries again, this time using every ounce of strength left in him
Baby Tooth watches, her eyes widening as, a  of blue light shoots off the staff
Jack continues to push, until a the icy blue light spreads and melds the two ends of the staff back together

He breathes a sigh of relief
Suddenly, the entire factory begins to shake, knocking the robot doll to the ground
He dives after it, juggles it in the air, and catches it just before it hits the ground
Suddenly, streaks of   whoosh up into and around the factory
The dark sand snakes its way up and around the globe, causing the Yetis and Elves to scatter and knocking to the floor
The Yetis and Elves look up in horror as the black sand, now covering the globe, gives rise to Pitch, who stands before them cackling
You're all free to go
We won't be needing any Christmas toys this year, thank you
Nor ever again
The yeti with the robot dolls sinks his head and sighs in defeat

He can barely comprehend what he's seeing
Jamie looks back to the window as more of the window panes frost over

2900 - - Jack, the Guardians, and the children all come to gliding halt on their sleds
They look up to see Pitch standing atop a building with a confident smile, while the clouds stir behind him
Monty, late to the party, comes running joyously past Jamie and the Guardians who stand in silence as they stare up at the sky
Whoa, yeaaaaaaaah
(sees Pitch, makes -Turn) Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
You think a few children can help you
Against this
The Nightmare sand storm descends from the sky
North draws his sword, but the weight of the blade pulls him down
He can barely stand
Jack moves to North's side as they look back to Jamie, noticing the concern on his face
They're just bad dreams, Jamie
And we'll protect you, mate
Aww, you'll protect them

Jamie takes a moment to reflect while his friends look up at the sky in fear

The Guardians, amazed, watch as the kids squeeze past them
Still think there's no such thing as the boogeyman

do believe in you
'm just not afraid of you
Jamie thrusts out his hand toward the Nightmare wave
His friends follow suite, just as the Nightmare sand smashes into them
As it makes contact, the black sand
bursts into streams of

Everyone is amazed, hardly believing their eyes
Streams of Dreamsand swirl around the children
And then it's pandemonium
The Nightmares buck and jump as the sand makes its way past them
He watches, aghast, as his precious Nightmares transform back into golden Dreamsand and makes its way across town
- Tooth, amazed, watches as her wings suddenly flutter with a resurgence of strength and energy
She takes off and flies past the kids who cheer her on

Whooaaa
North's eyes widen
He straightens his back and unsheathes his scimitars
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 121
() Whoa, yeah
No
Get them
Pitch gives a signal and sends another wave of Nightmares toward the Guardians
(') Do your jobs
The petite rabbit looks at himself, waiting to be transformed
Oh yeah, come on, come on
When suddenly he's pursued by a snarling Nightmare
(') Oh, crikey
Bunny takes off running
North throws two snowglobes down to the ground, through which an army of yetis and elves emerge
No way
Bunny tries to scurry under a parked car in order to evade the attacking Nightmare, but he is snatched by his tail before he can get away
'm just a bunny
Suddenly, Bunny transforms back to his normal size and whips out his boomerangs while being held upside down
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 122
(') 'day, mate
Bunny kicks the Nightmare, flips into the air, and throws his boomerangs which slice through two more Nightmares, turning them to dust
Bunny drums his feet on the ground and an army of sentinel eggs suddenly rise up out of the earth
Caleb finds himself riding on top of one as they join the yetis and elves in battle
() Whoa
() Come on
Wooooohoooo
Elves riding toy ducks and planes come flying in overhead like bombardiers, turning Nightmares into puffs of black sand as they fly through them
The kids look to see a Nightmare charging toward them, only to stop in it's tracks once the kids turn to face it
Let's get `em
Aaaaaahhhhhh
The kids, accompanied by two elves in a bike and side car, charge an incoming Nightmare
The elf behind the wheel lunges toward it, biting at its haunches
() Come on guys, we can do it
The kids put their hands on the Nightmare, turning it to Dreamsand

Suddenly, a
Pitch turns toward the noise to see Jack on the roof

Jack jumps to an adjacent roof and lets out another blast of ice
: -  - ( ) All yours, mate
Bunny taps his foot on the ground and creates a rabbit hole for North and himself to travel through
: -  - Jack runs into Pitch as he rounds the corner of a chimney
Pitch let's a Nightmare arrow fly, which is suddenly deflected by Tooth as she flies through the area and takes out a few Nightmares of her own
Thanks, Tooth
Suddenly, Bunny comes flying out of a nearby chimney, drawing his boomerang as he lands
( ) Ho, ho,

The Nightmares surrounding Pitch explode into dust as the boomerang tears through them

Hyah
( ) Wrong roof

North jumps off the roof to greet him mid-air with his scmitars

As he gets to his feet he forms a scythe with his Nightmare sand and begins crossing swords with North
In an instant Pitch finds himself surrounded by the Guardians
Each of them take their turn to deal Pitch a few humiliating blows

Look at that

(off their confused looks) () Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 125

Guys, come on
Jamie leads his friends as they follow the streams of Dreamsand down the street toward the growing mass of golden sand
: -  - The Guardians advance toward Pitch
It's over Pitch
There's no place to hide
Pitch give them a wry smile and quickly descends into the shadows, casting multiple versions of himself along the alley walls
Suddenly, in their moment of distraction, Pitch rises up behind Jack, his Nightmare sand  in hand
Jack, look out
The other Guardians look on in horror as-- golden whip wraps itself round Pitch's hands
We follow the whip to reveal Sandy, coalescing from the funnel cloud of Dreamsand
He gives Pitch a look, wags his finger, and then uppercuts him into the air
(
) () Whoa
The Sandman
Sandy looks off to the side to where Jamie and his friends have gathered
He forms a Dreamsand hat and tips the cap to Jamie
Jamie, gleeful, waves back to Sandy as his friends stand behind him in awe
() Man, this is so cool
Yeah, alright
Wahoo
Wow
Sandy then looks to his whip and tugs on it, slamming Pitch into the ground and knocking him out
The Guardians cheer as they welcome Sandy's return
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 126
Welcome back, old friend
() Sandy
Oh, Sandy
You're alright
Sandy, come here
Yeah
Mate, you are a sight for sore eyes
Sandy floats into the air, and shoots streams of Dreamsand in every direction
-  - wisp of Dreamsand floats into a child's bedroom and touches his forehead while he sleeps
Suddenly, a Dreamsand figure forms above the child's head, it's the Tooth Fairy
'  - Lights begin to appear on the globe
Baby Tooth notices this, and perks up
Her wings start to flutter
Other fairies begin to fly
They shoot down to the tooth boxes and begin opening them
We see one of the faces on a box, and transition to the actual child who she goes from sad to happy as her fondest memories flood back
We zoom out of her face to see thousands of fluttering fairies and
: - Sophie peers out of her bedroom window, watching as streams of Dreamsand dance along the Burgess skyline
Pretty
: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 127
- More and more windows begin to shine bright with gold as swirls of Dreamsand fill the night sky
We pull back to reveal the globe in North's sleigh, now decorated with spots of yellow light
: -  - Nightmare comes barreling towards Cupcake
It screeches to a halt, inches from the girl's face
She gently taps the creature on the nose and turns into a Dreamsand Unicorn
Whoa
gigantic Dreamsand dinosaur foot comes down revealing a Dreamsand brontosaurus
As Dreamsand creatures fill the streets, the Guardians and children rejoice
() Yeah
Jamie stands in awe of a school of beautiful Dreamsand fish as they float by
Suddenly, he's hit in the head with a snowball
He turns to look and sees Jack, smiling
Jamie picks up a snowball and throws it at his friends
Almost instantaneously, a snowball fight ensures
() Oh yeah
Bring it on
Sandy salutes Jack and North, who are standing off to the side while the snowball fight escalates
Your center
It took awhile, but  figured it out
North tosses Jack a small item
Jack catches it and looks to his open palm, it's a Russian nesting doll in the image of Jack, similar to those found in North's workshop
Jack smiles and North gives him a wink in return
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 128
North is suddenly hit by a snowball and turns
He sees Claude, Caleb, and an elf; they immediately point fingers at each other
Ooohhh
beat, until North bursts out in laughter
() You're all on naughty list
( ) Bunny, think fast
He throws a snowball, which hits Bunny smack in the face
Pitch groans in pain, and rises up to see the town crawling with Dreamsand creatures, snowballs flying and yetis playing
( ) No
He whips around to see the kids - having the time of their lives - and no fear in their eyes
He rises up, his entire body shaking with rage, and screams at them
(') You dare have fun in my presence
am the Boogeyman He lunges at Jamie who come running toward him, Pitch's hands outstretched as if he's going to grab him by the throat
But Jamie runs right through him, laughing, joyous
(') Noooo
Pitch gasps, realizing that he no longer has any power over the children
The devastation plays across his face
(') (under his breathe) No
He sees the Guardians approach, standing side by side with one another
Pitch turns and flees into the forest
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 129
- Pitch runs through the shadows in terror
He comes crashing through the trees of the forest, and out onto the ice of the pond
He looks over his shoulder to see if the Guardians are on his tail, when
He runs smack into North's chest
Pitch slips on the ice, and falls backwards
He looks up to see North smiling down at him
Leaving the party so soon
You didn't even say goodbye
Tooth tosses something to Pitch which he catches
He looks down
It's a quarter
quarter
fist punches him right in the jaw, and a single tooth goes skittering across the ice
Tooth shakes out her hand
And that's for my fairies
() You can't get rid of me
Not forever
There will always be fear
So what
As long as one child believes, we will be here to fight fear
Really
Then what are they doing here
Hundreds of Nightmares emerge from the woods, surrounding the pond
It's terrifying, but the Guardians seem unphased
They can't be my Nightmares, 'm not afraid
Looks like it's your fear they smell
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 130
Suddenly, Pitch's eyes get huge with terror as the Nightmares move in on him
He begins to back away, but the Nightmares pick up speed as they charge toward him
Ahhh, no
He tries to run, but it's impossible to get his footing on the ice
He falters, and is swept up in the stampede of Nightmares
The streaks of black whip and latch themselves onto Pitch as the black cloud carries him through the forest
(') No, no, nooooooo
Pitch struggles to escape, but the mass of black sand pulls him deep into the forest, under the frame of the broken bed, and back down into the dark depths of the underground
He looks up at the moon as he disappears and the hole in the earth seals itself up
: 3200 - - Pale and faint in the day, but oddly close and welcoming
It can't be, but -- is that the barest hint of a  on the Moon
Jack smiles as he looks up at it
He hears Tooth's laugh and turns to find North, Tooth, Bunny and Sandy, their faces shining with pride
Tooth comes flying in to give Jack a hug
She lifts him off the ground as they embrace
They share a moment and she soon recoils with giddy embarrassment as Baby Tooth interjects
Jack acknowledges Baby Tooth and gently pats her on the side of her face as North steps forward
Are you ready now, Jack
() To make it official
Jack looks over, a stern elf is hitting a horn against his palm
Yeti hands North the book we saw when Jack and the Guardians first met
Sandy and Bunny share a boastful look
(') Then is time you take Oath
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 131
North opens the book, flips through several pages, and takes a moment before he speaks
(') ( ) "Will you, Jack Frost
vow to watch over the children of the world
Jamie and his friends along with a crowd of yetis, elves, and eggs all make their way across the pond to the rest of the group
As they approach we see settle on Jamie, who stands at the center of the group

Klasno
North picks up Jack, gives him a hug, and kisses him on both cheeks
Jack winces, then looks up to North with a smile
() That's my boy
Woo
() Alright Jack
Yeah
Awesome
Imitating North, an elf picks up the elf standing next to him and gives him a big kiss
After an awkward pause, the affectionate elf is punched in the face
Jack looks to see several fairies hovering nearby, forming the shape of a heart
One of the swooning fairies faints and falls to the ground
Keep it together, girls
() Jack
You did it Jack
Wooo
You're in the Guardians
Yeah, Jack
Yay
Yeah
You earned it
You're Jack Frost
Yay
Awesome, yay
() You guys, look
() That's Santa's sleigh
The group looks up to the sky as North's sleigh comes in for a landing
The tie-dyed elf rescues a lone egg from the skis of the sleigh as it glides across the icy pond
() Wow, it's real
That is wicked
Whoa, that was awesome
Ohh

Whoa, did you guys see that
That's awesome
Wow
Whoa
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 133
(to North, wryly) Everyone loves the sleigh
() Wow

So totally insane
North turns away from Bunny and puts his hand on Jack's shoulder
Time to go
As the kids look on in wonder, Sandy throws up his hands creating a shower of Dreamsand, which drifts down on the children
() Whoa
It's beautiful
Wow, that was awesome
Meanwhile, Bunny hands an egg to Sophie who giggles and pats the brim of his nose
Happy Easter ya little anklebiter
'm gonna miss yah
Bye, bye, bunny
Jamie realizes what's about to happen
You're leaving
But, what if Pitch comes back
Jack looks back at Jamie, who seems wistful and worried
(') What if we stop believing again
If  can't see you -- Jack kneels down to look Jamie in the eye
Hey, hey, slow down, slow down
You telling me you stop believing in the moon when the sun comes up
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 134
(considers, then) No
Okay, well do you stop believing in the sun when clouds block it out
() No
We'll always be there, Jamie
And now
we'll always be here
(points to Jamie's heart) Which kind of makes you a Guardian too
Jamie smiles
Jack stands up and heads toward the sleigh
Jamie's friends stand off to the side rubbing their eyes as they become drowsy
() can't keep my eyes open
think gotta go home
Let's go home
What time is it
'm sleepy
Jack
Jamie runs over and wraps his arms around Jack
For a moment, Jack's astonished and then gives Jamie a warm embrace
Jack stands up and gets in the sleigh with the rest of the Guardians
Hyah
Jack and the Guardians look toward the kids as the sleigh takes off
Jamie  behind the sleigh, following Jack
In spite of it all, he doesn't want to let go
The sleigh takes off into the sky
Jamie stops unable to follow
() Woooo

(
) My name is Jack Frost
And 'm a Guardian
How do  know that

Jack smiles
