Workers
All the bustle and cacophony of a major seaport
We  ourselves focusing on
With the of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries it onto a ship
- Through night-vision binoculars,  , 28, watches the mysterious crate
Charlie is young to run his own crew but he's a born leader
Lyle

've got the orbital data and clock corrections for each satellite that gets the signal
That'll make my reading as solid as the Precise Positioning Service that only the can use
We're talkin' 100 meter horizontal accuracy, 156 meter vertical accuracy,
340 nanoseconds time accuracy

Steve has an arrogant confidence mixed with the hint of a smile
Why can't he talk like a person
Because he's not
do need one more thing, Charlie
What's that
Someone to turn the goddamn homing device on
No signal, no score

Half-Ear is a large black man with a Southern accent and a hearing aid
What's that shit
- book
It's called reading
You should try it some time
Handsome Rob holds up three fingers
You wanna read something
Read between the lines
- Well here's something even you can relate to
Albert got a lotta trim
That genius thing is a babe magnet
Lemme see that book
- The final member of the crew,  , 50s, is a tasteful man buying a very tasteful, and very expensive, diamond necklace
The saleswoman wraps it up as he dials a number on his cell phone
(
) Hello
Hi, sweetie
'  -  - , 27, crushingly attractive, has just stepped out of the shower, hair still wet, body wrapped in a towel
Daddy
How are you
'm sending you something
Really
Does it smell nice
No
But it's sparkly
Does it come with a receipt
'm having it sent to you from the store
(toweling her hair) Why not bring it by yourself
We could have dinner
He leaves the store and heads for the
Be a long trip
'm in Genoa
She doesn't like the sound of that
Let me guess
Checking out the birthplace of Christopher Columbus
Something like that
With your parole officer's approval
He steps into the elevator
Rides up
think 've paid my
my last visit
liked the guy, but we never really connected
What are you into, Dad
Don't break my heart
You told me you were through
After this,  swear to you,  am
You promised me
Daddy, don't do this
The elevator door opens, Bridger steps out and starts down the hall
Everything's going to be fine
've got to go now
love you
Bye
He clicks off then uses his card key to step into the -- - He eyes Charlie, who looks pretty tense
Italians
Not yet
Don't worry, they'll come through
You can trust these guys
trust everyone
It's the devil inside them that  don't trust
(then, to Charlie) Got a sec
My office
- They step inside, Charlie closing the door
How you feeling, boss
Fine
'm fine, fine
Bridger seems amused by that answer
You know what fine, stands for, don't you
Fucked-up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional
You've become quite the philosopher since you quit drinking
You don't like me sober
No, 'm glad
Makes you a better thief
Bridger pulls out a fine cigar, still in its wrapper, hands it to Charlie
For after the haul
Hope  get to fire it up
If Steve's Italians are a no-show, it's three months prep down the shitter and 've dragged you out of retirement for nothing
This is kinda nice
You being the boss with all the worries, me just along for the ride
Ain't you sweet
From the other side of the door, they  -- (
) Charlie
- Charlie takes the binoculars from Steve
He climbing onboard the ship
Your Italians
Yup
Dixie cups

toss 'em away if there's a problem down the road
- In , the Inspectors quiz the   about the mysterious crate
One Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips of plywood,  unmarked cardboard boxes inside
The other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open
It is filled with tomatoes
He takes a bite out of one
Nods
Everything seems to be order
The Captain looks relieved
The inspector closes the cardboard box but
Watch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power button on a small   and stuffs it in with the tomatoes
- On Lyle's computer screen, a pulsating dot appears, , sending out precise longitude and latitude
For those about to rock, we salute you
Charlie dials his cell phone
() - Handsome Rob answers
Yeah
Let's get rich
Handsome Rob pulls over
They're at the port
They can see the mysterious crate being lowered into the ship's hold
Half-Ear climbs out, taking a large duffel bag with him
: () - , The Captain is doing his final checks before launch to -- where we  Half-Ear, in scuba gear, applying Nitramon explosive primer to the hull of the ship
() - Plowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded beach
Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve is in the passenger seat
Lyle, in the back, is still on the laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth
goes his bubble gum
Can you chill out back there
You'd make a hummingbird nervous
- Half-Ear finishes up
Speaks into the headset inside his gear
- 'm done
Over
(
) Copy that
Enjoy the ride, cowboy
Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into deeper water

It's Charlie and John Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at a good 5 m

Both DPVs drag equipment bags
Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the handlebar of Charlie's , being fed information via Lyle's laptop

It's a wild ride
Through the headset inside his gear, he : (

Half-Ear lets go of the ladder
The ship's propellers speed by just above his head
He removes a radio-controlled detonator
Hits the button
- The hull of the boat
' very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate is opened
Water   and the crate falls right through the cavity, vanishing
The huge, heavy crate drops down
down
hits the bottom
Chaos rules
She's taking on water fast
No way to save her
The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water
- Parked in the sand at the top of the bay
Steve looks out to the bay through infrared binoculars
The ship is going down
The crew on the dingy head back to the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach
- The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting bag that is used to move heavy loads through water
The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits
Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood
The cardboard boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere
And now we see what was hidden between the boxes
large safe
They move like clock-work
Half-Ear aims an underwater light at the dial
Charlie drills a small hole near the dial
John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels of the combination lock
until the door pops open
As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their headsets, heard by all
Sweet Jesus
"That for which all virtue is sold
And almost every vice -- gold
" And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl
We're talking thirty million dollars worth of gold
() - They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be alive
Steve takes another peek through his infrared binoculars and sees -- The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then disappear
- The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag
They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves which cause the parachute to
Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing floats up about fifteen feet
Half-Ear holds onto its side, going along for the ride
Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which are tethered to the inflatable bag
As they glide through the water towards the secluded beach, we
: - The Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps
() The gold is in three crates in the cargo bay
Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front
The others are in the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear
They are pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who abstains
He holds up his empty cup
My name is John and 'm a very rich alcoholic
And 'm going to live my life one very rich day at a time
Alright, John
They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the Humvee
Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him
As Bridger lights it for him -- You planned this one down to a t, kid
It's a gift
You saw the big picture, made contingencies, covered the angles
Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous
Shit, you made thirty million dollars in gold drop out of sight without holding a gun
Who else could've pulled that off
You could've
had big shoes to fill
Fill the shoes but don't follow the footprints
What're you talking about
You've lived the life
My life's been nothing but fake IDs, fake business cards and divorce papers
This is the only thing that's real
Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in his wallet
Stella's a beautiful girl
She's amazing
And  spent half her childhood in prison
This is a once in a lifetime haul, Charlie
Bring down the curtain after this one
Make a new life
Find someone amazing and be there for her
As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth -- Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks the road
The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it
Shit
Click
That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed against Handsome Rob's temple
Anyone acts stupid and his brains go on the windshield
They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, - 47s leveled at the crew
Steve has double-crossed them
: shocked would be a good place to start
What the hell do you think you're doing
Sorry Charlie
But  want the box of Cracker Jack all to myself
The Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the Humvee
You're not thinking this through
It's a stupid move
Think so
Well you're the brilliant one
The Master Planner
Isn't that so, John
Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, the -47s aimed at the others
You bet on the wrong horse
We'll hunt you down
You're gonna regret this
Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger
No regrets, Dixie cup
He shoots Bridger in the head
Just like that
The Italians follow suit, -47s  out bursts of full automatic fire at the crew
They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire
Glass shatters
Bullets ricochet
They're in the epicenter of hell
Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas
Driving blind
The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, metal tearing against metal
The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff and the raging water below
The gunners keep
Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires
It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber
It careens off the road and -- The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the raging river
Water cascades in through the open windows
They're thrown around as the Humvee rides the rapids
The passenger door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is swept further downstream
Through the foam and spray, Charlie looks over to Bridger
He's dead
The torrent
Only their chests and heads are above water
And that's not all
There's a
The Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over
It cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser of water
It sinks out of sight
- The crates of gold are now inside the Italians' Jeep
Steve climbs in, leaving the crew for dead
- The Humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud
- The Jeep jerks to a stop
door opens and the bodies of the two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud
Steve is alone now
Just him and the millions in gold
- The water entombs them
Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot mists the water red
They manage to get the door open
They start to swim out but Charlie won't go without Bridger
He grabs his friend's body and pulls it up with him
- They drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie pull Bridger's corpse
Charlie is shocked, tormented, grieved, and angry beyond description
Against the rocky embankment, he holds Bridger
Not wanting to ever let go
(
) If you would have told me that would spend the next three years searching for Steve Bandell,  would have said that was nothing
Cause would have spent a lifetime looking for that bastard if  had to

top of the line safe
The only light in the office is the beam of a penlight on the dial
spin the dial, feeling for "contact points", areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt -- if you have the touch
woman holds the penlight in her teeth while trying to crack the safe
It's Stella Bridger, now 30
: Three Years Later Philadelphia She manipulates the dial
Click
She grabs the safe's lever and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of pride and relief
But before we see what's inside -- lurk at the doorway
You always work in the dark
Buzz of the fluorescents throws me off
She's all yours
The cops come closer and only now do we realize that they're on the same team
Damn
Chris Perley couldn't crack it
Neither could Michael Hoyt
Now you know who to call first
You're expensive, Stella
Those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs
Goodwill, community service
Well  do it for the money
'll send you the bill
Don't you want to see what's inside
never look
Bye, guys
And as she walks off, they do look -- at her
- car    on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini Cooper
, a worldwide motoring icon
Its shape crouches low to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives it the legendary Mini look
If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile soul
() - Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo Rally three times
She passes a minivan, a breeze with the Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling
She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs
Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in
Brake
Shift
Hard turn
She parallel parks the Mini with ease
She's right in front of -- Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: Stella hops out of the Mini
With a poised walk she heads inside
- It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along with some new models
Stella's  greets her
How long
Four minutes, forty-three seconds
High-five
You're the man
So what's on the line-up
2:00
Home safe in Fairmount Park
Owner died and the wife never knew the combination
And Todd Milliken called
He has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning
Says he added two false contact points on the tumbler
Tell him if  don't have it opened in six minutes flat, breakfast is on me
And there's a Charlie Croker in your office
He said you two know each other
(an aside) And he looks pretty fine for a white boy
Without a response, Stella heads over to -- and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that line the shelves
Charlie Croker
He turns around
Smiles
Charming
Hi, Stella
She steps inside
Refresh my memory
After you came to see me and told me what happened to my father,  told you  never wanted to see you again, didn't
Yeah
You did
So 'm a little confused
found him
At first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling
can tell you where he is
don't want to know
Are you sure
She doesn't answer
He's in Los Angeles
She doesn't respond
Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask him not to
So he goes on
The gold bricks he stole from us were minted in Singapore and decorated with the face of a Balinese girl
've had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your father's, Philly Steak
Stella remembers him
When  was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find
He got word from an
connection named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the Balinese girl on them, three or four at a time
You ever heard the expression, cut to the chase
tracked Steve down to an address in the Hollywood Hills
He's changed his last name to Frezelli
And get this: he had a Worthington 1000 installed in the house before he even moved in
We both know that you don't install a Worthington 1000 unless you have something precious to guard
Precious or not,  don't deal with ill-gotten goods
We boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio-weapons
Now that doesn't exactly make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed
Problem is, no one in my crew can handle that safe
And  need someone  can trust
And you think that's me
Haven't you heard that  work for the other side
What  heard is that you have your father's touch
And he was the only safecracker  knew who could open a Worthington 1000
'm not a safecracker
'm a professional safe and vault technician
You're John Bridger's daughter
And this is our chance to set things right
That sets her off
Our chance
Who do you think you are coming in here
Stealing the gold isn't going to bring my father back to life
No, it won't
Then get out
Charlie comes out of her shop and starts down the sidewalk
Suddenly, Handsome Rob appears out of the crowd and is walking next to him
How'd it go with the chick
'm working on it
don't want her on the crew, Charlie
Gotta have her
Important piece of the puzzle
There has to be someone else
What about Bill Huchins
Doing ten long at Levinworth
Red 'Reilly
Chemo
Martin Hernandez
Found Jesus
Handsome Rob stops Charlie
don't want a civilian to screw this up
She has the skill
And the motivation
Exactly
She's emotional
You know what happens when emotion gets into it
It's emotional for all of us at this point
Don't kid yourself
/ - has his back to the bar
He's a blue blood trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a Ferrari
It's all in my patented sideways glance
Like this
He gives a sideways glance to Stella; it's their first date
hit each woman on the jury with one of these
We make contact
And know exactly what they're doing
Undressing me with their eyes
see
What a nightmare
Someone bumps into Stella, a mumbled, "Excuse me
" Nightmare continues
The case is all but won
That's why in jury selection  choose as many women as possible
Except lesbians, of course
can tell in sixty seconds if they're a lesbian
Want to know how  know
If they don't undress you with their eyes
Precisely
Like that waitress right there
See
She's looking at me right below my belt
Definitely not a lesbian
waitress is indeed looking below Richard's belt
But Stella notices that she was only looking because Richard's zipper is all the way down
She smiles
Your fly
am fly
And 'm da bomb
Just wait until later tonight
Suddenly a  stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking Richard's suit in red wine
Oh, man
'm sorry
You should be
Moron
What the hell's wrong with you
It was an accident
'm very sorry
Where's the manager
Richard Worth is not paying to have his suit cleaned
Damn
(to Stella) 'm going to
don't believe this
He starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he was occupying empties, Charlie fills it
think your date's going pretty well, what do you think
She shoots him a look that could reverse global warming
What are you doing here
What do you mean
come here all the time
don't think so
Sure
Lawyers, Judges, my kind of crowd
See that gentleman there, he sentenced me to 90 days in county once
We need to talk
No, you need to listen
want you to leave
Got it
Hey,  paid valet parking prices to get in here, not to mention a twenty spot to the busboy to spill that drink on Mister Zipper
You --  don't believe this
You paid someone to spill that drink
Actually, you paid for it
Charlie returns her wallet
Didn't notice it was me who bumped into you earlier, did you
Anyway, was hoping we could get to know each other a little better before we leave for Los Angeles
already booked your flight
You truly are a fatuous, odious man
have no idea what you just said, but  like the sound of it
Well maybe you'll understand this
Hit the road, Jack -- Charlie -- Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause 'll kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels
She means it, too
'm beginning to worry about this whole relationship
'll let you in on a secret
You can't have a relationship with a pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind of thief
Charlie looks away, lets her have her point
This whole thing is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he uses a whole new approach
His emotions are genuine
John wasn't just a man  crewed up with, he was my friend, he was the closest thing to a father  ever had
wish to God  could bring him back
But all  can do is go after this guy, the guy that killed him, and hit him where he lives
She feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply, they're interrupted by -- Everything alright, Stella
He's back, red wine splotched on his suit
Fine
Richard
Charlie
Charlie was just saying goodbye
But for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring into to him
Can  help you with something
Oh, sorry
was just undressing you with my eyes
And with that, Charlie goes
Stella can't help but smile
'  - She comes home, having shed her date
'  - She goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasn't looked at for years
She opens it
Inside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her in Italy
It brings tears to her eyes
'  - He lies in bed, can't sleep
His phone rings
He picks up
Hello
'  - She's on the other end of the line
'm in this for one thing, Charlie, and one thing only
want to see the look on his face when his gold is gone
He took my father from me, 'm taking this; it's the best  can do
: - Stella's Mini passes, weaves, tucks in between cars
She drives like a madman
() Charlie feels like he's inside a video game
see Drive Defensively is your motto
Don't worry
Jack Daniels never let me down
She slaps the dashboard of her car
By the way you drive, 'm not surprised you named your car after a bottle of whiskey
Left
Jack Daniels was chief engineer of the Mini
And  drive it exactly the way it was meant to be driven
She whips down the avenue
Another left
She hangs a left
We're going in circles
Who's tailing you this week
The possibilities are endless
- The Mini parks in the middle of the huge, empty lot that surrounds Veterans Field, home of the Philadelphia Phillies
She looks around
Where are they
We're a little early
didn't expect us to get here quite that fast
There
Vespa pulls into the lot, headed their way
It's Lyle
Charlie starts the introductions
That's Lyle
Gearhead
He's who really invented Napster
: -   - 1999 - Below a Metallica poster, Lyle has fallen asleep on his desk
His roommate, Napster creator  , recognizable in his trademark baseball cap, sneaks a peek at Lyle's computer
(
) At least that's how Lyle tells it
: - And now they see a monster pick-up truck bouncing into the lot,   from its Alpine at ear-bleeding levels
Half-Ear
Explosives
He lost fifty percent of his hearing in the fifth grade
: - 1990 - 10 year old boy stands in front of a toilet in the stall
Water geysers out of the bowl and soaks him
(
) One -80 in the toilet bowl too many
Some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing
That was rad
- Wha'
: - And now a  in the distance
Stella looks
Sees a car streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves coming off the pavement
Closer
Faster
classic Mustang
Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer
It's had some serious custom work done to it
Handsome Rob
Premier wheel man
He once drove all the way to
just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase
: - 1999 - Handsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out his open window -- We watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled with cop cars in pursuit
(
) Smashed the mark by twelve minutes
We now see Handsome Rob through the lens of a  news helicopter camera
(
) He got a hundred and ten love letters sent to his jail cell from women who saw him on
: - As the cars converge in the parking lot
And what about you
've been a thief since  had baby teeth
: - is shoved against a chain link fence by a
Cough it up, Charlie
Charlie hands the bully a dollar bill
The bully puts it in a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off, laughing it up with his bully pals
Charlie turns to his 2nd grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye
So much for lunch
You need a dollar
thought he took your last one
He did
Charlie holds up the over-stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed from the bully
But  got lots more now
: - Doors open simultaneously
Everyone out
The crew eyes Stella
Charlie gets right down to business
This is Stella
She's working with us on this one
IDs
Handsome Rob hands out fake driver's licenses
(reading his) Melvin Lisp
Could  -- just once -- have a cool name
- (also complaining) 220 pounds
Try 180
Try 'Deal  Meal'
don't even have a cool nickname
Enough of this sewing-circle shit
Phones
Half-Ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their old phones
- Philly Steak says these are clean as a whistle
He also got us four dozen internal chips with different numbers
Change out the chips twice a day
As Charlie hands out airline tickets -- We travel to
separately
You still haven't told us the most important thing
What exactly is the job, Charlie
And who exactly is she
Lyle and Half-Ear have been kept in the dark until now
This is Stella Bridger
And we're finishing the job that we started in Italy
They're a little stunned at first
- Holy shit
It's about time
: -  - The crew deplane from five different airplanes, different air carriers
They disperse in separate vehicles
See Charlie at Avis, renting a car
See Handsome Rob renting a -Haul panel truck
See Stella on a hotel shuttle bus
See Half-Ear on the underground Metro Rail, taking the Red Line
See Lyle in a taxi, headed south on Figueroa Street
He notices a
For a moment, their eyes connect
She is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps through Lyle: if only
But the taxi passes by
Charlie checks into Shutters, with its Victorian beach house feel and oceanfront view
Stella's at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills with its opulent lobby
Handsome Rob's at the Standard, with its kitschy decor and ironic style
He stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the front desk where a performance artist writhes and a  spins out rhythmic throbs
Very
Half-Ear's at the new Renaissance Hollywood Hotel adjacent to the dramatic Babylon Gate and the Kodak Theatre
And Lyle's at the Downtown Bonaventure, riding up the glass elevator
Perfect gearhead hotel
-  - The five of them sit in chairs on the balcony of his hotel room
There's a sweeping view of the Pacific
We need an in to get a video blueprint of the interior
We're not going into this place blind
Half-Ear, you take the first surveillance shift
Who goes in, who goes out, levels of security, you know the drill
- You got it
also want audio surveillance on his phone
'll hack into the phone company's central office remote observance monitoring system and fool it into thinking there's a legal tap on the line
Reroute the digital copies of his calls to our own listening post
How long
'll burn through the night, have it up and running before morning
(to Handsome Rob) We need to know how long to get from the house to Union Station downtown
No problemo
Stella
How much time will you need with the safe
'll have it open in five minutes flat
It's not the same as opening a safe for the cops
Your heart will be pounding in your ears
Perspiration on your fingertips
It's a whole different ball game
You get me to the safe, 'll open it
Out over the ocean, the sun is in its death throes, bruising the sky a coiling purple and orange
'  - Nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac on Oporto Drive in the Hollywood Hills
Chrome
Glass
Carved wood
- The -Haul panel truck is parked on the side of the road that overlooks Oporto Drive and Steve's house
- - It's been converted into their surveillance vehicle, the back outfitted with monitors and surveillance equipment
Half-Ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a micro-cassette recorder
His binoculars focus in on the fence that surrounds the perimeter of the property
- (into recorder) We've got an anti-scaling fence
Hardened, electroplated steel
Hacksaw won't work
We'll need Nitramon
The binoculars    a guard booth where a guard keeps an eye on the gate
- Armed guard
9MM semi-automatic in the holster
Security booth is accessible and ideal for a triple charger chemical grenade
The binoculars    four Rottweilers prowling the grounds
- Shit
Dogs
Why do black men hate dogs
'll tell you why, Charlie
Because dogs are racist
That's a natural fact
Someone else deal with 'em
101  - sea of cars, gridlock in
Crammed in the middle of the traffic meltdown is Handsome Rob's rental car
() Timing out the getaway route
He's got a Thomas Guide on the passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but he's going nowhere fast
He futilely leans on the car horn

He takes digital photos with a telephoto camera
on a security pad on the front door
(into micro cassette player) Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System
Monitors 132 points for intrusion, fire, and environmental hazards
Best way around it is to get a back door password, trip the alarm during the heist, then call it in as a false alarm
: '  -  - turns the dial to a Worthington 1000 vault
The vault opens and voila: stacks and stacks of gold bricks
'  - The same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag to see Steve, three years older than when we last saw him, his beard shaved away
- - Through his digital camera lens, Lyle watches Steve walk towards his car: a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina
It's the first time he's seen Steve in three years
(into micro cassette recorder) 15:25
There he is
He's gained 15 to 20 pounds living off our money
And Handsome Rob, you're going to be pissed when you see his wheels
Lyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard booth
The gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in reverse
The Ferrari zooms away
- Another route
Handsome Rob's rental car is in the left turn lane waiting for the light to change
The light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of Handsome Rob is so preoccupied with applying her make-up that she doesn't go until he honks but by then it's too late as she makes it through the light but he doesn't
He checks his stopwatch
Simmers
-   - In a bikini, Stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana, reading a copy of Vogue magazine
But as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading the owner's manual for the Worthington 1000 safe which she's inserted in the fold of Vogue
- - Charlie's shift
He sees a Latina housekeeper get into her car
(into micro cassette recorder) Housekeeper leaves at 17:30
&   - Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store
The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian named  unlocks another door
He is the gold dealer that Philly Steak told Charlie about
You're right on time
&   - Yevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace
As they make their way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive -- All those poor bastards out there putting their life savings in banks and &Ls and mutual funds
What do they think -- that when the collapse comes they can depend on the government
don't think so
Steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them
Is the camera off
Of course
Just like you said never tape you, you can see for yourself
Steve sees the red light is off
He lays the duffel bag on a table, unzips it, pulls out three 25 pound gold bricks with the face of a Balinese Girl stamped on each one
As Yevhen inspects them -- Governments are nothing more than puppets on the strings of the Trilateral Commission with their twisted gods
Yevhen retrieves a briefcase, opens it, presenting Steve with stacks of Ben Franklins: $100,000 worth
As Steve inspects the cash -- mean, it's so obvious that in a world where  can overturn the Supreme Court, not to mention Microsoft's nefarious financial machinations, this, is our only refuge; gold
Steve closes the briefcase
Plus a little walking around money
7TH  - fender bender in the middle of an intersection has traffic backed up for miles
Handsome Rob checks the latest time on the stopwatch
- - Through night-vision binoculars Charlie sees a (different) security guard open the gate as Steve returns
He watches Steve go inside his house
Through the windows, he sees him use a remote to turn on a
101  - freeway sign says:   1/2 can see the exit up ahead, but traffic is so backed up and going nowhere that it feels like it's a hundred miles away
And it's not even rush hour
Just life in
Idling on the freeway, he looks at the drivers in the cars beside him
He sees a businesswoman reading the Wall Street Journal
Sees a man with his finger deep, deep up his nose
Where's a grenade launcher when you need one
- Our crew walks along the pathways of Japanese gardens that wind along outside the restaurant
It's a breathtaking view from high in the Hollywood Hills
Some tourists take in the vista
Doesn't matter what time it is
It's either bad traffic, peak traffic, or slit-your-wrists traffic
- You gotta ride the Metro-Rail, man
'm sure it's ideal for carrying a ton of gold, genius
What's your guesstimate
If we had all green lights, fourteen minutes
But in the twenty times 've done it, the average is thirty- two minutes, with a top time of fifty minutes
Then we'll travel like Rockefeller
They don't know where Charlie is going with this, but they've been around him long enough to know it's going somewhere
When cars first started catching on, workers on tall ladders would use these swiveling colored boards for traffic signals
Now whenever Rockefeller would take the drive from his mansion to his office on Wall Street, the workers would make sure that he got green boards all the way
How do we get all green lights
Lyle
Let me see what  can do
- Did you know that the first traffic signal to be patented was invented by a black man named Garrett Morgan
(to Charlie) You're not the only one who watches the History Channel
We still need an in to get the video blueprint
Carpet cleaners
Gutter cleaners
Flower delivery
We'll never get by the guard unless they're certain it's legit
'm thinking cable
We cut his cable, he calls the cable company
We show up
Send a cable technician into the house with a pinhole video camera while we get a feed through an antenna
Who plays cable technician
Steve thinks we're all dead
But Stella knows that's not exactly true
He doesn't think Stella is dead; he doesn't know her at all
If you're all dead,  guess 'm the man for the job
Are you up for it
In for a penny, in for a pound
-   - Service trucks pull into the lot
Technicians are getting out, finishing their shifts
( ) Handsome Rob behind the wheel
Lyle shotgun, aiming his digital camera at the exiting workers
'm telling you
He claims he named it Napster because his hair is so nappy underneath that cap of his
But  know the real reason
It's because  was  when he stole the idea from me
should've been on the cover of Wired magazine
Would you clam up
You'd give a woodpecker a headache
'm the Napster
Okay
You're the Napster
Heads up: cable chick
They see a female service tech getting out of her work truck
Lyle zooms his camera lens in on her Adelphia Cable work shirt
It has  sewn in above her right breast
Becky
Nice name
wonder what she calls the other one
And it's such a mystery why you don't have a girlfriend
had a girlfriend
Unfortunately even though the relationship ceased in an objective reality, it's still going on in my mind
(tapping his head) That woman's lived in here rent-free for four years
Lyle takes a few more pictures of Becky
Okay
All we need now is a work shirt like this one and a service truck like that one
You think Stella will be able to pull it off
have my doubts, but there's no talking to Charlie
Maybe he's been inserting his hard drive into her software
Clouds the judgment
He knows better than to mix business with pleasure
(getting out of the car) Only 'm allowed to do that
Where you going
To get a work shirt and a service truck
Lyle watches him stroll over to Becky and strike up a conversation in the parking lot
Lyle can't hear what's being said, but Becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is Handsome Rob for a reason
'  - a trail of clothes, hastily littered, that lead to the cable chick's bed
Lit candles are on the bedside table
The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets
Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure
His eyes flash open
He slips out of bed
Pulls on his pants
Reaches into her pants and removes her key chain
He selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick: he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges
He returns the key chain
Takes a couple more steps, past her panties, past her bra and
He snags her work shirt
Then he's gone
'   - Using locksmith equipment, he cuts a key that matches the impression on the candle wax
- Stella, wearing Becky's work shirt, arrives before any other workers
Using the key Handsome Rob made, she unlocks the door to the cable truck and gets in
- The cable truck pulls over
Charlie and Lyle climb into the back where they can't be seen
- The cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street from Steve's house
Charlie gets out
He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a sidewalk cement grate that says  on it
Inside are cable wires that feed the street
He crouches over and uses pliers to disconnect one of the cables
'  - He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee
He hits the remote control for a
It turns on but there's nothing but snow
He goes into the living room and checks out the plasma
The cable's not working in here, either
He hits an intercom button on his telephone
- answers the intercom
What can  do for you, Mister Frezelli
The cable's out
See if you can get someone over here to fix it'
Yes, sir
He finds the number and dials
() - Lyle monitors a digital copy of the security guard's call that's being routed to his laptop
Then he takes off his headphones and tells Charlie and Stella: Whoa
've never heard the Muzak version of Purple Haze before
When's the appointment
Thursday between 9 a
m
and 3 p
m
Charlie dials a number on his cell phone
- The security guard answers the phone
Hello
Yes, 'm calling from Adelphia Cable
understand your service is out and an appointment was set up for Thursday
Yes
Well we have a technician working in your area who finished with an appointment earlier than expected
Will someone be there for the next hour
Sure
That'd be great
Our technician will see you then
Have a nice day
You too
Charlie hangs up
Let's check the camera
Stella, you're going patriotic today
Lyle puts an American flag pin on her work shirt
Then he hits keys on his laptop and an image pops up on his monitor via an  antenna: the  of the pin
He's got cable lines in the kitchen, living room, bedroom and a cable modem on the computer in the office
Try to get a 360 look at each room
And walk slowly or the image will streak
Lyle hands her some papers
printed these up to look like paperwork from Adelphia
When you're done, ask him to sign and date the bottom
Stella looks very tense
How you doing
Fine
'm fine
Charlie seems amused by that answer
You know what fine, stands for
Fucked- up, Insecure -- Stella joins in with him
& Neurotic and Emotional
They look at each other a moment
and smile
() - While the others deal with the cable, Handsome Rob and Half- Ear drive down Sunset
- Here's our spot
They pull up in front of a strip joint
Girls girls girls
Half-Ear pulls a switchblade out of his boot and puts it in the glove compartment
Handsome Rob gives him a questioning look
- Philly Steak said we'd be frisked
- Outside the doorway of a back room they're frisked by a He's very thorough, digging hard into their crotches
(scowls) 'got a great job
Pays the rent, asshole
You got a problem, talk to Skinny Pete
He opens the door to the -- Where we meet  , who is the   ' He takes up an entire couch in the rear of the room
His catcher's-mitt-sized hands motion them to come closer
Philly Steak sent you
His voice is raspy, it's like a climbing-ten-floors-effort just for this guy to get out the words
- That's right
So was  right-on about the gold bricks or what
- That's really not what 'm here to talk about
Philly Steak said you could get us some supplies
The fattest man you've ever seen attempts a nod, triple-chins colliding like a train wreck
What do you need
- four inch can of Nitramon
Nitramon primer
Detonating cord
Two triple charger chemical grenades
Launcher
Nine p
m
Should we hang here
Check out the dancers
Nothing's going down here
don't shit in my own yard, do you
No, but  take a whizz off the deck sometimes
With his distended belly and bursting shirt, his eyes glazing with repletion, Skinny Pete writes down an address
Five thousand dollars
And don't be late
: - Looking at a monitor, one of Steve's security guards sees the Adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate
He hits a button and the gate rises, beckoning it inside
() Stella heads up the driveway, apprehension painted on her features
Lyle is hidden in the back
She parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded by the four Rottweilers
They snarl and flash their teeth outside her door until a shrill  yanks their attention to -- ' where Steve has just stepped out the front door
The dogs immediately back off
Stella gets out of the truck as Steve walks over, smiling at her
She comes face to face with the man who killed her father
It's all right
They won't bother you now
She's not sure she's going to be able to speak or pull this off
It's okay
'm used to running into all sorts of dogs on my job
He holds out a hand
'm Steve
Becky
She shakes his hand
She hates this, feeling his skin touch hers, but she can't betray her feelings
He stands there a moment
You want to show me the problem
Yeah
Course
This way
'  - She enters, moving her body to give the pinhole camera a full sweep of the entryway
'd like to check the cable modem first
- Lyle watches Stella and Steve on his laptop via the pinhole camera and hears them talking through his headphones
- Steve leads Stella down the marbled hall
'll show you
They step into the -- She turns her body so the mini-lens can stare at the gleaming black Worthington 1000 safe
Then she goes up to his desk and pretends to work on the cable line that feeds into his computer
He stares at her as she bends down
The cable guy who hooked this up weighed about 300 pounds, didn't wear any underwear, and his pants slung a little too low if you know what  mean
She tries her best to ignore his flirtatious stare and his words
There we go
Now onto the TVs
- Lyle sees a perfect view of the main hallway as Stella walks down it
- He escorts her inside
She works on the cable connection to the plasma
Finishes
Is it fixed
Turn it on and see
- Back at the spot where Charlie disconnected the cable
Wearing a headset with a mic, he gets the word from Lyle -- (
) Now
Charlie reconnects the cable just as -- Steve turns on the  and the picture is -- Perfect
Then it looks like you're all set
Steve stares at her a moment
Have we met before
She's hoping to get out as quickly as she can
don't think so
Sign here, please
She hands him the paperwork and a pen
He signs it
Date
You read my mind
Oh, no
meant that  need you to put the date by your signature
It's the 26th
know what you meant
(he smiles) This might seem a little sudden, but
would you like to have dinner with me
don't think that'd be a very good idea
Why
Is there some kind of cable- rule against dating customers
No, it's my rule
don't accept dates from men 've just met
've only known you five minutes
Then  guess 'll have to sabotage my cable over and over again until you get to know me better
He's being charming, and she has to act like he is being charming, but she really wants to throw-up
Look, 'm just talking about dinner
Friday night
It's no big deal
If you don't like me, you never have to see me again
You know 'm not going to stop until you say yes
: () - Stella drives in heavy traffic down Sunset
Charlie and Lyle are in the back
know it was tough in there
He touched my hand
And he came-on to me
That slimy, disgusting man came onto me and  had to pretend that  liked it
Stella keeps her eyes forward, on the road, so Charlie and Lyle can't see her face
But Charlie catches her reflection in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her cheek
She wipes it away
You do know what this means
've created our window of opportunity
know
When Steve leaves Friday night, we go in
By the time he realizes you've stood him up, we'll be long gone with the gold
: - different world
different vibe
That feeling in the gut: you don't belong here
() Handsome Rob drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat
- Skinny Pete
The guy makes Jabba the Hut look like a spokesman for the Subway Sandwiches' diet
They pull over in front of the apartment building that Pete sent them to
- What do you think
'm trying not to
- Half-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the paper from the fat man
The door to the building buzzes in response and they go inside
- Climbing stairs
From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies, violent yelling
They start down a hallway
Ahead of them a door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway
The door closes
They don't even get a glance at whomever is inside
They go to the suitcase
Half-Ear clicks open the lock for just a peek
He sees the goods
Handsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the door frame
Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the other side of the door and disappears
- Half-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of the rental car
Handsome Rob closes the trunk
- Drive slow
We crash and we're a crater
They get into the car
Handsome Rob keys the ignition
The beam of his headlights illuminate step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's door window
That one taps a 9  against the glass
Half-Ear lowers the window
The homeboy pats one hand against the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches the weapon
What'd you put in the trunk
- Suitcase
The homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with
Just gimme the keys before  pop a cap in your head
Handsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it over to Half-Ear
who nervously drops it onto the carpeted floor
Hurry up
Half-Ear reaches down for the key
but in the flash of an eye
moving so fast it almost doesn't register
we see him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, and stab it down into the homeboy's hand
The knife goes through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior of the door
The homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns it
The other homeboys are already    at the car with semi-automatic handguns
Half-Ear hits the deck
Glass shatters
Bullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with streaks of light from the bullet holes
They barely miss the suitcase filled with explosives
() The homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife
His legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged
Bullets whiz by him
He cries out in agony until Half-Ear has the time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the pavement
The car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over
The -Haul is waiting for them
They get out of the rental car and open its trunk
Half-Ear sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase
An inch closer and they would've been a crater
- Christ
- - They get in with the suitcase
Charlie is behind the wheel, he's been waiting for them
He hits the gas
They take off, leaving the shot-up rental car behind
Looks like that went without a hitch
: '   - An edited loop of the exterior and interior of Steve's house plays on Lyle's laptop
The crew is huddled around
Lyle, what's the distance from the front door to the vault
Lyle doesn't answer
Lyle
Handsome Rob leans over to Charlie
He only answers to The Napster now
'm not calling you The Napster
You call him Half-Ear
- That wasn't my idea
And him, Handsome Rob
That's only cause he is Handsome Rob
And 'm The Napster
How far
(sighs, gives in) The Napster
Five hundred yards
So here's the riddle
How do we get over a ton of gold from the vault to the getaway car
How wide is the hallway
The video that Stella got of the hallway plays on the laptop
Lyle calculates: Only six feet
on Stella
: () - She's driving
Pure concentration
Then: Tires spinning over a marble floor
Then: The sideview mirrors scraping wallpaper
Then: The thin car is like a missile firing   ' , a hair-raising fit
: '   - Her idea brings a smile to her face
Jack Daniels, straight up
Minis
We could rumble right up the front steps, bring the getaway car right to the vault, and then straight to Union Station
Handsome Rob likes it
We'll need three to hold the gold
- Parked in the lot are shimmering Supercharged Mini Coopers, a new model that still captures the legendary Mini look and feel
Half-Ear climbs in one Mini
Lyle into another
- In the background, a large window overlooks the lot
Handsome Rob fills out the paperwork on the Mini he's renting while flirting with a petite
'd say you're a Maserati 250
Just 4 cylinders but can go 0 to 60 in 4
2
As long as it's a convertible -- always like to have my top down
At the same time, in the background, we see Lyle and Half- Ear's Mini pull out of their parking spaces and Just a little bumper hit
Do you know them
They get out of their cars and start yelling at each other
Never seen 'em before in my life
: '  &   - Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store
The steel door rises up and once again Yevhen unlocks another door
You're early
And 'm in a hurry, okay
'  &   - It doesn't seem to matter if Steve's in a hurry or not, Yevhen still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room
Of course the Florida vote rigging was a  and Mob operation
(with total disinterest) That a fact
You want facts
Fact:  officials were allowed free -- and illegal -- access to official election material
Steve puts his duffel bag down on the table
It
Once again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25 pounds
Now given the sordid history in Miami of joint ventures between Central Intelligence and the Mob, which led to the unsuccessful attempts to kill Fidel Castro and the successful assassination of your President John Kennedy, this conjunction raises numerous red flags
And 'd love to hear more about it, but like  said
Don't worry, we'll have you out in no time
The cash is on its way
Steve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right
On its way
My cousin is bringing it over
Your cousin
Yes
Cousin Mashkov
He's on his way
Don't worry, he will be here any minute
Steve looks up to the security camera
The tape's off
Of course
Believe me, he doesn't want to be on video, either
Yevhen
Didn't  tell you, many times, that  never wanted to meet with anyone but you
Yevhen sweats a bit
know
But it's his cash
He uses me to launder money
'm just a middleman
And a middleman is supposed to stay in the middle
But you were early
Please
Don't worry
It will be fine
My cousin's a cool guy
Like  am
What you are, is a Dixie cup
Yevhen smiles quizzically, not sure if he's being complimented or insulted
Dixie cup
Before the words are out of Yevhen's mouth, Steve grabs one of the 25 pound gold bricks and slaps it across Yevhen's face, shattering his jaw
Yevhen's falls to the floor and Steve lifts the brick again and rams it down onto his head with an ugly
And again
And again
He then takes the gold brick -- slathered in blood -- and places it back in his duffle bag
: '  &   - Yevhen's Ukrainian cousin, , stares down at the corpse
Steve is long gone
Mashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing
- Mashkov walks through a living room, past some lighting equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a look to realize that a porno is being shot here but he couldn't care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where -- His boss, , 60, the owner of this house, is eating a bowl of Frosted Flakes at the kitchen table
They speak in a colloquial Ukrainian tongue that we
My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death
By who
That's what 'm going to find out
They stop talking for a moment as one of the "" comes in, plops herself down next to Danya and pours herself a bowl of cereal
She puts her hand on Danya's leg
She's young and it's a disturbing image and we  : she's the  who Lyle passed in the taxi ride down Figueroa Street when he first arrived in
Danya goes back to speaking
And what will you do when you find this piece of shit who killed your cousin
'll hack off his limbs and bury him while he's still alive
Okay
But now we should stop talking Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl
(switching to accented ) How are you tonight, Karen
Hungry
Then eat your Frosted Flakes
(like Tony the Tiger) They're grrrreat
Danya laughs pleasantly
Such a perfect girl
But as she eats her cereal, we see a troubled, sad look on her face
- The three Minis are parked inside: one red, one white, one blue
Handsome Rob and Stella are doing custom work under the hoods
Lyle is wearing the strap-on laptop and typing away
Half-Ear squeezes silver Haliburton suitcases into the Minis' trunks as Charlie enters -- How are our matchbox cars
Souped
Don't let their size fool you
These were rally cars back in the day
135 mph, 155 horsepower -- Do  get to drive one
No
Why not
Because you can't navigate your way out of a parking lot
Here's your ride
He pulls a blanket off a Vespa
Lyle points at Half-Ear
But he ran into me
He's not driving either
(to Stella) You ever got a speeding ticket
Let's put it this way:  can only get insurance through companies that advertise on  at 3:00 in the morning
You drive

The laptop's screen lights up
Charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the mainframes used to be
Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing box out of his equipment bag
He places the box on a nearby shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels

: '  - He's getting dressed for his date
We can tell by the way he preens in front of the three sided full length mirror, adorning himself in the most expensive fashion, that he is a vain and arrogant man

The -Haul follows

He wears a headset and mic
Radio check

- From side streets, the Minis converge on the road and head up towards Steve's house
'  () - He can feel the adrenaline already starting to course through is body
This is it, guys
Moment of truth
He takes a sharp curve
and the moment that Steve's house should come into view
he hits the brakes, his expression turning to complete surprise
The neighbor across the street from Steve is having the biggest party in town
The road is filled with parked cars and arriving guests
Ain't no way they're blowing the gate, launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing Steve's house in the midst of this
' As he takes this in, there's a  on the window
He turns
Sees a uniformed
Rolls down the window
Are you hear for the Baxter party, sir
- We see the three Minis pull tight -turns and head back the way they came
'  () - He slaps his hand against the steering wheel, fuming
Shit
Stella
'  () - She already knows what he's going to say
know
've got a date tonight
You'll have to fake it
Laugh at his jokes
You need him to ask you out again
: - posh restaurant
As    Stella and Steve, she is laughing at something he said, faking her way through the date
They're sitting at an intimate table
You really make laugh
He takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think it is
So here's what  have lined up for after dinner
We'll go to Club Deep
The Ferrari always gets me to the front of the line
We'll do a little dancing
Not tonight
don't want to be out late
Why the curfew
Let's just say 've made some wrong calls in the past
like to take things slow, cautious
Next time
understand
You have nothing to worry about
You can trust me
trust everyone
It's the devil inside them that  don't trust
That saying strikes Steve
That's an interesting saying
What
He looks at her closely, really closely
There's only person 've ever heard say that
Used to say it all the time
This worries her
Because of course, she used to hear it from her father
Who was that
Under the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like a vise
man named John Bridger
Where did you pick up that phrase
Ow
don't remember
You're hurting me
John Bridger was a thief
And he had a daughter
About your age
He told me that she took over a safe and lock company that he used as a front
Let go of my wrist
What is wrong with you
It's just a saying
Steve's voice is calm, so at ease that watching them you'd think this was pleasant dinner conversation
No wonder  liked you right away
Just like  liked your old man, right up until the moment  shot him in the head
Now tell me who you're working with and tell me the plan
Do it now or we'll go for a ride and 'll break every bone in your body
Stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine
It shatters on the floor
An emergency signal
Charlie, Half-Ear, Handsome Rob and Lyle appear around the table
Steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years ago standing before him, very much alive
They pull up chairs from another table, encircling him for a tense and pointed talk
Something wrong, Steve
You look like you want to call Ghostbusters
Half-Ear furtively slides the switchblade out of his boot
- She's coming with us
You got a problem with that
Fine by me
But it's you that has the problem
How do you figure
You've just blown the one thing you had going in your favor, the element of surprise
And  was surprised
(he laughs unpleasantly) Jesus Christ when  saw all you guys come out of the woodwork
For a minute thought maybe you were ghosts
But you're screwed now
(an arrogant sneer a Half-Ear) Did you figure out how to take care of my security guard
'll hire five more
(at Lyle) You know how to bypass my alarm system
'll have a new one installed tomorrow
(at Handsome Rob) Does it tear you up inside seeing what car  drive
'll buy a matching one in red
(at Stella) You think you can crack my safe
You'll end up the same way as your dad
(then to Charlie, all smiles) Looks like Good Time Charlie's got the blues
You can wear that shit-eating grin on your face, but  know under that Versace shirt you're in a cold sweat
And you're not going to sleep a minute tonight
Cause you thought you'd gotten away with it free and clear
You thought you'd gotten rid of us
You're the one who's screwed
Right to the wall
Give it your best shot
'll outsmart you every step of the way
And this time, 'll bury you myself
(taking the challenge) Get more guards
Change the alarm
Buy a dozen Ferraris
We'll still be here
Sleep tight
Charlie grabs a bread stick off the table and goes
The others follow
: -   - The door bursts open as the burly man we met earlier is dragged inside at gunpoint
Five Ukrainians armed with - 11 machine pistols storm the room where Skinny Pete works
Mashkov walks behind the posse
He carries a duffel bag
He takes in the sight of the fattest man he's ever seen
(in accented English) Do you know who  am
You work for Danya
Yes
And you are gonna be straight with me and everything's gonna be okay
You fuck with me,  will be ruthless
understand
don't want you to understand want you to overstand
Overstand
Okay
Because if you don't overstand, will use this
Mashkov nonchalantly opens the duffel bag and pulls out a short-handled ax
Skinny Pete sees dried blood on the blade
Someone was asking about gold bars with a Balinese girl's face on them
want the name of this man
: '    - The sun shines over the ocean and the hotel
' The crew is gathered
Lyle, monitoring digital surveillance on his laptop, takes off his headphones
Well we scared him alright
He's flying the coop
His security guard called Brink's Armored Car Service to confirm a 5 p
m
pick up at his house, then JetClub to confirm a MD11 cargo plane departing from the Imperial Terminal at  at 8 p
m
Confirmed
How'd we miss the first calls
They must have been cellular
The cargo plane is being chartered to Mexico City
Only place with worse smog and traffic than
Once the charter's in the air, he could change the flight path to anywhere
And good-bye gold
Not so fast
This is good news for us
Good news
Sometimes when you're up to your ass in alligators you forget that you started off trying to drain the swamp
Meaning what the fuck
We've been trying to get to the gold in the safe
Now the safe is coming to us
We'll boost it in transit
He might as well have said they'll steal the Holy Grail before sunrise
Charlie
He could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one
We can't take out an armored truck during rush hour
We're already set to do it
Napster: how would you like to create the biggest traffic jam in the history of Los Angeles
Keep talking
You gridlock every route except the one we choose
Force the truck to go exactly where we want it to go
But where do we want it
We can't shoot it out with armed guards in a Brink's
We'd lose
And even if we pulled it off, the cops would be all over us, chasing us all the way to Union Station
We're outmanned and outgunned
But not outsmarted
Charlie hums with focused energy
There's a term for it in horse racing
When a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and twitching with eagerness to run, he is "on the muscle
" That describes Charlie right now
We'll do it like the Italian job
We'll make thirty million in gold drop out of sight
They're interrupted by Charlie's cell phone
This throws them all off
Who else has this number
- No one but us
It's still
Charlie decides to answer it
Hello
-  - Meet
Or at least meet the back of his neck
Because that's where he has a tatoo that says
Why'd you do it
(informing the crew) Philly Steak
(then into phone) Do what
to Philly Steak's face which is weathered and as leathery as a football
An old school crook
Yevhen
The Ukrainian gold, dealer
You didn't, have to clip him, for Christ's sakes
Clip him
Listen to me
You've gotta get out of
Now
What're you talking about
We didn't clip anybody
Well Skinny Pete just called me
Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did
Why does he think that
Because you wanted, to know about the gold with the Balinese Girl
Plus  guess Pete was under duress
This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul Fucking Bunyan
Do you know how to get in touch with him
Yeah but
Maybe there's a way we can play this to our advantage
Are you out of your mind
Listen to me, Charlie
Get out of
Now
Cause if there's one thing  know, it's that you never mess with Mother Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother- fucking Ukrainians
- Speaking of -- Five Ukrainians lock 'n load their -11 machine pistols plus an M4 carbine with a 40mm grenade launcher mounted beneath the barrel
Mashkov enters the room and tells the others in
He's going to be on Train 59 for New Orleans

Karen, wearing a backpack stuffed with her only belongings, creeps into the kitchen with two 3/4" videotapes in hand
She sets them down on the counter
They say   on the labels
She opens the microwave oven
Puts the tapes inside
Sets the timer for 60 minutes at the highest level and presses the start button
As the videotapes start to cook, we watch Karen flee out the door
: - The -Haul is parked on the side of the noisy, congested boulevard
large metal sheet is now mounted on the side of the panel truck
Parked behind the -Haul are two of the Minis and Lyle's Vespa
We see traffic flowing through the busy intersection next to the vehicles
Then   , really fast, right into the black pavement and -- and out the other side, so we are now underground in the middle of the -- where Half-Ear is at work, mounting Nitramon primer to the tunnel walls, Charlie assisting
They both wear orange jumpsuits, plus headsets and mics

Same as mine
Still hope for that Nobel Prize

But  did get my college diploma

How'd you manage that, all the jobs we've been pulling

The  grows unbearable as a Metro roars closer, headlights gobbling up the dark tunnel
They press themselves into a crevice in the wall
With a  and a gust of wind, the Metro howls by
It makes their jaws clatter
- () - Stella's in the cargo area with Lyle who's working his laptop
It's monitor displays a string of computer code
He over his headset: (
) Napster
How goes it up there
Over
Working on the Metro Rail system
Almost ready
- Handsome Rob's Mini is parked on the side of the winding road
Using binoculars, he looks down onto Oporto Drive at Steve's house
Into his headset: Everything's quiet here
Over
- The Nitramon is applied
Half-Ear closes his eyes
Charlie observes him a moment
You okay
- Ah huh
Just need a moment's meditation
Now
- 'm about to insert a wire into a detonator tube and if the wire touches the sides of tube, we'll be blown to Kingdom Come
Best to be at one with yourself
Take all the time you need
Another moment, then Half-Ear sets to work
Charlie holds a mini-flashlight, illuminating the intricate detonator
Very carefully, he inserts a wire into a tube
Remember, the wire must not touch the sides
The wire is half-way in when a   drops onto his hand
Frozen, he ponders this
Charlie sees the spider, doesn't know what to do
Half-Ear studies the spider
then he closes his eyes just a moment
relaxes
breathes in, breathes out
and then -- He leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over the spider, comes back up
Finishes inserting the wire
Job done, he calmly opens his mouth
The spider puts a hairy leg out and delicately explores his cheek
Half-Ear plucks it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall
Charlie just shakes his head in disbelief
- My work here is done
- Brink's truck climbs the road towards Steve's house, flanked by two  K1200LTA motorcycles
- Through binoculars, Handsome Rob is still keeping an eye on Steve's house from the higher vantage point
The front gate rises
The Brink's truck and motorcycles are let inside and head up the driveway
But then he sees a   truck drive up, also guarded by two motorcycles
And a third Brink's followed by motorcycles turns into the driveway
' It's a convoy of matching armored trucks
- Witnessing the twist of events through his binoculars
He speaks into his headset mic -- Problemo

Lyle's manning the laptop
What is it
He's brought in three identical armored trucks
Shit
Decoys
It's like a shell game on wheels

The Ferrari follows behind
- Handsome Rob sees the vehicles head east on Oporto
He reports into his mike: Three Brink's trucks are leaving with motorcycle escorts, plus Steve in his Ferrari
- Maddening frustration
How're we going to figure out which truck has the gold
Charlie is just as frustrated
but in a tight spot he always comes up with an idea
You can monitor the traffic video cameras from your laptop, right
Yeah
Where's the first camera the trucks will go past
Lyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga where vehicles are driving under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera is mounted to
Cahuenga Boulevard
They all have to cross that
The weight of the gold will lower the suspension on the truck
- The first armored truck makes its way through the green light
- Lyle hits the keyboard and lines of measurements appear across the image of the Brink's truck
He strikes another key, momentarily  the image
He makes a visual check of the top of the armored truck against the Cahuenga Boulevard street sign
Lines up with the top of the sign
Next
He unfreezes the first image just in time to check out the next armored truck in line
The top of this truck also lines up perfectly with the top of the street sign
First two are the same

Shutting down the rail as we speak

The three Minis jump the curb and drive right over the star- lined sidewalk
Pedestrians throw themselves out of their path
The cars run over Marilyn Monroe's star and the flowers and candles left by fans
They make a sharp turn down the cement stairs that lead to the Metro Rail platform
At the same time -- The creeping gold truck is just about alongside the parked - Haul
- Through his sideview mirror, Lyle eyes the progress of the gold truck
He gives the word: Coming into position

Hearing the news over the radio
(
) There's been some kind of an explosion and a Brink's truck has just dropped down into the Metro Rail Blue Line
Steve slams the car into gear and jumps the sidewalk, passing the gridlock
He hollers into a walkie-talkie -- The truck's in the Metro Rail
Where does the Blue Line go back above ground
- The motorcycle guards who were escorting the decoy trucks hear Steve over their walkie-talkies
With squeals of rubber, they turn around as one of the guards answers -- It comes out at Flower & Pico
At the same time -- - Stella works the dial, feeling for contact points
And -- &  - The two motorcycle guards fervently try to lift off the steel sheet that dropped down from the -Haul
- They see daylight start to stream in from above as the steel sheet slides a little
Stella
Shhh
We  Stella's heart pounding in her ears
See the perspiration on her fingertips
You know when you said this wouldn't be the same as opening a safe for the cops
Yeah
Did you have to be right
&  - The motorcycle guards strain, managing to shift the steel sheet enough so they can see the armored truck below
- on Stella's eyes, pure concentration on each number on the dial
Finally:
She grabs the safe's lever and swings the sturdy steel door open
She instinctively looks away
Don't you want to see what's inside
never look
Trust me
You wanna look
So she does
Inside is a mountain of gold bricks

The Minis thunder into the daylight, past the above ground platform, just as two motorcycles come flying around the corner after them

Fingers go flat against the -47s triggers

It lands and the driver  it forward -- / ' He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards the third tower some twenty feet away
Lands
Keeps going to the last elevator, skids to a stop
He reaches out, punches the call button
Then looks over his shoulder to witness -- going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop jump
But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter
It soars but with a slight downward trajectory
Towards a large window on the top floor
Then lower
And the look on the driver's face says it all as
The front wheel of the motorcycle  into the side of the building, just below the window
The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies through the window as -- hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the chopper and -- The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass shards
/ Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit
The pilot keeps it under control but it's time to go
With a , the injured chopper banks away
- The elevator door opens
Charlie's Mini shoots out then skids out the lobby's exit
He made it
: '  () - She checks the rearview mirror
No sign of the Ferrari
Just a Jeep Wrangler back there
Stella looks relieved
Feels like she's home free
: - Stella's Mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier at the end of Amtrak Train 59, bound for New Orleans
She can see the other two Minis are already inside
She gets out and hands the cargo loader a ticket
- The "All Aboard" announcement goes out over the  system
Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly picking up speed
- The outside streaks by through the window
It's a happy crew
Champagne is poured
Charlie holds up his glass and gets their attention
want to make a toast
Cause there's somebody missing here today, and we all know who it is
They all raise their glasses
To John Bridger
The most brilliant master planner of them all
We wish he was with us
We   their faces
It's been a three year odyssey for them
They got the gold, but they lost someone they loved
To John
Clink
- past the three Minis parked inside
And  at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler
Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out
Looks around
It's safe
He walks over to Stella's Mini
Pops open the trunk a silver Haliburton suitcase
He unzips the case
It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic face of a Balinese girl on each one
Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it
He knows his gold
These bricks are real
But as he has a moment with his gold,  , the trunks of the other two Minis  in unison
Then Mashkov  out of the trunk of the white Mini
Another Ukrainian  out of the trunk of the blue Mini
Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis
They cock their -lls
Steve hears the sound from behind him
He turns around to see the weapons pointed at him
Take out your gun and drop it on the floor
Steve has no choice
Who are you
You knew my cousin
Yevhen
never knew anyone named Yevhen
Get in the trunk
Not that trunk, this one
That gold is for us gift from some old friends of yours
They said to tell you that they didn't mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, as long as you didn't get any
Not even the toy surprise
The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini
And for the first time, he's scared
Looking up at Mashkov, he begs
Please
Don't shoot me
Please
Don't worry
That wasn't the deal
'm not going to shoot you
Thank you
Thank God
(to the others) He really thought  was going to shoot him
The Ukrainians laugh
Steve tries to laugh
No
No
'm not going to shoot you
'm going to hack off your limbs and bury you while you're still alive
And with that, he closes the trunk
Like the lid of a coffin
And for Steve, the world falls into
- Underneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold
We to our five thieves
New IDs
Handsome Rob passes out new fake driver's licenses for when they arrive in New Orleans
(re: his fake license) Simon Quackenbush
Could  -- just once -- have a cool name
- (also complaining) 250_pounds
They're interrupted by the  of Charlie's phone
He answers
Did you get what you wanted
- Mashkov is on the other end of the line
'm happy
During this, Lyle types commands into his laptop that is connected to a phone jack in the car
It was good doing business with you
Lyle hits a final command and -- - signal box receives the command and -- - The coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train is electronically disengaged
This causes the train to separate from the car carrier
The train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour
The car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of nowhere
: - The Dining Car features crisp white linens and extended windows for scenic dining
Lyle walks over to a table where Karen is waiting for him
She looks resplendent
Is this seat taken
It is now
He sits
And as     Lyle, ready to embark on a new life, we -- : It fills
And beneath a photograph of Lyle himself, we read the headline: How The Laptop Fugitive Pulled It Off : - And as    Half-Ear, checking out the books in the library, feeling like the wealthy man he is, we -- : ' And beneath a graduation photo of Half-Ear in his cap and gown, we read the headline: "    '  " Professor Relives Memories of Erudite Fugitive : - And as    Handsome Rob, who's already caught the eye of a woman at the bar, we -- : And beneath a photo of Becky the cable chick, we read the headline: "        '
" Feds Say Technician Admits to Encounter With 'Handsome' Thief : - Charlie and Stella drink from glasses of champagne
We did it
We sure did
There's something 've been meaning to ask you, Stella
But 've just been so busy lately, what with the explosion, car chase, Ukrainians and all
It has been a hectic day
It's about that thing you said to me back in Philadelphia
That thing
You said that you can't have a relationship with a pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind of thief
Oh
That thing
Do you still believe that
Yeah
do
Well  was wondering
What about a retired pickpocket, gold robber, thief
Now that's an entirely different question
And as an enigmatic smile settles across her face, we -- : And beneath a photo of sunbathers on a glorious beach, we read the headline: And        the magazine cover
on the line of sunbathers
their faces -- and you'd never notice unless you were really, really, looking for them
is it them
on the pixels
and yes, it sure is
Charlie & Stella in lounge chairs, living the good life
