The figure gets larger as he approaches
But as yet we cannot tell who he is or where we are
(over) This is the most famous true story of Africa
It happened a hundred years ago, but even now, when children ask about it, you do not tell them at night
(The  continues to grow) It began with the race to build a railroad across Africa
(beat) But this is not about building a railroad- it is about Patterson
And now we can tell that the  is a  , This is
He is gifted and bright and serious, serious about his life, serious about his career
He has been successful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his talents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody
:
More specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant building - lovely woodwork all around
Everything is neat, everything is clean and in order
(over) Patterson was thirty
brilliant engineer
fine man, but do not become attached to him- there are many fine men in this story but do not become attached to any of them
(beat) So many of them die
Patterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks
Waits
(over) And remember this: only the impossible parts of what follows really happened
(Now the door opens and we-) Just a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway
This is - 40, with an irresistable smile
We're in his office and the place reflects the man - clean, cold
There are maps and charts on the walls
He ushers Patterson inside
(The great smile flashes) John Henry Patterson, come in
'm Robert Beaumont
(They shake hands) Firm-  like that, tells me a lot about you- (beat) -now why don't you tell me about me
To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile
'm sure you agree
(Surprised, uncomfortable, Patterson nods) Winning personality, heaps of charm
My wife is the game player in the family, sir
Games
(staring dead at Patterson) Look at me closely, Patterson:  am a monster
My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself
(again the smile - only now it's chilling) One mistake and  promise you this: 'll make you hate me
, as he realizes Beaumont is serious
Beaumont turns sharply and moves to a large map
It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear line that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles
(pointing along the line) We are building this railroad across Africa for the glorious purpose of saving Africa from the Africans
And, of course, to end slavery
The Germans and French are our competition
We are ahead, and we will stay ahead providing you do what  hired you to do- This one ends at "Tsavo," 130 miles in
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river
And be finished in four months time
Can you do that
'm sure you've examined my record
So you know 've never yet been late on a bridge
You've never built in Africa
But  have in India- every country presents problems
You'll need your confidence, promise you
've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and promised 'd be with her when the baby comes
Very moving, Patterson; 'm touched you confided in me
(beat) But  don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter
've made you with this assignment- (the smile) -don't make me break you
(smiling right back) You won't have the chance
(glancing at his watch) Any further words of encouragement
(silence) Then 've a train to catch
They look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear they do not like each other
Patterson turns, leaves and we , train is loading up
lot of activity, a lot of noise
Patterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around
, hurrying through the crowd
Early 20s, with the kind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons
She is still slim, has not begun to show
She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into his arms
tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone
(They are nutty about each other - he nods) We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena
(brightly) Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments
They start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a quieter place
Patterson is suddenly very serious- Oh dear- (beat) -you're geting that downtrodden look again- -well, it's just
(beat) other men don't abandon their wives at such a time- (not unkindly) -oh please- if 'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me
You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life
What if there are complications
- -not "what if"- there will be, there always are
Which only means that our "son" and - note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit
sounds
Go, now
(He kisses her hand) Such a gentleman
(Now he holds her) am desperate to see Africa- but hate the leaving
She hates it, too
You build bridges, John- (beat) -you've got to go where the rivers are
They hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into each other's arms a final time, then- , and thick clouds of steam- -Patterson runs into the clouds and disappears
Patterson runs out of the steam and we ,   ,
This is the train to  and Patterson is alone on the engine seat- a wooden bench in front of the engine used by railroad inspectors and visiting VIPs
Behind it is a white circular piece of wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers
, running as best as he can alongside the train, trying to pull himself up onto the engine seat
is a terribly appealing young man
Clothes do not fit him well, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that shirttail, trying to get things right
He wears glasses, tends nonetheless to squint at the world
He is, above all, a good man, morally impeccable and very much a product of these Victorian times
(as Patterson helps him aboard) Many thanks
(squints) You're Patterson, yes
(Patterson nods) Nigel Starling- 'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that
He just gave me his "monster" speech
That
know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse
(beat) And 'm one of his defenders
(Patterson smiles) Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo-  think you'll find it breathtaking
(And on that word-) coughing like crazy, hands over his face which is caked with dust- he and Patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary desert
(shouting toward Starling) "Breathtaking" doesn't begin to do it justice
(As Starling starts to laugh, his mouth opens and sand flies in, and his coughing fit returns and) , bent over, arms covering their faces as the dust gets worse- a wind has kicked up
,
Patterson and Starling are walking beside the train now, helping to push it, trudging through the dust
All the other passengers spread out behind them, also pushing- the train obviously needs all the assistance it can get
,
Patterson and Starling, filthy, sit together
Starling has nodded off
Patterson has a book open in his lap- -we can tell there are drawings of African animals- not all that accurate
Now Patterson's eyes close and he sleeps
Stokers shovel coal
They are exhausted but they keep at it
,
'
He stares out- -and from his face it's clear something special has happened
And now, at last- - and what it is, of course, is Patterson's first view of the Africa of his imagination
Because the desert has ended, and now there are grasses and trees and one more thing- -bursts of animals
On both sides of the train
flock of birds materializes here, a cluster of gazelles doing there amazing leap there
Patterson is like a kid in a candy store
, back outside in the engine seat again
Starling points- Aren't they amazing
'  : Some giraffes running along, their absurd shape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly long strides
, staring out
You know the most amazing thing about them
- they only sleep five minutes a day
(Starling glances at him- clearly, he didn't know that) Close by, loping in their scary way
Don't much like them
(nods) The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young
studying Patterson
Clearly, he didn't know that, either
moving along
Starling turns to Patterson
Anything special about them
Just that they fart through their mouths
(beat) Must make kissing something of a gamble
(laughs) 've lived in Africa a year and don't know what you know
How long have you been here
(looks at his watch) Almost three hours
(beat) But 've been getting ready all my life
(Now, from them-) -
They hold children who wave at the passing train
The children are more impoverished looking than their mothers
(suddenly touched) Every time  see something like that, know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls
Beaumont says it's to end slavery
(shrugs) We all have our reasons
Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes- (interrupts himself) -best  stop
One of the by-products of my belief is that  can become amazingly boring
But  know God smiles on me
(They really like each other) Have you got that in writing
(Starling, amazingly good natured, laughs
And now-) Hundreds of white claws
They aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and they're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree
And there are dozens of those trees, packed together
All mixed in with other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked red rocks- -now the train begins to slow
Smoke drifts across
bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks
(over) Welcome to Tsavo
(on the word) We have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a place that is still being built
There are tin shacks; a water tower is under construction- -men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for work
goes slower still
No one stands idly around here
But no one looks happy either
is apart from the rest: this is
An ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light the world
as they step off the train
(indicating Samuel, who is approaching) Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts
(softly) Does he speak English
(not softly enough) And very poor French
(introducing) Samuel- John Patterson
(as they shake) The bridgebuilder- (gesturing to the working men) -we have been getting ready for you
Excellent
Could  see the bridge site
(Samuel nods) 've got medical supplies to deliver
Come along to the hospital when you're done
(starting off) will bring him, Nigel
We should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at the very beginning of the picture
, starting to walk
They pass the water tower
Standing on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely powerful
He waves to Samuel who waves back
This is
study Patterson as he moves by
Not smiling
Up ahead, some  are erecting tents
Not smiling
Why do the workers look unhappy
Because they are here
(beat) Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world
(He points ahead) Come, John- to the bridge
(And on that-) as the camera pans along
in the distance as they walk toward it
And here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot where the movie takes place was like
There were five hundred men working for Patterson
And they lived in a spread out area
bunch of Indian coolies who might have come from the same town back in their country might choose to live in one cluster of tents
group of natives might be in another cluster
What we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are dozens of clusters of tents
(Eventually, as the terror began, these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence
) The places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where the bridge is to be built, etc
, etc
As they move, Samuel points out various camps
is getting ready for prayer
is eating
are cleaning their tent area
Anyway, you get the idea
Just remember that the place covered a wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more
Okay, back to the story
(as they pass the tent area where prayer is starting) It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job
Thank you
The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly
The workers don't get on
Get on
They detest each other
Obviously the Africans hate the Indians
But the Indians also hate the other Indians
Some of them worship cows, while others eat them
(As they move on) And suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we standing high above the Tsavo River
The track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where it just stops- -and picks up on the far side
All that's missing, in other words, is the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of track
(to the far side) Railhead is across there
Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great clouds of dust
Three thousand men laying track- when the bridge is done, it all joins up
Patterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at the space where the bridge is to be
Did it look like this in your mind
(shakes his head) This is more difficult- Excited
(eyes bright) -but how wonderful that it's difficult, it should be difficult- what better job in all the world than build a bridge
- make things connect- bring worlds together- and get it right
(Now from Patterson-) as Patterson and Samuel walk in
Patterson glances around- -it's not bad at all
Of course there are some patients, injured or with fever
But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, everything is working well, everything is under control
Starling approaches
Finish your tour
(nods) And anxious to get started
(indicating the hospital) What is this, mostly malaria
Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain
'  (over) That's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the poor bastards will relapse if you keep on that way
(As they turn-) tough, middle-aged cockney
And a heavy drinker
man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years
(to Patterson) 'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital
And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it
" (beat) That was meant to be charming, sorry
seem to have lost the knack
You never had it
Nigel and  don't like each other much
(breaking the tension) am also liaison between these two
(to Hawthorne) Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad
This sham
Ridiculous
Who needs it
It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer
Then why do you stay
Who else would hire me
(to Starling) Beat you to it, didn't
(beat) Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift
(Now he gestures and we-) who approaches them
He has been freshly bandaged across one shoulder
This is Karim, one of my orderlies- attacked by a man-eater earlier today- first incident of that kind here
Patterson says not a word, just studies the wounded man
(incredulous) man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it
Well, he got away, didn't he
(to Patterson) Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off
Listening
No emotion on his face
He's kind of enjoying this
Bearing down
know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- (beat) -but what are you going to do about it
(a long pause, then evenly-) Karim will have to show me where it happened
And of course, 'll need the donkey
(beat) With any luck, 'll sort it out tonight
(And he walks out, leaving an astonished Starling staring after him) ' Starling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne
And there are half a dozen
Right now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent
Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches
couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out
" As if it were the most normal thing in the world
"Ho-hum, what lovely tea,  think 'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway
" Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he
But that's all right- after all, 'm responsible for everything that happens here
And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl
He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him
There is a photo of Helena on a small table
photo of an , clearly his parents
His clothes are stacked with precision
He arranges his books precisely too
Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order
(calling out) You said "of course" you'd need the donkey
Why "of course"
(taking a rifle, moving outside) We know three things about man-eaters
First, they always return to where they've attacked before
Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us
And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up
, sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited
But also a bit reluctant
don't suppose  could watch
(delighted) Might be exciting for you
've never been all that adventurous
wouldn't be in the way
'd love the company
And 've hunted all my life
(gathering courage) Well, why not
You seem so calm and experienced
(standing, teacup in hand) Why not, indeed
(Now from that-) It's roped loosely to a tree, bells around its neck
When it moves, they make a sound
Middle of the night
night wind
We're in a clearing with thick trees all around
, seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge of the clearing, twelve feet up in the air
Patterson has his rifle ready
This next is all whispered
(embarrassed) hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse
(Pulls up his trousers- his leg is knotted) The pain is actually quite unbearable now
Shhh
'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but- (interrupting) -you'll have to deal with it, Nigel
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent
(And he begins to climb down) , grabbing him
They own the night- nobody moves when there's a man-eater out there
Starling glumly obeys
Then- John
know this isn't the time to ask, but- What
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- 've never even seen one
, not pleased with this news
He massages his calf, tries to get comfortable, which is impossible
Patterson just stares at the night
The donkey dozes
So does Starling
Patterson has not so much as moved
Now the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little
And the donkey is suddenly awake and scared- -and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound - -and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked but unhurt- -he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it
(amazed) one shot
(even more amazed) So that's what a lion looks like
(Now from the tree-) - for a moment
(over) One shot- one- Now Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited- -it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile
Patterson has made the nights safe again
As he walks on, behind him come   carrying the body of the lion
As dozens of men come running in from all over to see the dead man-eater- (mimes shooting) (Now as the crowd continues to grow-) ' It has two embankments on either side of the river
These embankments are big- forty feet wide, fifty feet high
standing on the high ground where the embankment will start
From here, there is a slope down to the river itself
Also present is  , who we saw earlier standing precariously atop the water tower
Singh, enormously powerful, is another assistant
Bright, a great worker, another main character in what is to follow
Now Patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river- it's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother him
He talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who move down with him
Singh, for all his massive size, moves like a cat
Starling does not, slipping and sliding
(gesturing) All right, 'd like to start the embankments today- (to Singh) -sufficient supplies on hand
(nods) More than
With much more on the way- (loses balance, falls) -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground- -true enough- but without the comedy relief
(Starling, amazingly good natured, smiles, gets back up) as they scramble down to it
they've come down- it's a long way back to the top
It's a glorious morning
How lucky we are
Aren't we full of ourselves today
(beat) think it's because of the lion
Possibly
(soft) You know,  too have killed a lion
How many shots did you need
Almost embarrassed
used my hands
He holds his big hands up, palms out
Starling looks at Singh to see if he means it- -he means it all right
Now, from Starling's perpetually surprised face- sighting through it- we are on the far side of the river now
Singh is there, Starling, too
Behind them: a field of tall grass
All right- thee second embankment will go there
(He gestures toward the river) You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just- (imitating Patterson) -"there
" (smiling) In your honor, Nigel
And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks
(very dubious) John, it will not be easy
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- (And he smiles, repeating Singh's gesture, both palms out) He smiles back, starts to reply
But his words stop, his smile dies
He just stares and we- '  - the surrounding field of tall grass
Nothing unusual about it
He stares, too
- suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a fresh wind
Silent
As before
Starling follows his glance
Frozen
And now the field is making odd patterns- as if something unseen were moving through
Quiet
Just the wind
Nothing visible
But the odd pattern seems to be making its way across the field
Quiet
Just the wind
The odd pattern seems to stop
Around it, the wind makes different shapes of the grass
, as the wind continues to blow
He continues to stare at the spot where the pattern stopped
As before
Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to shiver, as if from cold
And what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity
Huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments
And Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there
And alongside him is his assistant, , a little man with glasses and very bright eyes
Meanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that is on the far side of the river
And he does his best, tries to help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the clumsy side and balance is a problem for him
But he stays with it, does well
And Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the placements of the three stone foundation pillars- -he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor- -so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes- -which is all he wears from now on
And the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, working with the power of three- -and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded- -it's hard, brutal work- -but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three foundation pillars are taking shape- - being shoved into the wooden skeleton to complete the embankments
As this goes on- in the river- the foundation pillar work is going very quickly
Patterson stops working, looks across the river- -movement in the grassy area on the far side
as they rise out of the grass, gesture to Samuel who gestures back
The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points
watching them
What are they looking at
You- they cannot believe you're still here
Nonsense
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you
(Patterson doesn't) It means "slaughter"
, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads
, as more and more red rock is shoved and pushed into shape
- almost finished
The same
as still more rock is forced in and done at last- -and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other
And they all look at each other- the embankments are both finished-     are flying- -and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, in Singh's gesture
It's kind of become their password
big moment for them all
' He sits around a fire and the man is exhausted
His dinner plate is beside him, untouched
He's too tired to eat
' Starling is there, getting ready for bed
He's wiped out, too
, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep
is in his tent, turning out his lamp, half asleep already
in his tent, closing his eyes
, deep asleep in his tent- -he shares it with a dozen others and they're all deep asleep
They lie on the floor of the tent, heads together toward the center pole, feet toward the edges of the tent
It's very dark
just lie motionless, breathing deeply
Now the  moves up, high into the center of the tent, looking down at the circle of men
They don't move, not even an inch
The steady breathing is the only sound
,
Nothing is going on down there
Nothing at all
Not a goddamn thing
And now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide- -and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by some giant invisible wire- Screaming
, waking, staring around and as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams grow even louder as we and it's like a bomb just went off, they rise, spin, cry out, stare- '  sliding along the ground
It's pitch black, and he's going head first now, face upwards and he's going ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is that's making this happen is something we can't make out- because it's so dark and because it's on the far side of the man, and his body is in our way and , some bushes and , his body going faster than before and his cries are weakening- - and his body and there is no sound at all coming from him now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making this happen- all we see, barely, is the limp body of the big man as it skims along and- , a low clump of bushes
' , coming closer and and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn bushes and now- , suddenly rising magically in the night, his body flying over the bushes and gone
, early morning, their rifles held in front of them, racing along, suddenly stopping, staring down and At first we can't make out much
Then we can- a spot of red
, hurrying on again
, and as they force their way through them- , wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth- -- -as it lands we can see     are already there, surrounding something- -but we can't make it out
We are in an area of grass and shadow- -and specks of blood
, cries out in shock and fury, fires his rifle, races forward
screeching and screaming, taking off, and as we watch them soar into the morning sky- '  (over) What the lion must have done, once he'd killed Singh, was lick his skin off so he could drink his blood- Hawthorne is examining Singh's body, trying to be professional, but he's clearly upset- it's awful
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet- (evenb more upset) -please- you needn't be so graphic- You intend "sorting this out" tonight
'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion  killed could never carry off a man Singh's size
(maybe a little alarmed) But you said they were always old
That's what the books say
(Now from that-) - in tears
Where are we
This is Singh's funeral pyre
Singh's body is being burned
are there
We've caught sight of some of them before- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him in his tent
There is a terrible sense of shock
Patterson stands at the rear
He is terribly moved
Now, unseen by the others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final time
; they continue to rise
' Night
The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut and tied
, the middle of the night
He is alone, fifteen feet up in a tree near Singh's tent
He holds his rifle, ready for anything
He cannot get comfortable
- nothing, no movement
'
As before
No sign of movement of any kind
Dead
Lower in the sky
The night is growing to a lose but there is still darkness
Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his eyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do- That's all we see, just the eyes and they are near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and- , startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down and- - only they're gone
, blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky
, ,
, wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back toward his tent area
Now he stops
and a large group of workers- only they're not working
They smoke, play cards, sit around
, steaming, going up to Abdullah
You were contracted to work- (gesturing around) -malaria epidemic; very sudden
Let me see the sick
(not backing off) Oh, you're a doctor now, too
There is no reason for fear
On that  choose to remain dubious
(beat) Two are dead now in two nights
(And on that news-) Rocked
He didn't know
Behind him now, Starling hurries up, Samuel alongside
(to Starling) Second death
Where
- (gesturing) -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night
Hawthorne's examining the body now
(beat) There's even less of him than of Singh
(just shakes his head) But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon
(getting control- he looks to Samuel) Samuel
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area
Fires burning at night
Fine
Get started
And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night
(to Abdullah) Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two
(Abdullah nods) And 'm sorry for my tone earlier
But repeat- there is no reason for fear
will kill the lion and  will build the bridge
Of course you will, you are white, you can do anything
(They look at each other
They are not friends
Now-) There is a machete-like sound as we , led by Samuel, chopping down branches
They do it with care- these are claws- -, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, he's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his machete, moving in between bushes and ,   into Starling, and Starling taking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing- -his arms are starting to bleed- -he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at them, cutting them down
He is a good man doing a good thing and right now, he is possessed
, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward the bridge
Up ahead is a grassy area
For a moment, nothing
Then there is the same kind of movement we saw with Singh
Something is making the grass move- -only now there is no wind
Did he see it
We'll never know
, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished
His clothes are shredded
has finished with a section and satisfied, moves on- -but Starling is far from finished
He grabs the thorns with his bare hands and squeezes them together
Not good enough- look, it's got to be tighter
Tighter
' '
We see more fences around more camp areas
The entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual areas protected
The skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast
Fires start up
Dozens of them
Still darker
Now workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety before darkness takes over
They zig-zag this way, that way, dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, get up, run on- Falling out of the sky
The fires rise higher
No one moves
in the main tent area
He is bathing his bloody hands
Samuel is with him
Both are exhausted
Patterson brings them each drinks
They nod thanks, drain them
They stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire
You get the sense these three will be friends forever
What a good week
You mean nobody died
(shakes his head) We all worked together
Worthy deeds were accomplished
liked the labor
(beat) My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands
(looks at them) like the blood, is that strange
Oh yes,  think so
(Starling smiles, starts to speak) Look out, Samuel, here it comes
Even you two must admit that it is a glorious thing, what Man can accomplish
When there is a common splendid goal, there are no limits
Think what we will accomplish when we all have God's warmth in our hearts
(Samuel's eyes have closed; he begins to snore
Patterson can't help laughing) As good natured as ever
am immune to your disdain
(He looks at them now) When  came here,  had but one small goal: to convert the entire continent of Africa
(shakes his head) Now 've decided to move on to something really difficult:  will not rest until both of you are safely in the fold
've had four wives, good luck
The struggle is the glory
(  the three friends) , the next morning, working with Abdullah and some others at the bridge
completing work on the fence from the day before
It's high and taut and he's done a terrific job
are working near a large grassy field
One of the men starts a chant
The others pick it up
It's really pretty
wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the chant comes distantly to him on the wind
It's turning into a stunner of a day- glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds
Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men
As before
As before- -except it isn't
Because if you looked carefully, something flicked in a 180 degree arc
No telling what it was, it was gone too quickly
,
waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the men, of the birds
The sun is higher in the sky
- -and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking back in another 180 degree arc- -still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a tail
Now quickly- wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view
He holds an envelope
For you
(taking it) Thank you, Samuel
(watching as Patterson opens it) Good news
(glancing at the letter) expect so- it's from my wife
Do you love her
do, actually; very much
(his wonderful smile) You give me hope, John
(As he walks away-) , probing at the thorn fence, searching out any last weaknesses
Behind him now, in the tall grass, something moves
Starling, intent on his work, notices nothing
, getting more and more into it
, by the river, reading the letter
There is a large tree up the riverbank
It casts a large shadow
In the shadow now, something moves
Patterson, intent on his reading, notices nothing
(over) Darling one- the big excitement yesterday was when some school- children spotted a whale- (pause) -they were looking at me, John- , in their bedroom, moving across to the window, staring out
She now has a considerable stomach
That was an attempt at humor but don't feel very funny these days miss you terribly and after our son- still have total confidence- well, after he's born  think travel might be broadening
As he kicks me at night 'm quite sure he's telling me he definitely wants to come to Africa
(pause) Thought you might need reminding
by the river
He smiles, folds the letter
Now- at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they sound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound even better- -there must be twenty of them, working and singing- -and screaming
, turning his head sharply and , doing the same and and they're running now, running and shrieking and that's all we see, the workmen- -some of them run left- -some run right- -and now a few of them are starting to cry
running and running, glancing back, screaming louder, running on and on and -a shadow in the grass- no telling what- but it's big and it's moving and and this next goes so fast it could be a dream- or, more accurately, a nightmare- as it leaps onto the Fat Coolie, brings him to earth, bites his neck in two, kills him, just-like- that
, as they race away from the river and , running from the fenced area- he holds a rifle in his hands
- they freeze as the screams reach them and , on the way to his tent area and listening in fear and , racing to his tent, grabbing his rifle and cartridges and , running toward the screaming and , as he charges ahead, loading his rifle on the fly and , carrying more ammunition, running behind Patterson, keeping up and and nothing is visible now- the men are gone and from this angle, it looks deserted and , catching Starling, leading him into the area, Samuel just behind them
, ahead of them
They move to it, slow- -then they stop- -a sound is heard- from around the corner- the sound continues- Patterson glances at Starling- the sound could be this: the crunching of bones
, checking his rifle
, doing the same
Samuel, holding the extra ammunition, moves close to Patterson
Now- as he suddenly steps away from the shed, rounding the corner and as he does- , with the Fat Coolie- the lion is crunching at his feet- -then the lion stares toward the shed as we , moving out into clearer view, Starling and Samuel right with him
is a good distance away
, a low growl coming from him as he takes the coolie's body by the shoulder, begins backing away with it
, dropping to his knees for the shot and , doing the same and , growling louder and , taking aim and , crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow motion- -Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and- -and this thing is suddenly there- -this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the flat roof of the shed and , blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully stretched, it seems to go on forever and , turning around to see and , turning too, and we're coming back into regular motion now as we This enormous -  diving into the three, sending them all sprawling and roaring and roaring, running to the other and , for that is how they will be referred to- -and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth- -The Darkness has eyes that are crazed- -they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old and the young and the fat and the strong- , lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to reach for his rifle and , the white and the black, as they move toward the field of tall grass, roaring and , lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and '  and , as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring sounds are deafening now and , backing into the tall grass- -they roar one final time- , gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we and they're gone, the grass is full of moving patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing this way, that way- , staggering to his feet, staring at the grassy field
(dazed) Jesus, two of them
Dazed too
He points
Patterson registers, turns and ,  , his throat ripped open
briefly on the young man, then- train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in
And things are fairly chaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of the busier parts in camp- -but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with several dozen coolies who work under his command
THey are waiting for the train
Patterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah and Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them walking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same
(shouting over the noise of the approaching train) -oh, sing a different song, Abdullah- (gesturing toward the men who stand by the train tracks) -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is- (advancing on Patterson now) -you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate  persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate  have decided to stay- (losing it) You think you matter
(gesturing toward the train which is close to stopping now) -Beaumont is on that train- he matters- , moving in on Abdullah now- He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about
You think so
Fine
(finished arguing) It's best you get out
Go
Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- (And he wheels around, starts to walk away as we-) Quiet, staring after Patterson
Patterson has won
As the two of them exchange a quick glance- standing in the door of a passenger car, handsome as ever
Somehow his clothes are still pressed
Patterson moves up
In a splendid mood
Samuel is happy too
Pleasant journey
(stepping off the train) How could it be
hate Africa
Now there is the sudden sound of men singing- Patterson looks around and we and his workmen, moving away from the train- they are singing the same song that the workmen sang just before The Ghost and The Darkness attacked- it's pretty- but it's also a little unnerving
Listening a moment
Lovely sound- they seem happy
Don't they, though
So work must be going well
He and Samuel share another glance
(delicately) Truthfully
(beat) There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, 'd never built in Africa
But overall, you're pleased
(moving in) have never experienced anything like it
; almost longingly looks back at the train
almost feel like getting right back on
(glances at his watch) They do not breathe
He really wants to leave and for a moment it looks like he just might
(a sigh) suppose it would be a dereliction of duty not to at least look around
Now Abdullah wanders happily by
(waving) Morning, friend, glorious day
As are they all
He takes a step inside the passenger car
Hoping
Reluctantly returning
He has a large box
do need to see Starling
(dully) Starling
Awhile back he ordered some bibles- (indicating the box) -'ve brought them
(looking around) Is he here
(beat) Yes he is
Well,  need to speak to him
(helpfully) Let me deliver the bibles
His eyes flick from one man to the other
It's over
Excellent show
(voice low) Where is Starling
The jig is up
He gestures- Here he comes now
(And on that-) '
They start to put it on the train and as they do- Stunned
And furious
He storms off the train and we- as Beaumont sees it
Patterson and Samuel are with him
Little more work has been done than the last time we saw it
few men are working slowly
And now there are guards with rifles patrolling it
deadly look at them
He storms off
as Beaumont sees it- Patterson, Samuel, and Hawthorne stand quietly
It's much more crowded than the last time
Still under control, but barely
Beaumont is icy now
He gestures sharply toward Hawthrone to join them
speak low and fast- What in hell is going on
The Ghost and The Darkness have come
(snapping) In English
It's what the natives are calling the lions- (beat) -two lions have been causing trouble- -what's the surprise in that, this is Africa
It hasn't been that simple so far
What have they done besides kill Starling
(beat) How many have they killed
(Patterson nods for Hawthorne to answer) Doing his best
Well, of course,  can't supply a totally accurate answer because there are those that are actually authenticated and there are those that we once thought were workers killing each other or deserting from camp so any number  give is subject to error- (cutting through) How many
Thirty,  should think
(stunned) Christ
(whirling on Patterson) What are you doing about it
(Now from there-) : We are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area
This is not near the track but off by itself, in an area surrounded by thorn trees
Several workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it, trying to disguise the fact that the small railroad car is, indeed, nothing but a small railroad car
It is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily
looking at it
This is supposed to be salvation
(staring at Patterson) What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here
(keeping control) 'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door
There is, in fact, an open front door
Patterson gestures for Beaumont to follow him inside
It has been divided in half by thick metal bars from floor to ceiling
The bars are close together, only a few inches between them
In that half will be bait- human bait- 'll start things off- (points to the open doorway) -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor
(The smile is back) Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him
Patterson nods
Beaumont explodes
Are you running a high fever, man
How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed
How could you even conceive of it
didn't conceive of it for the lions-  built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger
(incredulous) And it worked
(He hates to say this) In point of fact, it didn't
(hurrying on) But 'm convinced the theory is sound
They move outside
The tension between them is considerable
Beaumont looks at Patterson for too long a moment
What
made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job
(Silence
Then-) You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you
Well, fine- (lashing back) -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that
And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here
Blazing
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind
And the Germans and the French are gearing up
And don't care about you and  don't care about the thirty dead-  care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, 'll get my knighthood and  want it
(glancing around as Samuel appears, goes to the workers) Professional hunters may be the answer
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then
'm going to try and locate Redbeard- assume you've heard of him
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead
(long pause) Very well, the job's still yours, 'll go
But if  have to return, you're finished
And  will then do everything can to destroy your reputation
Am not fair
(The great smile flashes) Told you you'd hate me
(And he turns, walks off) Moving up to Patterson
Samuel has a bag
(staring after Beaumont) do hate him
(takes the bag from Samuel, pulls out flares) want you to distribute one bag of flares to every tent area- (takes out a flare) -tell the men to light them if there's trouble- (beat) -make it two bags
( briefly, then-) lamp burns alongside him
Across the bars, the door of the railroad car is open
Flickering shadows
Above the doorway is a thick wooden slab the size of the door
n the ground, barely visible, the trip wire
Outside, something is moving
, rifle ready, holding his breath
SIlence
Nothing moves now
He rubs his eyes with his hands
on the wall
It's later that night
The man is bleary with fatigue
He sits in a corner of the car, writing a letter
'  (over) "Dearest
peace and tranquility continue to abound here- the workers report each day with a smile- except for your absence, this whole adventunre is providing me nothing but pleasure
" It's later still
Patterson, finished writing, stares out at the night
, rising brightly toward the sky
, seeing the flare
The man is miserable
'  (over) Fire
The branch is destroyed, the flowers blown away
hold rifles
They look like brothers, which they are
They also look tough
And they are that, too (impressed) Very good indeed
(he wears glasses) We have hunted since childhood
All right- you'll spend your nights inside
(He indicates the railroad car
The Coolies nod) You'll have plenty of ammunition
You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear
That is correct
(beat) Nothing
Patterson looks at the three men
Obviously, he could not have chosen better
From them- lot of men working under Patterson
Progress is slow
Some men sit on the part that's been built
Spending the night there for protection
Now, they all turn and we going off in another part of camp
, in a tree alone, in despair
Tough as ever
Ready for anything
But nothing is happening
Silence
-
are moving into the river
They wade til the water is up to their necks
Then they reach out, hold hands, start to sing
moving high into a tree
He listens to the sound
Lovely
The men stand as before, singing softly
The river here is calm, no current to speak of
The men are safe- -or rather they should be
swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as the others start to scream- , watching another flare rise, helplessly listening
- -one of them kicks wildly at the wind
They should be nervous- -The Ghost walks among them, chooses which one to kill, leaps on it, brings it to earth as the dust rises
seems overwhelmed
And for a moment we don't know what it is
There is a faint light and now we see what it is we're looking at: a wire
And now a paw walks across it- -and the instant that happens- , the brothers, in the contraption, two of them asleep, a flickering lamp the only illumination in the railroad car and slamming loudly down and , standing alone in one half of the railroad car- it's incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked and The entire of the car- the thick bars separating the two halves
In one half, the huge lion
In the other, the three armed, tough coolies
For a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too startled and surprised to do anything but stare- -and then all hell just explodes as we , and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more terrifying and , throwing his huge body at the bars and and both his front claws are slashing through and and they retreat against the rear wall of the car
, rage building, throwing its body at the bars again and , pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do anything but stare and , ripping at the air and , leaping forward, smashing into the bars and are connected and the sheer power of his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and , staring up at the ceiling and ,     , roaring and his body hits the bars and - and the bars shake- -but they're not giving way
, as they begin to realize this and , clawing for them and , raging and roaring on his side of the bars and , raising his gun and , his gun raised too and and he's ready and - -and reload- -and fire again, and reload, and- - and suddenly the lamp is knocked over- -and a fire starts, flames grow and it's starting to look like hell in there- -only it gets worse as we- at the bars- -and suddenly it stands up- it seems to fill the car, towering over everything, it's like a nightmare come to kill you- staring up at this giant thing, and of course they're more terrified now than they've ever been in their lives- but these are tough men and they ignore the flames, ignore the deafening roars of the beast and , standing there, going crazy on his side of the bars, trying to knock them down but they're holding and , reloading and , racing around the enclosed area now and he's trapped and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes have never been so bright, his roars as deafening and , firing again and , leaping at the bars again, and they shake, sure they shake, but they keep on holding and , firing, reloading, firing, reloading and as they do, something's starting to come clear- -amazing as it may seem, impossible as it may be to conceive, they're missing
, whirling on his side, roaring and leaping and and sure they fire, but they're still so goddam scared and - it's held in place by some thick wooden bars- -and now the Coolies start to hit something- the wooden bars because they begin to splinter and , whirling, leaping at the bars and firing and then- as it flops open and just like that- Out the door and gone
Patterson stands where The Darkness was
The three Coolies are where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars
This was the lowest point yet for Patterson
Not only had his notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend how the coolies missed
It never seemed possible- but of course, it really happened
Not once
- you didn't hit it once
- - would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving- -well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing- assure you we came close many times- Abdullah is in the doorway near Patterson now- with several dozen men
And from Abdullah's face, this is clearly going to be a confrontation
-the next time we will do better
(Patterson makes no reaction; moves outside) , simmering, moving straight to Patterson as soon as he's out
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo- (not in a mood for this) -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it- (moving in- tension rising as others crowd behind him) -now you're telling me my beliefs
- don't think so- just beyond- something is moving- an animal
- Impossible to say
wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo- (cutting in) -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo- -careful, Abdullah- Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous
You do not tell me "careful"- you do not tell me anything- you listen while  talk- (Now suddenly a shadow seems to cross-) His eyes widen
Pressed hard against Abdullah's temple
'  (over) -change in plan- you listen while talk- because you have a question that needs answering
(beat) Will  pull the trigger
We are looking at one of those legends- ageless and powerful, with a tanned face and a thick grey beard
He has seen everything and is capable of anything
Just now he seems more than capable of killing Abdullah
Very calmly, he cocks the pistol
(over) It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill you
(not looking around) No hints, Samuel
(The name has registered) You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo
You're right
The Devil has come
Look at me
am the Devil
, staring at Redbeard
Right now Redbeard just could be
(louder) am a man of peace
Am  to take it you want to live
Most certainly
Absolutely
Yes
Excellent decision
(Now he suddenly reaches out, shakes Abdullah's hand) Your name is Abdullah
'm sure we'll meet again
Go and enjoy the splendid morning
(dazed- leaving) think it's been a pleasure
, and now he does another surprising thing: embraces Samuel
(three words) You got old
(Now he releases Samuel, turns to Patterson) 'm sure you're John Patterson
(before Patterson can reply) Stay out of my way
(And without another word, he's gone) as Redbeard moves through, taking it all in
It's even worse than when we last saw it- bodies crammed everywhere and always the sound of pain and sickness
Patterson stands in the doorway, watching, waiting
(as Redbeard approaches) didn't have a chance to thank you
(preoccupied) What did  do
Got me out of trouble
(matter of fact) Nonsense- Samuel would have done something
(starts to move on) We need to talk
Let me save time- (1) you are the engineer; (2) you are in charge; (3) you're sorry 'm here
Right so far
(Patterson nods) Good- because (1)  am not an engineer, (2)  don't want to be in charge, and (3) 'm sorrier than you are that 'm here-  hate Tsavo
So  will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what  tell you so can leave
See any problems
Actually, no
All right- let's go into battle
(suddenly taking Patterson's hand) 'm Redbeard
(as they shake) Somehow  guessed
(As they move outside-) Hwathorne, Samuel, Abdullah, and perhaps a dozen other worker leaders
Redbeard and Patterson move to them
Starting now, we attack them
How; we don't know where they are
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we
And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion
(to Hawthorne) First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night
(appalled) That's a terrible idea- (backtracking) -is it, 'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know
Silliest thing  ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that
(charming now) suppose  could answer you suppose  could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike
It's even possible that  tell you  found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here
(Turning on Hawthorne now- his voice building) But  don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that  don't have the least idea what  am doing, that  am nothing but an incompetent, that  am a fool
(big) Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now
(The words burst out) have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived
(nice smile) Then we agree
(And on that-) It was a huge effort and they got half of it done that day- but there was always the sense of impending bloodshed
What we see first are Patterson and a bunch of shots of a lot of workers- laying out the dimensions of the new boma that would surround the place
This was to be by far the biggest wall fence they had in Tsavo
And now here comes Abdullah leading a crowd of men, wading into a huge patch of thorn trees, cutting the thick branches down, starting to load them for carrying- -and it's high noon now, and Patterson drenched with sweat, leads the start of the actual building- taking the thorn branches, bunching them together, forcing them so there is no room between them- -and we can just begin to get the sense of what the fence will be- except at the moment it's barely a foot high- -and now Redbeard appears, beckons to Patterson, and Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel walk quickly
turning to Redbeard and Patterson
Soon
(Redbeard nods) (to Redbeard) have to ask- why do you need me
don't really
But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out- (Patterson has to smile at the phrase) -when 'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge
And  don't want the men to have lost respect for you
(kind of surprised) That's very considerate
'm always considerate- my mother taught me that
, who just breaks out laughing
Why do you laugh
- you don't believe she taught me
don't believe you had a mother
(And as Redbeard laughs too-) as they approach
Redbeard walks ahead
You like him, don't you
Oh yes
But it takes time
You've known him long
(He has) Since his beard was red
Redbeard, Patterson and Samuel stand near him
and are there
Some of the children look at Redbeard, mime shooting, fall down dead
Samuel translates as necessary
How many cattle
Four should do it
They will want a lot of money
(to Redbeard) Have you got it
No, but you do- (beat) -see, you were needed after all
(to Samuel) And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn
(Samuel explains
The Masai Chief replies
Translating) Why so many
Because  have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men
watching as Samuel tells the Chief
He moves toward Redbeard and Patterson
As he speaks, Samuel translates quietly
There is a sadness in the Chief's tone
(translating) The Ghost and the Darkness have come
and we can do nothing
but if you anger them
they will stay in Tsavo
and life will become more unberable, that  know
, watching as Redbeard replies
(beat) Two lions are all that have come
they're only lions, that  know
(beat) And  will kill them both tomorrow
( , then-) '
We're not sure for a moment where we are but we can hear metallic sounds
Now we hear voices
(over) 'll need you by me in the morning
(over) Whatever you wish
- ' '
Patterson, Redbeard, Hawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire
THey are cleaning their guns, getting ready
Patterson's is a good rifle and he cleans it expertly
Redbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest
And the way his hands move as he assembles it, he might be bathing a child
Hawthorne is the least skilled of the three
But his rifle is clearly the finest
Bigger than the others, with great killing power
There is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel show it
Redbeard is as before
(terribly tense) You're certain about tomorrow
(Redbeard is) But you don't seem excited
(Redbeard isn't) You don't enjoy killing, do you
(Redbeard doesn't) Then why do it
He stares at the fire
Then- have a gift
Silence for a moment except for the sound of the weapons being reassembled
Redbeard's hands fly
His rifle is back together
He stands, nods, goes
, watching him
Strange man
(to Samuel) Has he always been this way
Much gentler now
(shakes his head on that) John
- (He holds out his beautiful rifle) Change guns with me- mine's much more powerful
'll be finishing the hospital tomorrow so  won't be with you- but if you'll use this
(beat) then  will
Patterson, touched, changes weapons
Thank you
(He turns to Samuel) Why does he need you by him
He doesn't
He needs nobody
But we have hunted many times
(beat) he knows  am afraid of lions
- Misty- hard to see much
Then  appear- -they're not ghosts, they're   emerging from the mists
They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking equipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them materialize- Redbeard, Patterson, and Samuel wait as the Warriors approach
(whispered) spotted one of them- (gesturing toward the thicket) -in there
again- alive with thorn trees
Dark, filled with long dark shadows
lot of tension
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter
Have you ever led trackers
(He hasn't) can try
(no good) Samuel says you killed a lion
It was probably luck- 'd rather you did the shooting
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck
(points- hand out straight) Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- 'll make the lion come directly to you
(He gestures for Patterson to take off and as he does-) as Redbeard goes to them- (as Samuel translates) -all of you- spread the width of the clearing- no gaps- go- (claps his hands once) , spreading apart
Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon
, running like hell
, moving quickly, silently
0F
, ducking his head, blasting through
, starting to cover the entire width of the thicket
, quickstepping over rocky terrain
staying close to Redbeard
The fear is there
, studying the position of the Warriors, who are almost ready
, circling now, racing toward a clearing, picking up speed
, spread out
They look to Redbeard
Not yet
, racing into the clearing, glances around- lots of anthills
, eight feet high
It casts a long shadow
Holding Hawthorne's marvelous rifle, he slips silently into the shadow
- it's almost as if he weren't there
Suddenly screaming and , screaming too and , suddenly moving forward, all of them shouting and screaming and pounding on their drums and it is loud
in the shadow
The noise is faint- but he can hear it
, moving forward, banging away
, even louder
, moving forward, his eyes flicking ahead- Nothing
No movement
No lion
Just the least bit louder now
, screaming and pounding and - the fear worse, dogging Redbeard's steps
His eyes flicking ahead
Nothing
No movement
No lion
It's a lot louder now
He's totally still
And he's ready
we've seen yet
, slashing their way through, drumming and shouting and , at their head, eyes, as always, flicking
Nothing
No movement
No lion
- starting to suddenly get louder and point- -because something is there- , and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw it before- -but now something begins to move and and it's all going crazy now, and they're starting to move faster and The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and and the movement up ahead is more distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we - eyes bright- it starts to move away from the sound- -and toward where Patterson is waiting
Faster, screaming louder and and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too and - he fingers the weapon
, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and , immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors to get left and , shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The Ghost's intended path and , shifting, trying to go the other way this time and ; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift the other way and , racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's path again and , rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in the original direction- toward Patterson and , and it's as if mass hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but you couldn't tell that from what they're doing- Waiting by the anthill
Waiting
Then, at last- , backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware of Patterson's existence behind him
Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the sunlight
He raises Hawthorne's gun
, backing toward Patterson
, sighting along the glistening barrel
, starting to turn
, ready to fire
,
And now its lips go back as it sees Patterson
,  , and this is it, this is the moment and as he squeezes the trigger- , and a totally unexpected sound- a dull snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired
, unharmed and desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function and It stares at Patterson
, and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and - -and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau- -   - as he hears it, breaking into a wild run- Shoot for chrissakes
- standing his ground as now   takes a step toward him
, firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the clearing and as he reaches it- Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and 's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot at the animal- he curses, races for a better position and One final stare at Patterson- -then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket- -and it's safe and free and gone
Rocked
The low point of his life
, catching up to Redbeard
Did you ever see a lion that size
Not even close
(Now he moves to Patterson) What happened
(a whisper) misfire
it jammed
Has it ever done that before
don't know
It's Hawthorne's
Trying for control
You exchanged weapons
(Patterson nods) You went into battle with an untried gun
(Patterson nods) For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's going to do
It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to happen
Drained, he epects it
It's very quiet
, studying the younger man
And when he finally speaks, his voice is surprisingly quiet
They have an expression in prizefighting: "everyone has a plan until they're hit
" (beat) You've just been hit
(beat) the getting up is up to you
(And he turns, moves off and) Nearly finished
The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is supervising men and material that are being transferred
, checking security in the New Hospital which is close to the center of camp
(The Old Hospital was situated on the outskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the sick and the wounded
) Late afternoon, now
Patterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him
As are , both armed with powerful rifles
Patterson is silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his face
(to the Orderlies) Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood
When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high
Any questions, ask them now
(They understand- now to Samuel and Hawthorne) You two will sleep beautifully in your tents
(beat) And stay there
And where will you sleep beautifully
(smile) Patterson and  will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- (beat) -and by the time we're done, promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible
(And on that-) Redbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the inside perimeter- -buckets of blood
Darker
They empty still more full buckets of blood
Redbeard seems pleased
, hurrying toward their camp
, leading Masai cattle into the grounds of the Old Hospital
, firmly closing and locking the gate
, just outside the fence of the Old Hospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as they move
Dying
dying
They slip inside the deserted Old Hospital, pull the gate securely shut
They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling to each other
Full
Clean
The men are exhausted
Most are already asleep
The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything
Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their fire, waiting
The cows are quiet
by his fire near his tent with Samuel
Nervously, they drink tea
Higher
An hour has passed
Perhaps more
Walking the fence perimeter
The cows are edgy
He calms the cows
The large chunks of meat are visible in the moonlight
The orderlies are calm
, still walking the perimeter
sitting by the fire, staring at the night
Redbeard moves to him, speaks in a whisper
Think about something else
Have you ever failed
(sad smile) Only in life
(He walks away
Patterson watches
) The Orderlies tend the sick
Quietly
Lovely
Stalking the perimeter
No sound
The night is deadly quiet
He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the ripping of flesh- Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat
Redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for Patterson to switch positions with him
As he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops
Silence again
Patterson reaches the far side of the fence
Now the eating sound comes again, and again,   are outside, directly across from Patterson
looks across the perimeter at Patterson
Whatever's going on, it's sure as hell odd
- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out violently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just before The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one- -now a different sound is heard: scratching- tracking the sound- -the main gate is starting to be pushed in
Inside the gate the ground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their buckets
More pressure against it- it could give way any moment
and from the look on Redbeard's face, this is it
Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we- , going nuts and then- All pressure gone
Patterson is furious
Goddammit
It's all right
Stay ready
(indicates the blood) They know it's there
Patterson takes a few steps away, stares at the moon
; he studies Patterson who so clearly craves redemption
(going to him) Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap
Your idea
(Patterson nods) Excellent notion-  used the same device myself once
But of course yours worked
In point of fact it didn't- but 'm convinced the idea is sound
He goes back to walking the perimeter
Patterson watches him- and for the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to lift
and an , blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the fire and rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before he can scream- suddenly beside him, and their giant paws slap out so fast we can't follow and , dropping to the ground, and now we're starting to spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning
with malaria and flashing and , lips pulling back and , falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed face and , trying to rise and , leaping on them and , eyes narrow and brilliant and , and he's terrified and he tries to scream- -the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry we've heard and , ,     - '     - -but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away
, rifles ready- but no sound reaches them
, out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it and he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel does his best to stop him- -but Hawthorne rips free and we , as it starts to collapse and , as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and , flying across the tent and , shattering and more medicine is destroyed and , of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those terrible bright blazing eyes and , being pulled out of the ground and and what they are doing is this: destroying the New Hospital and collapsing and Eyes crazed
, scared shitless as he runs
, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and , heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we -    are staring at him
, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring around- - the eys are gone- -and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New Hospital and the instant they are heard , grabbing torches, throwing the gate open and they're off as we , running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now
, tearing through the night
(We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes
) The tents are all down
The place is devastated
Filled with the dead and the dying
Ashen
Moving on
Dead
Blood
Pain
More dead
More dying
It's a slaughterhouse
He's crushed
His body sags
He takes a breath, his last
are on him, roaring
as the roar reverberates- they glance at each other- -then they slow
Because the New Hospital has come into view
,  , staring at the disaster
And this terrible crosses his face
For a moment, you think he's going to fall
His body seems drained of all its power
He stands there
Just stands there
Unable to move
And he does move
Slowly
Carefully
Into the chaos
He stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere
Hawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone
All that's left now is this: the sound of pain
Dust rises
It covers everything
Only the sound remains
Now different sounds take over- -an incredible babble of human voices
Patterson walks through the dust
Samuel, a worried look on his face, is a few steps behind
We are at the   and it is jammed
train has pulled into the station- -only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are workers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber up onto the roofs of the cars- -covering the cars- -everyone is leaving- -Patterson can only watch
Abdullah stands on one of the cars- -the train begins to pull out of the station
More and more workers chase after it, get pulled on
Now the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full
Patterson still watches, eyes vacant
Abdullah sees him, looks away
The train gathers speed
Rounds a corner
gone
Patterson turns from the scene, begins to walk
Samuel stays close behind him, the worried look still there
do the best they can
Patterson watches only a moment, walks on
Samuel still behind him
as Patterson walks through
ghost town now
Only Africans remain
where the coolies missed The Darkness
Patterson looks at it a moment, walks on
where Patterson misfired
Patterson looks at it a moment, walks on
And now, at last- '
One or two Africans
Samuel darts into his tent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson
'
Patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he never takes it off again
He walks on alone now until at last- It stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a lot of the scaffolding, but it's useless
Late afternoon
Desolate
Redbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations
He looks as he did the night before
Patterson walks to the top of the near embankment
He is unshaven, wrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace
For a moment, neither says a word
Then- (out of the blue) It would have been a beautiful bridge, John
never noticed before, occupied with other business, 	suppose
(He's rambling) never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but 've had the time today, nothing else on, and this
it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier
and
(He goes silent now, stares off) You just got hit
(Redbeard nods) The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions- (beat) -and 'm going after them crack of dawn
(And on that-) - -we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet tall- gorgeous early morning light
As we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the cliff
As we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving
are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the rock face
Patterson is much more nimble
It's dangerous, of course, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind
They travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons
as they make it over the cliff face
They stand, stare out
: the world
They move on
They are moving along the edge
It's tricky going- if you fell you wouldn't much like it
They are both concentrating on their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard starts to speak
They don't stop moving
In my town, when  was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place
(beat) But he was not the problem
He had a brother who was worse than he
But the brother was not the problem
(beat) One or the other of them was usually in jail
The problem came when they were both free togther
The two became different from either alone
(beat) Alone they were only brutes
Together they became lethal, together they killed
What happened to them
(pause) got big
(They move on) working their way up a steep ravine
It's hard going
They help each other
, moving along the edge of the ravine now
Slow
Silent
Redbeard stops, points- with one odd thing about it: there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used it as a regular passage
at the archway
They look at each other, without a word move through it
small clearing
And at the end of the clearing: a cave
Dark
They each check their guns, move toward it
Closer
Suddenly it's getting eerie
, moving slowly, Patterson right with him
They're by it- Redbeard squints inside
: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low tunnel you have to half-crawl through
Without a word, they start inside
, crouched low, moving through the tunnel
Ahead there is light
They move on
- they can see the cave beyond
They glance down
Nothing much there- just a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear
Now they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up
- '
, moving deeper into the cave
It's scary- dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock
It's dank
It all feels as at any moment, the world could end
Thunderstruck- Dear God- (And on those words-) More copper bracelets
And still more- -and now bones- -the floor of the place is littered with human bones- -eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around
The rest of the cave
We are looking at a carpet of bones
Their den
(Redbeard nods) Have you ever seen anything like this
Nobody's seen anything like this
Lions don't have caves like this- (beat) -they're doing it for pleasure
, dark and ominous, leading from the cave- -and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels- -something is coming close and coming fast and as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the sound explodes- - -shrieks- What the hell is it
- and here they come, screeching and angry- -bats- -swarms of them- hundreds of them- , diving to the ground, lying there amidst the bangles and the bones and the skulls- Circling above them
Screeching louder
, lying very still, eyeless skulls all around, staring
For a moment, it seems as if they might attack
Waiting, waiting
Then- back into the tunnel and , scrambling to their feet
One of my chief attributes is that 'm always calm
And then without warning, from behind them, a roar- spin around, start back toward the entrance of the cave- as they scramble half-crawling through it
as they make it, stand straight, look around- beyond- another roar and sudden movement and , entering the thick bush- but carefully, because they are vulnerable now and an attack could come from anywhere- there is the sound of water- -slashes of light hit their eyes, making it hard to see- and they're totally vulnerable now but it doesn't stop them- the water sound gets stronger- and as they burst clear- - -
They look around
Nothing is there
But the spot is wide open, exposed
(The words pour out) Where could it have gone
How could it get across the water
(looks at Redbeard) They're only lions, yes
(shakes his head; he doesn't know) Don't they have to be
They look around a moment more
Nothing to see- -they turn, leave, re-enter the thick bush
And now- - who knows where it is but it's there- -watching Patterson
on The Darkness, then- '
- -outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones
Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen
Patterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the other
(pointing) Both of them over there
He is pointing to Patterson's area
Patterson goes to Redbeard
Ever have to use a machan
(Redbeard hasn't) did once
In India
We will tonight
(Now from that-) Patterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd looking structure: four slender poles lashed together, slanting inward with a plank tied on top, a dozen feet up in the air
Redbeard and Samuel approach
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing
(indicating the plank) It may be tight
Not for me- 'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there
(to Samuel) Take the others to the water tower for the night
'll be bait alone
Yes
And 'll be in some distant tree where  can provide no assistance whatsoever
(beat) Can you control your fear
'll have to
can't control mine- 'd be lost without the shame factor driving me
Was that supposed to make me feel better
(Redbeard doesn't reply
Now-) start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan
Patterson takes a long look at the machan
He tests the support poles- they're rickety
The sun quickly beginning its quick fall
Samuel is with the remaining men who clamber up to the platform on top
Quiet
Redbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the plank
Patterson climbs his slow way up
It's dangerous
as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages to sit
Nothing is around the machan
He is totally vulnerable
, taking the ladder down
Patterson tries to get comfortable
He can't
(glancing around) It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you
You think they'll come then
(Redbeard does) Why
(not answering) Good luck
Why
(beat) Because  think they're after you
This registers
Finally, he nods
Redbeard starts to leave
How many do you think they've killed
(reluctantly) The most of any lions
a hundred
(beat) Probably more
(Now Redbeard looks up at the younger man) Johnny
They study each other in the gathering darkness
They've been through a lot together, these two
They're not what they were when they first met
An emotional moment clearly is at hand
Don't fuck up
(And he turns, never looks back, just goes) He is alone now
Growing longer
On top of the water tower
The remaining men are with him
It peers around
His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel- -there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, the world could explode
, a good distance away
bunch of trees
Nothing unusual
: Redbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches
About to die
, trying to get comfortable
It's not possible
, tethered, but able to move
, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles
He stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, giving it color
and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just set, it literally drops out of the sky
Suddenly it's bright and in a blink it isn't
As it drops- It's madness that he's up here
And he knows it
And that shows
No moon
Just thick cloud
Quiet
On his precarious perch
He scans constantly ahead of him past the donkey
Nothing moves- He swallows, moistening his throat
He stares down at the donkey
And now, just the beginning of a mist
sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends, listening for something, anything- -but all there is is silence
It lies still and quiet
, looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to scream
The mist is getting stronger
in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing mist
, listening, listening- -and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear it but to Patterson it might as well be thunder- -from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a twig
, and it's eyes widen- Because now something happens that hasn't happened before: suddenly there are no colors, only tones- -because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's happening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of the lion- Watching the donkey
And from now on, when we are using '   , everything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted
When we are using  '   , everything is totally clear- and sounds are thunderous
: just mist and vaguely, bushes
: The donkey
And  begins to move closer as The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer
Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be some movement in the bushes
: The donkey, very, very close- Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but the mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything
:
Now there is something else visible, something behind the donkey: the four legs of the platform
Now we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together
Involuntarily, a shiver
: , but the angle shifts- -what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist
, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving
He half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is behind him
:  shifting as the angle continues to change
as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about the donkey anymore, it's stalking him
In the tree
The mist obscures everything
:
Still circling, still closer
, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do anything but this constantly circling movement
(In truth, the lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite seen
) : , always the circling around
, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to let the animal's position out of his sight
:
Closer
, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and :
Closer
, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on turning
:
Closer
, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, almost knocking him off the plank and : , starting to slip off the platform and , fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and he's trying not to fall and : , beginning to topple off and , helpless, balance going, going- , starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and as he starts his leap- , racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing his rifle, firing again and , as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes and the night has him and , running, stopping, staring at the ground- Blood
, moving quickly forward again- More blood and
, starting to slow- - huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen, some of them fifteen feet high, some even higher
They separate, take different paths through the anthills
Alert
One step at a time
The same
One step at at time
Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, staring down at them both
He gestures for them to stop
They do
For a moment they might be statues
Spots of blood
Redbeard kneels to examine them and as he does- , launched in mid-air and , whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates- , in mid-air, body twisted and- -and
Freeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky
THen- ,    - -we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment when the three men brought the old man-eater into camp- -only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the actual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead animal to the ground- - and now there's a flash of light as we , kneeling by the dead animal
He is smiling beautifully, and there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face
; loads of bulky equipment
Patterson and Redbeard stand behind him, watching him
We're in a lovely spot by the river
Patterson and Redbeard have definitely been drinking
think another for posterity- this is an important moment in my life
He strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work
Understand,  had help- -not a time for modesty, Bob- -undeniably your triumph
Oh surely there's enough credit for us all- let's not forget, you did the actual shooting
Of course, hired you,  was the general who put the team together
And generals are the ones who tend to be remembered
Perhaps you might put your head in its mouth, sir- could be a corker
Clever idea,  like it
- it is huge- -Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the enormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and , surprised and frightened- -he jerks his head away- -there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's- -Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, humiliated, and as the laughter builds- Patterson and Redbeard flank a fire
It's a sweet moment for them, their first, no fear in the vicinity
It should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of champagne
It should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away from the young man who went to meet Beaumont
He's unshaven, his eyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure- he is more at ease with the world
(drunk) never thought 'd say this, but 'm glad you came
(drunk) Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me
Actually,  could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, 'm glad you came
(They toast each other) Samuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins them
(drunk) Where do you go next
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas
You
Help finish the railroad
want to meet my son- he must be what, two months old
They look at the fire a moment
Then- Three years 've worked for the railroad
Now  don't know why
It seemed a good idea once
feel the same about the bridge
This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it
Too soon to tell
They look at him
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder
Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad
But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity
Was that worth all the lives
Too soon to tell
(drinks) Some mysteries should not have solutions
(finishes his bottle, rises, looks at Patterson) Hold your son high
(And he turns, goes to his tent) (beat- quietly) He has children
(beat- quietly) Once
( on the two in the firelight
Then-) , (over) 'd like to see John Patterson, please
(As he looks up-) standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but still lovely
She holds their son in her arms
The kid is adorable
Could you tell him that his wife- (catches herself, smiles) -that his family has come to see him
(On that-) - Samuel hurries to him with the news- Patterson takes off running and and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all but her heels
, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station area
- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly and , excitedly waving back and , moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and , suddenly screaming "Get back- back-" , and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- she smiles again, waves again and , screaming now, all he has, " " and , and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the same, she stops and , stalking silently, closing on the mother and child
, and the baby wakes, smiles and , starting to run and and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get there, he's never going to get there- , and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she turns- -but too late, too late as we , flying toward her now and , in agony
, leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as Helena cries out helplessly- , crying out helplessly and , continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had is over- -he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside
It's dawn
Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the dream
He looks around
Redbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it- It's empty
Patterson stares around- -there is blood on the tent floor and quickly- running wildly, rifle in hand and , carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and , flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash across a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do, widening the area of search and , veering off and , as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the damage to his clothes or his skin and - he plunges wildly ahead and - it seems to be casting an unusual shadow- Patterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it- -nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working overtime and is only getting worse- Patterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do- -and then '  on the wind- calling to him- , tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again, louder- -Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend- So lovely
With one patch in the middle that is blood red
Something is moving in the blood red area
Patterson has his rifle ready- -and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch
In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen something beyond imagination
, rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to where Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down into the grass- -clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead
Patterson and Samuel stare mute at one another- -and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar of The Darkness
They don't even react
We should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this before
Samuel stands there, trying to hold it together
Patterson stands there too, trying to hold it together
'
Flames consume the body
Just Patterson and Samuel
No one else is there
The flames lick at the sky
, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use at the bridge, not far from the baboon
You're positive lions hate baboons
(Samuel is) Pebbles
(Samuel holds up a bag) Let's get it over with
as they reach the crane tower platform, fifteen feet from the baboon
They help each other into position
Almost night
, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into the darkness
on the platform
Samuel tosses a pebble toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but irritation- ' They're both tired
Samuel throws another pebble
The baboon cries out
, ,
He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes
Paterson looks wild; only nervous energy is keeping him going now
The moon
Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and frightening black clouds gather and , blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to hallucinate
Samuel is awake now
Patterson stares at the river which is calm
, raging and black and lethal
, hallucinating again
and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears- Firing- - , and it's hit and it roars and goes down and- -, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, turning back, ready to fire again- - gone
, blinking, looking around
Where is it
(pointing down) Underneath
(beat) Somewhere
'
The superstructure for the bridge- it goes several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run
They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to the railroad level
They reach the railroad level
PAtterson releases the baboon which races away
At the end of the bridge where they began construction
The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away before them
They begin to walk the incomplete bridge
carefully
as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, making sure they miss nothing
Terrified
Holding his rifle extremely tightly
Ready for anything
up ahead of them
There are some holes
slowing
The nearest one is the largest
He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole
It seems empty
One step forward
Another
They hold their breaths
It seems empty
- The Darkness is there
, firing
, going down through another level of scaffolding
, trying to track it
Nothing is visible
- Frozen
They listen- -nothing but their breathing
, looking around everywhere
Nothing
of scaffolding
Nothing
of scaffolding
Nothing
, looking this way, that way
- Patterson falls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it gets up and , turning for Samuel's rifle- -only Samuel isn't there- -he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and and he turns, starts running too, running across the narrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without slipping or falling and , wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it takes off after Patterson and , making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the nearest tree and running for his life across the bridge and , closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a dead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary speed, it's still faster than Patterson and , and he's never gone this fast in his life and '  , a different one from Samuel's and it's just up ahead and , closing and , and , springing into the air now and , diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both hands, swinging his body up as we , barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the branch and now comes this insane roar and with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree
in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen feet up
, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's tree, raging with frustration
, exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks across at the next tree not far away where Samuel is- (embarrassed) Afraid of lions
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- (Now he shuts up fast and-) , as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb the tree after Patterson
Lions are cats and when they want to climb, up they go and that's what The Darkness is doing now, going up and , and it's terrifying- he reaches for the branch above, climbing higher and , climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there is a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and , going still higher but the branches are getting thinner and the tree is shaking, and he could fall- , climbing on, nothing can stop it- , together in the tree, and there's no further Patterson can go and it's harder for The Darkness too, but slowly it moves in and , calling out- Samuel
(And he gestures for the rifle and the instant he does-) , and he takes the rifle between his two hands and , steadily moving in and , tossing the rifle with great care and Patterson's less than fifteen feet away and , hands out to catch it and in mid-air and , both hands ready and as it strikes a tree branch, spins away to the ground
, almost on Patterson now and , suddenly leaping out of the tree, and yes it's a long way and sure it's going to damage him but sometimes there aren't a lot of choices in this world and , staring as Patterson falls and , crashing hard to earth, stunned, hurt, ribs broken, leg broken and , and it's so big it's hard for it to get room to turn but it does and crawling for the rifle, and he's in terrible pain but he reaches the weapon, grabs for it and , skittering down the tree and as it reaches the ground , forcing himself to his feet and , a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its charge
, aims, fires and , hit again and down it goes again but up it comes again and , firing the final shot and , hit again and it has to stop, it just has to- -but it doesn't
It roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson
; all bullets gone, no place to hide
Still moving forward
He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a branch, lands hard and , framed between Patterson's legs
Six feet away, now four, now- , helpless on the ground
, and the eyes glow- -a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge teeth into the branch- -now a long dying sigh
and it goes to the ground
Can't breathe
, dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch
And suddenly he just empties and tears pour down his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with sobs
He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal- Just the sound of Patterson's tears
- -      -  '
-hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it- -Samuel is there- lighting up the world with his smile- -and Patterson's there, too
He stands with Helena, his young son in his arms
Everybody smiles, everybody waves, the train goes triumphantly by
He looks wonderful again, vibrant and young
Watching him, you might think he hadn't been through the nightmare as he stands there, holding the boy tightly
But with his other hand, he fingers the lion claw necklace
Now slowly dissolve to an African evening
Animals stretch from one horizon to the other
(over) Here we still wonder about them
How did they escape for nine months
And kill 135 men
And stop the railroad
(beat) And were they only lions
(beat) If you want to decide for yourself, you must go to America
They are at the Field Museum in Chicago, and even now, after they have been dead a century, if you dare to lock eyes with them
(beat) you will be afraid
In the distance, the animals continue to move
(over) Sleep well
They seem to go on forever
