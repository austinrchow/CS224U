2012 Written by Roland Emmerich & Harald Kloser Second Draft February 19th, 2008 We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the Clarinet Concerto in
Space, infinite and empty
But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move into frame and align
The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun
Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic proportion unfolds
The eruptions shoot thousands of miles into the blackness of space

An Indian  playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy ship across a puddle
The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy
Watch out
But it's too late
The jeep drives straight through the puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship
In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building
The driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance

Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir
As Prof
West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting for this science lab
Helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions
Correct, sir
But that is not what worries me
They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings

How can that be
We don't know, Professor, sir

#1 Look at Anheuser
Anyone would think he was President
Did you hear, he wants us to sign in and out like school boys
still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House
#2 Why not
Anheuser owns the Senate and the Congress
Shame he's such a pompous ass
(
) Somebody mention my name
Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling
() Yes sir
No, sir
Which one is it
We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight
Well done, sir
It's Helmsley, right
'll remember that
Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile

At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings

Listen, Adrian
The situation is much worse than we thought
Satnam quiets his little son
It is the boy we saw earlier with his toy ship
/  - Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House, papers in hand
Sir, the President needs to know this
Helmsley, how long have you been on the job as science advisor
Four months this week
would   say that's enough time to learn that we   have rules here
You'll just have to   wait until the quarterly science   briefing
If this is about what  said last night,  am truly sorry, sir
So you didn't like my speech
Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him
Can you please have a look at this, sir
It's really important

Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts to walk away, reading
Suddenly he slows down
Who wrote this
An Indian astrophysicist  graduated with from Harvard and Prof
West, the preeminent geologist in the
Who else knows about it
No one, sir
Let's keep it that way, Helmsley

President Wilson looks over to the Russian Colleague
Mr

Oh no
Not again

He throws some clothes and a toothbrush in a bag
His cell phone rings

What do you mean

It's not even 10:30
Jackson turns off the  and darts towards the door, stopping only to slide his laptop into a knapsack
As he turns, he stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'
(') Damn it
(into the phone) Kate, 'm on my way
For god's sake
Frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits
We hold on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on their back covers
' /  - The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door, struggling to pack his old  with camping equipment
They're kids, Kate, going on vacation
It's not a doctor's appointment
it's supposed to be fun
You remember that, right
Fun
He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead
Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel

(
) If you have a funny `mini-quake' story you wanna share, call Lisa & Randy at 1-800
Jackson switches the radio off
Two kids , 10, and , 7, come running down the driveway
They slow down, as they see the limo
Jackson, what is this
() 12
Don't call me Jackson, Noah, 'm your father
Lilly yells from inside the limo
(
) Noah
Look
Daddy's got Space-Busters in the car

Awesome
Their mother,  , 32, a beautiful woman appears
So what, you're a chauffeur now

This is better hours for me

Of course
Kate's new boyfriend,  , 43, pulls out of the garage in his Porsche wearing his Bluetooth
(on the phone) Simone, how many times have  told you, we don't do Lipo on Fridays
It's too messy
Jackson smiles bitterly
Gordon waves at the kids
(') Have fun guys
And watch out for those bears

Jackson waves grudgingly as Gordon pulls away
Noah needs to read twenty pages from his book each day
She follows Jackson to the car with a bag of pull-up diapers

Yes unfortunately  am Harry

You should at least go see him

Why
Do you see your boy
Not as much as 'd like
is a long way
But at least we talk
What about
Life, how short it is
Suddenly they're thrown off balance by a large swell that pulls the massive `Freedom of the Seas' away from the landing, about ten yards
The next moment, the ship slams back against the dock with an earthshaking
What the hell was that

Luckily nobody is injured

They may be listening to us too
Laura the Heritage Foundation is a sham

The art you collected, it's not in the Alps
The Peugeot enters a tunnel

huge blast rips through the tunnel as his car explodes

Noah sits in the back with headphones on playing Space-Busters 2
As they pass over a ridge, the music station is overpowered by a talk show filtering through
We hear a raspy and excitable voice
After what is going on in La-La- land with all those surface cracks, told myself: Get your stupid ass to Yellowstone
don't want to miss all the great fun, when it finally blows
Lilly reaches for the dial of the radio
What happened to the music
Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to this for a moment
Jackson corrects the dial to get better reception
There's been government people flying in and out all morning
And trust me, they did not look happy

Picard had been the director of the French National Museums for 24 years
As fate would have it his assassination took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died in 1997
The President comes around his desk
Laura looks at him distraught
just talked to him, Dad
He told me the world Heritage Foundation is a sham
Is that true
The President shoots an anxious look across the room
Laura turns and suddenly realizes that Adrian is standing in the corner
(') You knew too
You sleep with me and you didn't say anything
Adrian looks ashamed
(') can't even look at you
Either of you

Honey, calm down
man was killed

Right now

We hear Lilly before we see her
(
) Daddy, where are we going
To a very special place, Lil'bee
It's a lake
place where mommy and daddy fell in love
(winking to Noah) Remember the book  gave you
don't want to know where you and mom had sex
'm not ready for that, Jackson
'm your dad, Noah
(
) Daddy
Jackson runs to catch up with Lilly who has reached a fence with a `keep out' sign posted
This wasn't here before
Jackson starts to climb the fence
Don't you see the signs
It's fine guys
/   - Jackson and his kids crest a ridge
They look down on a parched basin with cracked terrain
() 18
It's gone
The whole darn lake is gone
swear you guys there was a lake here
The kids roll their eyes
/   - puddle of water is all that remains of the lake
Jackson and the kids walk into the basin, unaware of being watched Jackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to have a closer look
Elsewhere in the lake bed, we see sand seeping through in the ground
(
) Jackson
When he looks up, he sees heavily armed soldiers coming towards them from all sides
It's okay, Noh'
Through the , we see Jackson and his kids arrested and led over a ridge
With this we reveal an    with hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling tower

West exit the drilling tower, both studying papers
Adrian notices Jackson and his kids nearby, being interrogated by an

Adrian walks towards them
Jackson stares at the officer with defiance
And then you climbed over a posted fence
Just like that
told you
() 19
Isn't this supposed to be a National Park
There shouldn't be fences
What are you guys doing around here anyway
(
) We're geologists
Jackson turns and sees Adrian standing there
(') 'll handle this officer
Thank you
The officer reluctantly hands him Jackson's license
So, where did the lake go
That's what we're trying to find out
We think this whole area has become potentially unstable
would advise you to take your kids and leave, Mr
He throws a look at Jackson's drivers license
(') Curtis
He looks up at Jackson with renewed interest
(') Are you by any chance the Jackson Curtis, the author of `Farewell Atlantis'
() Yeah, that's me
Jackson straightens up proudly
Lilly smiles
What a coincidence
'm reading your book, as we speak
first third, around day 300, when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space
You're one of lucky 422 who bought it
Actually  didn't buy it
My father gave it to me

Oh,  see
Prof
West waves at Adrian from one of the container labs
Adrian hands back Jackson his drivers license
Officer, can you return them to the campgrounds, please
(to Jackson) Pleasure to meet you, Mr
Curtis
Jackson and his kids look after Adrian hurrying away
He was very nice
Yes he was, Lil'bee
/   - Jackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when suddenly  , 62, a crazy looking guy with binoculars around his neck, stands in their way
What did the government guys tell you
Jackson looks at him, instinctively picking up Lilly
They think it's not such a good idea to climb over their fences
They feel the area is unstable
Charlie bursts out laughing
Unstable
Ha-ha
They say its unstable
That's funny
With this he turns around and leaves
/   - Jackson is sitting on a camp chair, right outside the tent
He's on his laptop, looking enquiringly at an aerial picture of Yellowstone on Google earth
In the background we see the kids are in the tent
() 21
There are mosquitos in here
Did anybody spray the tent
Jackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray
We'll get some of that tomorrow
For tonight just put your head under the blankie
Daddy you said you weren't gonna work on your book
'm not Honey,  promise
Are you wearing your pull-ups
Lilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed
He kisses her good night
He turns and is surprised to see Noah typing a text on his cell phone
(') Did mommy buy you that
No
Gordon gave it to me for my birthday
Jackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands
Noah
Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family
() What family
Jackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping Sucks

Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone
Go to sleep guys

The base packs up
Adrian and Prof
West duck low as they board a chopper
Adrian is on the phone
You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser
The readings look much worse than  expected

(') Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from India confirm
We hear Anheuser, yelling
(
) But you guys said
We were wrong

But he can't concentrate on writing after what Noah has said
chopper flies overhead
Jackson follows it's path over the campsite and his eyes fall on an American flag fluttering on top of a massive radio antennae
This belongs to an  truck
Through the 's window, Jackson sees the silhouette of Charlie Frost, the guy with the binoculars, speaking into a microphone
Curious, Jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial
(Charlie's voice) We have a listener calling in
Bill from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie Frost Show
(Bill's voice) wanted to know, where will this all start
Jackson is intrigued
He puts his laptop down
(') (Charlie's voice) Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood, Ha-Ha
But seriously, they've got the earth cracking under their asses already, Bill
Jackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the

This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the world's largest active volcano
Charlie is about to take a bite of his sandwich, when there's a knock on the door
Jackson sticks his head in
Hi
Mind if  join you
only got a few minutes
Charlie bites into his sandwich as Jackson looks around at all the equipment
just heard part of your broadcast
Mind me asking a question
What exactly is it
that will start in Hollywood

What are you talking about
The apocalypse, the end of days

Charlie clicks on his laptop

crudely animated film starts to play
Charlie narrates on screen in an overly dramatic fashion
' In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold
Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years
Just imagine the earth as an Orange
Charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange
'  (') our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, that the core of the earth will melt - that's the inside part of the Orange, leaving the crust of our planet free to shift
On screen the middle of the orange shrinks, now the skin moves freely around it

Hapgood named it `Earth Crust Displacement'
faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen

The infamous photo of Einstein, sticking out his tongue

The film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with water
Charlie shuts the laptop
(') Pretty neat, huh
It's a big hit on YouTube
did the animation myself
() know what you're thinking
But all the governments know about this
If they all knew, don't you think somebody would tell us
() 25
They can't
Just think about it
First the stockmarket would crash
Charlie opens a can of beer
Phsssh
(') Then the economy
boom
The dollar
boom
And then the people in the streets
(mimicking gun fire) Boom, boom
Pandemonium, revolution, war
They would never tell us
Beer
Jackson shakes his head still struggling to digest this
(') Only if you're some Sheik, Bill Gates, or maybe one of those Russian billionaires do you stand a chance to buy a seat
seat
() They're building spaceships, man
Oh
see
No really
One of my listeners, a geography professor at , has even figured out where they're building them
He sent me a map
Well
Charlie,  think  gotta go
My kids are sleeping
Charlie looks at him bug eyed
Get them out of Yellowstone, man
It's gonna get ugly here
Night, Charlie
As Jackson exits, Charlie gets back on the air

Sorry for the delay, folks
But even in times like these, a man has got to eat

Kate and her boyfriend Gordon are shopping late
She picks up some pull-ups for Lilly, Gordon steps up behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist
Why don't we make a baby
He reaches up and touches her breasts
Stop it
We're in public
Gordon lets go of her with mock disappointment
Honey,  created them
And now suddenly can't touch them
Kate pushes him away and moves on
few customers are paying at the checkout stand
: Huge glass windows reveal cars slowly sliding into the ever widening crack in the parking lot
Nobody inside notices
Gordon catches up with Kate
(') You always act strange after he shows up
Just because  don't care for your arrogant humor doesn't mean 'm acting strange
He is the father of my kids
() 27
Maybe biologically
Can  remind you what that guy did
First you gave up med school to have Noah
Then you practically raise him and Lilly by yourself while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk
Some of his stuff is actually
He's published Gordon
() Yeah, published
You know your mother was right
You've always been drawn to guys with lofty dreams and empty pockets
But not this time right, sweetheart
Kate smiles awkwardly and picks up a can of soup
The shelf in front of her shakes for a moment
Did you see that
See what
Kate slowly puts the cans of soup into her cart and looks around
Gordon senses a problem between them
(') You know Kate, we have to keep working at this
our relationship
Because won't end up being just a re-run of you and Jackson
() mean Honey,  feel like
something is pulling us apart
Before Gordon finishes his sentence-- violent
From front to back, the entire supermarket rips open right between Kate and Gordon
The few customers scream in horror at the sight of the huge crevasse forming beneath them
Kate and Gordon are thrown up against opposite aisles holding on for dear life
They cling to the columns as the shelves fold into the ever widening crack

Just stop scratching
You'll get them infected
He smiles at the female cashier behind the counter who does not look friendly

Adrian steps up and gathers himself
Anheuser watches

Pointing to a set of charts

How much time do we have, Mr
Helmsley
Adrian glances to Professor West, standing in the back
Two, maybe three days if we're lucky
The Prime Minister of Italy breaks in, upset
How can you speak about luck in such a situation
Apologies Prime minster

(') No matter who is hitting us
No matter how hard
First Round
The fight is on
(') Now, go kill the bastard
() 32
Yuri walks to his seat, sitting down next to his trophy: , 28, blonde, wears the shortest mini one can imagine, designer shoes, handbag, glasses and boobs
In her lap she holds , a tiny dog wearing a diamond collar
In the ring the boxers maul at each other
Yuri's cell phone beeps
It's a text message: Yuri's whole demeanor changes
Without a word, he gets up and walks out of the arena
Yuri bear
where are you going
Yuri does not respond as he squeezes through the crowd
Zultan, the boxer, notices Yuri leave
In that split second distraction, he is hit  and goes down for the count
The crowd
: /  - Jackson has driven all night
The sun rises, a giant glowing orb
(
) Caltech believes that the incident in the Westwood supermarket has released most of the surface tension
' /  - Jackson pulls up
The kids are asleep
(
) It looks like life in the city will soon be back to normal, Mayor Gonzales said at an early morning news conference from his home in Hancock Park
Jackson switches off the radio and wakes his kids gently
Lilly, we're home sweetie
(to Noah) Wake up big man
() 33
Kate heads to the car
Still sleepy, the kids grab their stuff and run into her arms
Oh honey, 'm so glad you're back
And you too, darling
We tried calling but - (
) 'm hungry Mummy
At least it looks like the Mosquitos ate well
She looks at Jackson and softens
(') Wanna come in
Gordon appears at the door
Jackson watches painfully as Noah runs and gives Gordon a big hug
His cellphone beeps with a message
(
) Where are you Curtis
/  - Yuri stands at a huge window overlooking the strip talking into his phone
(
) Back in Westwood, Mister Karpov
Good
That is good
'm sending the Gulfstream to pick up Alec and Oleg
Tamara hovers in the background packing her Louis Vuitton luggage
Caesar, her little dog, watches from the bed
(in Russian) Tell him to bring Caesar's raincoat, it's in the Range Rover
Yuri brushes her off
34
/  - While talking to Yuri, Jackson is standing in front of the open trunk, changing into his chauffeur suit
(
) Curtis, make sure you get my boys as fast you can
/  - palatial home
Completely gaudy
The twins,  and , wait impatiently
They are 12 years old and wear identical clothing by Dior
Curtis, you are late
Jackson ignores him and starts throwing the luggage into the limo
The other twin notices his muddy sneakers
Careful with our stuff
Don't get it dirty
/  - Ahead of the limo a crowd has formed in the streets, singing songs and chanting about the end of days
with a ponytail preaches from the scriptures
There will be famines, pestilences and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord
Jackson has to maneuver through the people
Banners read: `Prepare for the End'-- 'You cannot escape his judgement'-- Alec looks up from his video game, annoyed
Curtis, can't you go faster
Are you guys blind
can't run people over
Why not
They're idiots anyway
Jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look
35
/  - Jackson stops in front of the Gulfstream
, 40, Yuri's Russian pilot is expecting them
Hey Jackson
Took you a while
Jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage, dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose
Ouch
Be more careful
The other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions
He gets into his face
Now you're laughing, Curtis
But we are going on a big ship
() We will live
and you will die
Oleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes
The Gulfstream taxis onto the runway
As Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots across the tarmac
We hold on his face as it hits him like a ton of bricks: ,
Frantically Jackson looks around and spots a  in overalls working on a twin engine Cessna
He runs to him
Where can  rent a plane
The man points to a shabby office building
: /  - Kate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids
Gordon watches the Governor on the news
(with Austrian ) just this morning my people at Caltech told me that in the last 36 hours we had basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California, which is very rare
() 36
The phone rings
Kate picks up
/  - Jackson drives like crazy
Kate, we have to get out of
've rented a plane for us
Get the kids ready
'll be there in five
The kids have plans today
Are you kidding me
No 'm not
Noah has music at 2 and Lil' has Karate
Gordon rolls his eyes and mutters
Not that we'd expect him to remember
() California is going down
Pack up the kids
You're crazy
The Governor just said we're fine now
The Governor's a meathead, how would he know anything
Kate listen
You gotta trust me over some politician
Come on
' /  - Kate slams the phone down
Lilly stops eating
Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy
Because your daddy is a lunatic, darling
On the , the interview comes to an end
() 37
it looks to me, like the worst is over
That moment a   hits Los Angeles
Everybody dives under the table
: The news casters and the Governor do the same
few seconds later the signal cuts out
Gordon pulls Kate and the kids close as the earth shakes violently for 20 seconds
' /  - Jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house
' /  - When he enters, Lilly immediately runs into his arms
The next tremor hits
Cracks form on the kitchen floor
We have to leave
Noah, let's go
think we're safer here
Noah, now
Kate please
The whole house rides up and down like on a wave
think he's right
Finally Kate pushes her son out from under the table
They all scramble out of the house in a panic
Kate is cut on the shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices
' /  - As they storm out of their front door the house crumbles behind them
Get in the car
The whole street starts to buckle
Left and right the houses are shaken and smashed like toys
() 38
Just before the wave of destruction can reach them, Jackson tears out of the driveway
/  - Jackson maneuver's the limo through the crumbling neighborhood
Right in front of their eyes, streets disappear, trees fall, electrical lines snap
Sewer pipes burst in front of the car
Holy shit
Jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers
/  - The limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac, coming to a stop in front of a twin engine Cessna
Damn it
Where's the pilot
Kate turns to Gordon
Gordon, you know how to fly
had a couple lessons
Did you cover taking off
Yeah
That's good enough for me
They start running, when Jackson remembers something and heads back to the Limo
He grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his laptop back inside it
Kate shouts
(
) Jackson, what are you doing
'm coming
He jumps out of the car and races back after them
Behind Jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate
() 39
gigantic fissure forms in the earth, shooting towards Santa Monica airport
Gordon fumbles with the controls, Jackson yells from the copilot seat
(') Come on, come on
(pointing at the ) But 'm supposed to check all these first
Jackson reaches over and slams Gordon's hand down and the plane lurches forward
As the Cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes down and explodes
Noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them
Guys, behind us
As the plane accelerates, the giant crack closes in on them
Gordon's hand trembles on the throttle control
Everybody screams on top of each other
Gordon
Damn it
Lift off
Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever
The plane almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them gives way
They hover for a moment, almost caught in mid-air as the widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the bowels of the earth
Gordon fights to maintain control but they begin to be pulled down
The daylight vanishes
Debris and mud smashes into the plane from all sides
The canyon walls erupt
can't get it up
Taking desperate measures, Gordon nearly rips the control stick out of its joint - with a lurch the Cessna lifts out of the abyss
() 40
They all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown Los Angeles
Like a roller coaster, Gordon manages to weave the little plane through the tumbling high rises
They dive one last time to evade the plummeting , the tallest building on the west coast
All are dead silent as they watch the whole of Los Angeles crumble beneath them
Kate covers Lilly's eyes
(in total shock) That was amazing, Gordon
Jackson looks at Kate and notices her cut
Are you okay
(brushing it off) 'm fine
How did you know this was gonna happen
didn't
(To Gordon) Do we have enough fuel to make it to Yellowstone
The plane veers off in a northeasterly direction
Behind them the destruction of Los Angeles continues
: / - The gigantic cruise ship plows through the Pacific
We hear lounge music
/    - Adrian's father Harry and his partner Tony are on stage
Harry on the piano, singing, Tony playing the bass
waiter brings drinks
Water for Harry, and a brightly colored cocktail for Tony
You got fans Tony
() 41
Tony raises his glass to two old ladies who are sitting at the bar
(') There's a call for you Harry
Want me to take a message
(while still playing) 'll be right there
The waiter nods
few more bars of music, then applause
(') (into the microphone) Thank you ladies and gentlemen
Let's hear it for the one and only Tony Delgado
And 'm Harry Helmsley and we'll be back after a short pit stop
Applause
Harry rushes off stage
(
) Dad
what  have to tell you is very serious
/  - Adrian is standing in a dark corner
Behind him people are packing up, carrying boxes
You remember when  told you about the dam in China
Well, it's happening much sooner than we anticipated
/  - Harry's face has turned serious
(
) The President has ordered us to clear out the White House
Hah
About time someone cleaned up that mess
/  - Adrian fights back the tears
() 42
Where are you, dad
What exactly is the course of the `Freedom' right now
(
) It's all good, Adrian
Don't worry about your old man
You have more important things to do now
/  - There's a tremor in Harry's voice
You know, your mom and , we had a hell of a great life
and a hell of a great kid too
() And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship you know
Don't write your old man off, just yet
/  - tear runs down Adrian's face
(
) Besides,  could never leave Tony alone
You know how he can't keep decent time by himself
Pause
love you, dad
/  - Harry bites his lip
Love you too, son
/  - Back in the lounge, Tony has finished his cocktail
Harry walks up and hollers at the barkeeper
Hey Herb
Get me a double Jack on the rocks
() 43
After twenty-five years on the wagon
Why not
Who cares how long we do certain things
How long we drink booze, how long we talk to people
Or how long we don't talk to people
Harry grabs Tony by his shirt
Woah
Harry, what's the matter with you
Let's go
We're back on
Harry pulls him even closer
Call your kid, you stubborn old ass
() 'm not going back on that stage unless you promise to call him
() Tony, the ladies are waiting for you
Promise me, Tony
please
Harry stares him down
Yeah, maybe  should call him
Harry smiles, downs his bourbon and walks back on stage
: ' /  - Adrian enters his office
The  is on
There is little we know at this point, but the earthquake registered at 10
1 on the Richter scale
The whole of the Western seaboard was hit
Assistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief, some of them are crying
Prof
West appears at the door
(pointing at the ) Have you seen this
() 44
Prof
West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him down the hall into a dark control room
They look at a wall- sized high def monitor
We have satellite images
Here's the sequence we've got so far
On the monitors, detailed satellite imagery displays how the monstrous quake unfolds, leaving California sliding into the sea
Any news from Yellowstone
Anytime now
: /   - The base is abandoned but for a few structures and the enormous drilling tower
Gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a fueling station
Jackson leaps out checking the pump
Guys, there's fuel
Fill her up and 'll look for Charlie
You're sure about this
Kate, everything this guy said so far has happened
'll be right back
Jackson runs off towards the hills
Daddy wait
wanna come with you
Lilly runs after him
Jackson picks her up
Lilly
Come back
It's fine
'll take her
Kate watches as they disappear, worried
Noah and Gordon have started to fuel the plane
45
' /   - Jackson and Lilly find Charlie's  with it's door hanging open
They enter
The key is in the ignition
The radio transmitters are on, but Charlie is gone
Jackson fiddles with the switches and Charlie's voice comes on
' am standing here at the highest point on what is the rim of this super volcano
He's got to be close by, Lil'bee
Jackson jumps behind the wheel and turns the ignition
Let's go back, Daddy
Listen to me
We have to find Charlie
He's got a secret map, you know, like Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'
That catches her interest
(') Lil', we have to work as a team now, okay
You have to help me
Jackson passes her his mobile phone
Lilly nods
He throws the  into gear and they speed off over the bumpy terrain
In their dust, we see the earth fissuring
/   - Jackson drives like a bat out of hell
' The last time this baby blew, was 640,000 years ago
Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart
Jackson tears up the mountain looking for Charlie
/   - Kate's phone rings
() 46
(
) Hi mommy
Where are you, honey
/   - Jackson hears the stress in Kate's voice
He hisses at Lilly
Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes
() We're looking for a secret map, mommy
Jackson grimaces
/   - Kate tries to keep it together for Lilly
Let me speak to your daddy, darling
(
) Daddy can't talk right now, he's driving really fast
/   - The  runs over a boulder
Lilly hits the roof
Ouch
(
) In the background Kate hears the voice of Charlie Frost
' tell you guys, any minute now
any minute the fireworks will start
(
) Who's in the car with you
Who's that man screaming
He's not in the car
He's on a mountain waiting for fireworks
() 47
Lilly spots Charlie way up on a ridge
He has erected his ten foot radio antenna with the flag fluttering on top
(') (to Jackson) There he is
Up there
You're the best, darling
Give Daddy the phone
(into the phone) Kate  am sorry,  can't talk
The road ends just below the mountain peak
(
) Bring back my child, Jackson
Jackson sees Charlie up above, broadcasting
He hangs up the phone and jumps out of the
You wait here for me
You watch the ship while Captain Curtis talks to the pirate
Okay
() Okay
Jackson climbs up to Charlie
/   - Charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body
The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind
(into his mic) wish you guys at home could see this on
He notices Jackson and muffles the microphone
(') How did you make it up here
Thought you were toast
The spaceships Charlie, where are they
You can't make it there
() 48
We have a plane
We can get you out of here too
Let's go Charlie
All around the landscape begins to collapse
three mile crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super- volcano
You'll never make it out in time
Just stay and enjoy the big bang
That your kid
Jackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at Charlie with her big brown eyes
Jackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground
Where is that god damn map
Easy, easy
Watch the mic
don't know
Somewhere in my camper
low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as tear into flight
(') Wow
Look at that
(into his mic) Fly birdies fly
This marks the last day of the United States of America folks and by tomorrow
The mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing molten lava underneath
(') the last of mankind
Soon they'll see us from a million miles away, out there in the milky way
Jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the mountain
/   - Jackson and Lilly jump into the  and races off, with Charlie's broadcast still playing
' The ash cloud will travel everywhere
() () 49
'  (') First the lights will go out in Vegas, then Dallas, St
Louis and then Washington
Jackson's cell phone rings and he picks up
We're on our way
/   - Jackson, things are really looking bad here
In that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked from the landscape into a vacuum
At least in the last 640,000 years
To them, all this occurs in total silence
The sound of the eruption has not reached them yet
They are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening
/   - The explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom
it's beautiful, kids
Just beautiful
The sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground
/   - The  flies over the rugged terrain
Everywhere the earth is cracking, falling apart
Jackson struggles to swerve around the disappearing landscape
() It's following us
Lilly has discovered the expanding   behind them
Just don't look back, Lil'bee
The  sound envelopes them
On the radio, the voice of Charlie is getting shrill
() 50
' Majestic
Oh yeah
/   - Charlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the cloud of dust and fire towering above him
Flaming rocks fly towards him
When they hit the ground, they detonate like fire bombs
' Oh baby
It's coming
/   - Rocks plummet like comets around the  as Jackson races over a collapsing bridge
On the radio, in his delirious state, Charlie begins to sing
' `This is the end, my friend'
Yellowstone looks like a war zone
The  dodges the bombardment of fire and rock
/   - Huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through the ashes
He screams at the top of his lungs
Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie
second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a scythe through the air
It decapitates Charlie in an instant
/   - The radio cuts out
The forest and the camp grounds are mown flat by the extreme force of the
In the rear view mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them
firebomb hits the , ripping half the roof off
Lilly barely makes it under the dashboard
() 51
(') Stay down there, Lil'
We're almost there
Just keep looking at daddy
Jackson spots the little Cessna in the distance
/   - At the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms, cutting the  off from reaching the plane
Lilly sticks out her head
Mommy
Jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack, sending Lilly flying out
Without thinking, he lets go of the wheel, lunging after her and pulling her back inside
Stay down darling
Jackson races the  alongside the forming crack
Spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision
Slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full speed
Moments later the  is airborne
Kate watches, too shocked to scream
few drawn out seconds
Then the  touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane
Kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper
Lilly jumps out, racing into her mom's arms
Jackson turns and sees the cloud approaching
(') You guys go
'll be right there
Kate pulls Lilly back to the plane
Jackson jumps into the back of the  scavenging through the shelves, looking for Charlie's map
Kate lifts Lilly onto the wing of the plane
Gordon revs up the engines
Give me your hand, Lil'
Noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit
() 52
Fiery rocks rain from the sky, detonating to the right and left of their plane as Kate climbs in
We have to take off
No
Where's daddy
Kate, 'm sorry but if we wait we'll all die
Gordon pushes the throttle
The plane starts to move
Kate screams
Gordon
Wait
Back in the , Jackson is frantically going through the masses of books and papers on the shelves
Finally, a map
He unfolds it
But it's only of the London underground system
He throws it to the ground and finds another
This time he's lucky
There are markings everywhere
As he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the
Kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight
(') Noah begins to cry and Lilly clings to her mom
Gordon just stares, paralyzed
The   is almost upon them
Gordon takes action and accelerates the plane
Kate turns back
hand emerges from the crevasse
Then another, holding a map
Her face lights up
It's daddy
Jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them, the map in his hand
Jackson
Here
Kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him
() 53
Faster Dad
You can make it
Kate, grab him for god sake
We're almost out of runway
Using every last ounce of energy, Jackson leaps onto the wing and is yanked into the plane by Kate
Just at that moment, the plane lifts off
Jackson falls into the cockpit, completely out of breath
Lilly crawls over and hugs him
Thanks for waiting guys
Now all eyes are glued to the speedometer
180
190
The violent   is hitting their tail rudder
The plane swerves wildly
Gordon gets it back under control
The speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the slowly falls back
Everybody breathes a sigh of relief
So, now that you got your map, where are we going
Jackson unfolds it and takes a look
Hundreds of markings clutter the map
In the left corner he discovers a large letter  followed by  -  -  -
He looks up
We're gonna need a bigger plane
: /  - The White House is being evacuated
Amidst the chaos stands Anheuser
Adrian puts down a phone and looks at him
Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone erupted, sir
The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly 7 hours
Maybe 6
We have strong easterly winds
And the crustal displacement
() 54
No one knows, sir
Anheuser starts walking, Adrian trails behind
Let's get the government airborne and
mean now
/  - Anheuser and Adrian burst into the Anteroom of the Oval Office
The President's secretary, , 55, is packing
Where is the President, Sally
Sally looks up stone faced
He said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone
think he's over at the chapel
The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church
Adrian shoots an angry look at Anheuser
He's praying sir
Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea
Maybe
But right now  need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One
Wheels up 1900 hours
Can  leave that with you Helmsley
Anheuser walks away
Adrian and Sally exchange a look
really don't like that man
/  - Adrian finds the President standing near the front of the chapel
Mr
President
We need to get you out of Washington immediately
() 55
President Wilson stays with his head bowed
Now matter how idealistic you are taking office
You lose your innocence behind that desk
() Laura was right
People have died because of the decisions  made
That's not your fault sir
He turns to face Adrian
You sound like Anheuser
This quietly affects Adrian
(') Laura's never looked at me like that before
Only once
When  told her, her mother had died
You knew the first lady
little
You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital
() `Tommy
think you should do a lottery
Every one should have a chance to go'
That's what Dorothy said to me
That's what we should have done
There would have been chaos, sir
President Wilson looks Adrian in the eyes
You know what  believe, Adrian believe nature should choose for itself, from itself
Adrian takes this in
(') Don't let her go
You'll regret it if you do
Prove to Laura what kind of a man you are
And 'll do the same
You go now
And watch your back for Anheuser
() 56
Adrian stares at the President in disbelief
But sir
Go
That's an order Helmsley
tense moment before Adrian starts to walk away
Just as he exits the chapel, Wilson calls after him
(') Would you tell my daughter
there's nothing on earth that  cherish more than her
We hold on President Wilson's face
: - Most of Las Vegas is destroyed
200 foot wide canyon now divides sin city along its famous strip
The towering casinos still teeter along the canyon's rim
All forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around the city
In the , we see Las Vegas International Airport, its runway cut dramatically short
Large pieces of tarmac continue to break off into the crevasse
/   - Gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos
Airplanes are strewn about the runway
Passengers everywhere
told you we should have gone to my parents' in the Rockies
Gordon's right
Look at this mess
Jackson looks around frantically
You don't understand, it's our only chance
() 57
This isn't one of your crazy stories now
How the hell are we gonna make it to China
Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never have made it out of California
Silence
Noah is right and they know it
They taxi past a private jet whose front wheel is stuck in a hole in the tarmac
We hear a dog barking and the  finds Tamara, with Caesar in her arms
(
) Careful with the landing gear
(in Russian) Tamara, get the boys out of the way
An airport tow truck attempts to pull Yuri's Gulfstream jet out
Sasha, the pilot, helps
safety announcement echoes through the whole area
(over loudspeaker) Attention
The  National Guard has informed us, that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed towards the city of Las Vegas
Tamara looks scared and secretly reaches for Sasha's hand
They share an intimate look, no one else sees
(') We strongly advise every one to move indoors immediately
The tow truck driver panics and runs inside
We move in on Yuri
For the first time he looks helpless
In the background, Jackson and his family join the panicked crowd heading towards the terminal building
Firemen and rescue workers usher them forward
Let's move people
Inside the terminal
Jackson and his family are swept along
: 58
/  - Adrian rushes up the stairs of Air Force One, approaching one of the flight officers
Where's Anheuser
In the command center, sir
Adrian moves on
/   - Adrian enters
Anheuser immediately senses something is amiss
The President is not coming
couldn't convince him to
Everyone in the room looks up, speechless
So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship
() Well, Mr
Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta
Adrian is shocked
What about the Speaker of the House
In this chaos
have no idea
But she's Commander In Chief now
Sir, just think - Anheuser moves in dangerously close
don't care what you think, Helmsley
Laura quietly enters the Command Center, as Anheuser and Adrian stare each other down
() 59
(') Your ass only made it into the White House, because your old man knew the First Lady
and because of all that affirmative action bullshit
Anheuser takes it even further
(') There was a white kid, much more qualified than you
Just so you know
Adrian's face is ashen
(
) Where is my father
Everyone turns to Laura
Silence
He wanted to stay with his people
Suddenly, the engines of Air Force One turn over
Laura panics
We have to go back
Adrian tries to hold her close to him
Anheuser sees this intimate moment and gives a suspicious, questioning look second later Laura pushes Adrian away
(') Let me get out
Mr
Anheuser - tell the Captain
There is a protocol for just this situation Ms
Wilson and 'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter
Anheuser turns to an officer
(') Tell the Captain, to take off immediately
Laura looks at him incredulously
: /   - Emergency lights illuminate the densely populated terminal
() 60
People, stay away from the windows
One of the rescue workers yells, pushing Jackson and his family back
Frustrated, Jackson turns to Kate and Gordon
We can't get stuck here
Suddenly a voice
(
) Dr
Silberman
What are you doing here
They all turn and stare at Tamara, holding her little dog against her plump breasts
Kate gives Gordon a look
() She's a patient, honey
() Nice work
But when Jackson discovers Yuri behind her, his tone suddenly changes
He gets in Yuri's face
(') You bastard
You knew it all along
(at the twins) You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours
Sasha comes running in and cuts through this
found us a plane, an Antonov
They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them
Can you still fly that thing
Sure
But  need a copilot
Lilly chimes in
Gordon is a pilot
() 61
Before Gordon can protest Jackson picks up Lilly
Let's go
They burst through the emergency exit, setting off an alarm
Emergency personnel yell after them
Hey
Stop
You can't go out there
Come back
But they keep on running
Sasha now leads the way
/   - They race around the corner and come to a halt
Before them, a Russian freight plane of enormous size-- The  225, the biggest aircraft in the world
Wow, that is a big plane
() It's Russian
Sasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees: moving towards the airport
Guys, follow me
They all run after him up the stairs
/ - Sasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while readying the plane for takeoff
(into the mic) You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold
/ - (
) Sit down and buckle up
They all scramble to get into their seats
() 62
Wow
Look at those
They discover the cargo they are carrying-- Sports cars, 's, concept cars and luxury models, some of them are labeled `Las Vegas Auto Show 2012'
We had  tickets for that
The six engines of the Antonov come roaring to life
/ - The plane is starting to move
Gordon sits uncomfortably in the copilot's seat
You check the main bus for the hydraulics
'll balance the tanks
Uh
What
Sasha reaches over and does it himself
Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay
Gordon nods and puts on the headset, trying to focus
/   - People start , when they discover the menacing racing towards them
Move back, people
down on the floor
/   - The nose of the Antonov turns onto the runway
This humongous plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash
/ - Gordon is panicking
We have to get going
() 63
Sasha hits the throttle
() We're going, we're going
deafening  emanates from the engines
/ - Everybody grabs their seat as the vibration of the aircraft builds
/   - The Antonov steadily gains speed as it rumbles down the cracked and uneven runway
The canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead
And behind them the volcanic cloud bears down
/ - Sasha stares down the gap ahead, determined
Gordon's face is as white as a sheet
We're not gonna make it
Shut up
We will
/   - The violent cloud has finally reached the airport
The terminals are hit by flying debris
Seconds later, Yuri's Gulfstream is whipped through the air, shattering the huge windows into a thousand pieces
People are thrown like rag dolls as the jet explodes in a massive fireball
/ - Kate and Jackson hold their kids tight
Tamara clings to little Caesar and Yuri to his twins

/   - The Antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off on the horizon
The runway is way too short
And to make matters worse, the ground begins to move again, slowly arching the tarmac upwards, creating a crooked ramp at the end of it
/   - drop of sweat trickles down Sasha's forehead as he pulls back the wheel
Gordon holds on for dear life as the huge plane barely lifts off, veering sideways
/  - The Antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling casino towers along the other side of the rim
/ - (shit)
Help me pull
Gordon grabs the wheel on his side, helping Sasha pull up the beast of a plane
/  - Very slowly the plane starts to rise and Sasha's face lights up
They barely make it over a casino called `Paris; Las Vegas'
But the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure right behind it, ripping away part of the landing gear
/ - After some struggle, Sasha manages to steady the Antonov
Gordon's face is green as he looks back
Was that the Eiffel Tower
Sasha looks over and grins
He grabs the microphone

Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way to China

In the distance, the sun glistens off the peaks of the Himalayas
, a young monk, 20, sits with his superior and teacher   , 65
They have tea beneath a huge bronze bell
(in Chinese) Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it, Neng
But Lin is my brother
He is working inside the big tunnels, where the ships are made
The Lama remains silent
(') What is in your wisdom for us to do, great Lama
if Lin is right, if our world is indeed coming to an end
Instead of answering, the Lama serves him more tea
When the cup is full, the Lama doesn't stop pouring
Neng watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain himself
(') It's full, great Lama
It can hold no more
The Lama stops pouring and looks at Neng
Like this cup, Neng, you are full of your own opinions and speculations
How can  show you wisdom unless you first empty your cup
Neng bows his head in embarrassment
The Lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his neck
On it hangs a set of rusty car keys
() 66
(') Be careful with the clutch
It tends to slide
The Lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them, smiling from ear to ear
They bow to each other and Neng runs off
Lama Yak La looks after him as a father would
He gets up and strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet
/ - As far as you can see is a series of identical little houses
The house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden
Mrs
Pang enters the coop
We last saw her when the village was being evacuated
She grabs one of the hens
She places its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet
Just about to strike, she hears a strange  noise
An old truck comes driving towards the house
Behind the wheel sits her son Neng
She puts down the hatchet, yelling
(in Chinese) Bata
Neng is coming
The young monk jumps out, quickly bowing
Mother,  got a message from Lin
He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at the west gate
He says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on
Mrs
Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat
thought Lin is working on the dam
The dam is a ship, Mother
The government lied to us
There will be a big flood
The chicken hangs limp in Mrs
Pang's hand
Not here in the mountains
Let's eat first
The hen panics as she puts its head back on the block, raising the hatchet again
() 67
No mother
We must pack up right away
' We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry once
Your father was throwing up the whole way
The door opens and Mr
Pang appears
Neng,  did not know you were coming for dinner
At that moment the hatchet drops with a
: /   - The majestic Antonov is flying high in the Pacific skies
(
) Look, the new Bentley
/ - The boys are exploring the huge freight deck
Caesar, the little dog, is traipsing along
Alec, Oleg and Noah marvel at a stylish mixture of luxury and performance cars
Our dad had one on order
We were supposed to get it next year
But then he cancelled it again, because of the ships
Noah points to a 2012 Aston Martin parked further back
If  was rich, 'd get one of those
We have one
How many cars does your family have
My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a Carrera 4
() 68
Our parents are divorced too
The boys share a moment of understanding
Nothing we can do about that
Noah reaches for the door of the Bentley
To his surprise, it opens
(') Wow

Noah jumps into the car
(
) Be careful, Noh'
Kate and Lilly are still belted in next to Tamara
Jackson and Yuri sit on the other side of the Antonov
How did you meet Dr
Silberman
He's great, isn't he
think for the same reasons you did
You know, after breast feeding two kids
Kate looks at Tamara
(') Did your husband ask you to get your's done
We are not married
And we probably never will
But he paid for them
bet he did
They laugh
What did the man pay for mommy
Nothing, Lil'bee
Kate looks over at Jackson who's trying to make sense of Charlie's map
Tamara catches her looking
() 69
What's your situation
Kate lets out a sigh
Way too complicated
On the other side of the plane, Yuri has been watching the two women talk
They seem to like each other
guess
So tell me Mr
Karpov - how much did you pay
One billion euro, per seat
That's disgusting
You know Curtis,  wasn't always businessman
am a boxer
Was my only playing when  was a boy, back in Murmansk
My coach
() his name also Yuri
He always said: `Someone wants to beat you
he has to kill you first'
Yuri puts his hand on Jackson's shoulder
(') What would you have done, if you rich like me
Just look at your gorgeous kids
And call me Yuri
Yuri offers his hand but Jackson doesn't shake it
Sasha's voice comes over the radio
(
) Hi guys
The plan is to refuel in Hawaii
So, buckle up
Gordon and will do the rest
/ - Gordon turns to Sasha
() 70
Let's get this straight, Sasha
'm not a pilot
'm a plastic surgeon
just took some lessons to overcome my fear of flying
Why did you give up
It didn't work
Gordon points to the declining altimeter
(') What about the wheels we lost at take- off
There's 14 on each side
Some of them must still be there
With that, Sasha commences the landing procedure
/  - The Antonov dives into a thick layer of clouds
(
) Still nothing from the tower
/ - Gordon shakes his head
The two pilots stare ahead watching as the clouds slowly change color, from yellow
to orange
They stare out the window in disbelief
/ - Gordon comes climbing down the metal ladder whispering to Jackson and Yuri
Guys, you really oughta take a look at this
Jackson and Yuri follow Gordon back into the cockpit
The women exchange a worried glance
71
/ - When Jackson and Yuri enter, they don't believe their eyes
What is that
The State of Hawaii
Not good
That is not good
/  - From above we watch as the Antonov flies over an endless ocean of fiery red lava
The Islands of Hawaii have turned into one big volcano
/ - How much fuel do we have
Not enough
We'll have to make a water landing somewhere in the South China Sea
At least we won't need our landing gear
Yuri wonders
What about it
We lost it all
in Vegas
/  - The damaged landing gear slowly retracts into the vast belly of the Antonov as it veers off to the east
: /   - Adrian knocks quietly and sticks his head around the door
Laura is sitting in her father's chair
() 72
Can  come in
've got nothing to say to you
But  do
Adrian enters
He has his travel bag in one hand
He looks at Laura and gathers himself
(') Your Dad and
we were trying to protect you
() 'm a big girl Adrian
don't need protection
You used me
You guys had me gallivanting around the world, as part of your little cover-up
But you were doing a good job
Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or Picasso
But if you're some young talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're not famous enough
People like you and Anheuser and my father - you think you can play God
Adrian takes a moment, he's desperate to make her see
You know what your father believed
That nature will choose itself from itself
That's bullshit and you know it
It's the fittest, the richest and the strongest that survive
That's not true
Adrian glances down and spots Jackson's book poking out of his bag
() 73
(') What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane
Zero
What's your point
Adrian pulls out the book from his bag
He shows her
It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read
It's part of our legacy now
Laura takes this in
The plane's intercom cuts through the moment
(
) Mr
Helmsley, Prof
West requests your presence immediately
Adrian takes a breath, but before he leaves - What if  tried to sort some of this mess out
need to know you can forgive me
Laura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope
need to know that too, Adrian
Adrian moves for the door
He stops
One more thing
Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world
You are to me too
As Adrian exits, we hold on Laura's conflicted face

Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone
ten inch layer of ash lies on the ground
The gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts

He walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can
An old African-American  holds a crying young girl
President Wilson kneels down to her
She can't find her mother
Why don't you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch
'll see what can do
The child nods
The President gets up
Sally, can you take care of them
'll go check with the Red Cross
As he leaves, the old lady looks up at Sally and smiles
No wonder the First Lady fell for him
knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before the President, when she was still singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry Helmsley
know, she was amazing
/  - The President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the front lawn
He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers
Who can help me with missing persons
Without looking up, the young guy responds
Sorry man, 'm busy right now
He then recognizes who he's talking to
(') mean, of course sir
didn't realize
What can  do for you, Mr
President
The President pats him on the shoulder
() 75
Don't worry about it
You're doing a great job son
deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place
As it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure himself
He looks out over Washington
His eyes grow wide
The National Mall bends like rubber
The towering Washington Monument breaks into pieces
An even more deafening sound makes him turn-- The Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up by earth's incredible force
As the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown to the ground
: /   - All the officers and scientists are glued to monitors that show satellite images from all over the globe
Adrian and Prof
West stare in disbelief
The capitol was hit by a 9

Laura enters the command center unnoticed
We lost communication with the White House, sir
She stands there frozen, emotionless
She looks over to Anheuser, who is shouting orders
Another officer hands him a phone
#2 President Makarenko for you sir
He's just entered Chinese air space
Anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers
That's affirmative, Mr
President
Until communication is restored,  am in command
Adrian and Laura look to each other baffled

(') It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action

Peter's Basilica

Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him
They all are praying

People look around frightened
In the distance we hear
/ - few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under Michelangelo's famous fresco
Most prominent above them is `The Creation of Adam'
The cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies
crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through God touching the finger of Adam
Then the whole fresco breaks apart
' / - The people in St
Peter's square begin to panic-- The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air
We hold on the Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto the fleeing masses

His parents huddle in the back of the pick-up
The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he slides the clutch and downshifts
As the vehicle slows on the steep incline, the vibrations become much worse
Neng worries that the truck may be breaking down
He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise the steering wheel continues to vibrate
Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking violently

Rocks fall all around them

Kate opens the passenger door and gets in
Couldn't sleep huh
Me neither
Anything
Nothing, just static
Not even an emergency signal

Jackson switches off the radio
(') wanted to thank you
For coming back for us
() 78
couldn't have left you
Silence
They both look out through the front windshield at Lilly and Noah curled up together
Do you think people change
By `people' are we talking about me
Do you think you've changed since we separated
Well  certainly eat a lot more cereal now
You know, you always had tunnel vision
You could always just block things out and write
You blocked all of us out Jackson
He thinks about this and can't help asking
Do you love him
Gordon
love him enough
Kate gets out of the car and shuts the door
He watches her go

Anheuser looks relieved
Then the big news hits
#1 The crust has begun to shift, Prof
West
By what degree
() 79
#1 1
2 percent, but still moving
Any clue what to expect next, Professor
Once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt, we expect the formation of tidal waves, sir
proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes
Adrian looks distressed as he turns to one of the officers
Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard
Laura notices Adrian's concern
#2 We've recorded two quakes averaging 8

Anheuser sees this and his suspicions about them are confirmed
cold little smile appears on his face

Harry has just entered and stands near the back of the room
with bad acne searches for an available channel that is still broadcasting
He finds a news program with lousy reception
Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit
Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water
The signal gets weaker
Harry watches Tony slowly stand up
As he turns to his friend, his knees begin to buckle
His face is pale

But  never got through

'm so sorry
Tony only stares back at him
Behind them, the  rolls to the side, as the whole room begins to tilt
Harry grabs on to the door frame, as the passengers along with Tony fall like dominoes

As the ship rolls to the side, Harry finds himself hanging from the door frame now 20 feet off the ground
He's barely able to pull himself up and roll onto the middle deck
/  - On his back, Harry is shocked to see the star field and the moon shifting across the sky
An eerie sound fills the air
gigantic swell has formed off to his right
It's a mountain of water
Harry turns to see another gargantuan swell close in from the other side of the `Freedom of the Seas'

The 2,000-year-old towers lie on the desert ground
Hundreds of believers have gathered to pray towards Mecca
As they raise their hands to heaven in unison, they slow their motion and the chanting dissipates
They stare into the distance not knowing if what they see is reality or only a mirage
monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering towards them

#2 The only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming
At least some good news
Anheuser turns to Adrian
(') Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment
We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent
The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours
He nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of commands
(') and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction
Here's the computer simulation

Everybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to planet Earth

Anheuser looks at the monitor, then turns to Adrian
So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that
the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin
Silence
Adrian clears his throat
It's the south pole, sir
An   goes off-- : / - red light blinks on the plane's instrument panel
(
) What's that
Engine failure
Two of six are down
We must get ready
Yuri and Jackson are standing behind the pilots
Let's go wake up the kids
Yuri nods and they make their way back to the lower deck
/ - Jackson's family are all asleep in their seats, Lilly in her mom's lap
She looks like a little angel
Jackson can't bear to wake them
He caresses Lilly's face
(
) Why do you hate Gordon
Jackson turns to see Noah is awake
() 83
What are you talking about
don't hate Gordon
But you don't like him either
don't know him that well
But  know him
He's really nice
You should talk to him more often
You guys would get along really well
This breaks Jackson's heart
He pulls Noah tightly to his chest
'll give it a try, Noah
promise
Kate opens her eyes
Is it time
Jackson nods
(') Wake up Lil'bee
We're getting ready to land
On the opposite side of the aircraft, Yuri and Tamara help the twins get into their life vests
Noah is suspicious
What's wrong
Jackson looks at his kids
They both look scared
Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy
and wet
The Antonov jerks to the side
Two more engines out
Alarm signals flash
- The remaining two engines barely hold the plane in the air as it dives into the clouds

/ - Jackson and his family huddle together
He puts his arms around Lilly and Noah
Your daddy has to tell you something
In the background, Gordon climbs down from the cockpit
He is about to speak when he hears Jackson's voice
(') know that with my writing and work didn't have a lot of time for you both
Jackson glances at Kate
(') wasn't there for you, the way should have been
Jackson looks Kate directly in the eyes
(') And  am so very sorry for that
Gordon watches as Kate pulls the kids and Jackson tight
For the first time, they seem a little like the family they once were
(
) Jackson, Yuri
think you guys should come back up here
/ - First Jackson and then Yuri enter the cockpit
Sasha points out of the window
Don't ask me how that happened
Behind them Yuri and Jackson stare at the snow covered mountains of the Himalayas
(') There's no more ocean, and it looks like we're pretty close to where we wanted to go
It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles

No shit

Prof
Hapgood, 1958
Jackson brims with joy

Drain the brake fluids
It's going to get rocky

The Antonov is extremely close to the glacier's surface
Jackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens
Everyone screams in panic
They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from Caesar
Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and clearly

The motor revs to life
Yuri looks at Jackson

He yells at Gordon
Your turn Gordon
Go
Make sure that they make it out of here before  touch down
What about you
'll be fine

Gordon hesitates
(') What are you waiting for

Sasha nods at him reassuringly
Gordon bolts out

The Bentley roars

) Push it Curtis
We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon
Noah turns and sees Gordon
Tamara
Open the door
Gordon jumps in
Tamara yells at him in desperation
Where's Sasha
He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down
Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit
Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing
Daaadddy
The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane
As it hits the snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers
The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold
They barrel past the Bentley like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions
The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart
Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the deep
The plane crashes and explodes
88
/ - As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow
The Bentley is half buried
We hear Caesar barking

) Everybody okay back there

) We're all fine
The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around
Just above the wind, he hears the
One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a surreal sight-- Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the mountain pass
, ,   hang by huge straps from these flying machines
One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet and lands near the Bentley
Armed soldiers jump out
Their Commander speaks to them in a sharp tone
Welcome to the People's Republic of China
Jackson nods to them
Thank you
(to Lilly and Noah) Say thank you, kids
The others acknowledge the soldiers as well
Hi
Hello
What color are your passes
Jackson stands dumbfounded
The Commander repeats
(') What color are your boarding passes
Still no answer
He yells an order
The soldiers point their guns at them

) have green card
Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green plastic cards
(') For my boys and me
Tamara can't believe what she's hearing
It's a joke
a mistake
() Right Yuri
Yuri shrugs
Tamara lunges at him
(') (in Russian) You disgust me
You pig
Yuri brushes her off, coldly
And then speaks so they can all understand him
You think  did not know about you and Sasha
May god rest that poor bastard's soul
With that Yuri turns to the others
(') am sorry guys
Good luck
And Jackson remember, if someone wants to beat you
he has to kill you first
Come boys
The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter
The dog barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara
The next moment, the helicopter takes off
What
Did that just happen
They're stranded

After you
Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper
Captain Michaels helps Laura in
Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door slides shut and it lifts off

My sincerest condolences Dr
Wilson, for your father
Laura's look thanks him for this
He turns to Anheuser

We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted
Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance

() 91
In front of every gate there is a line of huge `' shaped metal support structures, which are the launching towers for the ships
They are each at least 800 feet high
It's an unparalleled feat of engineering
/   - The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting
The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out
Laura follows
She looks around in awe
Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are immense
The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain
In the  we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with military personnel, waving his tickets
What do mean we can't board Number 4 want to speak to your supervisor
am the supervisor
Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements
want your name
(pointing to his ) Can you read
Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or 'll have you detained
The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar
They look afraid
: /  - Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape
They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a scree field
It is hard going
Jackson carries Lilly
Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart
You're doing great
() 92
Kate holds Noah by the hand
Gordon and Tamara trail behind
She's still very upset
should have listened to you, Dr
Silberman
actually liked the way looked before that monster talked me into it
Did you know he asked for a discount
and he paid in installments
Cheap bastard
You're better off without him
What he said about you and Sasha, is it true
Tamara nods silently
Now that he's gone  think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri
Suddenly they hear the  of an engine
You guys hear that
In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the dirt road
Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it
/   - Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of dust just as Jackson reaches the road
(out of breath) Hey
Help
Wait for us
But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck
Jackson, pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road
(') Shit
Shit
Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck, turns and sees his tantrum
She bangs on the rear window of the cabin
Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes
Jackson can't believe his luck
() 93
The others show up and they all run towards the truck
: /  - Anheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous arks
Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe-- Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the ship, readying it for launch
Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the  we met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his huge family
Laura points down at the workers
Captain Michaels
What happens to all those people
The Captain doesn't know what to say
Anheuser turns
Dr
Wilson, there's a protocol for all that
You just stick to your art
We'll handle the rest
Laura hates him in that moment
(') Captain
Where is the Bridge
Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals we saw being airlifted over the mountains
(
) Dr
Wilson
Your cabin is this way
Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward
: /    - Thousands are on the march up the mountains
Behind them a valley stretches into the horizon
Plumes of smoke rise from destroyed cities in the distance

Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young astrophysicist, holding his little son
The rest of Satnam's family trails behind
Distant   pierce the silent march, coming from the cities below
People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there frozen
He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a number on its speed dial
/  - Adrian is unpacking
He lays down his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings
Satnam
() Where are you
(
) On the Nampan Plateau
Adrian's face goes pale
What
There's a tidal wave coming from the East
It's huge
Satnam, what happened
(
) We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came
Adrian closes his eyes
/    - Satnam swallows hard
He stares out into the valley
have to go
wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards him
tidal wave of gigantic height
Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation
But for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance
() 95
He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child
/  - Adrian hears  on the phone and the deafening sound of the approaching wave
He tenses up, desperate but unable to do anything
As the noise reaches its height, the line goes dead
Adrian is left breathless
/  - Adrian storms onto the bridge
Many officers and analysts are at work under Captain Michaels
Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India
One moment, sir
Anheuser and Prof
West step over and join him
Helmsley, what's going on here
Looks like our model was wrong
They all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves coming in from the south
(') Satnam was talking about a wave from the East
science officer selects a different quadrant on the satellite display
They all stare at the new tidal wave that's coming from the East of the Cho Ming valley
Jesus
Anheuser is shocked
What does this mean
() 96
The flooding will happen earlier
Bobby, can you plug in the new data please
As the officer does this, Prof
West looks at Adrian with questioning eyes
(') Satnam didn't get picked up
Prof
West is horrified
(
) Ready sir
Adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave that is coming towards the Cho Ming valley
This one is at least 1500    meters high
Talk to me Helmsley
What does this mean for us
Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down
Every one on the bridge stares at a display
It reads-- 02hrs - 09min - 07sec The science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display changes to-- 00hrs - 28min - 10sec
and counting
We see the shock on Anheuser's face
Get me the other Heads of State
: /   - Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up to the service entrance of the launch site
lone figure awaits them
This is Neng's older brother Lin, who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'
Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck
() 97
(in Chinese) Who are they
Neng answers hesitantly
We found them by the side of the road, my brother
You must send them back
am a follower of the great Lama Yak La
You know  cannot do that
The others watch the interaction but do not understand
Jackson senses a problem
He grabs Lilly and Noah
Come with daddy
Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin with his kids
(') At least take our children with you
Please
Lin answers in broken English
Why should  do that
For the same reason you sent for your parents
Lin stares at him stone faced
In desperation, Kate turns to Mrs
Pang
have no clue if you understand what 'm saying, but  ask you as a mother, please take my kids with you
Silence
beat
The old Chinese lady turns to Lin
(in Chinese) We are all children of this earth
My plan will not work for so many, mother
() 98
She looks up at her son, determined
We will take them all
Bata
Mr
Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to follow
Kate bows to Mrs
Pang
Thank you ma'am
Thank you so much
Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done
: /  - We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains
Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other
Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the Seas'
However, they look more like spaceships than anything, having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force of nature
But only three of these monstrous  are complete
Number 4 is being repaired, all the others are still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding
Suddenly  goes off
The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to retract
There's growing confusion among the thousands of workers and security personnel
,  /  - Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers
They watch as massive stern gates begin to close
Yuri jumps up and yells to the others
They're leaving without us
The soldier from earlier points his gun at him
What did  tell you
Caesar barks at the guy
() 99
() Look
Idiot
They are leaving you behind too
The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out
He grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates
All the other passengers surge forward with him
In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of Cho Ming Valley
: /  - Lin leads his group over a ridge
In front of their eyes-- The gates to the mountain open
(in Chinese) We have to hurry
(to Jackson) They launch
We run out of time
They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the many -shaped launch structures towering in front of the gates
Neng and Kate help Mr
and Mrs
Pang down the rocky terrain
/  - screeching and thundering noise
on metal girders connecting the -shaped launch towers
/  - Laura feels a jolt
She rushes out of her small cabin and into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless corridor
She struggles to fight her way through
digital voice blares over the speakers
Countdown to departure
Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds
Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers
() 100
Where can  find Adrian Helmsley
He's in the Technical Command Centre
Follow me
/   - The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the open
Support helicopters swarm around them like flies
/- - Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal ladders of one of the launch towers
/  - Verbal commands fly back and forth
Anheuser watches the preparations from a large window
He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as they continue to be pulled into place
/  - We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command posts
/  - hatch opens at the top of the launch tower
Lin is the first to climb out
Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly creeps towards him
He's but a speck against this man-made behemoth
Lin hastily pulls the others up
(in Chinese) Faster, Neng
Help father
Mother, give me your hand
It's a race against time
The huge ship's hull closes in fast
Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson hurries to pull up the rest of the group
Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship
() 101
Move Lil'bee
Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time
In a frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are already huddled on a small platform
As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from their faces, Mr
Pang loses his balance
Jackson and Lin both see this, but Jackson is closer-- He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to his death
For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod
/   - The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their final launching position
mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the ship
More and more people join them, including soldiers
/  - Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform
The sound of   makes them turn
The storming masses have arrived at the access platform
There is now a huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships
() Oh my god, that's Yuri
Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar
She yells
(') Caesar
/   - The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms, leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the platform with the launching towers
Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs them by their necks
Let that stupid dog go
() 102
He's panicked
The arriving masses are pushing them to the drop off at the edge of the platform
/  - The ship has reached its targeted position
small hatch lines up directly in front of Lin and his group
(in Chinese) Okay
Now
One by one they all climb into the hatch
Jackson being the last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back
Tamara
Come on
Get in
She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog darting towards her
/   - The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys
Passengers on either side tumble off the platform
Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a tiny ledge 8 feet below
To his right, he sees a small ladder leading down
(in Russian) Down there
Oleg, you go first
As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the deep
Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running towards Tamara
Daddy look, Tamara
Yuri cannot believe his eyes
/   - The hatch behind Tamara begins to move
The hydraulic supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel
Caesar darling
Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch
() 103
Tamara
Get in
Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns
Come to mommy
Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch seals
As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives Yuri the finger
/  - Lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the hydraulics for the tail gate are located
He opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power drill, almost too big to be carried by one person
Lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew the huge bolts
He looks at Jackson
need your help
/  - Laura and the Science Officer enter the Technical Command Center
She finds Adrian staring at a wall of monitors showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms
People are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their desperation to board the ship
What in god's name is happening Adrian
Anheuser convinced them all to launch
Outside, panicking workers, screaming for their life
Deserted passengers waving their green cards
Adrian makes a decision and rushes out
/  - Anheuser turns hearing Adrian storming onto the bridge
Anheuser
We have to stop this madness
() 104
With that, Adrian turns to the Communication Officer
(') Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this
The officer hesitates as Laura enters in the background
What do you think you're doing
know exactly what 'm doing
(To Bobby) Turn it on
Bobby flicks a switch
Adrian's voice echoes through all the ships
(') This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson
/  - The German Chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the bridge of the European Ship
Can you please turn up the volume, Mr
Hoffmann
Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers
(
) know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions
to save our human civilization
/  - Anheuser looks on stoney faced
But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life
If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here
Ask yourselves
Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die
Laura watches him proudly
() 105
(') civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive
() Or at least  don't want to be part of it
Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm
We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by
Officer switch that off
The Communications Officer looks at Adrian
(') That's an order soldier
Don't do it
/  - The Russian President, together with the heads of state from China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds
(
) We have to open our gates and let these people in
All of them
/  - Anheuser has had enough
Have you lost your mind
Look at the countdown
We have less than five minutes left
And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people
If you save them today we all starve tomorrow
He's almost screaming now
(') Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race
Can you handle that, Adrian
Silence
Adrian's battle seems lost
But he doesn't give up, and instead speaks softly now
() 106
There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance
He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots
We all owe him our lives
All eyes are glued to Adrian
(') just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India
You know why
Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues
(') He died because we forgot to pick him up
() beg you
whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty
What will you tell your children
and their children
Silence
Laura steps up alongside Adrian
If my father were here, he would open the gates
Adrian and Laura share a look
(
) The people of Russia along with
/  - His Asian colleagues nod in approval
China and Japan agree to open the gates
/  - The German Chancellor speaks up
The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and  believe  can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister
107
/  - (
) We vote to open the gates
Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat
Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief
Adrian turns to the Captain
Captain Michaels, you heard them
/   - One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships begin to creek open
The masses gathered on the platform  wildly
/  - Lilly crawls through the   meeting up with Kate in a large bay on the other side
Phew
It stinks in here
Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in -- Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them
Caesar barks at her
Sssh
Caesar
second later, hundreds of different
They are in the zoological bay
/  - Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the connecting tunnel
Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the begin to
Lin looks up in panic
He screams
They're opening the gate
It will crush us
The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them
From down below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it
() 108
Noah
Watch out
Gordon makes a split second decision
With all his strength, he shoves the boy into the tunnel
/  - From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him off the ladder
No
/  - Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him
He survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the sloping surface, but he can't
He slips
Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look with Jackson before he dies
/  - Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel
Something happened, mom
Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly
She fights back the tears
/  - Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their remaining space is shrinking every second
We have to stop it
Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall
As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to slow down
109
/  - Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge boarding gate lowers towards them
They are trapped
Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be crushed
/  - Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill
Suddenly he slips
Jackson manages to catch his fall
But in the process Lin's foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it
He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a halt
You did it, man
You did it
In great pain, Lin grins back at him
/   - The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a thundering noise
People begin to rush on board
/  - Alarm signals go off
The Captain turns to one of his officers
What's wrong with the gate
don't know
Maybe there's something jamming it, sir
The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min
40 sec
Laura and Adrian share a worried look
We hear a   ring
: / - Lama Yak La rings the large bronze bell of his monastery
() 110
The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley
As a gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up-- tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains
The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is wiped clean from the earth
: /  - The technicians desperately try to figure out what's wrong
An officer waves Adrian over
Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay
Can you zoom in
The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly
Adrian can't believe his eyes
He turns to Laura
(') know those kids
Remember the book told you about
Their father wrote it
Captain Michaels shouts across the room
We're loaded
We can close the gates sir
Do it
Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown
It reads 1:34 /   - Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access platform onto the stern gate of the American ship
Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing his chance and lifting the first of his boys up
(in Russian) Pull yourself up
Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate
() 111
Inside the ship, officers yell
(
) To the lower decks people
The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close
Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot quite reach
Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding
Oleg
Catch your brother
Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms
Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and falls into the deep crevasse below
He makes no noise until he hits the rocks beneath
Oleg pulls his brother from above
/  - blasts
Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate
Boys, you gotta move
We wait for our father
He's still down there
The loading officer attempts to comfort them
There's no one down there
() Come on boys, come
The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly closes
But with a  sound it grinds to a halt
The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap
/  - sound
Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors
Why is the stern gate not closing
() 112
Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir
(
) Captain, over here
They race over
Adrian points to a monitor
(') think we found the problem
On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately waiting for Jackson and Lin
(') How did they get in there
They must have come through the hydraulic chamber
There
Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling along a wounded Lin
That guy is injured
Something must have gone wrong
You're damn right something went wrong
Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean
Adrian tries to ignore this
Let's get an emergency crew there right now
'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber
Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura
You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter
Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in the face
He drops to the floor, out cold
Everyone stands in stunned silence
Laura smiles
Adrian looks around
() 113
What are you all waiting for
They speed off
The countdown reads 0 min
53 sec
: / - Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming force
/   - The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn
However, the props of the American ship don't move
In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering towards them
/  - An   sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew
One of the officers explains
If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start
There's no way to override it
No sir, it has to be done manually
/  - Kate, Noah and Lilly watch as Jackson nears the end of the tunnel with Lin
Neng comforts his brother who's about to pass out
(in Chinese) Almost there, Lin
: 114
/   - All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water
They rock back and forth
Only the huge support towers they're resting on, keep them anchored
/  - new  sounds as water begins to shoot through the open stern gate of the American ship
The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec and Oleg
/  - The same  rings out in the hallways of the ship
Laura, Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor, as the vessel undulates back and forth
Water has penetrated the stern
Laura looks unsure
What now
The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time
Adrian looks at him
Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber
If we don't hurry, we won't be able to
Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on down the corridor towards the back of the boat
They follow
/  - Water is also now rushing into the Zoological Bay and only the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry
Jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious Lin
() 115
Kate shouts across to Tamara
Tamara
Take Lilly and Noah
Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with Lilly
Noah remains back with his mother
Jackson finally makes it through with Lin
Kate is almost tearful with relief to see him
(') was so worried about you
Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off
Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from the floor to the ceiling
It separates Lilly from her family
Mummy
Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late
They only catch a glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in
The water level continues to rise
-  /  - Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around
Down the corridor, in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew approaching
But between them she spots the next chamber door rising quickly
Lilly run
Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar
Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast rising door
But as she dangles from the other side, she looks down and is too scared to jump
(
) (') Lilly
Take him
Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar above the quickly narrowing gap
In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he gets crushed and together they fall to the ground
() 116
Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks around
She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in
/  - Laura picks Lilly up and comforts her
Adrian realizes they are too late
He turns to the rescue crew
Is there any way to talk to them
Lilly is close to tears
/  - The water continues to flood in as Jackson helps Neng with his unconscious brother
We have to move him higher
(looks around) Over there
Suddenly, a   throws them all off balance, pitching them into the water
/  - In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's launch towers
Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way
The other launch towers follow like dominos
The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting sideways, rudderless
/  - Chaos
Fear
Everybody holds on for dear life
/   - The vessel is swept away, over the mountain ridge
/  - Alec and Oleg scream, desperately trying to hold on as the whole ship capsizes
117
/ - The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed around by the debris and raging waters
But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up and seems to steady itself
However, the strong currents continue to force it through the mountain ranges of the Himalayas
/  - The officers try to regain some control
Moving at 34 knots, sir
What is our position
Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir
The Captain's face drops
You must be kidding
/  - The water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound for the first time
We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die
split second later Noah holds out his belt
Mum, will this do
Suddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker
(Over a speaker) Mr
Curtis
'm Adrian Helmsley
We met once before
Your daughter is with me
Kate screams with relief
() 118
Lilly
/  - Adrian is using an emergency wall intercom, with Laura next to him, holding Lilly
'm alright Mom
Caesar barks
-  /  - Tamara hears Caesar over the speaker in her compartment and smiles with relief
She is struggling to stay afloat though, and is running out of air
/  - Jackson discovers the wall speaker
He moves closer to it
(
) We can't get to you
Whatever you did, jammed the hydraulics
If you can't get it out
None of us will make it
/  - All eyes are on Adrian as he speaks
You're our only hope
Adrian looks at Laura
/  - 'll go back
'll try my best
'll go with you
You stay with Mommy
Jackson looks at Kate
() 119
(') 'll be right back
The water is up to their chest now
Jackson takes a breath and disappears underwater
/  - Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets to his feet
His nose is bleeding
He looks around him
Captain, what's happening
The Captain looks at him annoyed
What's happening
() We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr
Anheuser
Anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the window and sees the massive rock face of Mount Everest in the distance
/  - Jackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the jammed power tool, pulling at it
But it doesn't budge
-  /  - The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now and she goes under
She struggles below the surface for a moment, looking around desperately for a way out but there is none
Tamara drowns
/  - Jackson manages to find an air pocket
He fills up his lungs with air and thinks hard
As he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan
He dives under again
120
/  - Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents
Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls it tight
Lin screams
Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed, to go and help his father
/  - Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet
Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar
He begins to use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work
/  - Anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face of Mount Everest is almost upon them
/  - Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin
After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified to see that Noah is nowhere to be found
Noah
/  - Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift the drill
To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle of the crowbar
Noah is alongside him now, helping
Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to loosen it before finally the drill comes free
Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the surface
Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he spots the knapsack containing his laptop
He dives back down for it
121
/  - Noah emerges from the water
Mom, we did it
Kate pulls him to her, relieved he is safe
Noah smiles and calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker
/  - Lilly and Laura wait nervously
They hear a muffled voice
(
) We got it free
Can you hear me
We did it
Adrian leaps up when he hears this
He flicks a button on the intercom
Captain Michaels - close the gate
/  - Hearing this, the Captain yells the eagerly awaited order
That's affirmative
Close the gate
Ay, ay, Sir
/ - We hear a  sound as the tail gate finally seals
/  - Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that instead
He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles
But as he turns to swim back, his face freezes-- He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats inches from his face
122
/  - The gigantic propellers fight against the current, hitting rock at the base of the mountain
/  - The battle seems hopeless
Captain Michaels yells at the top of his lungs
Engage starboard stabilizers
One is engaged
two is engaged
number three is out, sir
The vessel scrapes against the rocks, throwing Anheuser to the floor
/ - The giant ship escapes the mountain with an inch to spare
/  - Everyone on the bridge watches in awe as Mount Everest, earth's highest peak, drifts slowly past
After a long beat, they begin to holler and cheer
/  - Kate hears the  coming from the speakers
The water level stops rising but she still looks around in panic
Noah
Where is he
Noah begins to cry
He was just behind me
Finally
Jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull of wonderful air
Kate and Noah are overjoyed
The Pangs smile to one another
Jackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes
() 123
If you would ever consider to give me another chance
promise, 'll always be there when you need me
Kate embraces him tightly
Whatever you do
will never let you go again
Noah is all smiles
2013 We hear a voice
(
) Day 988
No one is waiting for anything to happen
The  moves over the last lines of Jackson's novel
/  - Adrian sits in his cabin, his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' in his lap
and all we can hear is the sound of our   own breathing that reminds us we are   still sharing our memories, hopes and   ideas
Opposite him, Laura sits listening to him read
(') And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin
() The end
Adrian closes the book
There's a moment of silence
How many copies did you say that sold
() 124
Less than 500
(with a smile) It's what you might call a cult classic
Laura looks at him grinning
It seems we have very different tastes Mr
Helmsley
() Well that's healthy Dr
Wilson
Something we could maybe explore
unless you have other pressing engagements
Actually my diary's pretty open
The intimate moment is cut short
(
) (over loudspeaker) Mr
Helmsley to the bridge please
/  - Adrian and Laura make their way to the bridge
(
) Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Michaels speaking
In a few minutes, will be giving the orders to unseal the decks
/  - Jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other people who are gathering in anticipation
(
) Please be careful when you step out and of course
enjoy the fresh air
Jackson kneels down and zips up Lilly's jacket
She is holding Caesar, whose still wearing his diamond collar
Daddy
When can we go back home
() 125
There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee
Whatever's out there, that's our home now
Don't be scared
'm not Daddy
No more pull-ups
() That's my big girl
Jackson squeezes Lilly's shoulder
(
) Can we pet him
Lilly turns to see Yuri's boys standing next to her
Of course you can
He's your doggie
The boys both smile at her
/  - Adrian and Laura enter the bridge
You called for me, sir
Prof
West has something to show you, Mr
Helmsley
The Captain directs him to a monitor
(') Looks like your scientific projections are way off again
The Captain grins at Prof
West
The water is receding much faster than we projected, Adrian
monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however its shape changed dramatically
The image of the southern tip is enlarged
What's that
() 126
It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world
It's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal
The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded
Our European colleagues have already set course for it
Captain Michaels hands Adrian a short wave radio
(') Here, somebody wants to talk to you
Adrian curious, grabs the mic
This is Helmsley
We hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers
/    - Harry Helmsley stands beside the cruise ship's Captain
No, this is Helmsley
(
) Dad
Is that you
/  - Adrian is ecstatic
Captain Michaels explains
We should have a visual of the `Freedom of the Seas' shortly
Dad
We're coming to pick you guys up
How's Tony
/    - Harry looks over at Tony who's listening, smiling
He's fine, son
We're all fine
() 127
(
) See you guys soon
Bye dad
Harry hangs up
He picks up Tony, embracing him wildly
/  - Adrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura and kisses her on the lips
She squeals
(
) Put that woman down Helmsley
Adrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say
(') Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world
Adrian and Laura exchange a look
(') just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls
in this new world of ours
Adrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave
(') Mr
Helmsley, one more thing
Adrian turns back
(') There was no one
Pardon me
There was no white kid better than you
'm terribly sorry  said that
Anheuser puts out his hand
Adrian takes it
/  - (
) This is your Captain speaking
Standby to open Deck 1
Standing by Sir
() 128
Neng pushes his brother Lin in a wheelchair onto the deck next to his parents
Mrs
Pang turns to her husband
(in Chinese) wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars
Do not fear
Some things will never change
The old Chinese man forces a little smile
Closer to the front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah
thought you might want this
He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to him
Do you think 'll still get a signal Dad
Jackson is touched to hear him use that word
He smiles and hugs him
Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them
finally finished your book Jackson
Really
You may well be the first person who ever got to the end
Jackson looks at her, smiling playfully
Excuse me,  believe he's addressing the author
Well, what did you think
Adrian smiles
'd say
those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole
Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a burst of pressurised air
murmur goes through the crowd
Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to roll back and light streams in
() 129
The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser looks hopeful
Jackson pulls his family close as the first rays of daylight hit their faces
/    - Hatches unseal all around the ship
Sun streams through the clouds
Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of day
majestic moment
/  - They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice- covered mountain peaks
Caesar lets out a  of joy
Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's take off, flying towards a stunning site-- The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak, surrounded by calm waters
Behind it, they see the most beautiful rainbow
This is the new world
And again we hear Mozart's Adagio
