There is unrest in the Galactic Senate Several hundred solar systems under the leadership of the rebel leader, Count Dooku, have decalred their intentions to secede from the Republic
This separatist movement has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Kights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy

- The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun
Small patches of fog have still to burn off
- The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter
, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as  confers with an ,  , riding a small one man floating scooter
Order
We shall have order
The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time
Everything quiets down
The  disperses, and    steps to the podium
My esteemed colleagues, excuse me
have just received some tragic and disturbing news
Senator Amidala of the Naboo system
Has been assassinated
There is a shock silence in the vast arena
(continued) This grievous blow is especially personal to me
Before  became Chancellor,  served Amidala when she was Queen
She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet
She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life
She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy
Her death is a great loss to us all
We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom
and as a dear friend
There is a moment of silence
, the  of , moves his pod into the centre of the arena
How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends
We must confront these rebels now, and they need an army to do it
second pod moves into the centre of the area with , the Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination
We are no longer safe, under their protection
Senator    swings forward in his pod
The Republic needs more security now
Before it comes to war
Must  remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists
Peace is our objective here
not war
The  yell pro and con
tries to calm things down
, with  ,  , and , manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena
My noble colleagues,  concur with the Supreme Chancellor
At all costs, we do not want war
The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and applause
It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala
Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life
One of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered
was the target but, more importantly,  believe this security measure before you, was the target
have led the opposition to build an army
but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage
Many of the  boo and yell at
(continuing) warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow have experienced the misery of war first-hand;  do not wish to do it again
There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements
Wake up, Senators
you must wake up
If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return
Many will lose their lives
All will lose their freedom
This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic
pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision
Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war
Does anyone here want that
cannot believe they do
There is an undercurrent of booing
and groaning

My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first
That is the rule of law
looks angry and frustrated
gives her a sympathetic look
Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow
Until then, the Senate stands adjourned
- The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens
Traffic clogs the smoggy sky
'  - sits behind his desk with  -   on either side of the door
,  , --, and   sit acress from him
don't know how much longer  can hold off the vote, my friends
More and more star systems are joining the separatists
If they do break away - No
will not let that happen
But if they do, you must realise there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic
We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers
Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war
closes his eyes
Worse than war,  fear
Much worse
What
What do you sense, Master
Impossible to see
The Dark Side clouds everything
But this  am sure of - (opens his eyes) Do their duty the Jedi will

hologram of an ,  , appears on the Chancellor's desk
The loyalist committee has arrived, my Lord
Send them in
They all stand as  ,  ,  ,  , , and   ,   and    enter the office
and   move to greet the ,  taps  with his cane
With you the force is strong
young Senator
To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart
Thank you, Master Yoda
Do you have any idea who was behind the attack
Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo
don't wish to disagree but think that Count Dooku was behind it
There is a stir of surprise
You know, 'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi
He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character
-- He is a political idealist, not a murderer
In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are
gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city
Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict
It appears he has no desire to start a war
Why would he kill you
To what end
don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it
After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to Mace
Master Jedi, may  suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces
Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times
Chancellor, if  may comment, do not believe the
"situation is that serious
" No, but  do, Senator
Chancellor, please
don't want any more guards
realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with
an old friend like
Master Kenobi
nods to  , who nods back
That's possible
He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion
You must remember him, 'Lady
he watched over you during the blockade conflict
This is not necessary, Chancellor
Do it for me, 'Lady, please will rest easier
We had a big scare today
The thought of losing you is unbearable
sighs as the  get up to leave
will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, 'Lady
leans into her ear
Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics
Be mindful of your danger, Padme
Accept our help
As the  leave the office,  continues to pace behind his desk

He recognises - and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand

- It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar
Oops
Wheresa mesa manners
Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan completely forgot myself for a moment there
have had to learn Diplodiaclect
speak it like a native now
Don't really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it

(continuing) and this,  take it, is your apprentice

Oh, dear, 'm afraid 've forgotten myself again

She glances at him
- It's a great pleasure to see you again, 'Lady
It has been far too long Master Kenobi
'm so glad our paths have crossed again
but  must warn you that  think your presence here is unnecessary
- 'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons
She moves in front of Annie
(stares) My goodness you've grown
They look at each other for a long moment
(trying to be smooth) So have you
grown more beautiful,  mean
and much shorter
for a Senator,  mean
- looks disapprovingly at his apprentice
laughs and shakes her head
Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy  knew on Tatooine
This embarrasses , and he looks down
- and   smile
- Our presence will be invisible, 'Lady
am very grateful you are here, Master Kenobi
The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit
don't need more security,  need answers
want to know who is trying to kill me
- (frowning) We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation
We will find out who is trying to kill you Padme,  promise you
He's done it again
He bites his lip in frustration and shame
- gives  a dirty look
- We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner
meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course
- We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin
You will pay attention to my lead
Why
- What
Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer
Protection is a job for local security
not Jedi
It's overkill, Master
Investigation is implied in our mandate
- We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one
Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed
Now if you will excuse me  will retire
Everyone gives  a slight bow as she and  leave the room
Well,  know  feel a lot better having you here
'll have an officer on every floor and 'll be at the command centre downstairs
Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa again, Annie
Deesa bad times, bombad times
Captain Typho leaves
She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar
thought about her every day since we parted
and she's forgotten me completely
Shesa happy
Happier den mesa see-en her in longo time
- Anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again
Be mindful of your thoughts
She was glad to see us
Now lets check the security here
Yes, my master
- The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the traffic-filled sky
,  - and  walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the end
Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator
Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force
The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing
And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future
Only going through the Dark Side can we see
It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves
Do you think they are behind this
Out there, they are certainty that is
Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force
Only if he chooses to follow his destiny
There is a long silence as they walk away
Only footsteps are heard
, ' ,  - is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds
stands in the corner of the bedroom
His power is off
, ' ,  R0OM - is standing in the living room
He is in a meditative state
It is quiet
We hear   in the corridor outside the apartment
Suddenly ' eyes pop open
His eyes dart around the room
He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt
The door to the apartment slides open, and - enters
- Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs
No assassin will try that way
Any activity up here
Quiet as a tomb
don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her
- checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt
It shows a shot of  by the door, but no sign of  on the bed
- What's going on
shrugs
She covered that camera
don't think she liked me watching her
- What is she thinking
She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder
- It's not an intruder 'm worried about
There are many other ways to kill a Senator
know, but we also want to catch this assassin
Don't we, Master
- You're using her as bait
It was her idea
No harm will come to her
can sense everything going on in that room
Trust me
- It's too risky
and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice
And yours are
- Possibly
, ' ,  - As  sleeps, a   approaches outside her window
It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system
Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass
is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window
wakes up, and his lights go on
The   freezes
looks around, makes a   , then shuts down again
The   attaches a little tube to the window
-  exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping
, ' ,   - and - continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment
- You look tired
don't sleep well, anymore
- Because of your mother
don't know why  keep dreaming About her now
haven't seen her since  was little
- Dreams pass in time
'd rather dream of Padme
Just Being around her again is
intoxicating
- Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you
You've made a commitment to the Jedi order
a commitment not easily broken
and don't forget she's a politician
They're not to be trusted
She's not like the others in the Senate, Master
- It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns
and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds
Not another lecture, Master
Not on the economics of politics
It's too early in the morning
and besides, you're generalising
The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt
- Palpatine's a politician, 've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators
think he is a good man
My instincts are very positive about

He looks sharply at - - sense it, too

Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out

The  stand on their hind legs and hiss as  wakes up

The   sinks under the weight of - but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city

She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders
Stay here
, with   and , enter the room as Anakin dashes out
,  - The   sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing - to almost lose his grip
As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, - disconnects a wire on the back of the
Its power shuts off
- and the  drop like rocks
- realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back
The ' systems light up again and it takes off
-  - charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders
He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above
,  - The  bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose
It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him
It takesthe  wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as - is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the
The  heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up
When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called  , sees the  approach with - hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the
burst all around -
- have a bad feeling about this
, the  suffers a direct hit and blows up
- falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit
The  struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver,
That was wacky
almost lost you in the traffic
- What took you so long
Oh, you know, Master,  couldn't find a speeder  really liked, with an open cockpit
and with the right speed capabilities
and then you know  had to get a really gonzo color
They zoom upward in hot pursuit of  asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol
- If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman
thought  already did
- Only in your mind, my very young apprentice
Careful
Hey, easy
As this conversation is going on,  deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site
continues firing at them
Sorry,  forgot you don't like flying, Master
- don't mind flying
but what you're doing is suicide
They barely miss a commuter train Master, you know 've been flying since before  could walk
'm very good at this
- Just slow down
and the  race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks
The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings
races into a tram tunnel
- (continuing) Wait
Don't go in there
zooms into the tunnel after
They see a tram coming at them
They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport
- (continuing) You know  don't like it when you do that
Sorry, Master
Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now
turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the  off
Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid  and the
does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the
She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol
To avoid being hit by the laser bolts,  slams on the brakes and moves alongside
She now fires point-blank at -
- What are you doing
He's gonna blast me
Right - this isn't working
slides underneath Zam's speeder
They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other
The   skims over the rooftops, causing  to drop behind
goes through his gears, zooming around traffic
They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet
large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land
They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops
- That was too close
Clear that
- What
Clear the flag
We're losing power
Hurry
- leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop
The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power
- Whooooaaa
Don't do that don't  like it when you do that
So sorry, Master
They chase the   through a power refinery
- It's dangerous near those power couplings
Slow down
Don't go through there
Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass
- (continuing) Yiiii, what are you doing
Sorry, Master
- (sarcastically) Oh, that was good
That was crazy
slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as  approaches
(continuing) Ahh, damn
- Stop
No, we can make it
barely misses the  ' speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control
struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts
giant gasball shoots up, causing  to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder
- 'm crazy
'm crazy
'm crazy
But it worked
we made it
- (angrily) It didn't work
we've stalled
And you almost got us killed
think we're still alive
works to get the speeder started
It quickly races to life
- (very angrily) It was stupid
(sheepishly) could have made it
- (furious) But you didn't
And now we've lost him
Suddenly, there is an ambush
Laser bolts fire everywhere
surround them
They look up to see   take off
No we didnt
Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the  tear after
They are smoking
- slaps out the small fire on the dashboard
goes up and down, through cross-traffic
There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them
turns down and left between two buildings
pulls up and to the right - Where are you going
He went down there, the other way
This is a shortcut
think
- What do you mean, You think
What kind of shortcut
He went completely the other way
Youve lost him
Master, if we keep this chase going, that creeps gonna end up deep fried
Personally, Id very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who hes working for
- (sarcastic) Oh, so thats why were going in the wrong direction
turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up
- (continuing) Well, you lost him
Im deeply sorry, Master
looks around front and back
He spots something
He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach
(continuing) Excuse me for a moment
jumps out of the speeder
- looks down and sees Zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past
miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunters speeder
The speeder wobbles under the impact
looks up and realises what has happened
takes off, and  slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on
works his way back to the speeders cockpit, just as  stops suddenly, and  flies forward to the left front fork
shoots at him with a laser pistol
There is a  near ' hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder
slides to the right fork of the speeder, where  cant reach him
He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop
- has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder
The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic
Finally,  is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder
takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless , knocking the sword out of his hand
- races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengers seat
sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of  hand
She grabs the Jedis hand, and they struggle for the weapon
It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder
The speeder careens wildly out of control
struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive
- gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunters speeder
Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground,  pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks
goes flying into the street
- exits the crashed speeder and runs
picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street
It's the seedy underbelly of the city
Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles
It's pretty crowded with various  -,  , and the occasional group of
barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing
He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again
The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd
Ahead,  turns in through a door and disappears
nightclub sighs is flashing over the door
is just about to follow  when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters
start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him
- gets out and walks over, holding out ' lightsaber
- Anakin
She went into that club, Master
- Patience
- hands  the lightsaber
- (continuing) Here
Next time try not to lose it
Sorry, Master
reaches for the lightsaber, but - holds it back
- Jedi's saber is his most precious possession
Yes, Master
He reaches for the lightsaber, - pulls it back
- He must keep it with him at all times
know, Master
- This weapon is your life
've heard this lesson before
- finally holds out the lightsaber and  grabs it
- But, you haven't learned anything, Anakin
try, Master
- - and  enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them - Why do  think you are going to be the death of me
Don't say that Master
You're the closest thing  have to a father
love you
don't want to cause you pain
- Then why don't you listen to me
will
'll do better,  promise
- Do you see him him
think he's a she
- Then be extra careful
(nods to a room) Check it out
- goes away
Where are you going, Master
- To get a drink
- heads for the bar
blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where   look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables
- arrives at the bar
He signals the
- Somewhere in the room a  moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch
At the bar, a glass is placed in from of -
drink is poured
He lifts the glass
Wanna buy some death sticks
- looks at him
He moves his fingers slightly
- You don't want to sell me death- sticks
don't want to sell you death- sticks
- moves his fingers
- You want to go home and rethink your life
want to go home and rethink my life
He leaves
- lifts the drink and tosses it back
The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight
The   starts to move toward the bar
checks out
- signals for another drink
The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back
The drink is poured
- reaches for it
The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly - turns fast
His lightsaber flashes
There is a shrill  and '  hits the floor
The gun drops from its twitching fingers
Blood spreads
The room is silent
rise menacingly from their seats, and  is suddenly at -'s side, his lightsaber glowing
Easy
Official business
Go back to your drinks
Slowly, the  sit
Conversation resumes
Onstage,   pick up their routine
- and  lift  and carry her out
- - and  carry  into the alley and lower her to the ground
- attends to her wounded shoulder
She stares up hatefully at
She winces in pain, then nods
- Do you know who it was you were trying to kill
The Senator from Naboo
- Who hired you
glares at -
It was just a job
Tell us
That Senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake  did
- This wound's going to need treatment
Who hired you
Tell us

glares hatefully
It was a Bounty Hunter called
There is a sudden  sound

You're a good friend, Jar Jar don't wish to hold you up

Of course, 'lady
bows and goes out
As he passes , he flashes a dazzling smile
is in a very bad mood
do not like this idea of hiding
Don't worry
Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter
(frustrated) haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is decided
Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us
Pride
Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics
suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time
Sorry, 'lady

Annie
No
Please don't call me that

He becomes a little shy
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it
Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like
It's the only way we grow
Don't get me wrong
Obi-Wan is a great mentor
As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu
am truly thankful to be his apprentice
Only
although 'm a Padawan learner, in some ways
a lot of ways
'm ahead of him
'm ready for the trials
know  am
He knows it too
He believes 'm too unpredictable
Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it
know  started my training late
but he won't let me move on
That must be frustrating
It's worse
he's overly critical
He never listens
He just doesn't understand
It's not fair
cannot surpress a laugh
She shakes her head
'm sorry
You sounded exactly like that little boy  once knew, when he didn't get his way
'm not whining
'm not
just smiles at him
laughs in the background
didn't say it to hurt you
know
There is a brief silence
comes over to
Anakin
They look into each other's eyes for the first time
(continuing) Don't try to grow up too fast
am grown up
You said it yourself
looks deep into ' eyes
Please don't look at me like that
Why not
Because  can see what you're thinking
(laughing) Ahh
so, you have Jedi powers too
is watching with concern
It makes me feel uncomfortable
Sorry, 'lady
backs away as  turns and goes back to her packing
,   ,   - small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area
The spaceport is bustling with activity
Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships
The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship
It parks in the shadows of an overhang
,   ,   - and , dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where  ,  and - are waiting to hand them their luggage
is dressed to look like Senator Amidala
Be safe, m'lady
Thank you, Captain
Take good care of Dorme
the threat's on you two now
He'll be safe with me
They laugh, and  embraces her faithful handmaiden
start to weep
You'll be fine
It's not me, 'Lady
worry about you
What if they realise 'm not you
(looks to Anakin) Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is
and  smile
frowns as - pulls him aside
- Anakin, you stay put on Naboo
Do not attract any attention
Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council
Yes, Master
- (to Padme) will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, 'Lady
You'll be back here in no time
will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi
Time to go
know
gives  a last hug
picks up the luggage, and the   exit the speeder bus, where  is waiting for them
- May the Force be with you
May the Force be with you, Master
They head off toward the giant Starfreighter
Suddenly, 'm afraid
'm kinda scared too
This is my first assignment on my own
There's nothing to worry about
we have Artoo with us
The two laugh
- and   watch  and  disappear into the vastness of the spaceport with  trundling along behind them
- hope he doesn't try anything foolish
'd be more concerned about her doing something, than him
-  - The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant
It soon moves into the crowded skies
,   - From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings
- crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms
,   - - walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on
He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console
-4   comes to life
tray slides out of the console
-4 Place the subject for analysis on the sensot tray, please
- puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console
The  activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of -
- It's a toxic dart
need to know where it came from and who made it
-4 One moment, please
Diagrams and
appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed
- watches as the screen goes blank
They tray slides out
-4 (continuing) As you can see on your screen, subject weapon does not exist in any known culture
Markings cannot be identified
Probablt self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society
- Excuse me
Could you try again please
-4 Master Jedi, our records are very thorough
they cover eight percent of the galaxy
If  can't tell you where it came from, nobody can
- picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the
- Thanks for your assistance
You may not be able to figure this out, but  think  know someone who might
, The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed
,   - The great, gloomy hold is crowded with  and their belongings
To one side  is coming to the head of a food line, where  are ladling out bowls of mush
holds two bowls
Keep moving
Keep moving
slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity
With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread
sees him
(continuing) Hey
No Droids
takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line
The  shouts after him angrily
The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping  and comes to where  is sound asleep
The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare
He is very restless
No, no, Mom, no
He is sweating
leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead
He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is
simply looks at him
He stares back, somewhat confused
fills up two bowls with mush
(continuing) What
You seemed to be having a nightmare
looks at  a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets
She hands him a bowl of mush and bread
(continuing) Are you hungry
Thank you
We went into lightspeed a while ago
looks into ' eyes
look forward to seeing Naboo again
've thought about it every day since  left
It's by far the most beautiful place 've ever seen
is a little unnerved by his intense stare
You were just a little boy then
It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception
think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception
It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi
not being able to visit the places you like
or do the things you like
Or be with the people  love
Are you allowed to love thought that was forbidden for a Jedi
Attachment is forbidden
Possession is forbidden
Compassion, which  would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love
You have changed so much You haven't changed a bit
You're exactly the way  remember you in my dreams
doubt if Naboo has changed much either
It hasn't
can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills
Whenever  try to visualise the Force, those hills are what  see
looks at  when he says this
(continuing) love Naboo
There is an awkward moment
(changing the subject) Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you
Yes
left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading
don't want to lose it
Recently 've been seeing her in my dreams
vivid dreams
scary dreams
worry about her
gives  a sympathetic look
, ,   - - walks down the street
It is a pretty tough part of town
Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through
- comes to a kind of alien diner
On the steamed-up windowa it says "' " in alien lettering
He goes inside
, '  - young waitress,  , is wiping off a booth tabletop
There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window
number of  are eating - - ,   etc
looks up as - comes in
Can  help ya
- 'm looking for Dexter
' eyes narrow
Waddya want him for
- He's not in trouble
It's personal
stares at -
There is a brief pause
Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter
Someone to see ya, honey (lowering her voice) Jedi, by the looks of him
Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through
Obi-Wan
- Hey, Dex
Take a seat
Be right with ya
- sits in a booth
You want a cup of ardees
- Thank you
moves off as the door to the counter opens and   appears
He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien
Not someone to tangle with
He arrives, beaming hugely
Hey, ol' buddy
- Hey, Dex
eases himself into the seat opposite -
He can just make it
sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them
So, my friend
What can  do for ya
- You can tell me what this is
- places the dart on the table between them
' eyes widen
He puts down his mug
Well, whattaya know
picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it
(continuing) ain't seen one of these since was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim
- Do you know where it came from
grins
He puts the dart down between them
This baby belongs to them cloners
What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart
- Kamino Kyberdart
wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive
It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away
Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know
should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom
- Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we
(laughing) Kamino
doesn't sound familiar
Is it part of the Republic
No, it's beyond the Outer Rim
'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south
It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find
Those Kaminoans keep to themselves
They're cloners
Damned good ones, too
- then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them
- Cloners
Are they friendly
It depends
- On what, Dex
Dexter grins
On how good your manners are
and how big your pocketbook is
- The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed
,  and  are among the  streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area
They exit onto the main plaza
,   () - The speeder bus pulls up and stops
, , and  get out
The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side
They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard
trundles behind them
If  grew up here,  don't think 'd ever leave
(laughing) doubt that
No, really
When  started my training,  was very homesick and very lonely
This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things had to think about
The problem was, the more  thought about my Mom, the worse  felt
But would feel better if  thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers
and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls
The first time  saw the Capital,  was very young
'd never seen a waterfall before
though they were so beautiful
never dreamed one day 'd live in the palace
Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl
(laughing) No
That was the last thing thought of
My dream was to help in the "Refugee Relief Movement
" never thought of running for elected office
But the more history  studied, the more realised how much good politicians could do
So when  was eight, joined the "Apprentice Legislators", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before  knew it, was elected Queen
Partly because scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible
wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that  think back on it, 'm not sure  was old enough
'm not sure  was ready
The people you served thought you did a good job
heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office
Popular rule is not democracy, Annie
It gives the people what they want, not what they need
And, truthfully,  was relieved when my two terms were up
So were my parents
They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over
Actually,  was hoping to have a family by now
My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids
but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator,  couldn't refuse her
agree
think the Republic needs you
'm glad you chose to serve
feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways
think so too
and  walk toward the palace
continues to follow
,   - is seated on the throne, flanked by   and a
stand close by, and  are at the doors
We've been worried about you
(takes her hand) 'm so glad you're safe, Padme
Thank you, Your Highness
only Wish  could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote
Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made
How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists
About two hundred
And more are leaving the Republic every day
If the Senate votes to create an army, 'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war
It's unthinkable
There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic
Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic
Not if they feel threatened
The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves
'm sure of that
And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help
The armies of commerce
Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them
'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds
It's outrageous
After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation
Do those money mongers control everything
Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies
That's a move in the right direction
There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered
The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate
It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told
We must keep our faith in the Republic
The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it
Let's pray that day never comes
In the meantime, we must consider your own safety
signals
All the other  and  bow and leave the room
(to Anakin) What is your suggestion, Master Jedi
Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor
He's still a Padawan learner was thinking
(nettled) Hey, hold on a minute
Excuse me
was thinking  would stay in the Lake Country
There are some places up there that are very isolated
Excuse me
am in charge of security here, 'Lady
and   exchange a look
Something is going on here
Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home
know it very well
that is why we're here
think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance
(takes a deep breath) Sorry, 'Lady
(to Anakin, amused) She is right
The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo
Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain
Perfect
It's settled then
glares at
Then   gets up, and they all start to leave
(continued) Padme,  had an audience with your father yesterday
told him what was happening
He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave
your family's very worried about you
looks worred
They  exit down the main staircase
- The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity
All sorts of  are coming and going
,   - bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room
- stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face
On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity
Farther along the room in the background,   are seated at tables, studying archival material
After - studies the bust for a few moments before   , the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him
She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi
Tough as old boots and smart as a whip
Did you call for assistance
- (distracted in thought) Yes
yes,  did
He has a powerful face, doesn't he
He was one of the most brilliant Jedi  have had the privilege of knowing
- never understood why he quit
Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order
(sighs) The Lost Twenty
and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful
No one likes to talk about it
His leaving was a great loss to the Order
- What happened
Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council
much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn
- (surprised) Really
Oh, yes
They were alike in many ways
Very individual thinkers
idealists
stares at the bust (continuing He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi
He wanted to be the best
With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match
His knowledge of the Force was
unique
In the end,  think he left because he lost faith in the Republic
He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians
He always had very high expectations of government
He disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement
- Interesting
'm still not sure understand
Well, 'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson
Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi
- Yes, 'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino
It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts
Kamino
It's not a system ' familiar with
Let me see
leans over -' shoulder, looking at the screen
(continuing) Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates
- (nodding) According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere
just south of the Rishi Maze
taps the keyboard and frowns
No co-ordinates
It sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout
some old miner or Furbog trader
- All three actually
Are you sure it exists
- Absolutely
Let me do a gravitational scan
- and   studt the star map hologram
There are some inconsistencies here
Maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed
- Wouldn't that be on record
It ought to be
Unless it was very recent
(shakes her head) hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist
- That's impossible
perhaps the archives are incomplete
The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi
One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist
- stares at her, then looks back at the map
,  ,   - are passing through the little street,   are sunning themslves,  are gossipping,  are playing
,  and  turn onto a side street
is back in his Jedi robes
wear a beautiful simple dress
She stops, beaming
There's my house
starts forward;  hangs back
(continuing) What
Don't say you're shy
(untruthfully) No, but
Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils,  (age 6) and  (age 4)
They come running toward
& Aunt Padme
Aunt Padme
Ryoo
Pooja
scoops up  and  and hugs them
(continuing) 'm so happy to see you
This is Anakin
Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja
and the  say hello shyly
Then: & Artoo
As they see the droid, they hug him
and
laughs
and  go on toward the house
The  stay and play with
' ' ,   - , ' beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food
(over her shoulder) They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom
They just had a snack
They'll be fine
puts the bowl down on the table, where ,  and   (Padme's father) are coming into the room
Anakin, this is my sister, Sola
Hello, Anakin
Hello
sits, as   (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food
You're just in time for dinner hope you're hungry, Anakin
little
He's being polite, Mom
We're starving
(grinning) You came to the right place at the right time
Sit down, son
sits and starts passing food
(to Padme) Honey, it's so good to see you safe
We were so worried
gives  a dirty look
smiles as he watches
Dear
know,  know
but  had to say it
Now it's done
Well, this is exciting
Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home
(rolls her eyes) Sola
He isn't my boyfriend
He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me
bodyguard
Oh, Padme
They didn't tell us it was that serious
It's not, Mom,  promise
(glances at Jobal) Anyway, Anakin's a friend
've known him for years
Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis
They nod
(continuing) He grew up
Honey, when are you going to settle down
Haven't you had enough of that life
certainly have
Mom, 'm not in any danger
(to Anakin) Is she
Yes
'm afraid she is
(quickly) But not much
' '  - and  are walking
Sometimes  wish 'd traveled more
but  must say, 'm happy here
Padme tells me you teach at the university
(nodding) Yes, and before that,  was a builder
also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when was very young
' ' ,   - ,  and  are clearing the table
Why haven't you told us about him
What's there to talk about
He's just a boy
boy
Have you seen the way he looks at you
Sola - stop it
It's obvious he has feelings for you
Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed
'm not your baby sister, Sola
Anakin and  are friends
our relationship is strictly professional
(to Jobal) Mom, would you tell her to stop it
(laughing) Well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you
think you're afraid to
Cut it out
Sola's just concerned
we all are
Oh, Mom, you're impossible
What 'm doing is important
You've done your service, Padme
It's time you had a life of your own
You're missing so much
' '  - and  are walking in the garden
stops and faces  directly
Now tell me, son
How serious is this thing
How much danger is my daughter really in
There have been two attempts on her life
Chances are there'll be more
My Master is tracking down the assassins
'm sure he'll find out who they are
This situation, won't last long
don't want anything to happen to her
don't either
' ' , '  - throws some things into a bag
Don't worry, this won't take long
just want to get there before dark
goes on packing
looks around the room
(continuing) You still live at home
move around so much, 've never had a place of my own
Official residences have no warmth
feel good here
feel at home
never had a real home
Home was always where my Mom was
picks up a framed hologram
(continuing) Is this you
The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures
She is holding one in her arms
They are all smiling hugely
That was when  went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran
Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying
was helping to relocate the children
See that little one 'm holding
His name was 'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear
He was so full of life,
All those kids were
did everything  could to save him, but he died
they all did
They were never able to adapt
to live off their native planet
picks up another hologram
It shows  at age ten or eleven
She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators
Her expression is severe
(continuing) My first day as an Apprentice Legislator
Notice the difference
pulls a face
grins
She continues packing
sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent
,   - - walks through the main hallway to the training area
,   - - comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching  or so -- doing training exercises, supervised by
They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little   with their miniature lightsabers
The  dance in front of them
Don't think
feel
be as one with the Force
Help you, it will
(he sees Obi-Wan) Younglings - enough
visitor we have
Welcome him
The  take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers
(continuing) Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan
Welcome, Master Obi-Wan
- am sorry to disturb you, Master
What help to you, can  be
- Im looking for a planet described to me by an old friend
trust him
But the system doesnt show up on the archive maps
An interesting puzzle
Gather round the map reader, younglings
Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet
Find it, we will try
The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top
The  gather around it
- takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl
The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room
The  laugh
Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars
- walks into the display
- This is where it ought to be
but it isnt
Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot
There should be a star here
but there isnt
Most interesting
Gravitys silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared
How can this be
There is a brief pause
Then a  puts its hand up
nods
Because someone erased it from the archive memory
Thats right
Yes
Thats what happened
Someone erased it
If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away
- stares;  chuckles
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is
Uncluttered
To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will
- But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives
Thats impossible, isnt it
(frowning) Much harder to answer, that question is
,  ,   - water speeder driven by  , the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests
and  are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake
, , and  walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden
Behind them,   supervises two serving girls,  and , as they carry the bags into the Lodge
and  stop at the balustrade
looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond
looks at her silently
When  was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat
See that island
We used to swim there every day
love the water
do too
guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet
becomes aware that  is looking at her
We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us
and try to guess the names of the birds singing
dont like sand
Its coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere
Not like here
Here everythings soft
and smooth
He touches her arm
has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous
There was a very old man who lived on the island
He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass
They were magical
(looks into her eyes) Everything here is magical
You could look into the glass and see the water
The way it ripples and moves
It looked so real
but it wasnt
Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real
Real enough, anyway
They look into each other's eyes
He touches her chin
used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself
think it's true
kisses
She doesn't resist
She comes to her senses and pulls away
shouldn't have done that
'm sorry
When 'm around you, my mind is no longer my own
It's the situation
the stress
He looks at her
the view
,   - Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff
- and   stand beside it
Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger
- am concerned for my Padawan
He is not ready to be on his own
The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan
He has exceptional skills
The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan
If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force
- But he still has much to learn
And his abilities have made him
well
arrogant
realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning
the boy was too old to start the training and
- hesitates
There's something else
- Master, he should not have been given this assignment
'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator
Why
- He has a
an emotional connection with her
It's been there since he was boy
Now he's confused
distracted
- Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path
- climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter
- Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about
Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process
He could be in seclusion for days
May the force be with you
, '  - sits with his eyes closed, meditating
Silence
, , The setting sun touches the mountain peaks
The lake glows in the rose-tinted light
Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge
,   - place dessert in front of
does the same for
The dessert is some kind of fruit
picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves
She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves
She lokk up at
His eyes are on his plate
You did that
looks up - wide-eyed innocence
What
scowls at him
jabs at the fruit -  subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her
That
Now stop it
laughs
laughs
She reaches out for the fruit - it loops
(continuing) Anakin
moves his fingers
The fruit flies into his hand
'm not really supposed to do that
for fun,  mean
If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy
is pleased
He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to
She bites it out of the air and laughs
, ,   - fire blazes in the open hearth
is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames
She looks up as  arrives
She makes room for him
Brief pause
May  tell you something
don't know
Then how can  tell you
Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition
It doesn't work around you
My mind is always a muddle
can only think of you
Anakin, don't
From the moment  met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when  haven't thought of you
And now that 'm close to you again, 'm in agony
The closer  get to you, the worse it gets
The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry
feel dizzy can't breathe
'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me
My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar
You are in my very soul, tormenting me
What can  do will do anything you ask
Silence
The logs flame in the hearth
(continuing) If you are suffering as much as am, tell me
can't
We can't
It's just not possible
Anything's possible
Padme, please listen
You listen
We live in a real world
Come back to it
You're studying to become a Jedi Knight
'm a Senator
If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go
regardless of the way we feel about each other
Then you do feel something
There's an extraordinary connection between us
You can't deny that
Annie, it doesn't make any difference
Jedi aren't allowed to marry
You swore an oath, remember
You'd be expelled from the Order
will not let you give up your responsibilities
your future, for me
was destined to be a Jedi don't think  could be anything else
But you are asking me to be rational
That is something know  cannot do
wish  could wish my feelings away
but can't
am not going to give into this
'm not going to throw my life away
have more important things to do than fall in love
There is silence as they stare at the fire
is thinking
It wouldn't have to be that way
we could keep it a secret
Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to
Mt sister saw it
So did my mother
couldn't do that
Could you, Anakin
Could you live like that
Silence for a moment
No, you're right
It would destroy us
It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be
Obi-Wan's Starship flies   and heads down toward the planet
,    () - Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches
The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world
The Starfighter lands

shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain
- passes through it and goes inside
, Brilliant white light
- pushes the soaking hood from his face
Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi
- wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named
He has large, almond shaped eyes
Everything is ready
The Prime Minister expects you
- (warily) 'm expected
Of course
He is anxious to see you
After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming
Now please, this way
- masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor
Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously
,    - The door slides open
- and   enter and cross to where   rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light
May  present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino
and this is Master Jedi
- Obi-Wan Kenobi
Please
indicates a chair
- sits
hovers
The room is bathed in brilliant white light
The whole place is ultra high-tech
trust you are going to enjoy your stay
We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season
- You make me feel most welcome
And now to business
You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule
Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way
- (improvising) That is
good news
Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full
He is well,  hope
- 'm sorry Master -
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas
He's still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not
- Oh, yes
Sido-Dyas
(rising) You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself
- That's why 'm here
,   - and  are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers
At a distance, a herd of  graze contentedly
Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake
Several other lakes stretch to the horizon
The warm air is full of little floating puffballs
They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking
is picking flowers
don't know
Sure you do
you just don't want to tell me
Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me
They only work on the weak-minded
You are anything but weak-minded
All right
his name was Palo
was twelve
We were both in the Legislative Youth Program
He was a few years older then
very cute
dark curly hair
dreamy eyes
All right,  get the picture
whatever happened to him
went on to become a Queen
He went on to become an artist
Maybe he was the smart one
You really don't like politicians, do you
like two or three, but 'm not really sure about one of them
(smiling) don't think the system works
How would you have it work
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it
That is exactly what we do
The trouble is that people don't wlways agree
In fact, they hardly ever do
Then they should be made to
By whom
Who's going to make them
don't know
Someone
You
Of course not me
But someone
Someone wise
That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me
mischievious little grin creeps across his face
Well, if it works
stares at
He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile
You're making fun of me
(sarcastic) On no, 'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator
You're so bad
picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him
He catches it
throws two more pieces of fruit, and  catches them
You're always so serious
Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders
then starts to juggle the fruit
laughs and throws more fruit at him
He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head
They both laugh

starts laughing as  runs in circles, chased by the
The  crosses in front of

The  bucks, and  falls off
laughs even harder

jumps uip and runs to where  is face down in the grass
She turns him over
He is pulling a stupid face at her
She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him
He catches her arm
She struggles
They roll over in the grass
Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them
They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away
stands up and holds out his hand to her
She take it
He pulls her up
And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more
scrambles up onto the  behind
She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back
digs his heels in
The  starts forward, and they ride away
,   () - -,   and   come out onto a balcony
Below is a huge parade ground
The rain and wind are brutal
, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred
(beaming) Magnificent, aren't they
- nods slowly
,  ,  - conducts - through a large eating area
follows as they walk by    who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black
They are seated at tables, eating
We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host
As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question
- Who was the original host
bounty hunter called Jango Fett
We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself
- Where is this bounty hunter now
Oh, we keep him here
After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply
He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases
,  ,  - The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which  are climbing
Once in the tube, the  goes to sleep
Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself
Curious isn't it
- Unaltered
Pure genetic replication
No tampering with the structure to make it more docile
and no growth acceleration
- would like to meet this Jango Fett
would be most happy to arrange it, for you
bows, and leaves
,  ,  - The tour continues through a classroom filled with
- You mentioned growth acceleration
Oh yes, it's essential
Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow
Now, we can do it in half the time
Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature
- looks at the
- And these
About five years ago
,  ,  - They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which  are suspended
They're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action
- Very impressive
'd hoped you would be pleased
- gazes at the nearest embryos
- (carefully) Tell me, prime minister, when my Master Sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for
himself
or
Himself
Of course not
This army is for the Republic

We are also very much agasint this Count Dooku and his seccessionist movement
We are proud to be of help to the Republic

The door slides closed behind him

Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink

The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted

The singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out
- (
) 've never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master
No
Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi,  can assure you

) have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for
Who he is working for
discover that, you must

The hologram switches off, and - fades away

Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps
Someone's out to start a war
Inform the chancellor of this, we must
Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas, could be

The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake

He mutters to himself
Sweat forms on his forehead
He turns violently
He cries out

After a moment,  comes onto the balcony behind him
She sees he is meditating and turns to go
(eyes closed) Don't go

Your presence is soothing
Brief pause
You had a nightmare again last night
Jedi don't have nightmares
heard you
' opens his eyes and looks at her
saw my mother
saw her as clearly as  see you now
She's suffering, Padme
She is in pain
They're killing her
(getting up) know 'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator
know will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but must go
have to help her
'm sorry, Padme
don't have a choice
Annie,  told you  wouldn't let you give up your future for me
'll go with you
That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate
What about Master Obi-wan
smiles and takes his hand
guess we won't tell him, will we

They enter the Naboo Starship
, and follows them on board
The ramp retracts
drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off

Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms
,  - conducts - to the door of Jango Fett's apartment
waves his hand, and a muted bell
As they wait, - notes the door lock entry mechanism
Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy,  , looks at them
He is identical to the boys in the classroom
Boba, is your father here
There is a brief pause, then   nods
(continuing) May we see him
Sure
Another brief pause, then   steps aside, and   and - go through
,   - -,  , and   enter the apartment
- looks around the room
Dad
Taun We's here
comes in from the bedroom
He wears a jumpsuit
He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds
There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms
He eyes - with suspicion
Welcome back, Jango
Was your trip productive
Fairly
- and   size each other up
studies both of them
This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi
He's come to check on our progress
That right
' eyes fix - coldly
- Your clones are very impressive
You must be very proud
'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi
- Aren't we all
- eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor
registers -' look
He moves in front of him, blocking the view
- (continuing) Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant
Once or twice
- Recently
(eyes Obi-Wan carefully) Possibly
- Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas
Boba, close the door
moves to close the bedroom door
smiles thinly at -
(continuing) Master who
- Sido-Dyas
Isnt he the Jedi who hired you for this job
Never heard of him
was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden
- No
thought
Sido-Dyas told us to expect him
And he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would
We have kept the Jedis involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your Master requested
- Curious
Do you like your army
- It seems to me it's your army - being that they are all clones of you
(grinning) They'll do their job well, 'll guarantee that
- look forward to seeing them in action
Thank you for your time, Jango
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi
- and   go out
The door slides closed
turns to his son
He is deep in thought
What is it, Dad
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine
,     '  - The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa

stares at sights he hasn't seen for years
Finally, they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops

What can do for you
You look like a Jedi
Whatever it is

Little Annie
Naaaah
Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands  into life

Long way from here

Spray flies high and whips across the platform where - is standing
He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door
It slides open

Ahead, the corridor is deserted
He moves down it

The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure
All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone

As he runs, - draws his lightsaber from his belt
It flashes on

The Jedi deflects the shots back, but   evades them
Then he swoops down, swinging around -
As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand
The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform

He hauls himself to his feet

He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat
He punches buttons
The engines

It disappears
Lightning flashes
Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where: suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform
moment later,   grabs hold

They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below
Stay with the ship, Artoo
as  and  start down the trail toward the homestead

Master Anakin
My goodness,  can hardly believe it
And this must be Miss Padme
Hello, Threepio

Is my mother here
No, she's not

One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing
He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand

Shmi is my wife
Come on inside
We have a lot to talk about

) It was just before dawn
They came out of nowhere
hunting party of Tusekn Raiders
, ,   - , ,  and  sit around the table,  brings the drinks from the kitchen
Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos
From the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her
Those Tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters
Thirty of us went out after her
Four of us came back
Three more are still out there looking
'd be with them, only
just couldn't ride any more
until  heal
grimaces, easing his throbbing leg
(continuing) This isn't the way  wanted to meet you, son
This isn't how your mother and  planned it don't want to give up on her, but she's been gone a month
There's little hope she's lasted this long
Silence
Then  stands up
Where are you going
To find my mother
No, Annie
She's daed, son
Accept it

You are going to have to stay here
These are good people, Padme
You'll be safe
Take my speeder bike

Don't worry

Nearly there, son

Suddenly: Dad, look
On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them

They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose -
Hang on
The ship goes into a power-climb
ensues between - and
, The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing
They tumble from near misses
Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through
Finally, it seems as if - is getting the upper hand
breaks off the fight and dives sharply
He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids
In  ' ,   flinches as asteroids pass very close by
Dad
Watch out
Stay calm, son
We'll be fine
That Jedi won't be able to follow us through this
But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them
-' , his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks
Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path
There seem no way he can avoid it
- fires a couple of aerial torpedoes
They streak toward the asteroid
' , they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid
Got him
Yeahhhhh
We won't see him again

Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire
There are bodies of    lying beside the campfire
are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder
,  ( ) - rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes
In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks
Then he starts up his speeder and rides off

Somewhere close by, a night animal

She stops, listening to the animal  nearby
She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard

Short silence
Then: -3PO Please don't leave us, Miss Padme
These people need your help
is parked in a corner
'm not leaving, Threepio
just can't sleep
-3PO That's something  cannot relate to
As a Protocol Droid, 'm either active or inactive
There's no in-between
guess you're lucky
-3PO Do you really think so suppose  shouldn't expect
You're not happy here
-3PO Oh, 'm not unhappy
and my masters here ar so kind wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just
being like this
well, it's embarrassing
Being like what
-3PO Naked
If you pardon the expression
You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering
It's so humiliating
How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing
guess  wouldn't like it at all
-3PO Of course you wouldn't
Nobody would
It's simply not protocol
looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools
Maybe we can do something about it
-3PO don't think so
Only Master Annie
Why not
They seem to have a box of old coverings here
-3PO Oh
How observant of you, Miss Padme
Of course, 'm just not mechanically minded
if you see what  mean

Let's see, if we put this
here
-3PO Ooooh
That's tickles
You'll have to be quiet, Threepio
Hold still, please

His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness

He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall

He pulls himself to his feet
There are candles everywhere
shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut
By its light,  sees , hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut
He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground
Her eyes are closed
Her face is bloodied
She has been terribly beaten
Anakin cradles her tenderly
Mom
Mom
Mom

They are caked with blood
Annie
Is it you

Im here, Mom
Youre safe
Hang on
Im going to get you out of here
Im so glad
to see you, Annie
Now

Just stay with me, Mom
Im going to make you well again
Everythings going to be fine
You look so handsome
My son
my grown-up son
Im so proud of you, Annie
so proud
missed you so much

draws her to his breast
There is silence for a moment
lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms
,    - - arrives at the head of the trail
Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance
He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly
- takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes
He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below
with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view
- touches the viewfinder
Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows
Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility
Other platforms are rising to the surface
They carry  of   that step off and file into the waiting ships
fully loaded Starship takes off
- swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships
,   ,  - The pale light grows
Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air
Somewhere an dog
An   comes out of one of the huts
She carries a pail
She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground
As she goes back inside the hut, a   runs past, dragging a stick in the sand
The  runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the
Between them,  stands outside the hut door
His face is a grim mask
The  stares, then there is a    as Anakins lightsaber switches on
,   - - comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit
He settles into his seat
His   beeps a happy greeting
- switches on his comlink
- "Guiding light" to "old folks home
" ,    - line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building
, ' hologram of - flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (,  , and --) and Senators ( ,  , , and  )
and   are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern
- Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis
That's outrageous
The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army
What are they doing
- The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity
am going to go down and investigate
will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation
Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union
We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions
- One more thing
Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus
Any idea who that might be
With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be
Our missing apprentice
They are playing their hand at last
- Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army
Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are
Be careful, Obi-Wan
This investigation is becoming less than routine
Do you need help
- Let me see if  can figure out what's going on first
The hologram of - fades off
stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war
there can be no doubt of that
Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them
We must stop them soon before they're fully ready
The debate is over, we need that clone army now
Unfortunately, the debate is not over
The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack
Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up
This is a crisis
If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute
Please, please,  don't wish to have emergency powers
That's too extreme a solution
It's akin to a dictatorship
We must rely on the Jedi
Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis
and  look at one another
Two Hundred,
less or more
With all due respect for the Jedi Order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids
Patience
We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back
We don't know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it's speculation
But we must prepare for the worst
'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session
We must not wait
Out of the question, Senator
You and  are too closely aligned
The issue will become partisan and debates will begin
The proposal must come from a neutral source
If only Senator Amidala were here
steps forward from the back of the group
Supreme Chancellor
my august colleagues,  would be proud to propose the motion in question
This is a grave situation, and 'm sure Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo would agree
Thank you, Representative Binks
Silence
Then  sighs deeply
If called upon,  will serve
But it will be the saddest day of my life
, ,    - All is quiet

She goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water
, ,  - fixes the last piece of covering onto
There

They look at
He isn't the golden figure we know because  has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage
He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete
-3PO Um
How do  look
Great
You look perfect
-3PO Perfect
Oh, Miss Padme, 'm so happy
(extending his hand to shake hers) Oh, pardon me
drops his hand and bows formally
(continuing) Thank you
He forgets formality and hugs her
hugs him back, laughing
-3PO (continuing) Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
(grinning) Well, Padme,  think he should be yours from now on
know that is what my Mom would want
-3PO Oh, my
Then suddenly, from outside: (
) Come topside, everybody
He's back
He's back

Wait
ah
attack
don't

aaaggghhh
The hologram cuts off
jumps up, agitated
'm going after him
thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant
Yeah, you're right, you're right
, ,   - , ,  and  leave the homestead, waving to ,  and  as they go into the desert

is beside him
They are watching a hologram of
We will deal with Count Dooku
The most important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are
Protect the Senator at all costs
That is your priority
Understood, Master
The hologram switches off
is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel
They'll never get there in time to save him
They have to come half way across the galaxy
Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away
starts to hit buttons and flick switches
puts a hand over hers, stopping her
She stares at him
If he's still alive
Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die
He's your friend
your mentor
He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu
He gave me strict orders to stay here
He gave you strict orders to protect me
pulls her hand free and flicks more switches
The engines fire
(continuing) and 'm going to save Obi-Wan
So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along
grins and takes the controls
,    - The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away
,   - are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order
,  ,   - The   are assembled as   makes his plea
The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku's armies become
We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army
We have the authority to go now
We must go now
All of the   nod their approval
Agreed, Master Windu
Two hundred Jedi send
Enough, let's hope they are
,    - Inside the great rotunda, the  is even louder
Opposing  yell furiously at one another
Order
Order
Finally, the uproar dies
In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognises Senior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks
Amid the conflicting storm of   ,  , with   , floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space
He looks at  nervously
nods
clears his throat
Senators, dellow felagates
Laughter
Jeers
blushes
Order
The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a hearing
Comparative quiet
grips the edge of the podium
In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems,  propose that the Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor
Uproar
looks a little sheepish
(continuing) Who can deny these are exceptional times
Exceptional times demand exceptional measures
Exceptional measures demand exceptional men
We won't support a dictator
of agreement
That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with
And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned
Out ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before
Brief silence, then a rolling wave of
beams and bows
rises
It is with great reluctance that have agreed to this calling love democracy
love the Republic
The fact that this crisis is demanding  be given absolute power to tule over you is evident
But  am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process
The power you give me  will lay down when this crisis has abated,  promise you
And all  ask in return is when my current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace
We shall proceed to the vote
All those in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal ate at this time
those opposed
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis
, The Naboo Starship lands

and  are in the navigation area of the cockpit

She gets up
Hey, where are you going
To find Obi-Wan
gets up and goes over to her
No
You're not
He grabs her arm
Let go of me
'm not letting you go out there
It's too dangerous
What
It's my job to protect you
said it's too dangerous
You're not going, and that's final
Don't you give me orders, Annie
'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic
You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me
You remember your place, young man
(standing up) Now you can come along and protect me or stay here
It's up to you
storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter
stands scratching his head, then follows
and
-3PO Yes, it is, Artoo
Most confusing
One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility
Even though 'm programmed to understand them, doubt if  ever shall
a plaintive sigh
,  - and  enter the stalagmite city
They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness
(in a low voice) It's empty
They start forward
As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move
High above   grow from the pillars and detach themselves
,   - and  cross the square, reaching the middle
They stop suddenly as   grabs them
reaches for his lightsaber
Wait
carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them
The  part, and   appears
He bows courteously
Senator Amidala, 've heard so much about you
Count Dooku,  assume
'm delighted to meet you at last
We have a great deal to discuss, Senator
hope you can keep your young Jedi under control
Don't worry he's housebroken
() - sits at a large conference table with  on the far side
stands behind her with    standing behind him
stands behind  , and    stand behind him
You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan Kenobi
am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now
He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed
In just a few hours, believe
smiles
He is an officer of the Republic
You can't do that
We don't recognise the Republic here, Senator
But if Naboo were to join our Alliance,  could easily hear your plea for clemency
grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on
And if  don't join your rebellion,  assume this Jedi with me will also die
don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and  assume you want to do what's in their best interest
Aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all
Aren't you
Be honest, Senator
The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing
You believe in the same ideals we believe in
The same ideals we are striving to make prominent
If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right
The Chancellor means well, 'Lady but he is incompetent
He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no
Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed
It is time to start over
The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters
It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom
cannot believe that
will not forsake all  have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic
know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count
What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business
it's business becoming government
Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends
Without your co-operation can do nothing to stop their execution
What is to happen to me
Am  to be executed also
wouldn't think of such an offence
But, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, 'lady
It has nothing to do with politics, 'm afraid
It's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated
'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions
'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice
've done all  can for you
moves over to
'll take that weapon
hesitates
You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not escape
Anakin
hands his lightsaber over to
,    - and  are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom
Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is   , Archduke of Geonosis
He is accompanied by his underling,
Off to one side the Separatist Senators  , , and
Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries,  ,  ,  ,   and   of the Intergalactic Bank Clan
Along the wall about a   wait for a verdict
You have been charged and found guilty of Espionage
Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out
You are committing an act of war, Archduke
hope you are prepared for the consequences
laughs
simply smiles
We build weapons, Senator
that is our business
Of course we're prepared
Get on with it
Carry out the sentence
want to see her suffer
Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator
Take them to the arena
take hold of  and
They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling
- In the gloomy tunnel,  and  are tossed into an open cart
The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen
extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other
The  gets up onto his seat
Don't be afraid
'm not afraid to die
've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life
What are you talking about
love you
You love me
thought we decided not to fall in love
That we would be forced to live a lie
That it would destroy our lives
think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway
My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which have no answers
can't control it
and now  don't care truly, deeply love you, and before we die  want you to know
leans toward
By straining hard, it is just possible for their lips to meet
They kiss
have no desire to be cured of this love either
Long or short, vow to spend the rest of my life with you
They kiss again
The  cracks his whip over the  harnessed between the shafts
The cart jerks forward
Suddenly, there isa   and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena ,   - The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling
The cart trundles to the center, where - is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter
The cart stops
and  are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them
is in the center
- was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message
retransmitted it as you requested, Master
Then we decided to come and rescue you
- It looks like you're going a good job so far
Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away
There is another  as   ,  ,  ,   and  arrive in the archducal box and take their places
The felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the Sovereign System of Geonosis
Their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth
The crowd  and
In the box,    rises
The crowd becomes quiet
Let the executions begin
The crowd goes wild

From different gates around the arena,   are driven in
One is a  (bull-like), one is a  (lion-like), and one is an  (a kind of dino-lobster)
They are driven in by  carrying long spears and riding
The  poke the  toward the center, then retire to the perimeter
The  toss their heads, looking around,  or
Then they catch sight of the   and start moving toward them
- Take the one the left
'll take the one on the right
What about Padme

Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free
- It looks like she's already on top of things
The  charges
He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard
lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn
The  backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post - ducks around the post as the  charges
It knocks the post flat, sending - sprawling

It charges around the arena with  hanging on for dear life
He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the 's mouth
Its jaws clamp hard on the chain
yanks hard on the chain, turning the , beginning to ride it
The 's claws dig deep into the post
The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at
She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back
She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole
Then,  jumps off the post into the air
She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet
It tumbles back onto the sand
In the archducal box: Foul
She can't do that
shoot her or something
In the arena, - runs out from behind the fallen  and throws the spear at the , hitting it in the neck
It lets out a terrible  and turns on him

She finally manages to work the chain loose

Well, sort of

Maybe this is the way it's supposed to end

Across the arena, the , having chewed up the , starts to advance toward them
,   - -3PO Yes, it has been rather a long time
Do you suppose something's happened to them
and
-3PO (continuing) Danger
Oh no,  shouldn't think so
It looks a very dull planet to me
They should be back shortly
Just stop worrying, Artoo
,   - In the archducal box, amid the uproar,   feels a tap on his shoulder
He turns to see   standing behind him
masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees   standing at every entrance and exit
Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us
You're just in time for the moment of truth
would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training
Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku
This party's over
signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about    switch on their lightsabers
The crowd is suddenly silent
' lips curl in slight amusement

You're impossibly outnumbered

Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces - to retreat

His lightsaber flashes
- is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh
He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls
His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor
raises his lightsaber
- looks up helplessly
Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and  against - Anakin's lightsaber
and  stare eyeball to eyeball
(continuing) That's brave of you, boy - but foolish
would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson
'm a slow learner
And  charges at
The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance
Anakin's lightsaber flashes
draws back, putting a hand to his arm
He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him
You have unusual powers, young Padawan
But not enought to save you this time
Don't bet on it
- Anakin
- uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to
With  ,  attacks
parries and ripostes
It is no contest
is driven back against the wall
He loses one lightsaber
Finally  , in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber
drops to the ground in agony
draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace
Suddenly, the great doors slide open
The  turn fast, raising their weapons
Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of
He stops on the smoke-filled threashold,   lined up on either side of him, guns pointed
Before the  can get off a shot,  raises his hand, and the  are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal
Silence

His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute
Master Yoda
At last we shall know who is the most powerful

He salutes formally
Count Dooku
No interest in contests, do  have
charges across the space at
He rains down blows upon the tiny figure
doesn't budge an inch
For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims
Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through
His energy drains
His strokes become feebler, slower
attacks
He flies forward
is forced to retreat
Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay
His lightsaber his a humming blur of light
Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand
He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel
jumps onto ' shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head
(continuing) The end for you, Count, this is
Not yet
raises his arms and knocks  off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger
It comes crashing down on - and
But in the blink of and eye,  is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force

The fallen crane trembles and starts to life
Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up
concentrates harder
Slowly, the crane rises
The     increases
exerts every scrap of his powers
The crane lifts clear of  and is thrown to the ground

The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away
and a   with about   appear in the doorway
Anakin
runs too him and throws her arms around him

The   marches up to , stops, and salutes smartly
Resistance is at an end, General
What are your orders
looks at him and sighs

The Force is with us, my Master
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus
You have done well
bring you good news, my Lord
The war has begun
Excellent
(smiling) Everything is going as planned
,   - The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun
,   - Where is your apprentice
- On his way back to Naboo
He is escorting Senator Amidala home
They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below

- (continuing) must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory
Victory
Victory, you say

Apart from -- and  , who is wounded, the Chamber is empty
(continuing) Not victory, a defeat, it was
