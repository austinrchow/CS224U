Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace :  long time ago in a galaxy far, far away
vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by a roll up, which crawls up into infinity
1 Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic
The taxation of trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo
While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict
to reveal a small space cruiser heading   at great speed
with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships
- In the cockpit of the cruise, the  and  maneuver closer to one of the battleships
- : (off screen voice) Captain
The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her
: Yes, sir
- : (
) Tell them we wish to board at once
: Yes, sir
The  looks to her view screen, where  , a Neimoidian trade viceroy, waits for a reply
: (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately
: Yes, yes, of coarse
ahhh
as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador
Happy to
The screen goes black
Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship looms ever closer
-   -  () The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation battleship
-   - , -14, waits at the door to the docking bay
Two , -4 and -9 watch
-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless protocol gearheads to greet them
The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay
Two darkly robed figures are greeted by -14
-14 : 'm -14 at your service
This way, please
They move off down the hallway
-9 :  Republic cruiser
That's trouble
don't you think
-4 : 'm not made to think
- door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led   into the formal conference room by -14
-14 :  hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here
My master will be with you shortly
The droid bows before -  and -
He backs out the door and it closes
The  lower their hoods and look out a large window at the lush green planet of Naboo
- sixty years old, has long white hair in a ponytail
He is tall and striking, with blue eyes
- is twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes
Several exotic, bird-like creatures  in a cage near the door
- :  have a bad feeling about this
- :  don't sense anything
- : It's not about the mission, Master, it's somethging
elsewhere
elusive
- : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan
Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs
- : Master Yoda says  should be mindful of the future
- :
but not at the expense of the moment
Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan
- : Yes, Master
how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands
- : These Federation types are cowards
The negotiations will be short
- and   stand, stunned, before -14
: (shaken) What
What did you say
-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights,  believe
:  knew it
They were sent to force a settlement, eh
Blind me, we're done for
- hologram of  , surrounded by  , appears in the conference room hallway
: They must be dead by now
Blast, what's left of them
The hologram fades off, as a  , -1, cautiously opens the door
deadly green cloud billows from the room
cock their weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke
It is -14 , carrying the tray of drinks
TC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry
The   passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several   before they can fire
- The bridge is a cocophony of alarms
and  watch -1 on the viewscreen
-1 : Not sure exactly what
-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence
gives  a worried look
: What in blazes is going on down there
: Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir
: Well, not exactly, but  don't
(panicked) Seal off the bridge
: That won't be enough, sir
The doors to the bridge  shut
:  want destroyer droids up here at once
: We will not survive this
-  - - cuts several   in half, creating a shower of sparks and metal parts
- raises his hand, sending several crashing into the wall
- makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it
- The  is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door
- and - are on the view screen
: Close the blast doors
The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then a third
There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut
- tabs the door with his sword
The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the center of the blast door
:
They're still coming through
On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away
: Impossible
This is impossible
: Where are those destroyer droids
-  - Ten ugly destroyer   roll down the hallway at full speed
Just before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their battle configuration
- can't see them but senses their presence
- : Destroyer droids
- : Offhand, 'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage
The  , led by -59, rush the entry area from three hallways, blasting away with their laser guns
They stop firing and stand in a semi-circle as the smoke clears
- and - are nowhere to be seen
-59 : Switch to bio
There they are
The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the doorway that slams shut
The   blast away at the two  with their laser swords
- : They have shield generators
- : It's a standoff
Let's go
- and  stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the '  speeds to the doorway
: We have them on the run, sir
they're no match for destroyer droids
: Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft
- - and - appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay
They are careful not to be seen
Thousands of   are loading onto landing craft
- : Battle droids
- : It's an invisible army
- : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation
We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum
Let's split up
Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet
- : You were right about one thing, Master
The negotiations were short
- recieves a transmission
: Sir, a transmission from the planet
: It's Queen Amidala herself
: At last we're getting results
On the view screen,   appears in her throne room
Wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the and  , , , , and
: (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness
The Federation is pleased
: You will not be pleased when you hear what  have to say, Viceroy
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended
smirks at
:  was not aware of such a failure
:  have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of yours
:  take it you know the outcome
wonder why they bother to vote
: Enough of this pretense, Viceroy
'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a settlement
:  know nothing about any Ambassadors
you must be mistaken
, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully
: Beware, Viceroy
the Federation is going too far this time
: Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of the Senate
You assume too much
: We will see
The  fades off, and the view screen goes black
: She's right, the Senate will never
: It's too late now
: Do you think she suspects an attack
:  don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there
- The , ,  and her Governor,  , stand before a hologram of  , a thin, kindly man
:
How could that be true
have assurances from the Chancellor
his Ambassaodrs did arrive
It must be the
get
negotiate
The hologram of  sputters and fades away
: Senator Palpatine
(turns to Panaka) What's happening
turns to his : Check the transmission generators
:  malfunction
: It could be the Federation jamming us
Your Highness
:  communications disruption can only mean one thing
Invasion
: Don't jump to conclusions, Governor
The Federation would not dare go that far
: The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished
: We must continue to rely on negotiation
: Negotiation
We've lost all communications
and where atre the Chancellors Ambassadors
How can we negotiate
We must prepare to defend ourselves
: This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness
Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army
:  will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war
-  () Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo
-   - Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the perpetually gray twilight side of the planet
One by one, the Federation warships land in the eerie swamp
-'s head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake
For in the background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist
- takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy swamp
Troop Transports ('s) emerge from the landing craft
/   -  () The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain
-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast  marching across the rolling hills
small hologram of  and  stands on the tank
:
and there is no trace of the Jedi
They may have gotton onto one of your landing craft
-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them
We are moving out of the swamp and are marching on the cities
We are meeting no resistance
: Excellent
- - runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist
Animals begin to run past him in a panic
An odd, frog-like Gungan,   , squats holding a clam he has retrieved from the murky swamp
The shell pops open
's greta tongue snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp
looks up and sees - and the other creatures running like the wind toward him
One of the huge 's bears down on the  like a charging locomotive
stands transfixed, still holding the clam shell in one hand
: Oh, noooooooooo
drops the shell and grabs onto - as he passes
The  is caught by surprise
: (Cont'd) Hey, help me
Help me
- : Let go
The machine is about tp crush them as - drags   behind him
Just as the transport is about to hit them, - drops, and   goes splat into the mud with him
The transport races overhead

They stand watching the war machine dissapear into the mist

: Oyi, mooie-mooie

The frog-like creature kisses the

One-two
- is exhausted and tries to catch his breath
- : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon
- pulls out his burnt laser sword handle
- inspects it, as pulls himself out of the mud
- : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you
- nods sheeplishly

jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the water
Breath masks on, - and - wade in after him
- - and - swim behind  , who is very much at home in the water
Down they swim into murky depths
In the distance the glow of Otoh Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct
They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat

- and - follow

Four armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged  into the square

As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to follow
: Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes

Suddenly there is a loud , and the little craft lurches to one side
- looks around and sees a huge, lumimnous    has hooked them with its long gooey tongue
- : Full speed ahead
Instead of full ahead,   jams the controls into reverse
The sub flies into the mouth of the creature
: Oooops
- : Give me the controls
- takes over the controls and the    instantly releases the sub from its mouth
: Wesa free
As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the hapless
The jaws belong to the incredible
The lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the gloom
- : There's always a bigger fish
- and  stand before a hologram of
: The invasion is on schedule, My Lord
: Good

By the time this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to accept your control of the system
: The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her
: Queen Amidala is yound and naive
You will find controlling her will not be difficult
You have done well, Viceroy
: Thank you, My Lord
fades away
: You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi
: No need to report that to him, until we have something to report
- Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin
The sound of the power drive drops
- :
we're losing power
- is working with the sparking wires
panics
- : Stay calm
We're not in trouble yet
: What yet
Monstairs out dare
Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and nooooo power

Oie Boie
's eyes bulge, and he faints again
The sub narrowly avoids the deadly teeth of the
The    chasing them isn't so lucky
It is munched in half by the larger predator
The little sub slips away
- : Head for that outcropping
-     -  () The long columns of the   move down the main road leading to Theed, the Naboo capital
-  () As the  watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport carrying  and  lands in Theed Plaza
They exit the transport
: Ah, victory
-  -  () The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is brightly lit
: Wesa dude it
-  - Paradise
Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water
There is a , and a small sub bobs to the surface
The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast moving river
- switches off the two remaining bubble canopies
- stands up to look around
lets out a sigh of relief
: Wesa safe now
- : Get this thing started
: Dissen berry good
Hey
- : What is it
looks back to where they're drifting
He sees they are headed for a huge waterfall
: What
Oie boie
- tries to start the engine
The long props behind the sub slowly begin to rotate
- struggles until finally, a few feet short of the waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop drifting backward in the powerful current
The sub slowly moves forward
In the background, - takes a cable out of his belt
The engine coughs and dies
They start drifting backward again
panics
: (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey
- shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the shore
The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs precariously over the edge of the waterfall
- : Come on
- climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable
- starts in after him
- : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar
: No
Too scary
- : Get up here
: No a mighty no

stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks lose, crashing down the waterfall
The  move on

: Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people
- : They will kill you if you stay
: They wouldn't dare
: They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal
They can't afford to kill her

There is something else behind all this, Your Highness
There is no logic in the Federation's move here
My feelings tell me they will destroy you
: Please, Your Highness, reconsider
Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us
Senator Palpatine will need your help

Any attempt to escape will be dangerous

The Hutts are gangsters
If they discovered her

It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation

Finally, he gets the courage to speak
: Are you an angel
: What
: An angel

They live on the Moons of Iego  thimk
They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe
They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most hardened spice pirate cry

: You're a funny little boy
How do you know so much

He stands before a hyperdrive

Here it is

It would be cheaper,  think
Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this

Republic credits are no good out here

What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that

Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money
No money, no parts
No deal
And no one else has a -14 hyperdrive, promise you that

Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on board

)  few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe
Not enough for you to barter with
Not in the ammounts you're talking about

Another solution will present itself

He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth
Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire
The vendor suddenly appears

He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you

: And that works for you
: To a point

We'd better seal the ship

He drops one

Make thgat three, 'm not hungry
The wind picks up

: Gracious, my bones are aching
storm's coming on, Annie
You'd better get home quick

sandstorms are very, very dangerous
Come with me
Hurry
The  follows  as he rushes down the windy street

'  -   - -,  , , and  enter a small living space
: Mom
Mom
'm home
: Dissen cozy
Anakin's mother,  , a warm, friendly woman of forty, enters from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people
: Oh, my
Annie, what's this
: These are my friends, Mom
This is Padme, and
gee,  don't know any of your names
- : 'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks

Listen
The wind  outside

- takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to - :  have enough food for a meal
: Oh, tank you
Thank you so much
'm sorry if  was abrupt
'll never get used to Anakin's surprises
- : He's a very special boy
looks at him as if he's discovered a secret
: Yes,  know
'  -  - shows off his , which is lying on his workbench
There is one eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings
: Isn't he great
He's not finished yet
: He's wonderful
: You reall like him
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom
Watch
pushes a switch, and the  sits up
Anakin rushes around, grabs an eye and puts it in one of the sockets
: How do you do,  am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations
How might  serve you
: He's perfect
: When the storm is over, you can see my racer
'm building a Podracer
smiles at his enthusiasm
lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles
:  beg your pardon
what do you mean 'm naked
: (Cont'd) My parts are showing
Oh, my goodness
How embarrassing
- , , , and - watch a very bad transmission of a hologram
:
cut off all food supplies until you return
the death toll is catastrophic
we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness
Please tell us what to do
If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me
looks upset
almost nervous
- : It's a trick
Send no reply
Send no transmission of any kind
'  -   - - listens to his comlink
- is in the cockpit
- :
the Queen is upset
but absolutly no reply was sent
- : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace
- : What if it is true and the people are dying
- : Either way, we're running out of time
-    - and   look out over the vast city
: Tatooine is sparsely populated
If the trace was correct, will find them quickly, Master
: Move against the Jedi first
you will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty
: At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi
At last we will have revenge
: You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you
It is too late for them to stop us now
Everything is going as planned
The Republic will soon be in my command
The hologram of   fades off as   looks out over the city
-  - The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house
'  -   - -, , ,  , and  are seated around a makeshift table, having dinner as the wind howls outside
slurps his soup rather loudly
Everyone looks at him
He turns a little brighter red
: All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere
: 've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck
: Any attempt to escape
:
and they blow you up
poof
and   are horrified
: How wude
:  can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy
The Republic's anti-slavery laws
: The Republic doesn't exist out here
we must survive on our own
An awkward silence
attempts to end the embarrassment
: Have you ever seen a Podrace
shakes her head no
She notices the concern of
snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue
- gives him a dirty look
- : They have Podracing on Malastare
Very fast, very dangerous
: 'm the only human who can do it
looks askance at her son
: (Cont'd) Mom, what
'm not bragging
It's true
Watto says he's never heard of a human doing it
- : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods
smiles
attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl with his tongue, but -, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and forefinger
is startled
- : (Cont'd) Don't do that again
tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling
- lets go of the tongue, and it snaps back into  's mouth
:
was wondering
something
- : What
: Well, ahhh
you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you
- : What makes you think that
:  saw your laser sword
Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon
- leans back and slowly smiles
- : Perhaps  killed a Jedi and stole it from him
:  don't think so
No one can kill a Jedi Knight
- :  wish that were so
had a dream  was a Jedi
came back here and freed all the slaves
have you come to free us
- : No, 'm afraid not
:  think you have
why else would you be here
- thinks for a moment
- :  can see there's no fooling you
(leans forward) You mustn't let anyone know about us
we're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept secret
: Coruscant
wow
how did you end up here in the outer rim
: Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it
:  can help
can fix anything
- :  believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we need
: Wit no-nutten mula to trade
: These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind
: Gambling
Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races
- : Podracing
Greed can be a powerful ally
if it's used properly
: 've built a racer
It's the fastest ever
There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve
You could enter my pod
It's all but finished
: Anakin, settle down
Watto won't let you
: Watto doesn't know 've built it
(to Qui-Gon) You could make him think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you
- looks to
She is upset
:  don't want you to race, Annie
It's awful
die every time Watto makes you do it
: But Mom,  love it
and they need help
they're in trouble
The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need
: Wesa ina pitty bad goo
- : Your mother's right
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might be able to help us
shakes her head no
: We have to help them, Mom
you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other
: Anakin, don't
belches
There is silence for a moment as they eat
: 'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger
We will find another way
: No, Annie's right, there is no other way
may not like it, but he can help you
he was meant to help you
: Is that a yes
That is a yes
The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel
-    - The storm has passed
and   clean up the mess and rebuild their food stalls
sits on a box in front of Watto's parts shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness
is standing next to him
stops - as he is about to enter the shop
: Are you sure about this
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know
The Queen will not approve
- : The Queen does not need to know
: Well,  don't approve
- turns and starts into the shop
'   - and  are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese
: Patta go bolla
: No batta
: Pedunky
Maa kee cheelya
: Bayno, Bayno
- walks in, and  and  join him
: The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race
You can't afford parts
How can you do this
Not on Republic credits,  think
(he laughs) - : My ship will be the entry fee
- pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of He studies it
: Not bad
not bad
a Nubian
- : It's in good order, except for the parts we need
:
but what would the boy ride
He smashed up my Pod in the last race
It will take some time to fix it
is embarrassed and steps forward
: Ahhhh
it wasn't my fault really
Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports
actually saved the Pod
mostly
: (laughing) That you did
The boy is good, no doubts there
- :  have
acquired a Pod in a game of chance
"The fastest ever built
" :  hope you didn't kill anyone  know for it
(laughs) So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee;  supply the boy
We split the winnings fifty-fifty,  think
- : Fifty-fifty
If it's going to be fifty-fifty,  suggest you front the cash for the entry
If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts  need
If we lose, you keep my ship
thinks about this
tries not to be nervous
- : (Cont'd) Either way, you win
: (subtitled) Deal
Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya
(Your friend is a follish one, methinks
) -   - - stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink
- is on the back porch of the hovel
- : What if this plan fails, Master
We could be stuck here for a long time
- : (
)  ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and there is something about this boy
-   -  - - puts the comlink away as  comes onto the porch , ,  , and  work on the engines of the Podracer in the courtyard below
- : You should be proud of your son
He gives without any thought of reward
: He knows nothing of greed
He has
- : He has special powers
: Yes
- : He can see things before they happen
That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes
It is a Jedi trait
: He deserves better than a slave's life
- : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear
Who was his father
: There was no father, that  know of
carried him,  gave him birth
can't explain what happened
Can you help him
- : 'm afraid not
Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt
he has the way
But it's too late for him now, he's too old
-   -   - (a young boy about Anakin's age),  (a boy of ten),  (a girl of six), and  (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ,  , , and  securing some wiring

: Hey
Jar Jar
Stay away from those energy binders
: Who, mesa
: If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours
peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps him in the mouth and jumps back
tries to say something, but his mouth is numb and his words are garbled
: Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho
(Gibberish) : But you don't even know if this thing will run
: It will

gets his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get words out that make sense
- :  think it's time we found out
Use this power charge
: Yes, sir
jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines
He puts the power pack back into the dashboard
backs away, except for who calls for help
Finally  frees him and the engines ignite with a

The leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky

Let me clean this cut
: There are so many
Do they all have a system of planets
- : Most of them
: Has anyone been to them all

- : Yes, Master
- : Make an analysis of this blood sample 'm sending you
- : Wait a minute
- :  need a midi-chlorian count
- : All right
've got it
- : What are your readings
- : Something must be wrong with the transmission
- : Here's a signal check
- : Strange
The transmission seems to be in good order, but the reading's off the chart
over twenty thousand
- : (almost to himself) That's it then
- : Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high
- : No Jedi has
- : What does it mean
- : 'm not sure

Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while - ponders the situation

walks to the edge of the mesa and studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars
He picks out the lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on his electronic armband
Six football-sized   float out of the ship and head off in three different directions toward the cities

must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion
: Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope
: If  may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power
he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption manufactured scandal surrounds him
The bureaucrats are in charge now
: What options do we have
: Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor
One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice
You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum
: He has been our strongest supporter
Is there any other way
: Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts
: There's no time for that
The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate
Our people are dying, Senator

We must do something quickly to stop the Federation

We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians

Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force

However, there's great risk
The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship
