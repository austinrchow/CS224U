Written by Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett From a story by George Lucas - Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its underside
One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice- covered surface
An explosion marks the point of impact
-   -   - weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater
The ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance
- small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope
The bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun
Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast
The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop
Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the sky
He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed
The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter
His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him
(into comlink) Echo Three to Echo Seven
Han, old buddy, do you read me
After a little static a familiar voice is heard
(over comlink) Loud and clear, kid
What's up
(into comlink) Well,  finished my circle don't pick up any life readings
(over comlink) There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser
The sensors are placed, 'm going back
(into comlink) Right
'll see you shortly
There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here
want to check it out
It won't take long
Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard
He pats the beast on the head to calm it
Hey, steady girl
What's the matter
You smell something
Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind
He hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over him
It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously
Aaargh
Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw
He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken
The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain
-    - stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous ice cave
-   - Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing their new base
The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls off his goggles
He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which is parked among several fighters
Mechanics, R2 units, and various other droids hurry about
Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter
Chewie stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated greeting to his boss
Chewie
The Wookiee grumbles a reply
All right, don't lose your temper
'll come right back and give you a hand
Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han leaves
-   - makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick ice
The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity
Controllers, troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals
General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach
Solo
No sign of life out there, General
The sensors are in place
You'll know if anything comes around
Commander Skywalker reported in yet
No
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him
(indicates radar screen) With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships
Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind
General, 've got to leave can't stay anymore
Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants
Her hair is braided across her head in a Nordic fashion
She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat distressed
'm sorry to hear that
Well, there's a price on my head
If  don't pay off Jabba the Hut, 'm a dead man
death mark's not an easy thing to live with
You're a good fighter, Solo
hate to lose you
Thank you, General
He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away
(with feeling) Well, Your Highness,  guess this is it
That's right
Leia is angry
Han sees she has no warmth to offer him
He shakes his head and adopts a sarcastic tone
(cooly) Well, don't get all mushy on me
So long, Princess
Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center
Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him
-   - Han
Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia
Yes, Your Highnessness
thought you decided to stay
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind
Han, we need you
We
Yes
Oh, what about you need
(mystified) need
don't know what you're talking about
(shakes his head, fed up) You probably don't
And what precisely am  supposed to know
Come on
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me
Yes
You're a great help to us
You're a natural leader
No
That's not it
Come on
Aahhh - uh huh
Come on
Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs
You're imagining things
Am
Then why are you following me
Afraid  was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss
'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee
can arrange that
You could use a good kiss
Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him
-   - familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo- Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an ice wall toward the main hangar
Don't try to blame me
didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater
merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber
But it's supposed to be freezing
How are we going to dry out all her clothes
really don't know
Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles
Oh, switch off
-   - The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter
Han and Chewie are struggling with their central lifters
(to Chewie) Why do you take this apart now
'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these
Chewie grumbles in irritation
Excuse me, sir
(to Chewie) Put them back together right now
Might  have a word with you, please
What do you want
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir
She's been trying to get you on the communicator
turned it off
don't want to talk to her
Oh
Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke
He hasn't come back yet
She doesn't know where he is
don't know where he is
Nobody knows where he is
What do you mean, "nobody knows"
Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as night slowly begins to fall on the planet
Well, uh, you see
Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him
Deck Officer
Deck Officer
Excuse me, sir
Might  inqu
Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer approaches
Yes, sir
Do you know where Commander Skywalker is
haven't seen him
It's possible he came in through the south entrance
It's possible
Why don't you go find out
It's getting dark out there
Yes, sir
The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's mouth
Excuse me, sir
Might  inquire what's going on
Why not
Impossible man
Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia
Between ourselves,  think Master Luke is in considerable danger
-   - The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the tunnel
Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance
He might have forgotten to check in
Not likely
Are the speeders ready
Not yet
We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold
Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns
Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly
That's right
And my friends out in it
'll cover sector twelve
Have com-control set screen alpha
Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun
Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker
Then 'll see you in hell
Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter night
-   - The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a Hoth day
Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor
One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood
He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls
Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs
Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position
As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach
He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration
Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into Luke's hand
The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice
He flops to the snow in a heap
The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking
Luke scrambles to his feet
He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain
-     - Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight
Weak and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank
-   - small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile vastness of snow and cold
As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air
-  				  - Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly
Threepio moves stiffly over to him
You must come along now, Artoo
There's really nothing more we can do
And my joints are freezing up
Artoo beeps, long and low
Don't say thing like that
Of course we'll see Master Luke again
He'll be quite all right, you'll see
(to himself) Stupid little short-circuit
He'll be quite all right
Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully keeps his vigil
-   - The wind is blowing quite strong now
Luke struggles to stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over
He struggles to get up, but he can't
The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses
-    -  - Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes
She shivers in the cold wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands
In the background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors
Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with the princess
Sir, all the patrols are in
There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo
Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope
Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought
Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight
The shield doors must be closed
He turns to the lieutenant
Close the doors
Yes, sir
The lieutenant walks away
Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, somewhat like a coyote
At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex series of efficient beeps
Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five
to one
Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the entrance of the ice cave
The loud booms echo throughout the huge cavern
Chewie lets out another suffering howl
Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes
from time to time
Oh, dear, oh, dear
Don't worry about Master Luke
'm sure he'll be all right
He's quite clever, you know
for a human being
-   - Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious
Slowly he looks up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow
It is hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination
Luke
Luke
(weakly) Ben
You will go to the Dagobah system
Dagobah system
There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me
The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching from the windswept horizon
(groaning faintly) Ben
Ben
Luke drops into unconsciousness
Han pulls up and leaps off his mount
He hurries to his snow-covered friend, cradling him in his arms
Han's Tauntaun lets out a low, pitiful bellow
But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him urgently
Luke
Luke
Don't do this, Luke
Come on, give me a sign here
Luke doesn't respond
Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping Luke's unconscious face
As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a rasping sound behind him
He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow
Han carries Luke to the moaning beast
Then, with a final groan, the Tauntaun expires
Not much time
He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast
(moaning) Ben
Ben
Hang on, kid
Dagobah system
Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe
He quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass
(reeling from the odor) Whew
Dagobah
This may smell bad, kid
(moaning) Yoda
but it will keep you warm
til  get the shelter built
(struggling to get Luke inside the carcass) Ooh
thought they smelled bad on the outside
The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move
Han removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter container
He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection against a bitter Hoth night
-  - Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape
There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft
He concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit
He hears a low beep from one of his monitors
(into transmitter) Echo Base
've got something
Not much, but it could be a life form
- The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new direction
- The pilot switches over to a new transmitter
(into transmitter) This is Rogue Two
this is Rogue Two
Captain Solo, so you copy
Commander Skywalker, do you copy
This is Rogue Two
There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice
(filtered over Zev's receiver) Good morning
Nice of you guys to drop by
(switching transmitters) Echo Base
this is Rogue Two found them
Repeat,  found them
-  - The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side
makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift
Han spots Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his arms frantically at the tiny craft
- Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment
switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank filled with a thick, gelatinous slime
He begins to thrash about, raving in delirium
-   - Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling
His face shows terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack
Threepio and Artoo enter the room
Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again
Artoo beeps his good wishes
Artoo expresses his relief, also
Han and Chewie make their entrance
The Wookiee growls a greeting
How are you feeling, kid
You don't look so bad to me
In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark
Thanks to you
That's two you owe me, junior
Han turns as Leia enters the room
He looks at her with a big, devilish grin
Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer
(haughtily) had nothing to do with it
General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield
That's a good story
think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight
don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain
Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner
Han, enjoying himself, regards Chewie good-humoredly
Laugh it up, fuzzball
But you didn't see us alone in the south passage
Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia
She expressed her true feelings for me
Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han
My
Why, you stuck up,
half- witted
scruffy-looking
nerf- herder
Who's scruffy-looking
(to Luke) must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid
Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she focuses on Luke
Why,  guess you don't know everything about women yet
With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips
Then she turns on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly dumbstruck
With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head and grins
Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard
(over loudspeaker) Headquarters personnel, report to command center
The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke
Take it easy
Excuse us, please
-   - Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen
He calls over to Leia and Han
Princess
we have a visitor
The group hurries over to Rieekan
We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east
It's metal
Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke
It could be a speeder, one of ours
No
Wait - there's something very weak coming through
Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the strange signal
Sir,  am fluent in six million forms of communication
This signal is not used by the Alliance
It could be an Imperial code
The transmission ends in static
It isn't friendly, whatever it is
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out
Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to station three-eight
-   - The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three- eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base
It raises a large antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing signal
The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has popped his head over a snow bank
Instantly, the probe robot swings around, its deadly ray ready to fire
But before it can get a shot off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million pieces
Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the smoldering remains of the Imperial probe
-   - Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink
(over comlink) Afraid there's not much left
(into comlink) What was it
(over comlink) Droid of some kind
didn't hit it that hard
It must have had a self-destruct
(into comlink) An Imperial probe droid
(over comlink) It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here
We'd better start the evacuation
- Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of space
The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft
fighters dart to and fro
'   -  - Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls
The squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the approaching presence and turn toward it
Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, enters like a chill wind
As Vader moves across the wide bridge, Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel
Admiral
Yes, Captain think we've got something, sir
The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had
(irritated) We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy
want proof, not leads
The visuals indicate life readings
It could mean anything
If we followed every lead
But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms
Vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base
Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance
You found something
Yes, my lord
(studying the image on the console screen) That's it
The Rebels are there
My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements
It could be smugglers, it could be
That is the system
And 'm sure Skywalker is with them
Set your course for the Hoth system
General Veers, prepare you men
-   - captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the main transport bay
Several Rebel transports behind them are being loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in panic
Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders
As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch
Right, sir
-   - Alarms sound
Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert stations
Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near the main entrance
In the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the lifters of the Millennium Falcon
Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor
He pulls out his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters
(into comlink, to Chewie) Okay, that's it
Try it
Off
Turn it off
Turn it off
Off
Smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter
Exasperated, Han surveys the new damage
- Luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical droid stands by
Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the -forty- sevens
Well, forget the heavy equipment
There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports
Take care, sir
Thanks
- Pilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about
Luke, pulling on his heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders
He stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay
As Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and gives him a tight hug
Han is discussing the lifter with a repair droid when he sees Luke
Hi, kid
(to droid) There's got to be a reason for it
Check it at the other end
Wait a second
(to Luke) You all right
Yeah
Be careful
You, too
Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on
After a few steps, he stops and looks back
Han glances up and the two exchange a silent communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things, all difficult to verbalize
-
Alarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base
In the control room, a controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer scan
General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four
Reroute all power to the energy shield
We've got to hold them till all transports are away
Prepare for ground assault
Rieekan exits hurriedly
'   - '  - The dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube
General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving Vader
Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord
The younger general stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks
What is it, General
My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed
Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system
The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment
(angrily) The Rebels are alerted to our presence
Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system
He felt surprise was wiser
He is as clumsy as he is stupid
General, prepare your troops for a surface attack
Yes, my lord
Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen showing the bridge of his mighty ship
Admiral Ozzel appears on the viewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett
Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to
Aaagh
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral
Captain Piett
Piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused, touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully
Yes, my lord
Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system
You are in command now, Admiral Piett
Thank you, Lord Vader
Piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed emotion
He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him
- With a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered in the center of the hangar
All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance
The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded
Only two fighter escorts per ship
The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer
The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path
When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point
Understood
(in unison) Right
Okay
Good luck
Okay
Everyone to your stations
Let's go
The pilots hurry away
-   -   - Rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along the snow trench
Men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold wind
Other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into position
-   - Near the base power generators, troops rush to set up their heavy battle equipment
Buzzing loudly, the generators send along, sparking fingers of energy into the bitter Hoth wind
- The long line of Rebel controllers is tense, as are Princess Leia and General Rieekan, who are trying very hard not to show any fear
Their primary target will be the power generators
Prepare to open the shield
The Rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from the ice planet
- huge Imperial Star Destroyer rest against a sea of stars, far above the white surface of the planet Hoth
- An Imperial controller approaches his commander
Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector
Good
Our first catch of the day
- Stand by, ion control
Fire
- The giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two red energy beams skyward
-  - The Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet, closely followed by the two red energy beams
As the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial Star Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts
The Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull
The big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control
As the Imperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away to safety
- Pilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and their vehicles
(over loudspeaker) The first transport is away
Everyone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar
Luke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder
His gunner, Dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him
They climb in
Feeling all right, sir
Just like new, Dack
How about you
Right now  feel like  could take on the whole Empire myself
(quietly, strapping in) know what you mean
- thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape
Small dot-size objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the Rebel base
-   - Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes
Through the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker
He adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the ominous battle machines
Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the guns of the lumbering snow walkers
The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding begins to make the ground vibrate
The pounding grows louder and is accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling
The officer speaks into his comlink
Echo Station Three--Eight
- Pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders
Ice and snow begin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken by the pounding Imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer
(over comlink) We have spotted Imperial walkers
Imperial walkers on the north ridge
-   - The Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt all around them
They are nervous and their grip on their weapons tightens from the cold and from fear
Behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky
' ,   - (into comlink) Echo station Five-Seven
We're on our way
-   - The fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle
They accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers
' ,   - (into comlink) All right, boys, keep tight now
Luke,  have no approach vector
'm not set
Steady, Dack
Attack pattern delta
Go now
-   - The cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders
Other walkers loom in the background
Two speeders race away past two of the enormous walkers and bank to the right
' ,   - All right, 'm coming in
He turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers, flying toward its towering legs
The horizon twists as the speeder banks between the legs
(into comlink) Hobbie, you still with me
-   - Two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly past it
Three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons
-   - Rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice explode all around them
-   - speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker
Two other speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction
Other Rebel craft race just above the icy plain
giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and sending it crashing in a ball of flames
- General Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine forward
Luke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and heads straight for its viewport, blasting away
An explosion hits the walker window, but dissipates, doing no harm
The speeder roars up and over the impregnable war machine
' ,   - Luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance
That armor's too strong for blasters
On the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke's cockpit window, twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run
(into comlink) Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables
Go for the legs
It might be our only chance of stopping them
(to Dack) All right, stand by, Dack
Dack is at the gunner's controls
Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control
'll have to cut in the auxiliary
Just hang on
Hang on, Dack
Get ready to fire that tow cable
Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up his harpoon gun
Luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker
Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course for the tiny craft
-   - Rogue Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the walker as explosions burst all around them
' ,   - After sustaining a heavy volley of fire, Luke turns around to see if Dack is all right
Dack
Dack
Dack is lost
Blood streams down his forehead, which rests on his smoldering controls
Out the back window, an Imperial walker recedes in the distance
-   - Rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around them
-   - Two walkers lumber toward the Rebel base as a speeder between them explodes in a ball of flames
-   - The dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes
- Through the cockpit window, Veers and his pilot can see the Rebel power generators in the distance
hologram of Darth Vader appears on a control panel screen
Yes, Lord Vader
've reached the main power generator
The shield will be down in moments
You may start your landing
' ,   - (into comlink) Rogue Three
' ,   - (into comlink) Copy, Rogue Leader (over comlink) Wedge, 've lost my gunner
You'll have to make this shot
'll cover for you
Set your harpoon
Follow me on the next pass
(into comlink) Coming around, Rogue Leader
' ,   - (into comlink) Steady, Rogue Two - Wedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers
' ,   - (to gunner) Activate harpoon
Wedge's gunner reaches for a firing switch to activate the harpoon
The harpoon flashes out, and speeds toward the receding legs of the walker
- The harpoon hurtles toward the walker, In an instant it is embedded in one of the walker's legs
' ,   - (to gunner) Good shot, Janson
- The speeder Rogue Three races around one of the giant walker's feet, trailing the cable behind it
Continuing around the back foot, Rogue Three then circles the walker around the tail end
' ,   - Wedge checks his controls and banks around the front of the walker
One more pass
Coming around
Once more
- The speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the cable behind it
' ,   - Once more
Wedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant walker
Cable out
Let her go
Detach cable
' , The cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable drops away
' ,   - Cable detached
- The speeder zooms away into the distance
The tangled legs of the enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant Imperial walker begins to topple
It teeters for a moment, and then crashes onto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying
-   - The troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker
An officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops charge the fallen war machine
Come on
The troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two Rebel speeders flying overhead
Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground
' ,   - Wedge lets out a triumphant yell, banking his speeder away from the fallen walker
(into comlink) Whooha
That got him
' ,   - (into comlink) see it, Wedge
Good work
- Large chunks of ice tumble into the command center as Leia and General Rieekan monitor computer screens
don't think we can protect two transports at a time
It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer
We have no choice
(into comlink) Launch patrols
(to an aide) Evacuate remaining ground staff
- Muffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of the hangar
Trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, Han works on one of the Falcon's lifters while Chewie works on one of the wings
Noticing Chewie attach a wrong part, Han grows impatient
No, no
No
This one goes there, that one goes there
Right
In another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is raised up into Luke's -wing fighter
Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand
And do take good care of yourself
Oh, dear, oh, dear
- The fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on
The Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base, firing lasers as they lumber ever onward
In the snow trench, Rebel troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions erupt around them
gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes
Another blast destroys a ray gun
- General Veers studies various readouts on his control panel
All troops will debark for ground assault
Prepare to target the main generator
- Luke's speeder and Rogue Two fly in formation, banking from right to left and flying above the erupting battlefield
Flak bursts all around them
' ,   - Luke, glancing over, sees Rogue Two on his left
His ship shudders as flak bursts nearby
(into comlink) Rogue Two, are you all right
' ,   - (into comlink) Yeah
'm with you, Rogue Leader
' ,   - (into comlink) We'll set harpoon
'll cover for you
- The two speeders race across the horizon toward the giant walkers
' ,   - (into comlink) Coming around
' ,   - (into comlink) Watch that cross fire, boys
' ,   - (into comlink) Set for position three
(to gunner) Steady
(over comlink) Stay tight and low
' , Luke's speeder moves in formation with Rogue Two, when suddenly Zev's speeder is hit by a laser bolt
His ship bucks violently under the impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame
Spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker
Before they collide
Rogue Two explodes in a million flaming pieces
' ,   - Desperately, Luke works the controls of his flak-buffeted ship
Suddenly, the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion
Luke struggles with the controls with a look of terror on his face
The speeder fills with smoke, and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit
(into comlink) Hobbie, 've been hit
- Apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is strangely quiet and empty
Running footsteps echo through the freezing hallway, then Han appears
Cracks have appeared in some of the walls and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the underground hallways
Han hurries into the command center
It is a shambles, but some people are still at their posts
As he enters, a gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room
He finds Leia and Threepio near one of the control boards
You all right
Leia nods
She is surprised to see him
Why are you still here
heard the command center had been hit
You got your clearance to leave
Don't worry
'll leave
First 'm going to get you to your ship
Your Highness, we must take this last transport
It's our only hope
(to controller) Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters
blast rocks the command center, throwing Threepio backward into Han's arms
(over loudspeaker) Imperial troops have entered the base
Come on
that's it
(to head controller) Give the evacuation code signal
And get to your transports
Leia looks exhausted
Han grabs her and starts to lead her out
As Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center, the code signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls
-one-zero
all troops disengage
(to Han and Leia) Oh
Wait for me
- Rebel troops retreat under the awesome Imperial onslaught
Begin retreat
Fall back
Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them
- Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel headquarters
- Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever nearer
-  - On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over him
He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing overhead
Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at the walker's underside
thin cable follows the projectile from the gun
The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull
Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his belt buckle
Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling underneath the walker
The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen snow
Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch
Hanging precariously, Luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword
He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the Imperial machine
Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below
He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by - and just misses him
The giant walker stops in mid-step
muffled explosion comes from within - and then the walker's mechanical insides  are spewed out every conceivable opening
The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like a locomotive on stilts
- Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base
The smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right of Veers's path
- Inside his walker, General Veers prepares to fire on the Rebel power generators
Distance to power generators
One-seven, decimal two-eight
Veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main generator
Target
Maximum fire power
- The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the relentless Imperial assault
-   - With Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the crumbling ice corridors
Suddenly, there is an explosion
Han turns, grabs the princess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks their path
He takes the comlink from his pocket
(into comlink) Transport, this is Solo
Better take off -  can't get to you
'll get the princess out on the Falcon
Han and Leia turn and race down the corridor
But
but
but
where are you going
Uh
come back
-   - Imperial troops have reached the base
As they push through the blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them
-   - Han and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the Millennium Falcon is docked
Threepio still lags behind
Wait
Wait for me
Wait
Stop
The door to the hangar closes in his face
(exasperated) How typical
Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid through
Come on
-   - Chewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear
The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a few reassuring words
As he searches worriedly for his captain, something at last catches his eye
Chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward the ship
The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl, then runs up the ship's ramp
Han and Leia run up the ramp after him, closely followed by Threepio
Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident
Wait
Wait
-   - Imperial troops run through the base corridors
Vader surveys the place
huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but  he calmly, purposefully, continues around it
-   - distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck
Ice cakes come crashing down on the Millennium Falcon
-   - Han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as Chewie watches a troublesome gauge
worried Leia observes their efforts
(to Chewie) How's this
The Wookiee barks a negative reply
Would it helped if  got out and pushed
It might
Threepio clanks into the hold
Captain Solo, Captain Solo
sir, might  suggest that you
Han gives the gold robot a devastating look
It can wait
-   - They move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches
Leia watches him, impatient, disbelieving
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade
This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart
Han and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar
Quickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia into the navigator's chair
-   - Stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon
Behind them the giant hangar doors open slowly
- laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the Imperial troops
The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions
-   - Chewie rushes into the cockpit
Come on
Come on
Switch over
Let's hope we don't have a burnout
laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair
Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and the first stage of engine fire can be heard
Han flashes a big grin at Leia
See
Someday you're going to be wrong, and  hope 'm there to see it
Han looks at Chewie
Punch it
The roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice- cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window
- More stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader
Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's engines, Vader looks toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and disappear outside the cave
-   - Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above them, flying very close to the ground
The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their -wing fighters, each going to his own ship
Luke waves farewell, then heads toward his own fighter
Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke climbs aboard the spacecraft
Artoo
Get her ready for takeoff
From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own -wing, preparing for takeoff
Good luck, Luke
See you at the rendezvous
Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of his -wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently
Don't worry, Artoo
We're going, we're going
The canopy over the -wing lowers and snaps shut
-  ' - Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet
Soon it disappears into the stars
' - - Luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision
He flips several switches
The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn
The -wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction
The monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a question from the concerned Artoo
(into comlink) There's nothing wrong, Artoo
'm just setting a new course
Artoo beeps once again
(into comlink) We're not going to regroup with the others
Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "What
" Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel
(into comlink) We're going to the Dagobah system
Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments
He rides along with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence
Finally, Artoo chirps up
(into comlink) Yes, Artoo
Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles
(into comlink, chuckling) That's all right
'd like to keep it on manual control for a while
The little droid lets out a defeated whimper
Luke smiles, and continues on his course
- The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one huge Star Destroyer and four tiny  fighters
As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized objects
- Inside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl
Han checks as the ship is buffeted by exploding flak
He appears to be doing six things at once
(harried) saw them
saw them
Saw what
Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us
Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit
Sir, sir
Might  suggest
(to Leia) Shut him up or shut him down
(to Chewie) Check the deflector shield
Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch
Oh, great
Well, we can still outmaneuver them
-   - The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star Destroyers
Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight down, closely followed by four  fighters
The underside of the Star Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star Destroyers
Slowly, it starts to veer to the left
- Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen veering to the left
Take evasive action
Alarms sound all over the huge ship
The two other Star Destroyers get closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes brushing contact with it
-   - The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers, still followed by four  fighters
Laser bolts spark the pitch-black skies
- Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet
Chewie barks at Han
Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive
The ship is buffeted by laser blasts
Prepare to make the jump to light- speed
But, sir
The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger
They're getting closer
(with a gleam in his eye) Oh yeah
Watch this
Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into hyperspace, but just sit there
Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of concern
Watch what
Han tries again
Still nothing
think we're in trouble
If  may say so, sir,  noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged
It's impossible to go to light-speed
We're in trouble
The explosions become heavier
-   -   - The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four Imperial  fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer
- Stars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window
- Han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders to Chewie
Horizontal boosters
(Chewie barks) Alluvial dampers
Well that's not it
(Chewie barks) Bring me the hydrospanners
Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge
don't know how we're going to get out of this one
Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch radically
Chewie barks
The tools fall into the pit on top of Han
Oww
Chewie
More turbulence rocks the ship
That was no laser blast
Something hit us
(over comlink) Han, get up here
Come on, Chewie
Han climbs out of the hold like a shot
Both he and Chewie run out of the hold and toward the cockpit
- Out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by
Asteroids
Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie gets into his chair
Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses in front of the ship
Oh, no
Chewie, set two-seven- one
What are you doing
You're not actually going into an asteroid field
They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they
Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt
You don't have to do this to impress me
Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one
Never tell me the odds
- The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows
large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed
Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small explosions on its surface
Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in every direction, some colliding and exploding
The tiny Millennium Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain of rocks, followed by four  fighters, which bob and weave around the asteroids
One of the pursuing  fighters connects with an asteroid and explodes
The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of smaller explosions
Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly banks around both of them
The three  fighters follow in hot pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out of control into deep space
-   - The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the Falcon
Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface
-   - The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid
Two  fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side
- Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft through the dangerous field
Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship
Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch
Threepio's hands cover his eyes
He manages a short peek at the cockpit window
Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action
Han gives her a quick look
You said you wanted to be around when  made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart
take it back
We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer
The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window
'm not going to argue with that
Pulverized
'm going in closer to one of those big ones
Closer
Closer
Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder
- The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized asteroids
There is a continued display of explosions against the starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock
The two remaining  fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid
The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship
The  fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles directly into their path
As the asteroid continues on its way, it leaves remains of the two exploded  fighters to tumble into deep space
- Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in hysterics
Oh, this is suicide
Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful Wookiee, pointing
There
That looks pretty good
What looks pretty good
Yeah
That'll do nicely
(to Leia) Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going
Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater
- The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears
- hope you know what you're doing
Yeah, me too
The Falcon races down into the crater
The walls are barely visible as the ship speed through the tunnellike opening
small cave appears on one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into it
-  ' - The tiny -wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah
Artoo, riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with some anxiety
' - - Luke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the computer scope
(into comlink) Yes, that's it
Dagobah
Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry
(into comlink) No, 'm not going to change my mind about this
(getting a little nervous) 'm not picking up any cities or technology
Massive life-form readings, though
There's something alive down there
Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question
(into comlink) Yes, 'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids
-  -  ' - The -wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud- covered planet
' - - Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet
He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has completely obscured his vision
An alarm buzzes in the background, Artoo beeps and whistles frantically
(into comlink) know,  know
All the scopes are dead
can't see a thing
Just hang on, 'm going to start the landing cycle
The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's electronic squeals
Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the spacecraft stops
Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open
- The mist-shrouded -wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog
Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out of his cubbyhole on the back
The young warrior surveys the fog, which is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights
About all he can make out are some giant, twisted trees nearby
Artoo whistles anxiously
No, Artoo, you stay put
'll have a look around
Artoo lets out a short beep
As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake
Artoo
Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water is still and reveals no sign of the little droid
Artoo
Where are you
small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is heard
The periscope starts to move to shore
Relieved, Luke starts running along the nose of the fighter to its tip
Artoo
You be more careful
The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away
Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and turns to look for Artoo
The periscope still steadily moves toward shore
Artoo - that way
Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving toward the little droid
The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull
The droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream
Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend
Artoo
The black surface is still as death itself
until a few bubbles begin to appear
Then, phheewaat
The runt-size robot is spit out of the water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of soft gray moss
Oh, no
Are you all right
Come on
You're lucky you don't taste very good
Anything broken
Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from his round metal body
Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps
If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, 'm beginning to agree with you
Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here
It's like
something out of a dream, or,  don't know
Maybe 'm just going crazy
As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports
'   - ' Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle
After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising sight before him
Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far side of the chamber
black, insectlike droid attends him
Among the various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts from Vader's uncovered head
The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it
The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto Vader's head
When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face Piett
Yes, Admiral
Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord
But
it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk
(interrupting) Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral
want that ship and not excuses
Yes, lord
- The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave
It is so dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine
- Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems
Threepio and Leia watch worriedly
'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems
Sir, 'm almost afraid to ask, but
does that include shutting me down, too
Chewie barks "yes"
But Han thinks otherwise
No,  need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive
Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit to go flying
Chewie howls
Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable
Not entirely stable
'm glad you're here to tell us these things
Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive
Oh
Sometimes  just don't understand human behavior
After all, 'm only trying to do my job in the most
The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he move back to the hold
Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia across the cabin into Han's arms
Then, abruptly, the motion stops as suddenly as it started
With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they are in each other's arms
Let go
Sshh
Let go, please
Leia flushes, averting her eyes
She's not exactly fighting to get free
But, of course, Han blows it
Don't get excited
The anger rises in Leia
Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited
Sorry, sweetheart
We haven't got time for anything else
Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the door
Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face
-   - The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking swamp
Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing
He ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it
Taking a power cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket
Ready for some power
Okay
Let's see now
Put that in there
There you go
The droid whistles his appreciation
Luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater
(sighs) Now all  have to do is find this Yoda
if he even exists
Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle
Still
there's something familiar about this place
feel like
don't know
Feel like what
Luke jumps out of his skin
Artoo screeches in terror
The young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the speaker
Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall
The wizened little thing is dressed in rags
It motions toward Luke's sword
(looking at the creature) Like we're being watched
Away with your weapon
mean you no harm
After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really doesn't understand why
Artoo watches with interest
am wondering, why are you here
'm looking for someone
Looking
Found someone, you have, would say, hmmm
The little creature laughs
(Trying to keep from smiling) Right
Help you  can
Yes, mmmm
don't think so
'm looking for a great warrior
Ahhh
great warrior
(laughs and shakes his head) Wars not make one great
With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of the cases of supplies
He begins to rummage around
Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his disapproval
Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from and takes a bite
Put that down
Hey
That's my dinner
The creature spits out the bite he has taken
He makes a face
How you get so big, eating food of this kind
He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of Luke's supply cases
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just
(teasing) Aww, cannot get your ship out
The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case
Luke loses patience and grabs the case away
The creature retains his prize - a tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight
Hey, you could have broken this
Don't do that
Ohhh
you're making a mess
Hey, give me that
(retreating with the lamp) Mine
Or  will help you not
Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing closer to Artoo
As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature
don't want your help
want my lamp back
'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole
Mudhole
Slimy
My home this is
Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately engaged in a tug-of-war over it
Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats
" Ah, ah, ah
Oh, Artoo, let him have it
Mine
Mine
Artoo
Mine
The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one finger
Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go
Mine
(fed up) Now will you move along, little fella
We're got a lot of work to do
No
No, no
Stay and help you, will
(laughs) Find your friend, hmm
'm not looking for a friend
'm looking for a Jedi Master
Oohhh
Jedi Master
Yoda
You seek Yoda
You know him
Mmm
Take you to him,  will
(laughs) Yes, yes
But now, we must eat
Come
Good food
Come
With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily
Luke stares after him
All he sees is the faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog
Luke makes his decision and starts after the creature
(in the distance) Come, come
Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest
Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo
Artoo beeps even more frantically
But as Luke disappears from view, the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic sigh
- Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in front of him
The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps
Oh, where is Artoo when  need him
Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box
Sir,  don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized
'm afraid you'll have to replace it
Well, of course 'll have to replace it
He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling
Here
And Chewie
Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and whines
Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so only he can hear
(continuing) think we'd better replace the negative power coupling
Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve
It doesn't budge
Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her
She rebuffs him
Hey, Your Worship, 'm only trying to help
(still struggling) Would you please stop calling me that
Han hears a new tone in her voice
He watches her pull on the lever
Sure, Leia
Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes
do,  really do
You could be a little nicer, though
(he watches her reaction) Come on, admit it
Sometimes you think 'm all right
She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand
Occasionally
(a little smile, haltingly) when you aren't acting like a scoundrel
(laughs) Scoundrel
Scoundrel
like the sound of that
With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it
Stop that
Stop what
Leia is flushes, confused
Stop that
My hands are dirty
My hands are dirty, too
What are you afraid of
(looking right into his eyes) Afraid
Han looks at her with a piercing look
He's never looked more handsome, more dashing, more confident
He reaches out slowly and takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console
He draws it toward him
You're trembling
'm not trembling
Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him
very slowly
You like me because 'm a scoundrel
There aren't enough scoundrels in your life
Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words
happen to like nice men
'm a nice man
No, you're not
You're
He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips
He takes his time, as though he had forever, bending her body backward
She has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her faint
When he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk
Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly
Sir, sir
've isolated the reverse power flux coupling
Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace
Thank you
Thank you very much
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir
The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio
- The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently seeking its prey
'   - Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge window
Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control deck
Then slowly turns toward the bridge
Before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship commanders
One of these images, the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly
Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and continually disrupted by static
It is the image of Captain Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the Millennium Falcon
Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark Lord
(in hologram) and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes
Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed
No, Captain, they're alive want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found
The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to Admiral Piett
Lord Vader
Yes, Admiral, what is it
The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet
The Emperor commands you make contact with him
Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission
Yes, my lord
- ' Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars away from the rest of the fleet
'   - ' The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber
strange sound enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure
He looks up and bows quickly
twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before Vader
The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the cloak worn by Ben Kenobi
His voice is even deeper and more frightening than Vader's
What is thy bidding, my master
There is a great disturbance in the Force
have felt it
We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker
Yes, my master
He could destroy us
He's just a boy
Obi-Wan can no longer help him
The Force is strong with him
The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi
If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally
Yes
Yes
He would be a great asset
Can it be done
He will join us or die, my master
Vader kneels
The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord of the Sith and fades away
- '  - heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees
strange baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small lagoon
The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its thick glass windows
As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of the glowing portals
' Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very plain, but cozy dwelling
Everything is in the same small scale as the creature
The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower
He sits cross-legged on the floor of the living room
The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up an incredible meal
The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans
The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices
He rushes back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who watches the creature impatiently
Look, 'm sure it's delicious
just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now
Patience
For the Jedi it is time to eat as well
Eat, eat
Hot
Good food, hm
Good, hmm
Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down near the fire and serves himself from the pot
Tasting the unfamiliar concoction, he is pleasantly surprised
How far away is Yoda
Will it take us long to get there
Not far
Yoda not far
Patience
Soon you will be with him
(tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf,  cook
Why wish you become Jedi
Hm
Mostly because of my father, guess
Ah, your father
Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm
(a little angry) Oh, come on
How could you know my father
You don't even know who  am
(fed up) Oh,  don't know what 'm doing here
We're wasting our time
The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party
(irritated) cannot teach him
The boy has no patience
Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces
But there is no one there
The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking with Ben
' He will learn patience
Hmmm
Much anger in him, like his father
' Was  any different when you taught me
Hah
He is not ready
Yoda
am ready
Ben can be a Jedi
Ben, tell him 'm ready
Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low ceiling
Ready, are you
What know you of ready
For eight hundred years have  trained Jedi
My own counsel will  keep on who is to be trained
Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind
(to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have  watched
All his life has he looked away
to the future, to the horizon
Never his mind on where he was
Hmm
What he was doing
Hmph
Adventure
Heh
Excitement
Heh
Jedi craves not these things
(turning to Luke) You are reckless
Luke looks down
He knows it is true
' So was , if you'll remember
He is too old
Yes, too old to begin the training
Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice
But 've learned so much
Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned
After a long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben
(sighs) Will he finished what he begins
won't fail you - 'm not afraid
(turns slowly toward him) Oh, you will be
You will be
-   - The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid storm
Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing ships
One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid and explodes in a brilliant flash of light
-   - The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the control panel
Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat
She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the confusion he has created within her
Suddenly, something outside the cockpit window catches her eye
The reflection of the panel lights obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the windscreen
Leia moves closer to see what it might be
Large, yellow eyes flash open and stare back at her
Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her heart pounding
There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in an instant the eyes are gone
The young princess catches her breath, jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit
-   - The lights go bright for a second then out again
Threepio and Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires
Sir, if  may venture an opinion
'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio
Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into place
(out of breath) There's something out there
Where
Outside, in the cave
As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull
Chewie looks up and barks anxiously
There it is
Listen
Listen
'm going out there
Are you crazy
just got this bucket back together
'm not going to let something tear it apart
He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out
Leia follows
Then 'm going with you
think it might be better if stay here and guard the ship
(hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no
- It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is attacking the ship
Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave
This ground sure feels strange
It doesn't feel like rock at all
Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline of the cave
There's an awful lot of moisture in here
don't know
have a bad feeling about this
Yeah
Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's cockpit
five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of the Falcon
The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it with a laser bolt
(to Leia) Watch out
The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front of the princess
Han bends down to investigate the dead creature
Yeah, that's what  thought
Mynock
Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached
They're chewing on the power cables
Mynocks
Go on inside
We'll clean them off if there are any more
Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air
Leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the ship
Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster
Several of the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit window of the Falcon
Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence
Ohhh
Go away
Go away
Beastly little thing
Shoo
Shoo
Han looks around the strange, dripping cave
Wait a minute
He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave
The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle
Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han
The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their faces and run up the platform
-   - As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch
The ship continues to shake and heave
All right, Chewie, let's get out of here
The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel
Leia hurries after
The Empire is still out there
don't think it's wise to
Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit
(interrupting) No time to discuss this in committee
And with that he is gone
The main engines of the Falcon begin to whine
Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship
(angry) am not a committee
-   - Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle
The cave-quake has greatly diminished
You can't make the jump to light- speed in this asteroid field
Sit down, sweetheart
We're taking off
As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks
He notices something out the window ahead
Threepio sees it too
Look
see it,  see it
Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen surrounding the entrance
And as the Falcon moves forward, the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller
Han pulls hard on the throttle, sending his ship surging forward
We're doomed
The cave is collapsing
This is no cave
What
Leia's mouth drops open
She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny ship
Chewie howls
The Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth before the huge jaws slams closed
- The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon flies out of its mouth
The monster tilts its head, watching the starship fly away
- The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of the asteroid storm
- With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick vines that grow in the swamp
Panting heavily, he continues his course - climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in and out of the heavy ground fog
Run
Yes
Jedi's strength flows from the Force
But beware of the dark side
Anger
fear
aggression
The dark side of the Force are they
Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight
If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice
Vader
Is the dark side stronger
No
no
no
Quicker, easier, more seductive
But how am  to know the good side from the bad
You will know
When you are calm, at peace
Passive
Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack
But tell me why  can't
(interrupting) No, no, there is no why
Nothing more will  teach you today
Clear your mind of questions
Mmm
Mmmmmmmm
Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground
Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and pulls it on
He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few feet of water
Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on one side
Luke stares at the tree, trembling
There's something not right here
Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt
feel cold, death
That place
is strong with the dark side of the Force
domain of evil it is
In you must go
What's in there
Only what you take with you
Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda
He starts to strap on his weapon belt
Your weapons
you will not need them
Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no
"  Yoda shrugs
Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters the tree
- Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave
The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage
Holding his lit saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree
Luke draws a deep breath, then pushes deeper into the cave
The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it
His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness
It is very quiet here
Then, a loud
Darth Vader appears across the blackness, illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword
Immediately, he charges Luke, saber held high
He is upon the youth in seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword
Vader is decapitated
His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness
The metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops
For an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks vertically
The black helmet and breath mask fall away to reveal
Luke's head
Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in terror
The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision
-  - Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick
- ' Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its convoy of  fighters
'   -  - Vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a motley group of men and creatures
Admiral Piett and two controllers stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn
Bounty hunters
We don't need that scum
Yes, sir
Those Rebels won't escape us
second controller interrupts
Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger
Right
The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune hunters  There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle- scarred, mangy human types; -88, a battered, tarnished chrome war droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit
there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon
You are free to use any methods necessary, but want them alive
No disintegrations
As you wish
At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement
Lord Vader
My lord, we have them
,  - The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a firing Imperial Star Destroyer
large asteroid about the same size as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship
The tiny Falcon banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface
Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer
- The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window
Threepio checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches tensely out the window
Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field
Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side
-  ,  - The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship
The Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself
- Han corrects the angle of his ship
Let's get out of here
Ready for light-speed
One
two
three
Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens
Flak bursts continue to rock the ship
(frantic) It's not fair
Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and captain
Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle
The transfer circuits are working
It's not my fault
Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining
(almost expecting it) No light-speed
It's not my fault
Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield
One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for
Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever
Turn her around
Chewie barks in puzzlement
said turn her around
'm going to put all power in the front shield
You're going to attack them
Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer
Shut up
-   - The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn
In the next moment it is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the massive surface of the Imperial ship
As it moves across the surface of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous flak bursts
,  - The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge
The Imperials stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge area
Alarms go off everywhere
The Destroyer's commander, Captain Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes
They're moving to attack position
Shields up
Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window
At the last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight
All is quiet
Track them
They may come around for another pass
Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes
They can't have disappeared
No ship that small has a cloaking device
Well, there's no trace of them, sir
Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit
(drawing a breath) Get a shuttle ready
shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader
Meanwhile, continue to scan the area
Yes, Captain Needa
-  - Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain
He stands on his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet
Opposite Luke and Yoda are two rocks the size of bowling balls
Luke stares at the rocks and concentrates
One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to rest on the other
Use the Force
Yes
Yoda taps Luke's leg
Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground
His body wavers, but he maintains his balance
Artoo, standing nearby, is whistling and beeping frantically
Now
the stone
Feel it
Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock
It rises a few feet, shaking under the strain
But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping, Luke loses his balance and finally collapses
Yoda jumps clear
Concentrate
Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking urgently back and forth in front of him
Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the edge of the swamp
Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge
The -wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the lake's surface
Oh, no
We'll never get it out now
Yoda stamps his foot in irritation
So certain are you
Always with you it cannot be done
Hear you nothing that  say
Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship
Master, moving stones around is one thing
This is totally different
No
No different
Only different in your mind
You must unlearn what you have learned
(focusing, quietly) All right, 'll give it a try
No
Try not
Do
Or do not
There is no try
Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out
Slowly, the -wing's nose begins to rise above the water
It hovers for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again
(panting heavily) can't
It's too big
Size matters not
Look at me
Judge me by my size, do you
Hm
Mmmm
Luke shakes his head
And well you should not
For my ally in the Force
And a powerful ally it is
Life creates it, makes it grow
Its energy surrounds us and binds us
Luminous beings are we
(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder) not this crude matter
(a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you
(gesturing) Here, between you
me
the tree
the rock
everywhere
Yes, even between this land and that ship
(discouraged) You want the impossible
Quietly Yoda turns toward the -wing fighter
With his eyes closed and his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship
Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo beeps in terror and scoots away
The entire -wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore
Yoda stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the beach
Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore
He walks toward Yoda
don't
don't believe it
That is why you fail
Luke shakes his head, bewildered
- The fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star Destroyer, the Avenger
'   - Apology accepted, Captain Needa
Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader
Two stormtroopers pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing
If the Millennium Falcon went into light- speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now
Alert all commands
Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory
Yes, my lord
We'll find them
Don't fail me again, Admiral
Vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than when he arrived
Alert all commands
Deploy the fleet
- Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships
the Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction
No one on that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon
- Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far
(Chewie growls) No,  will not be quiet, Chewbacca
Why doesn't anyone listen to me
(to Chewie) The fleet is beginning to break up
Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw
Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin
really don't see how that is going to help
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances
The Empire may be gracious enough
Leia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence
Thank you
What did you have in mind for your next move
Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away
With the rest of the garbage
Then what
Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here
Got any ideas
No
Where are we
The Anoat system
Anoat system
There's not much there
No
Well, wait
This is interesting
Lando
He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel
Leia slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot
Small light points representing several systems flash by on the computer screen
Lando system
Lando's not a system, he's a man
Lando Calrissian
He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel
You'd like him
Thanks
Bespin
It's pretty far, but think we can make it
(reading from the computer) mining colony
Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine
Lando conned somebody out of it
We go back a long way, Lando and me
Can you trust him
No
But he has no love for the Empire,  can tell you that
Chewie barks over the intercom
Han quickly changes his readouts and stretches to look out the cockpit window
(into intercom) Here we go, Chewie
Stand by
Detach
Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile
She thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and she gives him a quick kiss
You do have your moments
Not many, but you have them
- As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it
Hidden among the refuse, the Falcon tumbles away
In the next moment, the Avenger roars off into hyperspace
The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races off into the distance
Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's ship appears and moves after the Falcon
-  -  - In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but his face shows less strain and more concentration than before
Yoda sits on the ground below the young warrior
On the other side of the clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air
Nearby Artoo watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air
His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, looking for help
Concentrate
feel the Force flow
Yes
Good
Calm, yes
Through the Force, things you will see
Other places
The future
the past
Old friends long gone
Luke suddenly becomes distressed
Han
Leia
The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then Luke himself tumbles over
(shaking his head) Hmm
Control, control
You must learn control
saw
saw a city in the clouds
Mmm
Friends you have there
They were in pain
It is the future you see
Future
Will they die
Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head
Difficult to see
Always in motion is the future
've got to go to them
Decide you must how to serve them best
If you leave now, help them you could
But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered
Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words
Gloom shrouds him as he nods his head sadly
-   - The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward the soft pink planet of Bespin
- It is down on the gaseous planet
Huge billowing clouds form a canyon as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's Cloud City
Suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon
The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship
- One of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak rocking the ship
Chewie barks his concern
(into transmitter) No,  don't have a landing permit
'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian
More flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's interior
Leia looks worried
(into transmitter) Whoa
Wait a minute
Let me explain
You will not deviate from your present course
Rather touchy, aren't they
thought you knew this person
Chewie barks and growls at his boss
(to Chewie) Well, that was a long time ago
'm sure he's forgotten about that
Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven
(into transmitter) Thank you
Angry, Han snaps off the intercom
Chewie looks at him and grunts
Han turns to the worried princess and her droid
There's nothing to worry about
We go way back, Lando and me
Leia doesn't look convinced
Who's worried
-   - The clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out of the cloud surface
The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the gleaming white metropolis
-   - With the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the Cloud City's platforms
- Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed
Behind them, Chewie, also armed, surveys the scene warily
Oh
No one to meet us
don't like this
Well, what would you like
Well, they did let us land
Look, don't worry
Everything's going to be fine
Trust me
-  - Lando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a group of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing platform
The group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection of aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions
Lando has a grim expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform
- See
My friend
(to Chewie) Keep your eyes open, okay
Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp
Lando and his men head across the bridge to meet the space pirate
- Lando stops ten feet from Han
The two men eye each other carefully
Lando shakes his head
Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler
You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled
Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me
" Lando moves threateningly toward Han
Suddenly, he throws his arms around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him
(laughs) How you doing, you old pirate
So good to see you
never thought 'd catch up with you again
Where you been
The two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling
-
Well, he seems very friendly
(wary) Yes
very friendly
- What are you doing here
(gestures toward the Falcon) Ahh
repairs
thought you could help me out
(in mock panic) What have you done to my ship
Your ship
Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square
Chewie growls a reserved greeting
Lando suddenly notices the princess and smiles
Hello
What have we here
Welcome
'm Lando Calrissian
'm the administrator of this facility
And who might you be
Leia
Welcome, Leia
Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand
All right, all right, you old smoothie
Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando
Hello, sir
am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations
My facilities are at your
Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city
Well, really
Lando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge, followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia
What's wrong with the Falcon
Hyperdrive
'll get my people to work on it
Good
Lando turns to Leia
You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times
She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy
- The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city
They walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and passing many small plazas as they go
Threepio lags a bit behind
How's the gas mine
Is it paying off for you
Oh, not as well as 'd like
We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient
And 've had supply problems of every kind
've had labor difficulties
(catches Han grinning at him) What's so funny
You
Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader
Who'd have thought that, huh
Lando is reflective
He looks at Han a moment
You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things
Yeah
(shakes his head) Yeah
'm responsible these days
It's the price you pay for being successful
Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the corridor
The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming out of a door
Oh
Nice to see a familiar face
(mumbles) chu ta
How rude
Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away
Then he hears the muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the room
- Curious, Threepio enters the room
That sounds like an R2 unit in there
wonder if
Threepio walks through the doorway to the main room
He looks in
Hello
How interesting
Oh, my
' (from within) Who are you
Oh, 'm terribly sorry didn't mean to intrude
No, no, please don't get up
No
laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions
Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door whooshes closed behind him
- Lando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio's dreadful accident
Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but shrugs his shoulders and follows the group
-  - In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the belly of the ship
Artoo sits on top of the -wing, settling down into his cubbyhole
Yoda stands nearby on a log
Luke
You must complete the training
can't keep the vision out of my head
They're my friends
've got to help them
You must not go
But Han and Leia will die if don't
' You don't know that
Luke looks toward the voice in amazement
Ben has materialized as a real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda
The power of his presence stops Luke
Even Yoda cannot see their fate
But  can help them
feel the Force
But you cannot control it
This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force
Yes, yes
To Obi-Wan you listen
The cave
Remember your failure at the cave
But 've learned so much since then
Master Yoda,  promise to return and finish what 've begun
You have my word
It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants
that is why your friends are made to suffer
And that is why  have to go
Luke,  don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way  lost Vader
You won't
Stopped they must be
On this all depends
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor
If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil
Patience
And sacrifice Han and Leia
If you honor what they fight for yes
Luke is in great anguish
He struggles with the dilemma, a battle raging in his mind
If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone
cannot interfere
understand
(he moves to his -wing) Artoo, fire up the converters
Artoo whistles a happy reply
Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side
Luke nods and climbs into his ship
Strong is Vader
Mind what you have learned
Save you it can
will
And 'll return
promise
Artoo closes the cockpit
Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of the engines and the wind engulf them
(sighs) Told you,  did
Reckless is he
Now matters are worse
That boy is our last hope
(looks up) No
There is another
- Luke's tiny -wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and off into space
-   - Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in agitation
She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a lovely dress
Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons
She moves from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the doorway
The ship is almost finished
Two or Three more things and we're in great shape
The sooner the better
Something's wrong here
No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio
He's been gone too long to have gotten lost
Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead
Relax
'll talk to Lando and see what  can find out
don't trust Lando
Well,  don't trust him, either
But he is my friend
Besides, we'll soon be gone
And then you're as good as gone, aren't you
Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face
- The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts
Four Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten metal
Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt
Chewie enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting Threepio's head
The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, then reaches to grab the head
But the Ugnaught tosses it away from him to another Ugnaught
This game of keep-away goes on until Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the ground
-   - The door zaps open
Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge
What happened
Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation
Where
Found him in a junk pile
Oh, what a mess
Chewie, do you think you can repair him
The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts
He looks at the princess and shrugs sadly
Lando's got people who can fix him
No, thanks
There is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando
'm sorry
Am  interrupting anything
Not really
You look absolutely beautiful
You truly belong here with us among the clouds
(coolly) Thank you
Will you join me for a little refreshment
Han looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of food and licks his lips
Everyone's invited, of course
Leia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go
Lando spots Threepio's remains
Having trouble with you droid
Han and Leia exchange a quick glance
No
No problem
Why
Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and Chewie
The door slides closed behind them
-  - Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance behind
Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, pure-white columns
So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the
uh
jurisdiction of the Empire
So you're part of the mining guild then
No, not actually
Our operation is small enough not to be noticed
which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves
The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at the far end
Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down
That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here
But things have developed that will insure security
've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever
- The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the dining room
At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader
Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty hunter
Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a couple of shots directly at Vader
The Dark Lord quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they explode harmlessly
Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's hand
The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of him
We would be honored if you would join us
Han gives Lando a mean look
had no choice
They arrived right before you did
'm sorry
'm sorry, too
' - - Luke's -wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City
' - - Luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin's shining city
Artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope
(into comlink) No, Threepio's with them
Artoo whistles another worried inquiry
(into comlink) Just hang on
We're almost there
- Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell
The stark room is flooded with hot light
To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle screeches loudly
Chewie is going mad
He hits the wall with giant fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor
The upper lights go off abruptly
The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a wall, where he listens for a moment
Then, moaning to himself, he moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie
He picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, barking a few philosophical remarks
Chewie sticks the robot's head on its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits
Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches two connectors together
Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible
Mmmm
Oh, my
Uh, , uh - Take this off
, uh, don't mean to intrude here
, don't, no, no, no
Please don't get up
No
Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry head
He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio immediately begins speaking normally
Stormtroopers
Here
We're in danger
must tell the others
Oh, no
've been shot
- Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an elaborate torture mechanism
Han is strapped to a rack which tilts forward onto the torture device
Vader activates the mechanism, creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face
The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a sharp, piercing cry of agony
Darth Vader moves to the holding chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him
- Lord Vader
(to Fett) You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after  have Skywalker
Han's screams filter through the torture room door
He's no good to me dead
He will not be permanently damaged
Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee
They must never again leave this city
That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter
Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly
No
Good
It would be unfortunate if had to leave a garrison here
Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett
Lando walks swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself
This deal's getting worse all the time
- Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together
One arm is connected, but the legs are yet to be attached
There is one small problem, however
It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's head on backwards
Oh, yes, that's very good
like that
Oh
Something's not right because now  can't see
Wait
Wait
Oh, my
what have you done
'm backwards, you stupid furball
Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough
Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a circuit and the droid shuts down
The Wookiee smells something and sits up
The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is shoved into the room by two stormtroopers
Barking his concern, the huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug
Han is very pale, with dark circles under his eyes
feel terrible
Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open revealing Leia
She, too, looks a little worse for wear
The troopers push her into the cell, and the door slides closed
She moves to Han, who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking his head
Why are they doing this
They never even asked me any questions
The cell door slides open
Lando and two of his guards enter
Lando
Get out of here, Lando
Shut up and listen
Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me
Over to you
They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe
What about Han
Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter
Vader wants us all dead
He doesn't want you at all
He's after somebody called Skywalker
Luke
Lord Vader has set a trap for him
Leia's mind is racing
And we're the bait
Well, he's on his way
Han's rage peaks
Perfect
You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you
(spits it out) My friend
Han hauls off and punches Lando
The two friends are instantly engaged in a frantic close-quarters fight
The guards hit Han with their rifle butts and he flies across the room
Chewie growls and starts for the guards
They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando stops them
Stop
've done all  can
'm sorry  couldn't do better, but have my own problems
Yeah, you're a real hero
Lando and the guards leave
Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia and Chewie help him up
(dabs at his wound) You certainly have a way with people
- - Four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks
In the middle of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform
Darth Vader and Lando stand near the platform
This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor
An Imperial soldier appears
Lord Vader, ship approaching
-wing class
Good
Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land
The soldier bows and leaves the chamber
Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing
If you put him in there, it might kill him
do not want the Emperor's prize damaged
We will test it
on Captain Solo
Lando's face registers dismay
-   -  ' - Luke's -wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city
' - - Encountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern
- - There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform
Six Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use
special coffinlike container is put in place
With Boba Fett in the lead, a squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie
Strapped to Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is Threepio
Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see what is happening
His one attached arm is animate and expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes
The remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack
If only you had attached my legs, wouldn't be in this ridiculous position
Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish
(to Lando) What's going on
buddy
You're being put into carbon freeze
Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader
What if he doesn't survive
He's worth a lot to me
The Empire will compensate you if he dies
Put him in
Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han
Within seconds, other Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee with their laser weapons
From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm
Oh, no
No, no, no
Stop, Chewbacca, stop
The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face
Stop, Chewie, stop
Do you hear me
Stop
Yes, stop, please
'm not ready to die
Han breaks away from his captors
Vader nods to the guards to let him go and the pirate breaks up the fight
Chewie
Chewie, this won't help me
Hey
Han gives the Wookiee a stern look
Save your strength
There'll be another time
The princess - you have to take care of her
You hear me
Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell
In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too distraught to protest
Han turns to Princess Leia
They look sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a final, passionate kiss
love you
know
Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to the hydraulic platform
Han looks one final time at his friends - and then, suddenly, the platform drops
Chewie howls
Leia turns away in agony
Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him
Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace
Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure
What
what's going on
Turn round, Chewbacca,  can't see
Oh
they've encased him in carbonite
He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is
Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an angry glance and bark
huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate out of the vat and stands him on the platform
Some Ugnaughts rush over and push the block over onto the platform
They slide the coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it inside
They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step away
Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat
He shakes his head in relief
Well, Calrissian, did he survive
Yes, he's alive
And in perfect hibernation
Vader turns to Boba Fett
He's all yours bounty hunter
Reset the chamber for Skywalker
Skywalker has just landed, my lord
Good
See to it that he finds his way here
Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship
You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision
am altering the deal
Pray don't alter it any further
Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia, Chewie, and Threepio
-  - As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a group of people coming down a side hallway
Artoo lets out an excited series of beeps and whistles
Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops in his tracks with a feeble squeak
Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the floating, encased body of Han Solo
Two stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot Luke and open fire on him
The youth draws his weapon and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot
The two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a huge chunk of wall
Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, Han, and the guards are gone
think metal door blocks the passage
Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a second hallway by several other stormtroopers
Leia turns just in time to see Luke
Luke
Luke, don't - it's a trap
It's a trap
Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears from sight
Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing behind
- Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings
Leia and the others are nowhere to be seen
Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit
Several more doors clang shut, echoing through the chamber
- Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door
He whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the other direction
- -  - Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam
Seeing an opening above him, he stops to look up
As he does, the platform he stands on begins to move
- - Luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform
The room is deathly quiet
Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else seems to be in the large room
Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway
Steam begins to build up in the chamber
Looking up through the steam, Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him
Luke holsters his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader
He feels confident, eager to engage his enemy
The Force is with you, young Skywalker
But you are not a Jedi yet
Luke ignites his sword in answer
In an instant, Vader's own sword is lit
Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow
Again Luke attacks, and the swords of the two combatants clash in battle
- Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, guarded by six stormtroopers
The group reaches an intersection where Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention
The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers
Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia and one to Lando
Well done
Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet
Move
As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to undo Chewie's binding
What do you think you're doing
We're getting out of here
knew all along it had to be a mistake
Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him
Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you
Lando tries to free himself from Chewie
(choking) had no choice
Chewie barks ferociously
(to Chewie) What are you doing
Trust him, trust him
Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie
He had no choice
'm just trying to help
We don't need any of your help
(choking) -a-a-a
What
It sounds like Han
There's still a chance to save Han
mean, at the East Platform
Chewie
Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back
(to Lando) 'm terribly sorry about all this
After all, he's only a Wookiee
-    -  ' The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of the bounty hunter's ship
Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to the cargo hold
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold
And with that, the door slams shut
- Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly
Artoo
Artoo
Where have you been
Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be spun out of sight of his friend
Turn around, you wooly
(to Artoo) Hurry, hurry
We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter
Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing group
Well, at least your still in one piece
Look what happened to me
- An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform
Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset sky
In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship
Oh, no
Chewie, they're behind you
laser bolt explodes near the princess
Everyone turns to see what Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them
Artoo peeks out from the elevator
Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break for the elevator
Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge
Lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice
They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons
But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator
Once they are inside, the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward
- - Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the chamber
Their swords clash, the platform sways
Luke aggressively drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics
You have learned much, young one
You'll find 'm full of surprises
Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and sending it flying
Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself
Losing his balance, Luke rolls down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform
There he sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken
Just in time he looks up to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him
Luke rolls away as Vader lands
Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his enemy
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker
Obi-Wan knew this to be true
No
Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly
All the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord
Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and falls back into the opening
There is a rumble, and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision
Vader turns aside and deactivates his sword
All to easy
Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought
Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward
Liquid metal begins to pour into the pit
Vader turns around - and then looks up
He sees Luke, who has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the carbonite outlet
Impressive
most impressive
Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the steaming carbonite pit
He raises his hand
His sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly ignited
Vader immediately lights his sword as well
Obi-Wan has taught you well
You have controlled your fear
now release your anger
Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger
He begins to retreat as Vader goads him on
As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he has been foolhardy
quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back
Another exchange and Vader retreats
Luke presses forward
Only your hatred can destroy me
Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader
He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to fill up with steam
Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword
Vader blocks the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes
The energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of collapse
Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of Vader
He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit
- Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the reactor room
He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as Vader enters
Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack
Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back
Luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him
Using the Force, Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield
large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke
He deflects it
Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth
Small tools and equipment come flying at him
Bombardment from all sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised
Finally, one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window
fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader
piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window
-    - Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his deactivated sword in hand
He puts the sword on his belt and begins to scramble up
- Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the door to the landing platform
They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a moment before the door slams shut
The group ducks into an alcove as stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor
The troopers send a rain of laser bolts at the group
Chewie returns their fire as Lando punches desperately at the door's control panel
The security codes has been changed
Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system
Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel
Artoo beeps and scoots toward it
Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's intercom
Attention
This is Lando Calrissian
The Empire has takes control of the city
advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive
Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the socket
Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream
Artoo's circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out underneath him
Quickly, Chewie pulls him away
This way
Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor
As he scoots along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way
Don't blame me
'm an interpreter
'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal
- In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city
Some carry boxes, others packages
They run, then change direction
Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide
Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back at them
Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude
What are you talking about
We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon
It's fixed
Just open the door, you stupid lump
Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor
triumphant beep from Artoo - and the door snaps open
(to Artoo) never doubted you for a second
Wonderful
Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes outside
-   - They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers reaches the main door
Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the droids get on board with Chewie
As Chewie bounds to the ship the Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp
Ouch
Oh
Ah
That hurt
Bend down, you thoughtless
Ow
Chewie starts up the ship
The giant engines begin to whine as Lando and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire
Leia
Go
- Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the Falcon
thought that hairy beast would be the end of me
Of course, 've looked better
Artoo beeps understandingly
- Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches over their shoulders
As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship begins to move
-   - The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars away from the city
Troops fire after it and  fighters take off in pursuit
-    - Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room
Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet Vader's
Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke backward toward the gantry
You are beaten
It is useless to resist
Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did
Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder
The black armor sparks and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers
Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword
Luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry
Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward
Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away
At that instant, Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying
In great pain, Luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end
Vader follows
The wind subsides
Luke holds on
There is nowhere else to go
There is no escape
Don't make me destroy you
You do not yet realize your importance
You have only begun to discover your power
Join me and  will complete your training
With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy
'll never join you
If you only knew the power of the dark side
Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father
He told me enough
It was you who killed him
No
am your father
Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief
No
No
That's not true
That's impossible
Search your feelings
You know it to be true
No
No
No
Luke
You can destroy the Emperor
He has foreseen this
It is your destiny
Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son
Come with me
It is the only way
Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke
calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision
In the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space
The Dark Lord looks over the platform and sees Luke falling far below
The wind begins to blow at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge
The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab onto anything to break his fall
Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft
When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform
Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe
He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet hit a circular grill and knock it open
Luke claws at the surface of the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space
-   - Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the undermost part of Cloud City
Reaching out desperately, he manages to grab onto on electronic weather vane
Ben
Ben, please
Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down
He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments
All the while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust pipe
Ben
Leia
There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below
Hear me
Leia
- Leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled
Chewie is busy operating the ship
Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a readout on the control panel
Luke
We've got to go back
Chewie growls in surprise
What
know where Luke is
But what about those fighter
Chewie barks in agreement with Lando
Chewie, just do it
But what about Vader
Chewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl
All right, all right, all right
-   - The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City
- Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the Falcon disappears
The wind blows at his cape
He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing platform
Bring my shuttle
- Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his body shifts in the wind
- The Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city
Three fighter close in on the starship
Leia tries to remain calm
(pointing out the cockpit window) Look, someone's up there
It's Luke
Chewie, slow down
Slow down and we'll get under him
Lando, open the top hatch
Lando rushes out of the cockpit
- Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane
He slips from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks toward him
The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up through the opening of the hatch
Luke begins to slide and finally falls from the vane into space
- Out the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the city
The ship gains on him
Okay
Easy, Chewie
The Falcon closes in on Luke
Three  fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away
- The hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure
Lando reaches out to help the battered warrior inside the ship
- Flak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city
Leia and Chewie struggle with the controls
(into intercom) Lando
(over intercom) Okay, let's go
The Falcon races away
It is closely followed by three  fighters, all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship
- Explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly
Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship
Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the cockpit supported by Lando
Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie barks in joyous relief
Oh, Leia
All right, Chewie
Let's go
Leia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship
-   - The Falcon, still followed by the three  fighters, races away from the cloud-covered city
- Luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff
Leia gently wipes his face
The ship lurches again
'll be back
She kisses him, then leaves the quarters
- All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound
Lando anxiously watches the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some switches
Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing on the panel
Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the shape
Star Destroyer
All right, Chewie
Ready for light-speed
If your people fixed the hyperdrive
Another explosion rocks the ship
Leia notices as a green light on the panel next to her flashes on
All the coordinates are set
It's now or never
Chewie barks in agreement
Punch it
The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle
The sound of the ion engine changes
it is winding up
Faces are tense, expectant
But nothing happens, and the engine goes off
Chewie lets out a frustrated howl
The flak still violently rocks the ship
They told me they fixed it trusted them to fix it
It's not my fault
Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit
He gives Lando and angry shove as he storms past him
In the distance the  fighters continue their chase, still shooting lasers
Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly following the Falcon
'   - Vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as Admiral Piett approaches him
They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, my lord
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon
Yes, my lord
Good
Prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun
Yes, my lord
Beeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires to Threepio who now has one leg attached
Chewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself
Noisy brute
Why don't we just go into light-speed
Artoo beeps in response
We can't
How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated
Artoo whistles knowingly
The city's central computer told you
Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer
Ouch
Pay attention to what you're doing
Chewie is in the pit
He is trying to loosen something with an enormous wrench
Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits the panel
- Leia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly sprayed by a shower of sparks
'   - Vader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium Falcon is chased by the  fighters
As his Destroyer draws nearer, Vader's breathing gets slightly faster
Luke
- Luke realizes that Vader's ship is very near
He feels resigned to his fate
He senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically
Father
'   - Son, come with me
- (moaning) Ben, why didn't you tell me
- Lando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon
Meanwhile, in the ship's hold, Chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive mechanism
(into intercom) Chewie
The Falcon races through space followed very closely by the fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer
- Luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window
He is almost unconscious with pain and depression
It's Vader
'   - Luke
it is your destiny
- Ben, why didn't you tell me
'   - Alert all commands
Ready for the tractor beam
- Artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board
Furious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling
Artoo, come back at once
You haven't finished with me yet
You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive
Chewbacca can do it
'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur
Artoo moves a circuit on a control panel
Suddenly, the control panel lights up
- Leia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the Millennium Falcon unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace
- The ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of Chewie
Oh, you did it
The Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer which seems, by contrast, to stand still
'   - Admiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in terror
Vader turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back in a contemplative gesture
- The Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking tube
Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel transport ship hovers near the fleet
- Lando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the comlink
Chewie busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff
(into comlink) Luke, we're ready for takeoff
(over comlink) Good luck, Lando (into comlink) When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you
- Luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand
Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window
(into comlink) 'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine
- (into comlink) Princess, we'll find Han promise
- (into comlink) Chewie, 'll be waiting for your signal
Chewie's wail comes over the comlink
(into comlink) Take care, you two
May the Force be with you
Luke looks down at his hand
metalized type of bandage has been wrapped around his wrist
The medical droid makes some adjustments in a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke's fingers
Ow
Luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it
His hand is completely functional
He gets up and walks over to Leia
There is a new bond between them, a new understanding
Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about his uncertain and newly complicated future
Together they stand at the large window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star Cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space
Luke puts his arm around Leia
The droids stand next to them, and Threepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him
The group watches as the Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and zooms away into space
- While Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship
Slowly, the cruiser turns and moves away into space
