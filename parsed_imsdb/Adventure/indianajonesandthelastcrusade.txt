Some of the passageways in here can run for miles
Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff
- The two boys head down the passageway
It's dark, and the temperature drops several degrees
Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair

The    now as the boys get closer to their source
The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead
The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden
What is it
This is what they see: digging with shovels and pick-axes
They have broken into one of the pueblo's

And the fourth man wears a    and He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet anything that this is
However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is someone else

Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young
Alfred, did you get anything yet
Nothing

Two of the men stand and look at  who steps forward holding a box in his hands

He's got our thing

The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his back teeth

Now we glimpse
The passenger in the car

Suddenly he looks worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt,     and tosses it away

Indy kicks at him
Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to

He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar

The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge
Things get even more serious when Roscoe

Finally, he raises his head and as the horn  through the wood only inches from 's head

Rising slowly to its feet

The boxcar walls shake
Indy gasps
Dust swirls up into the shafts of sunlight
And  has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged from his belt during the fall

He carefully takes it down by the handle
The Lion sees this and

He leans over and kisses her cheek

, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise
He moistens his finger with champagne and rubs it over the tablet
steps up next to Indy
: (3) Hard to resist, isn't it
The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail
What good is it
This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons
Pretty vague
Where do you start looking
Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on
But the entire top portion is missing
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway
has to shake his head at 's apparent lack of judgment
Let me tell you another "bedtime story, " Doctor Jones
After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade
Three brothers, to be exact
've heard this one as well
Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France
But only one of them made it
And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to ato a Franciscan friar,  think
Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones
produces an  -  with very brittle pages
views the manuscript with considerable interest
: (4) This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story
it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, 'm afraid
but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would
(indicates the Tablet) This Tablet is one of those "markers
" It proves the Knight's story is true
But as you pointed outit's incomplete
(beat) Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother
Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy
(beat) As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago
We're only one step away
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet
You could be more right than you know
Yes
We've hit a snag
our project leader has vanished
Along with all his research
Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him
(beat) want you to pick up the trail where he left off
Find the man and you will find the Grail
: (5) You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan
Why don't you try my father
(after a pause) We already have
Your father is the man who's disappeared
- speeds down the tree-lined street

Your father and  have been friends since time began

And 've watched the two of you grow apart

They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar
They exchange a quick look of concern as they enter
- approaches the half-open front door

He's not a field mans He pushes open the door

Dear God

But whatever it is, he's in over his head
picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk
Dad
It's today's mail
And it's been opened
turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes
Then something hits him
Mail
That's it, Marcus
He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark
(as he tears it open) Venice, Italy
What is it
uncovers a small book
It looks like a  or Indy flips through it: Page after page of handwritten notes and drawings
glances at it with great curiosity
It's Dad's Grail Diary
Every clue he ever followed
Every discovery he made
complete record of his search for the Holy Grail
This is his whole life
Why would he have sent this to me
: (2) don't know
But someone must want it pretty badly
Do you believe, Marcus
As  asks the question, he turns to a  on the wall:  depiction of Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice
on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff
One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands
Do you believe the Grail actually exists
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us
sees that  is unsatisfied by this response
But if you want facts, Indy, have none to give you
At my age, 'm prepared to take a few things on faith
Call Donovan, Marcus

He was as giddy as a schoolboy
Who
Attila the Professor
He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy

Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy himself right now
As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower from a street vendor
He holds it out to Elsa

gives her the flower
It would make me very happy
But 'm already sadby tomorrow it will have faded
Tomorrow 'll steal you another
(cutting in) hate to interrupt youbut the reason we're here (interrupting) Yes
have something to show you
She hands a slip of paper to
: (2) left your father working in the library
He sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city
When  got back to his tablehe'd gonewith all his papersexcept for that scrap which  found near his chair
extends the scrap of paper to
Roman numerals
- leads  and  into the large piazza
People walk about and sit at tables in front of a large building
Here is the library
They have arrived at the front steps of the library
That doesn't look much like a library
It looks like a converted church
leads the way inside
- ,  and  enter, their heels  across the marble floor
We notice, along with  and , that the library contains many stained- glass windows
In this case it's the literal truth
We're on holy ground
These columns over here
She indicates     that go from floor to ceiling
were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades
: glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a Knight of the Crusades
Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window
Now please excuse me
The library's closing in a few moments
'll arrange for us to stay a little longer
The minute  is out of earshot
MarcusI've seen this window before
Where
whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the airplane
Right here
In Dad's Diary
You see
glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design
Look, Indy
The Roman numerals
Dad was onto something here
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean
and  now see  approaching
Indy quickly tucks the Diary back into his pocket
(explaining to Brody) My dad sent me this Diary for a reason
Until we find out why, suggest we keep it to ourselves
Find something
doesn't reply
He's looking in five directions at once
His eyes moving across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery
: (2) (to ) Uh, yes
Three, seven and tent That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals
My God,  must be blind Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb
he was looking for the Tomb itself wears a blank expression
Don't you get it
The Tomb is somewhere in the library
You said yourself it used to be a church
Look
's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns
Three
looks again to the stained-glass window
He points
Three
has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral
Indy hurries away toward Column
All  and  can do now is try to keep up with him
Seven
He points again to the stained-glass window
Seven
Ten
He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands
And ten
Now where's the ten
Look around for the ten
walks past aisles of book-lined shelves
He stops, turns, then looks down
: (3) Three, seven and ten
He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a  and looks down at  and The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge ""visible only from this higher angle
Ten
(wryly; to himself) "" marks the spot
rushes down the staircase and goes to the   where the two sides of the  intersect
He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot
rushes past  to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath the stained-glass window
raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book
The Librarian regards the stamper curiously
continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still puzzled by the   through the library
Finally  breaks the tile
As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a -
Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole
Bingo
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones
You're a great deal like your father
Except he's lost, and 'm not
Lower me down
is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole
When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to
Look after this for me, will you
Then  disappears into the hole
- jumps down a steep step
He reaches back to help
Come on
and  glance around
This is really a horrid place
Dark and dank
foul smelling
Elsa turns
She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design
and  inspect markings carved onto the walls
Pagan symbols
Fourth or Fifth Century
Right
Six hundred years before the Crusades
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later
takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway
That's right
If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him
- carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an unsuspecting
One of the Men, , raises his gun and brings it down hard on Brody's head
Ohhhh
gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious
The other two men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles
- rest in niches carved into the stone walls
Grotesque skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones
holds the lighter up as he and  inspect symbols carved into the walls
: spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize
As she blows away some cobwebs: What's this one
only has to give it a quick glance to know
The Ark of the Covenant
Are you sure
(deadpan) Pretty sure
holds the lighter up and he and  enter another dark passageway
steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone
He scrapes the cobwebs away to reveal the   "
" Watch out
now holds the lighter as  rams his shoulder into the wall
The wall collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room
- as  falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling, green, slimy liquid
More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches
holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall
Petroleum
could sink a well down here and retire
reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water
uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then dips into the oily water
Give me the lighter
Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way,  and  come upon a
The water is knee-deep and Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs
Squirming
Thrashing in the water
Oh, rats
gasps as the rats scamper between her legs
moves forward through the rat-infested water as  follows, still gasping in horror
Suddenly he slips into a hole
Recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa
Come onl She gasps once again, terrified
lifts her and carries  as he moves forward
- and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water
More rat-infested water as , now walking again, follows  through another passageway lined with skulls and bones
reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions
He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to 's side
He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same
Come here
The chamber is flooded with black, briny water
Look
In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an "island altar" on which    rest
They move toward the altar
: and  begin to inspect the ornately carved  like the scholars of antiquity that they are
These are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass
It must be one of these
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork
One coffin is elevated above the others
It's this one
Together they begin to push on the lidSTRAINING and  until it slides away and  against the stone platform
lie the   of a
and  look in
Elsa gasps
This is itl we found it
Look the engraving on the Shield
It's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker
unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield
What's that
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet
The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield
Just like your fathergiddy as a schoolboy
laughs
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this
(chuckles) He never would have made it past the rats
He hates rats
He's scared to death of them
- as it lights a match
dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick water
holds the torch
looks around
Listens
Something is wrong
And then he sees the    dancing across the Catacomb walls
This is followed by     from around the corner of the Narrow Passageway,  toward  and  and as they approach
The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to escape a: around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick; consuming the oxygen
Get back
Back against the wall
braces his back against the altar and    with his feet
It  against the stone platform and  into the water
Quick
Under it
They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin
Air pocket
hesitates
literally  her and pushes her underneath
surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin,  and Now  pops up into the air pocket
He looks at ELSAthey are both soaking wet
Don't wander off
: What
disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin
What
swims, looking for an escape route
The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on , who squirms and screams in terror
pops back up through the water
think 've found a way out
Deep breath
groans
They take a deep breath and both dive under the water
-   - The perfect picture postcardSt
Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond
Cafe customers are startled to see  and  climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly
Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles
(wryly) Ah, Venicel Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since  and are running towards them with drawn guns
He grabs  by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and - fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock
but not before a Turkish Agent  in with him
grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while  and the Turk trade punches
- Indy's Speedboat  across the choppy waters heading in the direction of the
and his men rush to    tied to the dock
They chase after
grapples with the Turkish Agent
As Indy grips his arms, we  a  in the Agent's hand
It
As  fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him and two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes
, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent
(to ) Are you crazy
You don't go between them
can barely hear  over the noise of the motor
Go between them
Are you crazy
finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard
Turning, Indy sees that  has committed the speedboat to a course the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat
said go around
You said go between them
said don't go between them
It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls
-   - One Enemy Speedboat chases  between the two Freighters
But the Speedboat containing  veers off and goes around
- It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever closer to one another
Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap
But the Enemy Speedboat  as it is crushed between the two Freighters, and  back down into the water
spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see '  appear racing toward them
He stands in the moving boat,     at and
' matches Indy's move for move
- The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side from Kazim's boat  the wood of Indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat
The machine gun runs out of ammunition
puts it down and takes control of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him
As Indy's boat drifts toward the ,   at the  of , Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them steps into Kazim's boat
He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then turns his attention to
The two men trade punches as the boat spins helplessly in the churning water
No
kicks  in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being      toward the Steamer's giant propeller blades
Why are you trying to kill us
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail
My father was looking for the Holy Grail
Did you kill him too
No
Where is he
Talkor you're dead
Damn it, tell me
Tell me
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die
: Then we'll die
My soul is prepared
How's yours
By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are getting closer
This is your last chance
No, Doctor Jones
It's yours
The wind of the blades is on their necks
grabs  just in time and jumps
into the motorboat, driven by , which gets alongside in the nick of time
All right
Where's my father If you let me go,  will tell you where he is
Who are you
My name is Kazim
And why were you trying to kill me
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years
And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe
pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark
or is it a tattoo
Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword
Let me get off at this jetty
The boat is close to the edge of the canal
gives  a nod, telling her to bring the boat in
steps ashore
: (2) Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ
Is it for His glory, or for yours
didn't come for the Cup of Christ
came to find my father
In that case, God be with you in your quest
Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border
walks away
- -  : The rubbing taken from the shield of the Grail Knight
is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack
How's the head
It's better, now 've seen this
It's the name of a city
"Alexandretta
" Hmmm
, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression
The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year
The entire city was destroyed
lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins
Marcus you remember what the Grail Tablet said
"Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon
" (pause) But where exactly
: Your father would know
Your father did know
Look
He made a map
picks up the Grail Diary
He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail Quest
map with no names
:  - It covers two pages of the Diary
's finger moves across it
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east
Here
He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains
Here
Straight to the canyon
He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city
(solemnly) Alexandretta
Now we know
Yes
Now we know
(rising) Marcus, get hold of Sallah
Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun
closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe
What about you
'm going after Dad
'  - opens the door
His bedroom has been ransacked
the mattress on the floor, the drawers turned out
- approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks
Elsa
He goes in
'  - and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own
The room is empty
He is worried for her, knocks and calls out: Elsa
He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door
Elsa
He opens the bathroom door, peering inside
Elsa
'  - Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe
She gasps, startled, as enters
He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub
'  - joins , waiting in the ransacked room
she looks around in shock
My room
Mine, too
What were they looking for
She looks to , who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket
This
: The Grail Diary
Uh-huh
You had it
You didn't trust me
She looks hurt and beautiful
She comes closer to him
didn't know you
She's awfully hard to resist
At least  let you tag along
Oh, yes
Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere
Knock it off
You're not mad
No
No
You like the way  do things
It's lucky  don't do things the same way
You'd still be standing at the Venice pier
She stomps her foot angrily
flinches
She starts to walk away but Indy grabs her
Look, what do you think is going on here
Since 've met you, 've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait
We're caught in the middle of something sinister here
My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for
And until 'm sure, 'm going to continue to do things the way think they should be done
: (2) He pulls her to him and kisses her
How dare you kiss me
Now  reaches for  and kisses him
Leave me alone
don't like fast women
But he embraces her, and  begins to nibble at his ear
And  hate arrogant men
smiles slyly as they fall to the bed
- as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past Indy's window
'  - lies on top of , kissing her
He stops for a moment as he hears the Ahh, Venice
reaches up and pulls him back down to her
- Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves
This is that charts their course from Venice across Austria toward Salzburg
- Storm clouds darken the skies
in the distance; lightning flashes
The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the formidable stone castle
What do you know about this place
know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors
- - reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip
What are you going to do
Don't know
Think of something
He glances up to the beret  is wearing
She reaches up and adjusts it
- walks to the door and opens it to reveal  and  standing outside in the rain
she now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret
Yes
, followed by , steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat
He adopts a Scottish accent
And not before time
Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day
We're drenched
As  says this he pushes his way past the startled , pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket
follows, taking off her coat Now look
've gone and caught a sniffle
dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as  looks on in amused amazement
(coldly; with Austrian accent) Are you expected
Don't take that tone with me, my good man
Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries
(') : Tapestries
Dear me, the man is dense
This is a castle, isn't it
There are tapestries
This is a castle
And we have many tapestries
But if you're a Scottish lord, then  am Mickey Mouse
How dare he
Simultaneously knocking the  cold with one slug on the jaw
The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold
- and  move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway
Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of working around a large table with a map atop it
reacts to the sight of them
(to ; softly) Nazis
hate these guys
and  continue down the hallway
Indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt
He steps to a closed door and listens
This one
think he's in here
How do you know
points out an
Because it's wired
He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other doors
He knocks at the doorthere is no response
He looks back at  and enters
- The room is dark and empty
throws open the window shutters and looks out
comes down in sheets
There is a wide ledge beneath each window but below that is a
Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge, which is several yards away
Indy
Indy
reassures her
Don't worry
this is kid's play
'll be right back
He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window
He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight
- from the window to the stone gargoyle
seals the window
takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet
swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended as a    disguises the noise
- into the room
The broken shutters hang by their hinges
Rain and cold air whip through the open window
No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a Stunned,  sinks to one knee
and Indy's father,   , steps out of the shadows
Junior
gets to his feet
(a reflex) Yes, sirl : This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part
Now they look at each other
It is you Junior
(an old familiar irritation) Don't call me that, please
(amazed) But what are you doing here
came to get you
What do you think
approaching
and  press themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand
steps to the window and looks down
moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look
(sotto, mumbled) Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty
is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand
Father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments
Oh, it breaks the heart
(quietly to himself) And the head
(to , aggrievedly) You hit me, Dad
(referring to the vase) 'll never forgive myself (surprised, misunderstanding) Don't worryI'm fine
Thank God
: (2) has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase
he is examining the broken end carefully
it's fake
See, you can tell by the cross section
throws the vase against the wall where it
No
Dad, get your stuff
We've got to get out of here
Well,  am sorry about your head, though
But  thought you were one of them
Dad, they come in through the doors
(laughs) Good point
steps to the door and stands, listening
But better safe than sorry
slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag
Humpfso  was wrong this time
But by God,  wasn't wrong when mailed you my Diary
You obviously got it
got it and  used it
We found the entrance to the catacombs
(excited) Through the library
Right
knew it
And the tomb of Sir Richard
: (3) nods
Found it
(breathless) He was actually there
You saw him
Well, what was left of him
(trembling with anticipation) And his shield
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield
Alexandretta
(beat) It's a great moment in 's life
He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to  with joy
Alexandretta
of course
on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire
Oh, Junior
winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment
you did it
No, Dad
You did
Forty years
If only  could have been with you
There were rats, Dad
Rats
Yeah
big ones
What do the Nazis want with you Dad
They want my diary
: (4) (interested) Yeah
's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes
knew  had to get that book as far away from me as  possibly could
's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket
His eyes turn inward
(thoughtfully) Yeah
Then
The door is kicked open and three  enter
One is an
The other two are  with machine guns
and raise their hands
Doctor Jones
& Yes
will take the book now
/ (simultaneously) What book
(to ) You have the Diary in your pocket
laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the You doltl Do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my Diary all the way back here
At which point an awful thought strikes
You didn't, did you
(a beat) You didn't bring it, did you
: (5) Well, uh
You did
Look, can we discuss this later
should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers
(overlapping) Will you take it easy
Take it easy
Why do you think sent it home in the first place
(points towards the ) So it wouldn't fall into their hands
came here to save you
Oh yeah
And who's gonna come to save you, Junior
's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally from the hands of one of the startled soldiers
and for a moment we think he's going to use it on his dad
told you-- He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three  to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room
--don't call me Junior
looks shocked and horrified
Look what you did
Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead
(aghast) can't believe what you just
- leads  down the hallway as he searches for Elsa
Elsa
Elsa
He opens a door and enters: - and  rush back into the room where  had been left, only to find:  Nazi
His name is : a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute
One arm is wrapped around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a  behind her ear
That's far enough Put down the gun, Doctor Jones
Put down the gun or the Fraulein dies
But she's one of them
Indy, please
She's a Nazi
What
is thrown
He doesn't know what to do
He looks at , then back to his father
Everyone is yelling at once: Trust me
Indy, no
will kill her
Oh yeah
Go ahead
No
Don't Shoot
: (to Indy) Don't worry
He won't
Indy, please
Do what he says
And don't listen to her
Enough
She diesl jams the barrel of the luger painfully into 's neck
Elsa
Wait
Waitl And then Indy gives in
He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across,
audibly
releases his grip on  and shoves her toward
She is propelled directly into his arms
He holds her tightly
She buries her face in his chest
'm sorry
comforts her
No, don't be
Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary
But you should have listened to your father
She steps back next to
is stunned
gives him his most withering look of reprimand
- large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor
Firelightfrom the giant fireplacedances across the ceiling and walls
and  are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by and  and
crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace
and do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair
They only see a
: (quietly to ) She ransacked her own room and fell for it
How did you know she was a Nazi
Umh
How did you she was a Nazi
She talks in her sleep
nods, and then the statement catches up with him
He looks at with surprise
didn't trust her
Why did you
Because he didn't take my advice
The     gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be
and  react with stunned expressions
Donovan Didn't  warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones
smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary
misjudged you WalterI knew you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan vase
But  didn't know you'd sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity
(suddenly erupting) Doctor Schneider There're pages torn out of thisl rushes to 's side
she takes the Grail Diary from him
Elsa takes a look for herselfthen glances up at Indy
: (2) This book contained a mapa map with no namesprecise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon
So it did
Where are these missing pages
This maps we must have these pages backs gives  a look of surprise
Indy smirks
(to Donovan) You're wasting your breath
He won't tell us
And he doesn't have to
it's perfectly obvious where the pages are
(looking at Indy) he's given them to Marcus Brody
now wears a pained expression
(to Indy) Marcus
You didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you
He's not up to the challenge
He sticks out like a sore thumb
We'll find him
The hell you will
He's got a two-day head-start on you, which is more than he needs
(beat) Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan
He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom
He'll blend in
Disappear
You'll never see him again
With any luck, he's got the Grail already
looks amazed and impressed
-    - disembarks from the train along with the other , a cross- section of  and
Does anyone here speak English
Or even ancient Greek
Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to
No water, no thank you
No, fish make love in it
continues through the crowd past various
Woman holds a chicken out to him
Thank you so much
No,  don't like that
No,  really don't want
No, no, thank you very much
No, thank you, madam
'm a vegetarian
The Woman walks away, leaving  alone in the crowd
Does anyone understand a word 'm saying here
shoulders his way through the mob toward
Mister Brodyl They meet and hug, then begin to walk
Oh, Sallahl What a relief
(laughs) Marcus Brody, sir
And where is Indy
(overlapping) Oh, he's in Austria
slight detour
You are on your own
Woman runs in and tugs on 's coat
He waves her away
: Yes, but don't panic
Everything's under control
Have you
have you arranged our supplies
Oh, yes, of course
But where are we going
Oh, this map will show you
It was drawn by, uh
searches in his coat pocket for the map as a   approaches
Mister Brody
puts the map back in his pocket
The   clicks his heels and bows quickly
Welcome to Iskenderun
The Director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you
takes off his hat
Oh, what

And  am his

The man turns and joins a

pats his clothing, searching for his papers
Yes

Your presence on the platform is requested
at the highest level
Thank you, Herr Oberst

Take this Diary to the Reich Museum in Berlin
It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule
Without a map, 'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir
He hands her the Grail Diary
(to , meaning Indy and Henry) Let me kill them now
: No
If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive
(to , with a helpless shrug) Always do what the doctor orders

Once they are gone, turns to
Don't look at me like thatwe both wanted the Grail,  would have done anything to get it
You would have done the same

She runs her hand down the side of his face

which is near enough to Henry's ear
(whispers) can't forget
how wonderful it was
Thank you
It was rather wonderful
She smiles and kisses  passionately

appears to remind  of her appointment
Doctor Schneider
Your car is waiting

Ohh
exits
shakes his head clear
(to himself) Ooooh
like the Austrian way better
So did
Let's try and get these ropes loose
We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do
(confused) You said he had two days' start
That he would blend in
Disappear
Are you kidding
made that up
You know Marcushe got lost once in his own museum
Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency
Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket
is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket
squirms his body around towards Henry's hand
What am  looking for
My lucky charm
Feels like a cigarette lighter
: (3) Try and burn through the ropes
's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame
Very good
yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand
He drops the lighter to the floor
Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot
The rug starts to burn

Don't get sentimental now Dad save it 'til we get out of here
The floor's on fire
See
(turns and sees) What
And the chair
All right, movel Move
Rock your Chair
Do what  do
They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet

and  remain behind, flanked by Another car pulls up and  holds the door open for  who gets into the rear seat

Etwas wichtig, mein Herr
puts on his glasses to read the message
Well, we have Marcus Brody
But more important, we have the map
steps forward with yet another written message for : Aus Berlin, mein Herr

Secrecy essential to success
Eliminate the American conspirators
" (to ) Germany has declared war on the Jones boys
(to ) Los fahren
The car drives off
- and  are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back
Indy tries to communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in opposite directions
Dad
What
Dad
What
Dad
Finally they turn their heads in the same direction
What
Head for the fireplace
Oh
,  and  their chairs, they work their way FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now
: think  can get these ropes off
Indy struggles to free his hands
His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door
Whoopsl The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find themselves in the: - where a   wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials, switches and meters, and a  stands over a map plotting coordinates
Their backs are turned to  and

Well done, boy

They activate the lever and begin to rotate through the Secret Door

As they struggle they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened behind

As he disappears into the next room, a    swivels into the room

the solution presents itself

Come on, Dad
Come onl What about the boat
We're not going on the boat

They quickly descend the stairs

Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the way to  or
Indy starts down the road marked
Stop
What
Stop
Stop
The motorbike skids to a stop
You're going the wrong Way
We have to get to Berlin
(pointing towards Venedig) Brody's this way
My Diary's in Berlin
You don't need the Diary, Dad
Marcus has the map
There is more in the Diary than just the map
All right Dadtell me
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge
What final challenge
Three devices of such lethal cunning
Booby traps
: (2) Oh, yes
But  found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St
Anselm
But what are they
Can't you remember
wrote them down in my Diary so that  wouldn't have to remember Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin
Into the lion's den
Yes
The only thing that matters is the Grail
What about Marcus
Marcus would agree with me
Two selfless martyrs
Jesus Christl slaps him across the face
is rocked to his foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself
That's for blasphemy
The quest for the Grail is not archaeology
It's a race against evil
If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth
Do you understand me
This is an obsession Dad
never understood it
Never
Neither did Mom
Oh yes, she did
Only too well
Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all  could do was mourn her
- Arrows point in opposite directions to  and
The on the portion of the sign reading
-  - Nazi Rallya book-burning is in process
The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire
Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd
and  walk toward the Square
Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi Soldier
He is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes too big
My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy land
Then
Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks to: where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking   as they oversee the rally
is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi Officers
one of whom is now none other than , coming up to her before she knows he is there
His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard
Fraulein Doctor
Where is it
Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her thoughts
How did you get here
Where is it
want it
pushes  against a column and begins to search her clothing for the Diary
He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket
: You came back for the book
Whv
My father didn't want it incinerated
She understands him
It's as though he slapped her
Is that what you think of me
believe in the Grail, not the Swastika
(vicious) Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands forwho gives a damn what you think
(hard and fast) You do
Now it's as though she'd slapped him back
His hands fly to her neck
All  have to do is squeeze
All  have to do is scream
It's a standoff emotionally
He knows he'd never do it
she knows it too
And the same goes for screaming
releases her and backs away
she looks at him with a lover's pain
He moves over to
've got it
Let's get the hell out of here
They move off and almost run headlong into  and his entire entourage coming down from the Podium
50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's signature
pauses to sign them
Hitler looks Indy's way
They make eye contact
It only lasts a moment but the moment is electric
breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first page and signs his autograph
He hands it back and moves on
- , - Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal
- Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing '  to Nazi Soldiers inside the terminal
leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as  enters down the stairs and taps Henry's shoulder
They begin to walk toward the boarding gates
What did you get
don't know
The first available flight out of Germany
Good
and  show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of passengers, which has already begun to move toward a: Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying in the grand tradition
-   - The Zeppelin is about to take off
and  make themselves comfortable in one of the compartments
Well, we made it
looks over his newspaper at
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then 'll share that sentiment
Relax
But  looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees: rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin
Nicht zumachen
Wir steigen ein
sits back in his chair, looks to , now reading his newspaper
enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of  and , then continues down the aisle of passengers
Indy follows after the Steward
He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk up a flight of stairs
now walks up the aisle
He approaches a   hidden behind a newspaper
uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph
Haben sie disen Mann gesehen
The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative
shows the picture to other Passengers
Nein
(
) Fahrscheine, bitte
Nein
turns to see: (
) Ich habe ihn night gesehen
Tickets please
The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English
Fahrscheine meine Dame
Bitte
approaches , still hidden behind his newspaper
Again,  uses his walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face
Guten Tag, Herr Jones
Now , still playing the role of Steward, asks  for his ticket
Fahrscheine meine Herr
Weg
Tickets please
looks confused
(in German) Was
glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face, knocking him toward the window
In another quick move, Indy onto the tarmac below
Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment
(in German; with a shrug) No ticket
Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face
- gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship
Vogel shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin
Du wirst nochmal boren von mir
- and  together again in their compartment
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience
: (meaning ) That's not all we shared
It's disgraceful
You're old enough to be her fa---er, her grandfather
Well, 'm as human as the next man
was the next man
(laughs) Ships that pass in the night
opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink
had a milk shake
Hmmm
What did we talk about
We didn't talk
We never talked
And do  detect a rebuke
regret
It was just the two of us, Dad
It was a lonely way to grow up
For you, too
If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that
Actually,  was a wonderful father
When
looks up from his Diary
Did  ever tell you to eat up
Go to bed
Wash your ears
Do your homework
No
respected your privacy and  taught you self- reliance
: (2) What you taught me was that  was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country
And learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years
You left just when you were becoming interesting
Dad, how can you --
(interrupting) Very well
'm here now
He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat
What do you want to talk about
Hmmm
stutters uncomfortably as  stares at him, waiting for a response
(laughs) Well
can't think of anything
Then what are you complaining about
(laughs) Look, we have work to do
When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges
(he reads from the Diary) "First, the breath of God
Only the penitent man will pass
Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed
Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth
" What does that mean
(laughs) don't know
We'll find out
: (3) Sunlight falls across the table from the window
reaches for the drink
The bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks
We see  puzzled
Only for a moment
They're turning around
They're taking us back to Germany
- and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin
The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed
and  hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin
Well,  thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead
Come on, Dad
Move
Then  opens the doors
We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds
We also see a small  that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a  & Come on, Dad
Come on
- climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as  takes the tail gunner's seat
(with delight) didn't know you could fly a plane
Fly--yes
Land--no
- turns in his seat to give  the "thumbs up
" Henry smiles valiantly and points down to the ground
Then they both become aware of a   in the skies behind them
Something between a  and a
streak out of the clouds and race across the sky
shrink in their seats as the  (going three times as fast as they are)  past on either side
Dad, you're gonna have to use the machine gun
Get it ready
turns and grips the    with a perplexed expression

What happens at eleven o'clock

Eleven o'clock

Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage
The speeding Messerschmidts continually overshoot him,  past in a blurmaking wide turns miles away in the sky
has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight
He pulls back on the trigger -----
---
The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but  keeps it in his gun sight
Henry swings the gun around, inadvertently Dad, are we hit
More or less
: Son, 'm sorry
They got us
looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father
The plane begins to go down
struggles to control its descent
Hang on, Dads We're going in
slumps down fearfully in his seat
- The wheels of the plane touch down
, the   and first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending a cloud of dust into the air
As  pulls himself from the cockpit: (sarcastic) Nice landing
Thanks
Suddenly, 's attention is directed to: coming in low
Guns
As   around them,  and  jump over a stone barricade
Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy
Those people are trying to kill us
know, Dadl It's a new experience for me
It happens to me all the time
- An   kneels at his car repairing a rear tire
turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands
Suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling the Old Man
-  - has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel
is a very nervous passenger
sees a -  coming up behind him in the As the Messerschmidt  by overhead,   around them, narrowly missing the car
This is intolerable
This could be close

The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns
The car  the tunnel
The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time

fly as its belly  against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel
- Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless gaining on them; about to overtake them
Faster, boy --faster
-      - The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road
The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and in the middle of the road
- As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow
Well, they don't come any closer than that
looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt out of the sky toward them
-   - The  drops its single -
It  in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet
made by the bomb
: - climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater
He turns back to
Dad, he's coming back
and  run down the mountainside to: - and  run to the shoreline
Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his pants
He opens the chamberthe
swings around and is coming in for another pass
exchange a wordless glance
They don't even think about running: there is no place to run to
hands his case to
Holding his umbrella,  suddenly spins around and runs screaming and shouting into
take to the wing in flight
Thousands of them
Bullets kick up sand leading up to him
then meet in midair
Sea gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a that  against the cockpit and Silence
The Messerschmidt falls from the skies and  in an

These pages are taken from Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness
And they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the Grail

As you can see, the Grail is all but in our hands

Somebody else is also taking note
and we see that it is , the spy at the court

We have no time to lose
Indiana Jones and his father have escaped

We go this way
waves his arms and shouts to a
Get that camel out of the way
What happened to Marcus, Sallah
(overlapping) Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon

Now they have the map

Donovan hands a canteen back to him
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus

But as  haven't got any spit
snatches the canteen away from  before he can drink
We must be within three or four miles
Otherwise we are off the map
: He hands the map to , drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend
and  are at 's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance
Parked nearby is a  containing all of their supplies
Ah,  see Brody
He seems okay
They've got a tank
Six-pound gun
Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills
What he sees is: ' What do you think you're doing

What are you hiding
Another slap
What does the Diary tell you that it doesn't tell us

That's five camels

Indy, your father and Brody Where's my father
They have them

Then  commands the Tank Driver to give chase

Fire
- The tank starts firing at  on horseback
Indy zigs and zags as the tank fires two rounds at Indy, barely missing him
Each time Indy emerges from the plume of desert dust, hanging like a toadstool in the air
- and  hold their hands over their ears
- shouts orders to the Troops
is followed by various vehicles in the caravan
notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far
Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank, turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees
The tank starts to follow
watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with Cleverly,  has turned the tank directly into a head-on collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon
The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of the six-pound cannon on the turret
, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of a culvert
He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is
- shouts to the Gunner
Der Kubelwagon sprengen
The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun
He , into the air, where it
The tank drives through the resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it - gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging several rocks inside
Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun
- pushes  away from the window
Keine Bewegung
He points his gun at  and
Keine Bewegung
The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, , blowing the breech out into the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke

The   swings his fist, knocking  off his seat
- Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open
emerges and aims his gun at
and    as Indy chases the tank on his horse
pulls the trigger againhis gun is empty
Indy immediately takes the high trail
Now  is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail
He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank
- Hate-staring at - Hate-staring back at
Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies  , tackling Indy
: One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over
is struggling with a German's Luger
presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself
The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief
Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he grabs
They struggle and fall
sits up to see  standing over him
Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's neck
- appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by Dad
He drops the gun down into the tank
Dad
Dadl Get it
pulls  from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around his neck
- approaches
hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread
The Nazi Soldier screams as he is dragged under the rolling tank
Now  and  struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around Indy's neck
- We   and  struggling atop the tank
Indy lifts his feet, lunging toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him
's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope
- The   looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then turns back to it
's face, still pressed against the lens
pulls  from the periscope
- The   pulls away from the periscope again
(laughing) Diese Amerikane
Sie Kampfen wie Weiber
- now lies on top of
He kicks out at the periscope which spins around
- The periscope handle spins around and hits the   in the head
He falls against the   guarding  and
pushes the   aside and grabs the gun
The struggles to take the gun from Henry
- holds the chain around 's neck, pushing his head downward toward the revolving tread
- The   holds  from behind, forcing the gun toward him
Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen from his coat pocket
: As the   pulls on 's face, Henry lifts the fountain pen and squirts ink into his face
The Soldier falls, his head smashing into the wall of the tank
At the same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to the floor
Henry, the pen What
But don't you see
The pen is mightier than the sword
- troop truck pulls near the tank
- fires the   at the troop truck
The   flips over and
- The  knocks  off the tank and onto the tread
He grabs onto the shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank
looks down at  and smiles smugly
The tank is approaching a cliff wall
As  tries to secure footing, steps on his hands
- looks at
Look what you didl It's war
- now swings a shovel at , smashing at his hands
climbs up out of the tank, followed by
: Didn't  tell you it was a rescue, huh
appears and pulls  down
raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on , still hanging from the protruding gun
loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of his leather pouch
He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending stones tumbling down over him
- The   knocks  into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the face
As the  raises the gun to 's face,  hits him over the head with a canister
The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air
The   around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel
; then the and   , this time passing '
Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver slumps forward, his body depressing the levers
- still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely missing the rocks and causing  to fall
Indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then peers down to , still inside the tank
Dad
You call this archaeology
Get out of there, Dad
pulls  and  from the tank
pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm
How does one get off this thing
As  winds up to punch  he catches  in the face on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down
- Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor
- (to ) Where's Marcus
Before  can answer,  is up and swinging with the shovel
Indy ducks but the shovel catches  sending him over the side and onto the moving tread
grabs his whip, knocking  aside
As  speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, , with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle
Dad
is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll
struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip
Hang on, Dad
draws his horse next to the treads
He tips his fez to
Father of Indygive me your hand
now punches  in the back and grabs him around the neck
Still, refuses to let go of the whip
Sallah
Get Dadl reaches out to
Give me your hand
manages to hold onto  as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge
finally frees himself of 's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head
looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror
We  his and sail over the cliff's edge
He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top of his lungs
The tank trundles over the cliff and
- ,  and  look down at the flaming wreckage of the tank
Junior
We  the
Indy
Oh, God
've lost him
And never told him anything
just wasn't ready, Marcus
Five minutes would have been enough
And then
looking dazed and bewildered,
He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression
Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence
says nothing
He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion
Finally, he throws his arms around him
thought 'd lost you, boy
After a moment, Indy's head clears
And he becomes aware of his father's embrace
Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever
And it touches him
He hugs his father back
thought you had too, sir
and  are moved by this sudden reconciliation
Wellwell done
Come on
pats  on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge
: Unaware, ,  and  start to walk away
Henry turns back to see  still sitting on the ground
Let's go then
why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end
Come on let's go
turns and walks toward the horse with  and
Suddenly the , borne on the wind,    and lands at 's feet
- peers through binoculars to see the He lowers the binoculars and turns to
The Canyon of the Crescent Moon
Now  peers through the binoculars
- , ,  and  ride into the canyon
They hear a Feel the biting cold
And sense the danger
Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city
Its spectacular Grecian facade is carved directly into the rock
It is a stunning sight
The vehicles, camels and horses belonging to 's party have been left at the entrance
: - , ,    creep forward to see: He's walking slowly
Eyes darting
Muttering a prayer under his breath
What's going on here
- stands alone in the center of the Temple
It is very dark define the Temple's perimeter
watch him from a safe distance
is about to approach the spot where a
We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been
stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier
takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out
We hear a of airbut we  NOTHINGexcept  ' across the ground
, , react to the sight
She looks at him, horrified
Helmut, another volunteer
force another Turk forward
Suddenly
The     being cocked
Everyone turns to discover  and his party surrounded by
Indy's group are relieved of their guns
- , ,  and  are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers
's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead
she controls herself and continues more coldly
(to ) never expected to see you again
'm like a bad penny
always turn up
Step back now, Doctor Schneider
Give Doctor Jones some room
He's going to recover the Grail for us
: laughs
Impossible
What do you say, Jones
Ready to go down in history
As what
Nazi stooge like you
(scornfully) Nazis
Is that the limit of your vision
The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world
Well, they're welcome
But  want the Grail itself
The cup that gives everlasting life
Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him
'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo
(he draws his pistol) The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me
Shooting me won't get you anywhere
You know something, Doctor Jones
you're absolutely right
Then  shifts his aim, just a bit, and
The bullet enters his side below the ribs
Dad
Junior
No
( to ) Get back
collapses
Blood flowing from the wound
and  rush to his assistance
: (2) spins toward  with murder in his eyes
points the gun at him: You can't save him when you're dead
hesitates
The healing power of the Grail is the only thing that can save your father now
It's time to ask yourself what you believe
takes in the situation
The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him
He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions
We get silent reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their different emotions proceeds forward
His hands open the Grail Diary
"The Breath of God
Only the penitent man will pass
Only the penitent man will pass
" takes a few steps forward
"The penitent man will pass
The penitent man
" stops
He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died
looks at
Indy looks at Henry
(in a raspy voice) "Only the penitent man will pass
Only the penitent man will pass
" (quietly to himself) The penitent man will pass
The penitent
the penitent
The penitent man
The penitent man
The penitent
takes a step forward through the cobwebs
: (3) The penitent man is humble before God
Penitent
Penitent
The penitent man is humble
The cobwebs begin to move
He kneels before God
(to himself; suddenly) Kneel
We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH
Because  is in the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face
Instinctively he   on the ground out of harm's way and looks up
From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: gets cautiously to his feet
Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead
Wooden wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades
loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe
'm through
We're through
and  smile, relieved
(to ) He's all right
shakes his head
No
holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs
"The second challenge is the Word of God
Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed
" (to himself) The Word of God
The Word of
pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path
Each cobble is engraved with a letter
"Proceed in the footsteps of the Word
" lifts his head painfully
The Word of God
No, Henry
Try not to talk
The Name of God
as he studies the cobblestones before him
The Name of God
Jehovahl still lies in 's arms
leans over him
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "

" takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and  falls up to his hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was
reacts
Oh dear
who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand
In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with an "

Now we  each letter on the stones as  carefully walks forward
and  follow in his footsteps

""
sighs with relief and steps forward to: stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across, nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall
He can see nowhere to cross
He looks again to the v-rail Diary
"The path of flood
Only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth
" looks around and then he notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion
Impossiblel Nobody can jump this
looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it is asking him to do
rushes forward and calls to
Indy
Indy, you must hurry
Come quickly
(realizing) It's
a leap of faith
Oh, God
calls to his son
You must believe, boy
you must
believe
We see him do it
We see him leap into space
We see that he is in midair
We see that he is not going to make it
His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 feet to his death
And thenhe doesn't
He appears to be held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees
looks around and down and now he figures it out
Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below
It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping
It's painted to blend in with the rocks below
Highly evolved camouflage
in perfect alignment with everything we see below
When  leans out to the left or right
that's when he sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick
Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk
Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple
vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple
Perhaps a hundred or more
Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and shine
is mesmerized by their number and their beauty
And then he realizes that a man is praying at the altarl He has his back turned to
but he is dressed as what he is But we can't see the Grail Knight's face
The visor of his helmet is down
Perhaps we see his eyes
: When the   sees  he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly, prepares to give combat
taking up his two-handed broadsword
he comes at Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too much
Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt to fight back
until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses
Indy approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient man
knew you'd come, but my strength has left me
Who are you
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it
That was seven hundred years ago
long time to wait
The   reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing
You're strangely dressed
for a knight
'm not exactly
a knight
What do you mean
was chosen because  was the bravest and the most worthy
The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat
pass it to you who vanquished me
The   holds his sword out to
(gulp) Listen,  don't have time to explain, but At that moment  and  appear
Donovan turns to face the display of cups
Which one is it
: (2) You must choose
(beat) But choose wisely
For as the True Grail will bring you life the False Grail will take it from you
'm not a historian
have no idea what it looks like
Which one is it
Let me choose
Thank you, Doctor
and  exchange looks
He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors
chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet
instantly takes it from her
Oh, yes
It's more beautiful than 'd ever imagined
This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings
rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water
Eternal life
drinks from the goblet
Then, ' entire body starts to convulse
His face contorts in agony
He grabs his stomach and turns toward
What
is
happening
to
me
He starts to agefast
His hair grows long and gray and brittle
His face sinks
Fingernails curl back on themselves
Milky cataracts coat his eyes
gasps and screams
What
is
happening
His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits
His skeletal hands reach for 's throat, choking her
: (3) rushes forward and pushes  away
As he falls he , then
He chose
poorly
studies the array of chalices
It would not be made out of gold
picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug
That's the cup of a carpenter
He and  exchange a look
There's only one way to find out
goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses
brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows
strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment
and we see his wounds begin to heal
You have chosen wisely
But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal
That is the boundary and the price of immortality
who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return
and  come forward with the Grail
The    are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail
They put down their guns and kneel
kneels by 's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to his lips
is too weak to even open his eyes
swallows some of the water
Much of it runs down the corners of his mouth
Finally  pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes
The color returns to Henry's face
's eyes open
The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up
Then they shift to 's faceand they light up even more
run forward
points a rifle at them
Drop your guns
Please
The   drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in surrender
(to ) Dad, come on
Get to your feet
steps forward and picks up the Grail
She turns to , her face alight with possession of the Grail
We have got it
Come on
steps onto the edge of the Great Seal
Elsa
Elsa, don't movel It's ours, Indy
Yours and mine
Elsa, don't cross the Seal
The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here
and the ground roars and shifts
Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern
falls on the Great Seal
The Grail bounces away from her grasp
She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to slips into the crevasse
She screams
is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach
As her hands lose their grip,  just manages to one of them, he himself sliding forward across the slanted floor
Junior
Junior
With her free hand,  is trying to get the Grail
can't save her unless she gives him her free hand
She has to choose
Elsa
Elsa don't
Elsa
Elsa
Give me your other hand, honey
can't hold you
: can reach it
can reach it
Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp
Elsa
Give me your hand
Give me your other hand
just manages to touch the Grail
In doing so, she has tipped the balance too farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death
(horrified) Elsa
Now the ledge  lies upon begins to break apart
grabs one of his hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other
Junior, give me your other hand
can't hold on
can get itI can almost reach it, Dad
looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing can ever be retrieved
Indiana
Indiana
snaps his look up to his father
His father has never called him this before
(very calmly) let it go
abandons the Grail and grabs onto  with both hands
pulls him up to safety
looks through the falling debris to  and
and  rush from the crumbling Temple
Dad
The   raises his arm to
: Please, Dad
and  down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles down upon the spot where they stood
The   lowers his arm as he watches them leave
- , ,  and  emerge from the Mountain Temple through the Grecian Facade
From within the Mountain Temple, the cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance
turns to
Elsa never really believed in the Grail
She thought she'd found a prize
What did vou find, Dad
Me
Illumination
and  mount their horses
Henry turns back to his son
What did you find, Junior
Junior
Dad
Please
What does it always mean, this
this "Junior
" That's his name
Henry Jones, Junior
like Indiana
We named the dog Indiana
May we go home now, please
: (to ) The dog
(laughs) You are named after the dog
(embarrassed) 've got a lot of fond memories of that dog
moment passes as they all ready their mounts and  continues to laugh at
Ready

Uh-huh
After you, Junior
