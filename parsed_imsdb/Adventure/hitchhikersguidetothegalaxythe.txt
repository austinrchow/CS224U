The dolphin stadium at Sea World
(') For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet, instead of the third most intelligent which was, in fact, entirely accurate
The dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc
(') The second most intelligent creatures were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth
They had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means
They leap madly, desperately
Higher and higher
(') The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double- backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but in fact the message was this
"So long and thanks for all the fish
" - (  35mm ) Dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles
Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a Buzby Berkley-style song called, " " We end with a wide shot of all the dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never come back down
to a starry night sky - the dolphins have vanished
As night turns to morning, we hear , then
as well as Sea World Orlando and San Diego reporting their dolphins have mysteriously disappeared overnight

He yells into his mobile phone
(into phone) What do you mean he's gone out to lunch
You just said he was still at breakfast
, a bureaucrat, leans over him
Come off it, Mr
Dent
You can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever
'm game
We'll see who rusts first
This bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built
You should have made your protest months ago
The first  heard of it was when a workman came yesterday
asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house
He didn't tell me right away of course
First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid
Then he told me

Prosser removes plans from his briefcase
Look
These plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year
On display
had to go down to a cellar
That's the display department
eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'
Mr
Dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if just let it roll straight over you
How much
None at all
(
) (American accent) Arthur
Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill, pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and bags of peanuts
This is
Wiry, intense
As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket
He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers
Ford
He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop
Arthur
There you are
Here drink and eat with me
We need to talk
Er, um
now's not the best time, Ford They're going to demolish my home, Whoa
You already know
How
Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer

When you say "they" you mean they
Got it
Listen,  gotta tell you something important, and  gotta tell you now
But what about my house
Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the bulldozer driver
He pushes the cart over to him
- watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die
The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer and eating the peanuts
Ford returns to Arthur
'mon
Let's go to the pub
He said they won't destroy your house until they've finished the beers
Can we trust him
'd trust him to the end of the Earth
And how far's that
About twelve minutes away

Ford hurries to the bar
Arthur follows, cell phone to his ear
Six pints of bitter
And quickly
The world's about to end
Oh yes, sir
Nice weather for it
He starts to pull pints
Ford shoves bar peanuts into his pockets while Arthur shouts into his phone
Well, when does he get back from lunch
Or is he going straight out for tea
He shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn
(') This is shaping up to be a crap day

There you are, six pints
Ford slaps down a 50 note
The barman's impressed
Keep the change
You've got ten minutes to spend it
Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur
Three
At lunchtime
Time is an illusion
Lunchtime doubly so
Very deep
You should send that in to the Reader's Digest
They've got a page for people like you
Drink up
Why three pints
Muscle relaxant
(grabbing more peanuts) And eat these
You'll need the salt
What's going on
Ford
What would you say if  told you  wasn't really from Guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Eetelgeuse
Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely to say
Remember when we met
That car was racing toward me,  was trying to greet it, you pushed me out of the way

Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him out of the way as the car zooms past
(6 cont)      :                                      (6 cont) Didn't you find it a little strange that was trying to shake hands with a car
assumed you were drunk
(shaking his head) thought cars were the dominant life form
was trying to introduce myself
And that's why you're named after a discontinued car from the seventies
(nodding) You saved my life that day
Now 'm saving yours
Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer
This must be Thursday
never could get the hang of Thursdays
Look, if it's about your house
No, it's not that
It's

The perfect girl found her, and then  let her get away

Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet, sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable

Arthur looks up

Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands

No,  mean who are you
Oh, the costume
Right
Er, um

Let's go somewhere
Yeah
It is a bit noisy
There's a lovely little cafe around the corner

Arthur isn't sure how to react
(') Well
that's
an extraordinary proposition
But
can't just up and go
What about my job
Quit
Get a new one when we return
can't just
what about my house
Who would feed my dog
Bring him with
He's a Welsh Collie
He'd feel all out of place in Madagascar
Trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed
(
) You don't want to go to Madagascar
They both turn to face   - very charming, extremely handsome - whose attire seems very "other worldly

You really think the world's going to end

If you want
Will it help

Last orders, then

(') In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom
For though it has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects
First, it is slightly cheaper
And second, it has the words "' " printed in large friendly letters on its cover

The Vogon guard pushes a still struggling Arthur and Ford down it
It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything said to you in any language
Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal window
He backs up to look out

Ford  like he's having an epileptic seizure
Arthur just looks like he has a migraine
(') The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria
During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty  Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning," four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid- Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off

Ford's entire body tenses, arches, then goes limp
Arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends
The absolute worst poetry was written by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix
It involved decaying swans
Luckily, it was destroyed when the Earth was
So, Earthlings,  present you with a simple choice
Either die in the vacuum of space, or -- tell what you thought of my poem
Ford is spent, can't say a word

As soon as the drive reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously, then selects the appropriate re-entry point
The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were of course well understood

The whale in mid-air, stops rising, starts falling
It is important to note that suddenly, and against all probability, a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet
And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more
This is what it thought as it fell
The camera moves around the whale as it falls

Then --  - the door seals shut

He starts to march off

Zaphod takes it with a smile
Thank you

No one doing the boring jobs
Oh, you had that problem, too
In spades
So a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs

He looks down and sees     sitting on a silver platter
After ten million years on Earth, and a rather large chunk of that time in England, it would be utterly humiliating if we didn't know how to make a decent pot of tea
Arthur stares in shock
can't speak

They control a large sector of the Universe in our dimension (chew, chew)

Which means we still need an ultimate question
Or at least, one that sounds ultimate
Yes
Got to sound good
An Ultimate Question that sounds good
From a couple of mice
for a chat show
And as it turns out, the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain
Which is why we need it
More tea
Franky tries to pour more tea
Arthur stops drinking, a little woozy
Did he hear them right
'm sorry -- did you just say you need my brain
Yes
To extract the question
You can't have my brain
'm using it
Barely
We can replace it if you think it's important
An electronic brain maybe
simple one should suffice

Through the opposite window (in much the same way bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons arriving
