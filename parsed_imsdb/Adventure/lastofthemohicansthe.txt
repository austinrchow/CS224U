Written by Michael Mann & Christopher Crowe The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, emerald green moss
It's a landscape in miniature
We  the forest
Some distant birds
Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern
piece of sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow
The whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it
distant rustling
It gets closer and louder
It's shallow breathing
It gets ominous
We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming
: rockets through the frame scaring us and
: running hard
His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock
Tattoos
He's twenty-five
He seems tall and muscled
Heavy, even breathing
We'll learn later this man is , the last of the Mohicans
: ' flash as he runs
One carries a flintlock musket
Sweat on the man's skin calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads over a breechcloth
He wears leggings to protect his legs
long-handled tomahawk is stuffed in his belt
-    - in the hand of another running man
He's heavier, older
green bear claw is tattooed there
Silver armband
snake is tattooed over his left eyebrow
Silver rings in his ear
He's forty to forty-five
His head is shaved into a scalp-lock
It says: "Come and lift this from me
Take it, if you can
" That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely
This man is The French call him "Le Gros Serpent," the Great Snake, because "he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly blow
" : runs, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound
He's running parallel to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest
It's heavily canopied
There's very little brush
The girth of the trees is huge
Shafts of light illuminate motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through
Sometimes there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock
These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into ravines as if they own them
They do
-    - rocketing through trees
His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife
long rifle in which is carved the name "Killdeer" is in his right fist
Indian tattooing on his chest
His name is
He's a few years older than Uncas
The French and 	the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle)
Other frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes know him as Hawkeye
Sweat stains his shirt
He flashes through the tree branches disturbing nothing
Making no sound
' : two hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage
Killdeer's at his shoulder
' cocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click
stops dead, holding out his hand
no sound
slips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket
Is this an ambush
' : Five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, off target
It's a precise, smooth movement
No human quiver
' tighter
holding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting sparks into the pan of priming powder which flashes and
is a huge elk that leaps at the sound
' like lightning
leaps where the
59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him
On the moment of impact
three men approach the fallen elk and each other
We realize they're hunting together
Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook
His massive war club is flat and angles to one side with a stabbing blade
Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother
The two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection
Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures
In his coloration and worldliness he's more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman
In his independent views and candid manner and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican)
As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk
] (low Mohican; sub-titled) We're sorry to kill you, Brother
Forgive us
do honor to your courage and speed, your strength
-    -   - roasts potatoes on a stick in the stone fireplace next to   , an American in very worn quasi-military gear
On a rough table in the tiny cabin , his wife, is kneading bread
Three children climb on their father
He grabs their wild seven year old son, , who shrieks laughter and dodges away
The cabin has two primitive rooms, waxed paper windows, log walls
a dog barks
Others pick it up
Cameron & Jack are suddenly alert, reaching for weapons
,  -  - appears warily, musket in hand
: Halloo
John Cameron
Doorway: Cameron towards the interior
Alexandria
Set three more places
(to the fence) How is Chingachgook, then
Behind him, emerging from the dark trees are Hawkeye, Uncas, cradling flint locks, blankets and packs over their shoulders, leading a mule laden with skins and the elk carcass
Crossing the splitrail fence
The Master of Life is good
Another year pass
How is it with you, John
Gettin' along
Yes, it is
(warm) Nathaniel
Hello John
Cleared another quarter,  see
(shakes hands with Uncas) Yes,  did
tears past his father & runs full bore
Just before he's going to collide into Uncas, he leaps into the air and Uncas snatches him with one hand and swings him up onto his shoulders
The kid screams with delight and rides back towards the cabin that way
Alexandria comes to the door
-  -  () lights & smokes a clay pipe
The scene says: this is a rustic, frontier home and these people have known each other & live in dangerous circumstances
If Uncas is with you, that means he has not found a woman and started a family yet
Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron
They see into my heart
Your farm good to you this year, John
It was a good year for corn
Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on the river
Chief Joseph Brandt's field
You take much fur
That we did
John
But the horicane (sic) is near trapped out
Tradin' your skins in Castleton
No, Schylerville
With the Dutch for silver
French & English want to buy with wampum & brandy
Pause, then
So what is it, Jack
What brings you up here
French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English
'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense
Folks here goin' to join in that fight
We'll see in the morning
Fathers of England & France, both, take more land, furs, than they need
They're cold & full of greed
Few'd deny that
Where you headin'
Trap over the fall and winter among the Delawares in Can-tuck-ee
So  can find a woman and make Mohican children so our father will leave my brother & me in peace
Alexandria laughs
So do Hawkeye & Chingachgook
son like me
Uncas grabs James & suspends him upside down
No
You are too strong
Turn me old too fast
Hawkeye grabs the kid from Uncas
The kid's laughing & can't stay still
Chingachgook watches, content, smoking his clay pipe
That's what he's doin' to his mama
She ruffles his hair and lifts the heavy iron pot off the tibbet
Uncas goes to help her, she shrugs his hand away and carries it to the table herself
The men gather around
There's pan-baked bread, a dish of salt, and the pot has venison and yellow cornmeal in a kind of stew
Everyone waits
Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits of our labor with plenty
Amen
As they start to eat
'  - () -   &   - slam into other kids as they battle through a Lacrosse game
In the background are sixty men, women and children
It's a community gathering held out of doors
We've entered mid-scene
Captain Jack is standing on a box
Some women and kids mill around some tables and boards laid over barrels
Cooking fires
Smoke
Most but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, eight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing
Off to the side are an English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in Albany
man named  speaks in French
His son, , translates
(
in French) (translates) My father says he was driven out of France by the black robe priests and he would fight them now but he lost his arm and so  will go in his place
Meanwhile
is an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand
He says something to Chingachgook who nods
Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an outer grouping of the men
Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is tattooed
As Martin finishes, he steps forward
John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality
Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les Francais
Trade furs with Les Francais
Now Les Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds
These people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot "mechanics" (craftsmen)
They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings
The Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement
They 've been acculturated for over a hundred years
Some wear European calico hunting shirts
Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed
They've politically and commercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a hundred years because of their military power and geographic position
Their relations with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all
This is a mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America
The Europeans are former indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier hunters and trappers
working people
(continues) Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais
My brothers have asked me to lead them in this war so  speak for the Twin River Council
The importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant
His Majesty King George  is very grateful for your support
How far up the valley
To Fort William Henry
#1 two days from here
Some don't like this
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy
Your enemy
Heads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd
What did you say
(loud) said
France is your enemy
Not ours
Really
Do you want them to overrun all New York colony
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio
(smiles) Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands
(ignoring Hawkeye) Will you men help us stop the French
and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes
What then, Lieutenant
For your own homes, for king, for country, that's why you men ought to join this fight
You do what you want with your own scalp
Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours
(furious; to Hawkeye) You, sir
You call yourself a loyal subject
No
Do not call myself much of a subject at all
Light laughter
#2 Nathaniel's right
But if  got to fight, figure 'll try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of my bean field
Yes
Yeah
No
am stayin' on my farm
And any man who goes, his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he comes back
Boys
My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to fill the county's levy
But only if General Webb accepts a few terms  got in mind
& cross through the people
few men drift off to their women at the tables
It is apparent two-thirds of the men will join
couple of jokes, light banter, no hostility
(
) Webb
what's that, Jack
As they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons
You boys marchin' with us
What do you say
We had our say, Ian
They approach the Lacrosse field
Chingachgook stands with Cameron in the background, watching
Uncas joins James
Hawkeye goes on the other side
couple of young Mohawks and a young blonde farmer shout hallo's and as the bodies crash into each other
,   - 62nd    - in two rows
At each command the crack troops respond en masse
Their hands slap the stocks of their brown bess muskets in unison
These men are drilling in preparation for war
We witness a state-of-the-art, 18th century, precision killing machine
(shouts) Shoulder arms
(slam) Order arms
Handle cartridge

Draw ramrods
Ram cartridge

The Dutch roof lines of Albany are in the distance
Nearer, a coach races past
-   - Six horses, wide with dumb, mute strain
Foam, manes fly, their hooves pound the yellow road into dust
Military outriders are on the three left side horses
-    - sits erectly in the brilliant scarlet coat of the First Royal Regiment of Foot with gold braid, blue-black facing and blue-black breeches, cavalry boots, spurs, a tricorn, white wig (
) and a gorget (large medallion) around his neck
He's 28-30 and tough
He is self-sure, principled reactionary
He believes human society is static & layered into hierarchies of class and they are absolutely impermeable
He opens a simple gold- clasped case & contemplates its contents
' : an enameled portrait of a dark-haired young woman
as a soldier is militarily first-rate in his milieu: the open battlefields of Europe
Right now, however, he is about to enter the forests of North America
He closes his clasp and glances out the window as we enter Albany and as a facade of buildings & people pass
,   -  - Four Grenadiers come to attention as Heyward enters mid-scene
(
) if they are not allowed leave to defend their families if the French or Hurons attack the settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort William Henry
(low) You, there
Help my man outside with the baggage
sees Heyward and nods
Three of Webb's Adjutants are on either side
Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered mitred caps are at the door
Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial representatives, including Captain Jack Winthrop
Heyward watches Jack
They will report or be pressed into service
Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into forest
time it takes you to blink
Where's that leave ya, then
Heyward, preparing to hand over dispatches, is interrupted by the insubordinate tone
Equally wound tightly is the Lieutenant
They will be found
Arrested
(cuts in) cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, would ever object to his American subjects defending their hearth & home, their women & children, if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages, aroused to such excess by our enemy, the ever-perfidious French
Does that mean they will be granted leave to defend their homes if the settlements are attacked
Of course
Heyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb
These Americans, including Jack, are streaming past him on their way out
You got yourself a colonial militia, General
Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir
Webb's pouring gin
Duncan
How was your journey
The door closes
Dispatches are passed
They are now alone except for the General's two Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner
He's
In the dim light, he's motionless
Webb slides a glass across to Heyward
didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what  witnessed here today
And what is that
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service
know
(assuming a co-commiserator) One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all
Tiring, isn't it
(throws up his hands) But that's the way of it here
(tight) thought British policy is 'Make the World
England', sir
chill
Majors don't upbraid Generals
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot
At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro
will march the 33rd to Fort Edward
Sir
Might  enquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters
was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort
Yes
You may
(to Magua, after a glance at Heyward) You there
What does Munro call you
(to Heyward) The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you
rises and slowly walks into the light
He is reserved and over six feet tall
His head is shaved into a mohawk
Rings, beads & feathers pierce his ears
blanket is worn as a shawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing
long tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house
company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way
By your leave, sir
Webb holds Heyward a moment (to Adjutants) Explain to the Major we care little about toying with colonial militia because we have little to fear from the French
They have not the nature for war
Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would rather make love with their faces than fight
Webb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit
Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile
He's been made the butt of the joke
He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French
Webb doesn't like Heyward's manner
We don't like Webb
Then: (continuing) Dismissed
Heyward stiffly salutes
Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in return
(to Magua) Dawn
At the encampment
Six a
m
sharp
See to it you're there
Beneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence & menace
None of 	these Brits see it
We do
'  -   - brushed clean, his wig freshly powdered, his tricorn in his hand with a crimson sash and sword and his cavalry boots, walks through the gate after knocking
He enters a small courtyard
Suddenly he hears
(
) Heyward
Duncan Heyward
Heyward looks to the side
An inner light turns on
In this mode, this is a man we could like
: enters from the garden
She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's educated, but with conventional values and attitudes
She hugs Duncan to her and then pushes him away to look at him
My God it's good to see you
He takes her hand in both of his and kisses it
He is open and lit up
' ,   -  &  - vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal garden setting
Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs
Wind blows
In the background a servant hangs laundry
The white sheets billow
table holds a tea setting
They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly
Duncan's jacket is removed
Time's passed
Long pause
Then: 'm embarrassed to be so indecisive
after so long apart and after you've traveled so far
And by sea
You still have an aversion to the water
Aversion
No
"Hatred"
"Loathing"
Cora laughs
But it was worth it all to end in a garden by your side
She looks askance at him
Then the banter drops
(difficult) Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend
Alice and  depend on you and respect you immensely
wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that
Do you see
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined
And all else may grow in time
Some say that's the way of it
"Some"
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but
(interrupts) Cora, in my heart,  know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England
Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you
In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine
Cora stares directly at Heyward
Then she looks away
She has no answer
Something subterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life
Will you consider that
(pause; smiles) Yes
Yes,  will
She's still unsettled
(
) Duncan
: eighteen years old, white-blonde hair, wide blue eyes
She's effervescent and runs to hug him
Heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and laughs
My God, you've grown up
We leave in the morning
(rises) Yes, miss
won't sleep tonight
What an adventure
absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild
My God, Alice
(smiles) It can be dangerous
Nonsense
Papa wouldn't have sent for us if it were dangerous
Alice takes Hewyward's hand
Cora pours Heyward more tea
The white sheets billow
(
- barks) Atten-shun
-    - jolt upright as if electrified
(entering) Shoulder arms
a sergeant major of forty-one is wide and deep and built like a fullback
You do not 	mess with Sgt
Major Ambrose
(barks) Form two companies of nine
march in perfect drill into two groups, each three across and three deep
,  - steps out
Rigid salutes
climbs onto his white military charger
It's spirited
Cora & Alice are in riding dresses and veils
The veil doesn't completely cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the flush of her complexion
They're riding two sidesaddled Narragansetts
The tight traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more mature
All three ride to the front of the column
The baggage horses and mule are in the gap between the two companies
cradling his musket
: down the path that leads into the wall of forest looks impressive
: marching
Now they look brave but smaller
The forest - with all its mysteries and dangers - now impresses us as a towering dark, sinister, and it's immensity swallows up the living mass which slowly enters its bosom
the Redcoats, their faces now filmed with dust, cut with lines of perspiration
They march in perfect formation
We   the pack horses, the first company, Sgt
Major Ambrose and on to Cora & Alice
Alice seems fatigued
Cora's turned, looking up into the forest canopy, astonished at the deep beauty of the place
' : of trees is dark, except for spots where leaves are sparse, and there the light is golden
It's the forest of childhood
In a ravine a buck disappears into a deeper stand of trees
(
) Alice, did you see that
' reverie's broken by Heyward entering the frame
Alice
Alice rouses from fatigue
Are you alright
Can we rest soon
Absolutely
Heyward rides to the front of the column to Magua, who's twenty to thirty yards ahead of everybody else
You there, Scout
Magua slowly turns towards Heyward
(overly articulated) We must
stop
soon
Women are
tired
You
understand
(perfect English) understand
This is not good place to stop
Two leagues from here
No water 'til then
That where we stop
Better place
No
Stop in the glade just ahead
When the ladies are rested, we will proceed
Do you understand
(in Huron: English subtitle) "Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women
When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness
" Excuse me
What did you say
Magua say: "Yes
Good idea
" As they begin to stop
&  -  - Silently entering on either side of us come Chingachgook, followed by Hawkeye and Uncas
Even relaxed, they carry themselves with a degree of alertness
They're eighteenth century Viet Cong moving through the rain forest
The Maxfield Parrish/Hudson Valley of tall trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them
All three cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet
: - in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops
The others freeze in their tracks
Chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine
under the water in the stream
It's been turned from its bed
Chingachgook finds another
Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees, searches and then he gestures
he's found another sign of something
has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing
Rapidly he rejoins Uncas and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert
They move up the bank into the forest ninety degrees from their previous path
: ,  & moving
Fast
Nearly soundless
They hardly disturb a blade of grass
The impression: expertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong
,  -  - on point
The trail cuts the side of a hill
The ground on one side rises into a forest acclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine
Magua walking towards camera
- ' slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist
He lets the shaft drop into his hand
He shrugs off his blanket
There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure we didn't see before
Magua turns about face and advances on the column
Magua
Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt
Major Ambrose, marching in advance of the men
Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row
We see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye
is curious, starts to smile
What does the Huron want to say to him
When Magua is two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the spike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the neck of the center man in the first row
thirteen muskets  from the wooded rise
are blown off the path, two others are wounded
Form company
Left face
March
shrieks
Cora grabs Alice's reins and her own
pulling his fusil (short musket), seeing, firing, reaching for the women
' bucking
' bolting, dodging sideways, spilling Alice to the earth
Company make ready
The regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies of their comrades
All thirteen face the incline
- flash downhill through the trees
Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares and fires while the other advances to the next cover
He, then, prepares and fires covering his partner's advance
Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast and rapidly closing
Even though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their tactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons'
Present

The English rush to complete the reload
Will they do it in time
(continuing) Present
Present
Suddenly, Hurons - en masse -  down onto the Redcoats line with tomahawks, war clubs and point-blank musket fire
on the ground, screaming insanely, covered by Cora who's protecting her little sister, and
' horse shot from beneath him, the animal folding, falling straight to the earth, and
shoots Ambrose in the chest, and
by the Munro daughters spins, swinging his fusil like a ball-bat, upending one Huron and lunges with his bayonet in his left towards another
But this Huron easily slips the thrust and slams Heyward with his rifle butt
dead and dying
blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a second with his sword
Then he's chopped down
Hurons begin scalping the British while four race towards Heyward and the two women
&  & ready to die
Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon
He readies
three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise
: barely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine
In parts, we recognize Nathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, and Uncas
' not sure where the shots came from
Suddenly Chingachgook slams him, head first into the ravine with the war club
He didn't even slow down
warrior spins
Uncas tomahawks his shoulder
The Huron swings downwards
Uncas ducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat, sending him downhill into as
' momentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a couple of wounded Redcoats who fight on
calmly sees the odds have changed
His attention becomes focused
He commits a very revealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies
We will remember it
He raises his musket and aims at
who's unaware she's a target
Why is he singling out a Munro girl to kill
sees
Killdeer's at his shoulder
: senses Hawkeye
Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left
The moment is frozen
Their eyes lock, each to the other's
Then
Magua swings at Hawkeye and
shifts
The
65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's already squeezing Killdeer's trigger as
'   : from Magua's musket blast clears
Magua's gone
He almost shape-shifted, it happened so quickly
It's nearly mystical
lowers Killdeer, impressed
glances back at Hawkeye
She doesn't know why he's looking at her
pursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline
Two strides gain him the first man, who he hamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill
as
in the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an Indian
We recognize that he's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the second Huron up the hill
No, Duncan
Duncan ignores her
' is jerked from his hands
case your aim is any better'n your judgment
He's drawn his sword, reflexively
Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed
It's pointed at Heyward's chest
And Hawkeye , killing an attacking Huron behind Heyward
As Heyward spins
' flashes up the hill
It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over
Chingachgook retrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down
scalps the man he killed
Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung
Sudden silence
Heyward's motionless
The women are frozen, as terrified of the savages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them
Cora, holding her, is stunned but functioning
Moments ago both women were clean and demure
Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their baggage is gone
' crossed to his slaughtered soldiers
Moments ago they were a testament to British military power
Now they're dead meat
Ambrose's body is against a tree
In the
two of the wounded start to rise
(
) Stop it
Heyward spins
just cut the throat of the second Narraganset
It drops into the brush
Alice attacks him
We need them to get out of here
Uncas gently restrains her
Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the "savage"
Heyward runs in to protect the women
(to Nathaniel) why the bloody hell he do that to the horses
Uncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees
(matter of fact) too easy to track
they can be heard for miles
find yourself a musket
Cora's surprised by Uncas' easy English
Hawkeye's scanning the forest
(to Heyward) Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany
They'll never make a passage north
(breathless) We were headed
(appropriating a knife) Fort William Henry
to Hawkeye: let's go
Then a fast exchange of Delaware
Cora's surprised to see it's Chingachgook's decision
Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts off
take you as far as the fort
Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket
Cora & Alice look towards Heyward
He looks at them: the women are totally terrified and do not move
If we are goin' to take you, we need to move
Fast
And the fort is well off our course
So if you all rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by, we'll be on our way
Heyward quickly decides to go
The women follow
Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and Chingachgook
-  - moves through the trackless forest
Uncas is far out on the left flank
Cora, Alice & Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps
' walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones
The others follow
Hawkeye looks at Heyward
conforms
He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian frontiersman through a foreign wilderness
] How far is it, scout
Day and a half (pause) Where did you get
the guide
Colonel Munro sent him
He was one of our Mohawk allies
He is Huron and nothing else
(checking the Munro girls are not too close) Why would he want to murder the girl
What
Dark haired
Miss Cora Munro
He never set eyes on her before today
No blood vengeance
No re-proach or insult
Of course not
(pause) And how is it you were nearby
Came across the war party, tracked 'em
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry
No
Fort Edward, then
No
Headin' west
To Can-tuck-ee
thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia
Off to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea
ain't your "scout"
And  am in no damn militia
(stops) Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France
England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account
She uses us to war against France on her own account
of greed for land and furs
' appalled
(turns) Clear it up any
(loud) owe you gratitude or 'd call you out
(low) Do not let gratitude get in the way
Cora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook looms over him
(to Hawkeye) Yengeese no good in woods
Make more noise,  kill him
Heyward spins
Hawkeye coolly watches Cora
Her attitude is hostile; aligned with Heyward
He turns away
Meanwhile
stops, alarmed
Something in the air bothers him
Hawkeye smells it, too
is already moving out front, low and fast
,   -   - After we , we realize Chingachgook's been there all along
Hawkeye and Uncas join him where the branches meet the ground
Smoke drifts through the trees
Hawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again
-  - Burned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself
past what was the doorway
dead child's hand protruding from the ruin
fragment of a dress
Charred and smoldering wood
John Cameron's body in the wreckage
And then, through the collapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and are seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice
approaches and is frozen in horror
Cora shields her from the sight
Cora is affected but confronts it directly
(
) Anything to be done
returns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as they all are
We know the degree of their inner pain
All dead
bends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining
They look at each other grimly
Heyward joins them
Who were these people
(re: print) Ottawa
Excuse me
(to Hawkeye) Ottawa
enters, very careful where he places his feet
Hawkeye gestures to Heyward to stay where he is: on the periphery with the women
Mirrors
tools
clothes
all inside
(to Chingachgook) Movin' fast, not able to carry much
this was a war party
Chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican
The significance is very ominous to them
We don't know why yet
Chingachgook starts away
Let us look after them
He starts approaching the bodies
Leave them
Heyward stops
Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin
(hasn't moved) Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial
(shaking his head) Let us go, miss
will not
have seen the face of war before, Mr
Poe, but never war made on women and children
And almost as cruel is your indifference
Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her
She takes a step back, fearful
(contained) Miss Munro
(pause) They are not strangers
And they stay as they lay
realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected
She also realizes for the first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and rhythms she doesn't understand
He turns away from her and walks on
She hesitates a moment
as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks, walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard
The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them
- :  - moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and some thin grass grows
The land rises into a mound
Chingachgook and the others avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it
mutters something to Uncas
He nods and disappears amongst the white birch, soundlessly
throws Heyward a blanket
Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there
' hits the blanket
She curls into a fetal position and she's out
Heyward is nearby on watch
Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped mound
Cora has sought him out
doesn't react as Cora enters
He's scanning the trees; not looking at her
They whisper
Why didn't you bury those people
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing
You knew them
Hawkeye looks at her and nods
(stiffly) You were acting for our benefit
And apologize
misunderstood you
Well that is to be expected
My father
Your "father"
Chingachgook
He warned me about people like you
He did
Yes
He said
"do not try to make them understand you
" What
Yes
And "do not try to understand them
That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense
" Cora's indignation is cut off because
moving fast
He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy
Uncas disappears around the mound
-  - Nothing
Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the white birch
- white eyes
ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head
Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver
He's followed by others
Wary, silently, they hunt
: Towards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de la Sarre
They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts
There's nothing clumsy about them
They're the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous
If they and the Ottawa find our people, it's all over
seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic
Her hyperventilating and involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position
hand covers her mouth and silences her struggling
It's Uncas
His other arm is around her, holding her, looking towards the advancing Ottawa
on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground
& are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people
Mist envelops them
His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand
waiting for the attack
Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there
Nathaniel's impressed with her cool
He hands her a pistol
She takes it
He listens for the soft drop of moccasined feet
through the grass
Thirty feet away they stop
They're motionless
Then their leader gestures and they start backing out
The French Rangers continue towards the crescent
The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him
The French Ranger whispers something inaudible
The Ottawa chief shakes his head, "Non
Pas possible
" And means it
They retreat
: , , , tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat
& He slowly removes his hand from her mouth
She's a little shy, then she looks up, catches his eyes
Then she averts her face
sees all of it; doesn't like it
The Ottawa are gone
(quietly) Why did they turn back
In answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head
turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted against the night sky in the distance
They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial place
& She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the danger & complexity of this place
She hands the pistol back to him
Their hands almost touch
(still pissed off) "We're a breed apart and we make no sense"
(smiles) In your particular case, miss,  would make some allowance
(sarcastic) Thank you so much
Cora is angry
Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her
She settles, looking at him
Her mood changes
Then
You called Chingachgook your "father"
Where is your real family
Hawkeye's surprised by her question
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters
And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own
'm sorry
do not remember them
was one or two
How did you learn English
My father sent Uncas &  to Reverend Wheelock's school when  was ten
So we would know both worlds
though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yous
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with
The Bible
Monarchy
Many wrong ideas about the government of men
My father's people already know each man is his own nation
And only he can have dominion over himself
Not kings
No man is better than any other man
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison
(changing the subject) Why were those people living in this defenseless place
'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people
So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave
Their name was Cameron
John & Alexandria
Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars
She looks at 	Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky
(continuing; looking up) My father's people say
at the birth of the sun and of his brother, the moon, their mother died
so the sun gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life
And he drew forth from her breast the stars
The stars he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul
(the sky) So there is the Camerons' monument
my folks', too,  guess
' pensive
Hawkeye's watching her
Her reaction is enigmatic
After a pause
(low) You are right, Mr
Poe
We do not understand what is happening here
And it is not as  imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London
Sorry to disappoint you
(eyes downcast) On the contrary
It is more deeply stirring
to my blood
(then up into his eyes) than any imagining could possibly have been
She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep
Hawkeye is the one left staring into the birch forest, a little surprised
Some of his assumptions about her were wrong
-  - Deep fog has set in
hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us
It moves a branch aside
It's Uncas
Spread to the right is Chingachgook, far to the left is Hawkeye
They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks
Much further
Top of this ridge
Fort and Lake George are downhill of it
Re-energized, her spirits pick up
Will we be able to bathe
Before Cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar
Alice is alarmed
Thunder
Papa will arrange something
looks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to Hawkeye and Chingachgook
' : and the band of red-painted Ottawa and Coureurs des Bois, who have now split into two groups, are still on their trail
Meanwhile, oblivious
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant
If Cora doesn't marry you,  shall
Alice
Heyward laughs
Hawkeye sees them
It bothers us: will these Europeans, including Cora, shed their frontier experience
can't wait to see Papa
And you, Duncan
What are you looking forward to
Posting to a different continent
He and Alice laugh
Cora does not
think it's very important and exciting
Heyward looks at her
She's not kidding
: helps Alice
As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like
His dark thoughts are distracted by a  of light and more
- drops and pulls Cora to the ground
Lightning
Hawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to the top of the ridge
:  & join them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of England in the wilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome
: is none of those things
The thunder is the roar of French siege cannon clouded in dense smoke
The flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red glare
Fort William Henry is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army
looks over his shoulder
: pursuing them
There's no way back
They're propelled forward
,   #1 -   - French cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame
dug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward the fort by two poles and fascis on the sides
searching the night
: is black
light the battlefield revealing the French trenches
excited
Colonial militia and Mohawk snipers fire their rifles
The British gun crew scrambles to adjust their 18 pounders
#1 #2 , French cannon  rips into the fortifications, exploding wood and earth, shredding the English gun crew with cannister
The English fight stubbornly, but we feel they're outgunned
Meanwhile
new artillery duel erupts
The action is to the west side of the fort
On the north, the fire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground
Then a dark shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections
We see in silhouette the outline of a birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake
- Behind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts
& : Behind them is black water
Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook, followed by Uncas and Hawkeye
Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and the forms of the girls further out
Chingachgook's war club is held low
The Huron senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back
Hawkeye's knife flashes in the night
Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto the debris
The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side
Uncas jerks him forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him
,   - - - Amidst the cannonade roar, ad-libbed shouts from Hawkeye and Heyward convince battle begrimed soldiers to open the sally-port
Our people rush in
the group moves through the long, dank, tunnel
Enlisted men escorting them
Another torch from the other direction:   is revealed
'm Major Duncan Heyward
Captain Jeffrey Beams
We didn't think you'd make it through
Where's Colonel Munro
His daughters are here, too
Beams raises his torch, sees the muddied, soaked women
He is shocked that they traveled with Heyward
,   -  - emerges from a sally-port tunnel
It's smokey
is deafening
The group has traveled through a nightmare, only to arrive in hell
,  & , ,  & run diagonally past pyramidal stacks of cannon ball, smoldering beams and shrapnel, wounded men
Just then a mortar is fired and explodes, killing the gun crew
On the ramparts Mohawks and Colonial Militia, sniping at the French
Women huddle in corners next to the sick and dying
: (shouts over roar) Uncas
Nathaniel
waves
One wounded man, , intercepts Uncas
Thought you and Nathaniel weren't joinin'-up
(on the run) Didn't
Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'
running from his quarters is shocked to see them
(hysterical) Papa, Papa
(enraged) Why are you here
Cora is stunned
Alice is decimated by her father's anger
Munro sees and whips off his coat to cover them and takes Alice under his arm
Bombardment resumes
Alice clings while they race for the cover of his quarters:] (to Heyward; re: Alice & Cora) Why did you allow them to come
And where the bloody hell are my reinforcements
They race into the yellow lantern light of Munro's quarters and slam and bolt the heavy door
Heyward's confused
'  - (embracing his daughters; softer) Told you to stay away from this hell hole
Why did you disobey me
When
How
My letter
There was none
What
There was no letter
sent three men to Webb
One called Magua arrived
He delivered no such message
Munro's stunned
Does Webb not even know we are besieged
Sir
Webb has no idea
And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements
Munro has nowhere for his rage to go
Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father
At 45-55, the British Army has been his life
He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers like Webb would disdain his Scots origins
From under his fury: (flat) What happened to you
(suddenly tired) Ambush
on the George Road
This Magua led us into it
(pause) eighteen killed
It's these men who saved us
They guided us here
Thank you
How can  reward you
No answer
Then
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores
What else
Some food
(to Uncas) 'm indebted to you
And get your side sewn up, young man
sees his exhausted and bloodstained surgeon in the doorway that leads to the next rooms
(bellows) Mr
Phelps
' face lights up when he sees Cora Munro
Miss Cora
How are you
(smiles) Fine, Mr
Phelps
Have you cat gut and a suturing needle
(for Uncas) And we could use some rum, clothes, and a place to wash
Cora tries to remove Alice from her father, but she clings to him
Munro holds her tighter
Then he whispers something to her
She nods her head
And Cora takes her
They exit
is moved beyond words by his daughters' presence
There's a break, a pause
(to Heyward over table map) What a place for them
Might  enquire after the situation, sir, given that 've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above
(perfunctory) Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them
They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day
His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust
They look to be three hundred yards out
You have three days
Bloody murderers
man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb
not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements
Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits
Webb's not in Albany
He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago
Webb's at Edward
Yes, sir
Only twelve miles away
He could be here day after tomorrow
(to Hawkeye) Find your man, sir
Captain Beams will give you the message
Beams nods
Munro turns back to the map
Hawkeye has something else to say
John Cameron's cabin
We come upon it last night
Burned out
Everyone murdered
And it was Ottawa
They're allied to the French
Munro looks at him
Yes, Mr
Poe
So
It was a war party
It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier
Munro turns to look at him for a long beat
Munro doesn't like what his response must be to this news
He turns to Heyward and the map
(cold) Thank you
Hawkeye's dismissed, frozen out
Many men here, their homes are in the path
That's all, sir
Hawkeye is furious
Chingachgook gestures Hawkeye out
He leaves Munro's quarters almost knocking over an entering Adjutant who backs way up to let Chingachgook pass
Things were done
Nobody was spared
Terrible feature of war in the Americas
(beat; a mantra) Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty
Our duty is to defeat France
That hangs on a courier to Webb
'  -   - of three Seneca women and five boys, led by a Jesuit, sing the Te Deum in the Iroquois language
This is a large tent that could sleep twenty
Montcalm's four personal guards are at the entrance as well as    in dirty lace, a facial wound and a braceful of pistols on a sash
Inside is simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot battle standard and flag of France
stands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed Seneca chief in a silk turban
(low) and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left us no time to put our cabins in order before telling us our French father had need of our aid
We rolled our blankets and were the first to be here
Yet we are not the first and closest to my father's campfire
The Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his waistcoat
He has an acute intellect, an elegant manner
He is more aristocratic than Munro, but a consummate professional soldier
Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm sees and nods to
entering with four Huron braves
This is not the Magua we saw on the trail
In his scalp lock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes
match-coat blanket drapes his left shoulder
(to Seneca Chief) For my children and the children of the true faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless
will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow , myself, will sing the war song with you in the great council house
The Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, exit
The look on Magua's face and the wry expression on Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is based on realpolitik
Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your English friends
Magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm and sits, European style
(over his shoulder) Louis Antoine, join us
enters
He wears a functional melange of Indian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officer's waistcoat
Hear what le Subtil has to tell us
Bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, at twenty-six was a secretary to the French Ambassador in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he was elected a member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight he's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain
Later in life, he brought "bougainvillea" from Tahiti to Europe to America
English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward with 33rd Regiment
He does not know my father's army attacks Fort William Henry
But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't get through
He'll send another
The Grey Hair will try
Four or five, including two women entered the fort
The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's knife but escaped
They'll be under it again
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart
Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever
Montcalm won't get a direct answer
My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through the night, now
You may have your opportunity soon
,  -  - exhausted, sitting on a low stool, taking a breath
(
) She know what she's doin'
Phelps looks up, then he looks over his shoulder at Cora
She's in a borrowed launderess dress/blouse
She looks different
He's a little indignant
First assisted me in Austria when she was fourteen
would say she does
Her apron is stained
Hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the New World, but it's not her first military campaign
Still angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's nevertheless falling for Cora
She does not shy away from much
(elsewhere) What's that
Nothin'
Alice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention
Outside the surgery where a casement meets a wall, she sits, withdrawn
catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to her
(
) Miss Cora
Gentleman looking for you
enters
Cora's sewing up Uncas
(looks up) Mr Poe
Miss
(re: cotton) May
Cora, curious, nods
Hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined and discarded dress that she now uses to bandage Uncas
We don't know why; neither does Cora
(to Uncas) You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro
Uncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye
Then he's up and he hurts
Cora starts to tend another wounded man
As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates
Sensing it, Cora turns
What are you looking at, Mr
Poe
Why,  am looking at you, Miss
Cora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner
It's not insolent, only unsettling
Feeling foolish; she turns
He leaves
-  &  - having worked through the night, are still digging the diagonally-advancing trench
We note it's closer than it was
- at their posts guard the sappeurs
Meanwhile
,   - - - opens
Ten Mohawks and Rangers crawl towards the French lines
Meanwhile
,  -  &  - are low and out of French sight in the northeast battery
Four others are with them, including Captain Jack
Stacked rifles are against the casement
We don't know why
Each rifle is within reach of Hawkeye's hand
Hawkeye is taking extra care loading Killdeer
He charges it once, then overloads the powder by a quarter charge
You told him about the raid
(nods) He does not want to hear it
(pause) But he is gonna have to
(to one man) Get together by the West Battery James & Ian, Sharitarish & William
Hawkeye uses the fine cotton he took from Cora
Uncas sees it
Tight weave
Another forty yards
Uncas nods
Hawkeye wets it to make a tighter gas seal and rams it home
The tighter fit requires more effort
looks below to ground level
- Two pistols are holstered in a sash around his chest
He wears no hat and carries no pack
He waits by the sally-port door
-   - are suddenly tomahawked and knifed by stripped down 42nd Highlanders and Mohawks
Alarm is raised
French and some Huron run to advance
Shots are fired
The Rangers & Mohawks fall back
emboldened, pursue
suddenly Heyward and three companies of the 62nd regiment of Foot (60 men) are over the top in perfect formation
Sergeant
Form three ranks
Sir
(bellows to troops) Upon the center, wheel to the left-about
March
(three motions; drums) Rear ranks, proper distance
(the rear ranks back up six paces) Front ranks, take your distance
March
(everybody moves) Halt
(in unison they slam to a stop) Make ready
(muskets snap to port arms) & dodge right & left of the 62nd's line of fire
are coming forward
Their sergeants trying to stop and form their men in ad-libbed French
62ND (dead cool) First rank
Second rank
Present arms
(muskets shouldered) Fire
Like one shot, lightening, smoke and
65 caliber death screams from the first two ranks like a scythe, cutting down
: Fourteen wounded or killed
62ND    - exposed
He's oblivious to incoming rounds
piece of hat is blown off, epaulet is shot off
The man next to him is killed and bloodies Heyward's coat
Advance, Sergeant Major
Sir
(to soldiers) Third rank
Twelve paces
Forward march
Drums
The rear rank walks through the first two ranks, who are priming and loading in perfect order to their Sergeant Major's commands
As the third rank becomes the first rank
Shoulder arms
(slam) Present
(slam) Fire
-  - sprints for the trees during the diversion of Heyward's sally
materialize from nowhere and charge at him
both are  off their feet by
,  -  & now handed already-loaded, primed and cocked rifles while the four men behind them reload the two just fired
Hawkeye gestures
-  - are running down the hill to intercept the courier
One fires
a near miss
- half second later, Uncas
One Canadien's falling through the trees as the second one's hit by Uncas' shot
reaches out his hand
Killdeer with the heavier load is slapped into it
Hawkeye aims
Looks away a second and comes back to the sight in deep concentration
The world goes silent
' :  & pursuer are barely visible
Only patches appear momentarily between the trees
They're three hundred yards away: an impossible shot in 1757
- will intersect the courier
His arm is back with his tomahawk to throw
- judges wind, elevates the long rifle
and  at us
: Hawkeye's heavy round rips through
We  the ball cut air
few leaves flutter
- whacked head over heels by the impact
looks over his shoulder
He didn't know the Canadien was there
He stumbles in the half light
Then he runs on
-  - The three companies of the 62nd Regiment of Foot file back into the fort in perfect order
The sally-port is closed
Three men are wounded
The diversion worked perfectly
Sergeant Major
Sir
Thank you, Sergeant Major
Thank the men
Atten-hut
& have seen no action for three days & nights
Heyward got their blood running and won their respect
They step aside and nod to him
Heyward keeps walking
He is home
'  -  - a knock and Heyward enters
& Alice is in her father's bed
Cora is collecting and tearing linen into strips for bandaging
Cora
wanted to talk to you, but 'll come back another time
Alice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed
Alice
Talk to Duncan, Cora
must manage
cannot be an invalid schoolgirl
(starts for door) 'll see if Mr
Phelps needs anything
She leaves
'm sorry,  didn't mean to
Her nerves are shattered
She's trying to be brave
There's a lot going on under Cora's surface
We don't know what it is, but it's disconcerting
Cora,  adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England
am certain of that
More than ever before
(softens) believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts
Duncan
(pause) Duncan,  promised you an answer
You have complimented me with your persistence and patience
But the decision 've come to is 'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment
Heyward is stunned
And it's been unfair to you, while  search myself for feelings, which, if they were there and as strong as they ought to be, would've made themselves known long ago
(pause) Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan
And please take this as my final answer
It must be no
Heyward' shattered inside
see
am sorry, Duncan
Heyward nods
He's speechless
He's errect as he leaves the room
: The tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter-timbered walls for support
Then she collects the linen and starts out
,   - moving through the corridor past wounded
Two French mortar bombs explode above one of the casements
We hear shrill screams in the distance and
(
) it was no raidin' party out for pillage
The cabin was attacked by a war party
They are sweeping south down the frontier spreading terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos all the men are here
(
) And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of Cameron's
Cora, passing the open door to Munro's crowded office, now hesitates
' : Hawkeye, Captain Jack Winthrop, Ian, seven or eight other militia spokesmen, Munro, Heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of Rangers
(to Jack) must receive proof more conclusive than Mr
Poe's opinion before  weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw
Chingachgook's of the same opinion
Taken together, that's gospel
Your fort will	 stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence
judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families
Major Heyward was at John Cameron's
He saw what it was
(looking to Heyward for confirmation of his point of view) What did you see, Major
Heyward looks around the room
And he catches the doorway
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests
At the same time
examines him with a cool, level stare
looks at Munro
More French rounds detonate
What if Webb gets here and they need to launch a counter-attack
They need every man they have
It's his moment of decision
(to Munro) saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than a raid by savages bent on thievery
Jack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel
You're a liar
' saddened
Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes
can't help it
He turns to look at Cora
' : She's gone
suffused with an inner sadness, turns to Hawkeye
And the blood is on your hands
Heyward reaches for his sword
(to Heyward) 'll have none of that
(to colonials) Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman
Not a butcher
Easy for you to suppose
While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms
(exploding) You forget yourself
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise
British promises are honored
And the militia will not be released
Because  need more definite proof than this man's word
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here
This interview's over
The militia stays
(to Munro) Does the rule of English law no longer govern
Has it been replaced by absolutism
This is very dangerous talk
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French
That is sedition
Treason
That is the truth
(restaining himself) ought to have you whipped from this fort
Major
(changes down) Some day  think you and  are gonna have a serious disagreement
(steel) Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition
Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion
(pause) My decision is final
Get out
Hawkeye and the others are not intimidated
Their rage smolders
The look on Hawkeye's face says this is not over
,   -  - Sparks shower skyward
Impromptu music
Some Celtic proto-bluegrass played on fiddle & drums
It's stirring
: laundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and American Rangers
few people lit by the firelight are solemn
Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while
underlit by the red firelight
They are a disposable people, a diverse plurality stuck in a postage stamp-size fort in an ocean of forest, locked into mortal deadly conflict because of the policies of cold and distant European monarchs
We can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind logs, crates and new wreckage from the day's bombardment
(low) got no kin in the settlements
If  did, 'd be long gone
You didn't think it right to be here in the first place
By my light that's how  saw it then and see it that way now
(low) But we are under English military authority
(low) believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us
All they have over us is tyranny, then
And 'll stay here no longer
No force on earth will keep me here
Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot
So each man make your own decision
Those who are goin', be back here in an hour
Out the northern sally-port
Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line
Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers
(grumbles) Should've skinned outta this long ago
#2 Got no families, Captain
Figured we'd stay and give 'em a hand even though
(to Colonial #2) 'll cover them from the top of the casement
(in amazement) You're not coming with us
Hawkeye shakes his head
Got a reason to stay
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery
Low laughter (dry) It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop
(more laughs) Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn
(sticks out his hand and grasps Winthrop's) Good luck, Jack
The men split up
- wanders among the dancers and musicians clustered in groups, lit by the firelight
Someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction
' : in the shadows, leaning against the wall, searching
we sense she's been looking for him
He comes up to her
She turns in surprise
Somehow she breathes easier because he's there
She's in a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up
Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people
& Hawkeye takes Cora's hand
Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing through a new land, a new self-determination
She's drawn to this rough yet graceful man with his direct manner
Hawkeye settles against a wall
She leans next to him
Their shoulders touch
To her everything about him seems to be somehow right
She's discovered that the passions and outrage that move him, move her
And her readiness to give herself to what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his
looks at her
She's beautiful in the firelight
Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his arms
His lips find hers and tears stream down her face
She's suffused with an elation she can't explain
In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a wild continent
-  &  - door  inwards
Twelve British sentries storm in
Four bear torches
: , , ,   & are out of the bunks and moving with them with tomahawks, knives, a flintlock
(
) You
Halt
their muskets aimed mostly at Hawkeye
As you were
Hawkeye freezes
The others slow down, indecisive
Hawkeye drops his tomahawk and says something in Mohican to restrain Chingachgook and Uncas
The British in the torchlight with the long muskets and bayonets are an image out of Goya
Take him
Hawkeye's spun around and while his hands are bound
(Mohican; subtitled) Why do they make my son prisoner
(Mohican; subtitled) helped Winthrop and the others leave
This fight is not yours, father
love you and my brother
And you should leave this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee
(Mohican; subtitled) What will they do with my white son
One of the guards - scared to death by Chingachgook - nervously fingers his musket
Get back from him
enters
shrugs in answer to Chingachgook's question
' moved out
As he passes Heyward, his eyes lock on his
'  -  - He saved us
We are alive only because of him
: Heyward, Munro, Cora
We've entered mid-argument
An adjutant comes and goes
Heyward and Munro are sensitive to appearances in front of the adjutant
Cora couldn't give a damn
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence
He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children
He knew the consequences
And he stayed
Are those the actions of a criminal
Duncan, do something
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations
He ought to pay without sending you to beg
You know he wouldn't send me
You misrepresented what you saw and caused this
(frustrated) , too, was at that farm
It was as he said
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies
To come and go without so much as a "by your leave
" They do not live their lives "by your leave
" They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way
(distant) You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him
Cora is having her intelligence written off as a hormone attack
She contains her fury
Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable qualities
But taken as a whole,  was wrong to have thought so highly of you
Heyward's shot through the heart
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon
"Justice"
If that's "justice"
, then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people
You do not know what you are saying
(explodes) Yes  do
know exactly what  am saying
And if it is sedition, then  am guilty of sedition, too
She exits, leaving them there
,  - Heavy timbered door
sentry
They stand at attention when Cora passes as opposed to barring her entry
- comes to the door, grips the bars with his hands and looks at Cora
They are silent for a moment, then
Sorry
can't ask you in
Cora's pale smile
They're going to hang you
(pause; soft) Why didn't you leave when you had the chance
Because what  am interested in is right here
What would you have me do
He touches her hand
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not
If they do not arrive, the fort will fall
If that happens, stay close to your father
The French will protect the officer class among the English
No
will find you
Do not
(pause) Promise me
Cora drops her forehead to Hawkeye's hands wrapped around the bars
She acquiesces, nods
Then   commences
Cora & Hawkeye look up
Mortar bombs begin striking the fortress
Still dark
The final French bombardment has started
The whole world's on fire, isn't it
pause
This part of it sure is
Reaching through the bars set in the thick door, their hands clasp each others
On that image
-   -  (2ND ) French cannoneers in Batteries #1 and #2 fire again and again
They work like precision drill teams
ending in Battery #3 is complete and surprisingly close to William Henry's walls
Crews reload the squat and massive newly arrived thirteen inch mortars
The flash-hole is primed
The burning fuse is jammed into the bomb
The primer charge is lit off and the crew ducks as the crude iron belches red flame and black smoke into the lightening sky
The second mortar
Then a
-    - tries to return fire but can't under the heavy French bombardment
The French mortar bomb arcs in and  smoke, flame and shrapnel, wiping out most of the crew
The fortress is under the heaviest attack we've seen
Wounded are in shock or terrorized
Another mortar bomb arcs in and explodes part of a building and casement, starting a fire
Another lands in the grounds
People scatter
It doesn't explode
One soldier dashes to rip out the fuse
As his hand is inches away
-  -  - protects Cora through the bars as she half sleeps through the muffled roar
Then the thundering stops
Hawkeye seperates himself from her and crosses to the window
,   -  : bows deeply to Major Beams
French honor guard of five men is behind him
white scarf is on his sword tip
The fresh destruction of the fort is apparent
Debris smolders
-  - crosses to an awakened Cora
He touches her face
He's desperate to drill these next words into her brain
What is it
don't know
Whatever happens you stay with your father
You stay among the officers
Cora looks up at Hawkeye
We feel forboding
are heard drums
- , ,  - The drums are from Munro's honor guard
They stop
: Marquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold fleur-de-lis on a field of blue)
They carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here
To 	them, assaulting this fort is the easy part
The drummers of the honor guard play a tattoo behind them
Huron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox
hear the drum of the honor guard and wait
They're in war paint
Many tattoos
Split ears
The Osage scalping locks are hennaed red
Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage
At their head
in full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting
Drums
-   () grim, silent, watchful
&      () watching the parlay from a blown apart battery
Silent
:  & and their honor guards
Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the ground in a courtly bow
Munro bows coldly
Colonel Munro,  have known you as a gallant antagonist
am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend
And  to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress
Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material
mere chance has allowed me to array against you
Monsieur le Marquis,  am a soldier, not a diplomat
You called this parlay for a reason
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope
But now,  beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity
beg you to consider my terms for your surrender
However  may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy
These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and  am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves
Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb
Montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro
(quietly) My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you
Munro is puzzled, suspicious
(to Bougainville) Read the dispatch
& ] (
- reading) "Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry
have no men available to send to your rescue
It is impossible
advise you to seek terms for surrender
Signed Webb
" Munro is rocked, as if struck by a blow
Bougainville hands Heyward the letter
(confirming) This is the signature of Webb
(to Munro) And  know the temper of our men
Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end
(to Montcalm) You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis
(salutes) Munro starts off
Montcalm stops him
Sir
(challengingly) am incapable of mistreating brave men
beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to my terms
Munro turns
Such as
My master requires the fort be destroyed
But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied
None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge
They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms
Their arms
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition
Other than that, ask what you wish
Munro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity
The honors of war
Granted
My colors
Carry them to England to your King with pride
Allow me to consult with my officers
As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put back together
As the men move away from the French
have lived to see two things  never expected
An Englishman afraid to support a friend
And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage
General Webb can burn in hell
We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts
Our mission is to fight
(flares) Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same
Today  have learned that they are not
Munro looks at the fortress behind him
Sir
(stops him with his eyes) The decision is final
beat
Then Munro turns toward Montcalm
Their eyes meet across the churned, scarred earth of the battlefield
am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity
The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon
Granted, Monsieur
And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so
-   - passes away from the little city of tents in the direction of the beach and towards William Henry
He seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the fort
As he approaches a sentry: Qui vive
France
Le mot d'ordre
La victoire
'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant
The cloak parts
By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and the soldier as General Montcalm
The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues walking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees
: The moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father
Yes
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters
They have consented to go
So now he calls them enemies no longer
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood
It is still bright
Only when it is red, then it will be buried
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post
Is he not tired
Where is that sun
It has gone behind the hill
It is dark and cold
It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need
(threatening) And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe
There have been many clouds and many mountains
But now he has come to lead his nation
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light,  know well
Magua grabs the hand of the French commander
Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's eyes
Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest
Does my father know that
' deep indentation and scar
That's where a lead bullet has torn you
And this
Magua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back
deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide
] My son has been sadly injured
Who did this
(laughs; sardonic) Magua slept hard in the English wigwams
And the sticks left their mark
(pause; for real) Magua's village and lodges were burnt
Magua's children were killed by the English
Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair
Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another
The Grey Hair was the father of all this
(pause) In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free
In his heart he always was Huron
And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead
My son Magua's pain is my pain
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms
Munro would
But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake
Having let them go,  fear  will only fight the same men again when  move south
(pause; shrugs) And yet,  cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France
Long pause, wheels turn
Then: Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can
Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that
As the English march away, our soldiers and the Canadiens will be drawn to the looting of the fort
except for a small guard
Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm
-  - walking back to the Huron camp
Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods, waiting for Magua
Now he joins him
They walk in silence
Then
(in Iroquois; re: Montcalm) wonder at the blindness and pride of the white man
He believes only he knows how to speak falsely to make other men do his bidding
Magua exhales in derision
,   -  - at the end of the column, rides out on his horse
Both sides of the gate are jammed with armed French troops standing at attention
The French colors and honor guard are just outside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as is - at the head - Montcalm
: trots past his walking column out the gate
He does not look at the French
salutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle
: salutes Montcalm
(eyes forward) Monsieur, the fort is yours
- - marching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort
The French troops have thinned out
Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead
The 33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum
In the
Munro on his horse passes Heyward as he rides towards the front of his column
Heyward does not look at him
- on the back of a mare
Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under the arm of her sister
They ride behind the standard bearers
In the
her father is seen approaching and takes his position at their side
Cora looks down the column, sheilding her eyes against the sun
We know who she's looking for
Hawkeye
' : The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward
thirty to forty women and a number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and many Mohawk, walking wounded
The column is still snaking its way out of the fort
No Hawkeye
straining to see
- being assembled, their hands shackled
Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen
He stands erect, walking out of the gate
The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior
Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees
& on the other side of the column
Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own musket
They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye
Their eyes connect
We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration
few insults
The British soldiers answer
Nobody breaks rank
It's just talk
- His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley
The path cuts through the forested hills ahead
He sees
'  : riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers
Only a few scattered and curious Huron and Ottawa
She does not see him
-  & as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley
We're shooting from inside the dark woods
Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron
They are in no order, are spread out and don't constitute a threat
They watch the column
slides across the shoulders and back of a large man wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked
He is heavily war-painted
- and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red
The right third is painted black
Much silver is in his ears
His tomahawk is in his left hand
His cut-down musket in his right fist
Magua's attention is all focused to one point
'  &  :  &  & at the head of the column
This is the focus of Magua's attention
: ,   & Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye
: doesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye
running toward the column
Just one man
No musket
He's running and whooping like a dog charging from his master's front yard
Why
the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a British trooper who falls dead
The single Huron never breaks stride
He simply runs off again
horrified, holds Alice tighter
has seen it too
And now he sees
62ND fixing bayonets
large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons and other Indians
of the 33rd present arms
Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition
Locks are cocked
There's the answer
Steady
No one fires
- are watching what happens
scanning them
(to Sergeant Major) Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major
Yes sir
Drums beat the cadence
step over the fallen soldier
Heads turn, they're on edge
- ,  & watching
They exchange looks
This is not good
Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer and his own musket
' : Hold
We start to make out details in the shadow
Tree trunks
We become accustomed to the dimness
Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest
Many Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows
They're moving along parallel to the column, stalking it
Waiting
racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd
look at their sergeant
He nods
They wait until he's within ten feet of the column
Both bayonet the Indian
He's dead
-  & saw what happened
But, they hold their ranks
among the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously
Some are cocking flintlocks
gallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack
We hear him from the distance ordering
Do not break ranks
want these ranks to hold
Cora's frightened
' frustrated
He saw Munro leave Cora
He knows events have a momentum and it's accelerating
& move next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as
with children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against hope these are isolated incidents
draws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning the hills
- His eyes see Munro
& : raises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop
hundreds have been stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands
Then
: from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive ambush of mostly Hurons
They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a of musket fire, war whoops and screams as
& dropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes
is being unshackled by Uncas
The sergeant is rising from the ground where Chingachgook knocked him
Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the column
- charging down the hill
with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the area in which he saw Munro
& at the head of the disintegrating column
Cora's holding Alice's head to her bosom, covering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds
shouting orders
Right - about face

Hurons are twenty yards away and closing
Fire
As the line of muskets belch smoke and fire
:   & We're shooting into the "v" of the valley with Hurons and other tribes pouring down from both sides
(: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and Mohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off views, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of
using their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog swirls among the men - fighting for their lives
glides through the scenes, striking and hunting
Some of his coterie of braves near him
He sees
hugging the ground in fear
Magua throws her over
It's not Alice Munro
It's a woman protecting her baby
Magua walks on
One of the braves behind Magua raise his tomahawk
On his downswing
running through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away
Cora
Chingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club
& running through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in struggle with Hurons
Cora's dress is torn
She holds Alice to her
There's a pistol in Cora's hand
scalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us
shoots him in the face
: and her eyes take it all in
And her affect starts to flatten
blankness suffuses her expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her head
locked in combat
He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand fires Killdeer at
six feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back
free for a moment, spins
He has no idea of direction any more
Everything is death in strange tableaux
Meanwhile: hollering Cora
Alice
He cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right
An Osage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to stab down into Munro's neck
The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in an iron grip
His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires backward, point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse
Just then Munro's mount is shot
His horse rears up, throws Munro and falls on him
shouting orders over the deafening noise
Second rank fire

: His eyes drop to what's in front of him
The field goes quiet
' : his lower body is trapped under his dead horse
Magua leans in towards him
Grey Hair
will cut your heart from your living chest in front of your eyes
As you die, know that  will put under the knife your children and wipe your seed from this earth forever
Magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro
& spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives
The Huron goes down and then the Mohawk is shot
The Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with tomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other
Two Mohawks and three Rangers fighting back to back
They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst bodies and ground slippery with blood
As smoke obscures their image
& in a group of civilian militia
Two of the militiamen are shot down
The third engages a Fox warrior
Cora & Alice run
' frozen in agony by shock
reaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into the air
But his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood
: seen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro
: saw him and fights his way to attack when
crazed,  through men, knocking Hawkeye over
protecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking his attack, his arm and his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an Ottawa who's behind him

One-handed, Heyward fires the musket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod through him
Then Heyward's shot in the thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways
Dazed
Barely able to stand
He uses the musket as a cane and
Rank two, six paces back
Rank one, present
Rank two did not retreat six paces

Heyward straightens

One French officer is shot by a Huron
The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second
Then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down
pleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand
He offers his cross
The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud
sees a flash of something yellow
So does Hawkeye
They charge into the swirling chaos of attacking bodies
As we lose sight of them
on her hands and knees
massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take her life and her scalp
He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases him
He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly
is spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye
Uncas has Alice and Cora
from the earlier group are nearby
They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out with bayonets and tomahawks
, , ,  ,   & ' back through the swirling smoke
There seems to be a lull
Then they're hit from the side by musket fire
One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded
Hurons attack
The Mohawk supports the wounded Ranger
shields Cora as they back up
smashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and shoots another
Then he sees
It's glass-smooth
And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes
- , , , , , & back into the water
They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to the canoes
held up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams
something underwater is pulling her down
An Ottawa brave rockets out of the shallows
Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and
has shoved a large birch canoe at them
Suddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye
His hands rest on Hawkeye's shoulders
Hawkeye looks into his face
Tries to hold him up, tries to rescue him
frozen moment
Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring into Hawkeye's as the light goes out
Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float away
He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe
-  &   - The bottom of the frame is water like glass
Smoke obscures the background
Fingers tendril towards us
Out of the mist we  small splashing and then the high bow of a war canoe defines itself
It's paddled towards us
,  & Cora's behind Hawkeye
Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas
:  & Cora looks left
Her eyes go wide
No
spins
&     33RD have emerged from the smoke ten feet from them
Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at Hawkeye
is non-plussed
He doesn't stop paddling
You got nothin' better to do today on Lake George than shoot me, Major, then go ahead
Heyward's a hair's breadth from firing
Suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and rounds come in
They're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and fifth - of Huron
is indifferent to Huron musket balls
Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays Heyward no heed
Stop it
Heyward comes to his senses
His head is gashed
scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied around his leg
He lowers the gun
When you fall into British hands again, Nathaniel Poe,  will have you hanged
paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake
& ' with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken
looks to Uncas
They both realize the same thing
Hawkeye nods and he, Uncas & Chingachgook begin to paddle furiously
The others match the doubled pace
They're sprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting
maintain their steady pace
Three or four Hurons fire
' Musket balls ricochet on the water's surface
One rips a hole through the bow
Hawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving out
#1 Can't
keep it up
Pull
He renews the attack on the water with the paddle
(shouts) How long
(shouts) Only chance we got is
(breathless) to get more distance on 'em and go to ground
Heyward digs in
Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets sound
new hail of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes
One Redcoat is shot in the back
He falls overboard
(shouts) Pull
sprints forward
: looks over his shoulder
They're pulling away from them
Pull
More Huron musket balls hit water nearby
in Heyward's boat is shot
the
65 caliber ball didn't penetrate his skin
The Redcoat - amazed - picks it off the floor of the canoe
#2 Spent
Distance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics
They're out of smoothbore musket range
] (to Heyward) Head for
for the white water
Do you hear me, sir
(exhausted) If you ever fall
into British hands
(breathes) What white water
& ' : divided by a spit of land
The right fork becomes a river with white water rapids
- paddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way ahead of the Hurons
leaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of Heyward's and takes control
He roughly gestures to the Redcoat and the Major to stop paddling
He and Hawkeye will pilot the two canoes
-  - The canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet-propelled
: racing in the same direction they are
They hit it straight on and it shoots over them and they're drenched by two waves coming from the sides
& paddle like fiends to get momentum and control
' Same thing
When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to "pull" and they do
As soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through stern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way through a hazard of
jutting out of the water
- Hawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to shove the canoe away from jutting rocks
Uncas does the same
Past the jutting rocks, Uncas swings it back around while
smashes into the camera
& as the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow
Then suddenly it's through and the water is miraculously smooth
The Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride
That's because they think they're home free
Here's where it gets tricky
Heyward turns to look in front of him
He doesn't know what the hell Hawkeye's talking about
' : looks glass-smoth
Although there is a distant  of sorts
Then Heyward realizes: something's wrong with this picture
: The look on his face starts to change
' : The glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world
The river just ends
: , , realize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall
There's a couple of outcroppings of rock in the center at the very edge
We are at Glen Falls
Don't move
from the other side of the falls
It's a two hundred foot high, death-defying cataract
The canoes - slightly above us - will go right over
At the last moment, Hawkeye & Uncas land both on either side of the larger rock outcropping
It is literally at the lip of the falls
grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe
He loses his grip
The canoe rockets for the edge
lurches sideways, grabs a tree root
He is the only link of the canoe to earth
The bow, with Heyward, is literally hanging over the edge
Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to the rock
He gestures to Heyward
crawls forward and makes the island
Then the two Redcoats
Finally Uncas
The canoe rockets over the falls
Meanwhile
Hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush
As they clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, we see Hawkeye is slipping into a crevice
He motions to Cora
Uncas carries the wounded Ranger
Heyward helps Alice
-  - The irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of Hawkeye, Cora and then the others entering
Where do we go from here
We don't
don't understand
This is it, as far as we can go
If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land
If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls
Then what
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward
And if we're unlucky
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me
: Hawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger
Chingachgook carries Alice, down the rockface into a cave
We hear a distant  reverberating off the walls
: are scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water
At an earlier time the formation was part of the falls
& reach the irregular floor of the chamber
The  is louder
a curtain of falling water
They're behind the cataract, probably a third of the way down its height
Light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence
They're exhausted
The others join them
They almost have to shout to be heard
followed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies
They check their powder
They have almost none
Uncas shares his with Hawkeye
The Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked, the paper cartridges a soggy mess
Heyward has none
The Ranger has two left
In Mohican, Chingachgook decides some things
Hawkeye and Uncas nod
Heyward approaches Hawkeye
Any powder
: (crossing to Cora) Only one or two loads
is soaked to the bones
Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out
Cora turns her back, strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois
Are we safe
Maybe
Our father
Did you see my father
: The look on his face tells it all Tell me
Hawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers to her
We don't hear what he says
Cora drops to her knees and places her hands over her eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away
Leads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face covered and she cries softly into his shoulder
: says into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks
Say nothing to Alice
Hawkeye nods
stands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated with its shimmer
She's oblivious to all the events and everything going on around her
sees Cora & Hawkeye together and turns away
Uncas watches Alice
The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep
The Redcoat is exhausted
Hawkeye & Cora against the wall
-      &   - landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's already behind the mountains
The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white highlights of the foaming water are going rose
Reflecting the darkening sky, where the surface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal
: a shaved head and muscled back stands into the foreground
It moves down the shore away from camera
He's followed by other Huron warriors
They're two hundred yards away from Glen Falls island
looks at the island of rock & trees and tilts his head curiously
&  -   - watches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls
: join him, moving frenetically, uneasily
The leader of the pack looks up & howls as his eyes go white reflecting the new moon
-  - hears the distant howl
He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling water
Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there
He exchanges worried glances with Uncas & Chingachgook
immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves carefully to the first fissure
Hawkeye follows
His countenance gives way momentarily
All his experience seems of no avail
He touches the side of Cora's face
Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook
sensing new danger, slips away on her own
crosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious
She can't do a thing except hold his hand and think of her father
-  & below the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses
- against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky
looks at the sky through the fissure
She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight pull her forward
She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them
Suddenly
yanks her down next to him
He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand
There is no sign she was seen
& He relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent
Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up, as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy
Uncas tries to restrain her
' eyes slowly open
Oblivion disappears
It's replaced with escalating fear
She holds onto Uncas with desperation
Her fingers claw his shoulders
She buries her face in his chest
Uncas
Her body shudders
Her terror's total
He tries to restrain and calm her
She won't let him
Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life, she holds him between her thighs
And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name and he responds
He loves her in the half-light
his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and holds her
Then she's flooded with shame
He reaches for her
She jerks away
He reaches for her again and clutches her to him
And she breaks down
Then he turns her face to him, but her expression has completely flattened
She's not a lover to Uncas now
She's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her
-  - beaches a canoe on the bank
He and eight braves ease out
His war paint is fresh: green handprints on his chest and black and green on his face
Black plumes are affixed to his scalp-lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder
The right arm carrying his musket is exposed
Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk
He walks towards us approaching the island, two hundred yards away
-  - checks his powder horn
Nearly empty
He looks at Chingachgook
,  -  - with the Ranger, looks up
Hawkeye enters
The look on his face
Then hers
They've been discovered
Now they're backed into a hole in the ground with no powder and no way out
,  -  &  - Chingachgook talks to him in Mohican
Momentarily the anger and frustration is seen on Hawkeye's face
All his experience & craft has been to no avail
He looks at Cora
Back to Chingachgook
Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican
Hawkeye agrees
Heyward's confused
He doesn't know what they're talking about
Cora has understood Chingachgook's intent perfectly
Yes
Go ahead
(explodes) What the bloody hell plan is this
(to Cora) In this there is a chance
If  live,  can try to free you
If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them
Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance
None
can do nothing
Do you understand
Yes
want you to go
Coward
Coward back at the fort
Coward here
Hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man
You try
With all you have
To save yourself
If the worst happens, and only one of us survives, something of the other does, too
-  - Listens
Hears
Then he inches above cover to see
' :   & of Hurons approach to assault the island carrying torches
-  &  - She's holding him
In the rigid language of her body is the struggle to contain her fear
(very close) If they don't kill you, they may take you north up into Canada
warrior may take you for a wife
turns aside
Hawkeye insists
(continues) Listen
Submit
You hear me
You're strong
You stay alive
will find you
no matter how far, how long it takes
(nods, low) never doubt what you are doing
conscious now, arranges his crushed body to face the direction from which will come the attack as
puts Alice, who's entered, behind him as
Uncas hits the floor of the cave
Now the first glow from Huron torches starts to light the walls
They're coming
has their weapons slung over his back
He says something in Mohican
Uncas spins looks at Alice: her expression's vacant
' cuts a lock of Cora's hair
He folds it into his shirt
The orange light from Huron torches, now closer, plays on the wall behind her
We hear many Huron approach
& now run out of the cave and throw themselves into the curtain of water
This is their exit
engraves her image in his memory one last time and then sprints across the floor towards the water
: and then through it into
: An awful crushing roar
We explode out the front of a white cataract a third of the way from the top and we fall down away from the world
-  - tumbles down the falls; rolling, tumbling through the white water; then through air; then back into cascading white water again, disappearing
-  & ' bodies hit, disappear and don't surface
It looks unsurviveable
' : Sheets of water fall with us
The bottom races towards us at a hundred miles an hour
Just before we hit
,  -   - The cave is filled with Hurons
The Redcoat is dead in the corner
group of braves moves away from the body of the Ranger
' surrounded
The women are behind him
He slashes at one Huron with his sword and is clubbed down by a giant
enters
His blanket, like a shawl, over his left shoulder, black plumes in his hair
He's imperturbable
' reaches out and touches Cora's hair
Cora is frozen to the spot
His hand drops away from the hated Munros and as Magua turns to go, he says something low in Huron and the two women are jerked towards the fissures
Heyward is dragged by the arms
-   - miles from the falls
We see a figure
It's Chingachgook, nearly spent, rolling and tumbling through the fast-moving white water
He submerges, then surfaces again
He appears exhausted by the fall and ride
' : rocketing at us, battering and drowning us
We glimpse something downstream
tries to focus, slammed against rocks, he's striking out towards the right, swimming against the current
He's grabbing for something
' and leather shoulder-strap
Chingachgook's hand grabs it
The current rushing past tries to steal him from Uncas and Hawkeye, who're also beaten, bloodied, exhausted
They pull the older, larger man from the water and
all three lie there, almost devoid of energy
Then Hawkeye rises, looks at the others
Chingachgook nods
He's up
Then Uncas, and they're moving off into the calm eddy between the rock they landed on and the shoreline
-  - move along animal paths
& struggle through the branches of trees
No one helps them
When they fall behind, they are pushed forward
badly beaten, bound, staggers ahead to get behind Maqua
Then: If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers will receive many gifts
(as if considering) Gifts
Three, four oxen
much wampum
Wampum
Yes
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea
Yes
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua
Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen
Magua looks at Heyward derisively
Does this white man think he's an idiot
Gold could be arranged
For Munro children
Yes
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese
The King
The King has mountains of gold
Long pause as if Magua and King George  were seriously considering this 	transaction
Not enough
Heyward is first realizing with whom he's playing
What is enough
Heart
Give Magua new heart
Magua totally disdains the Englishman and walks away from him, starting up a steeper forested hill
- ,  &  - running cross-country after the Huron column
They leap over fallen logs and keep going
: breathing hard, his lips are drawn back, sweat stains his buckskins
: runs
Then sees something
where Cora & Alice were struggling up the animal path
as they race across a stream away from us after the war party and into the night
-  - supporting Alice, is dragged forward by a Huron warrior by a woven rawhide thong tied to her neck
is imperturbable
move quickly down into a ravine
is shoved forward
-   - Long, loping strides
& cover ground like long-distance runners
No noise except their hard, even breathing
They're moving down a clear trail
out on the flank
Running hard
: lips are drawn back, determined, flashing through the hard verticals of the forest, now leaps down an embankment into the soft loam and keeps going
-   - on a rude platform
The entire village is crowded in a large circle
They all wait for someone
They've been waiting a long time
In the perimeter warriors keep Huron at bay for some reason
We see Magua
He stands apart
They wait
Then
is led to the dais by three women down the main street between the neat rows of birch bark lodges
Many scalps and trophies from the massacre are in evidence
He sits on the raised platform
He looks to be in his nineties
His dark wrinkled face is contrasted by his long white hair
His robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation of combat
He wears numerous silver & gold medals, gifts of French, English and Dutch governors
Most startling is his face
His dark & lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of tatooing
He looks up to Magua
(in Huron; subtitled) The tomahawks of your young men have been very red
(in Huron; subtitled) Many of the Yengeese are dead, great Sachem
(sound dissolve to English) have brought three of my prisoners, to honor you
Two are the children of Munro
Whose scalp hangs on my lodge pole
And whose heart  cut from his chest
Now we see Cora on the ground
Defeat & fear are held in place by her determination
Alice looks around, in another place
Heyward's hands are bound between his back with a piece of wood wedged through his elbows
-  : ,  & - running
Then Uncas drops and the other two follow
:   "" seen in the distance through the sparse trees
They have dropped at the very periphery of the forest where the woods end
(The lay of the land is important for action that follows: the village is built in a meadow
To the left is a cliff face that rises to a rocky promontory
On the right is a path that winds up to the promontory and beyond, across the mountains
) Hawkeye sees
' :  ,  & in the center, outside the largest lodge
slams the earth with his fists
They didn't intercept them in time
Difficult odds just became impossible
-  - the earth was pale
Our tomahawks were bright
Now they are dull from war
And the Huron rich with the trophies of honor
Magua will sell the English officer to Les Francais and the reward is my gift to you, wise one
The women - children of the white war chief - will burn in our fires so all can share in this
The sachem considers this
Then he looks up and sees something beyond Magua
senses the sachem's eye line
unarmed, walking through the Hurons
young boy rushes at him
Hawkeye, at the last possible second, dodges
Others catch and restrain the boy
The Hurons are astounded a European would simply walk into their camp
sees him enter, doesn't believe he's there
Nathaniel
Hawkeye glances at her, doesn't respond
The situation is a stick of dynamite ready to go off
(to Heyward; low) Translate for me, Major
Into French
Every word
as  say it
Magua starts towards Hawkeye, his tomahawk slipping into his hand
(to Sachem) come to you unarmed and in peace to unstop your ears, wise one
Because the Hurons are mislead by the words of the wolf who's never spoken the truth
Sachem gestures with his hand to Magua
Magua reluctantly stops advancing on Hawkeye
Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur
We hear Hawkeye's English
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones
(to Sachem) Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war
The Huron do not fear English anger
(to Sachem) Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship
Magua broke it
It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron
Sachem reacts
(laughs) It made our French father happy to never have to fight the same Yengeese again
He told me this without telling me this
Hawkeye realizes this is true
So the Huron are the servants of the French
To do what the French are shamed to do
No
(to Sachem) Huron serve no one
The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind
But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one
Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron
That is good
When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais
And we will trade as the white man trades
Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox
And make the Huron great
Over other tribes
No less than the whites, as strong as the whites
Hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua
(to Sachem) Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese
(to Sachem) The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest
Yes
It is the only way
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man
Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use
Like Francais Black Robes do
Would Huron kill tribes with disease
Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy
But sell the fur to the white man for gold
(to Sachem) Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters
Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land
Or of dogs
Magua's heart is twisted
He would make himself into what twisted him
Dog, become Master of Dogs
But are Hurons dogs
Magua's way is false
It is like the white sickness
Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame
Is there another way
don't know
(pauses) am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people
Let the children of the dead Munro go free
speak the truth
Magua starts to rebut
Sachem holds up his hand and stops him
Nobody talks
Sachem whispers to the older men on either side of him
waits for the decision
looks to Alice, then to Hawkeye
exchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem is staring at him from the perspective of nearly a century of laws & judgments
Then
to every word
The white man comes like a day that has passed
And night enters our future with him
(pause) Our council talks since  was a boy: What is the Huron to do
(pause) But Magua would lead Huron down paths that make us not Hurons
(the judgment) Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted heart of Magua
Cora, hearing the sentence
Hawkeye's losing her
(continuing) Munro daughter with moon in her hair must be Magua's wife so Munro's seed doesn't die
Alice is gone, living in some dark recess of her mind
(continuing; dissolves back to French) and Yengeese officer not go to Les Francais, but back to Yengeese so their hatred burns less bright
La Longue Carabine, go in peace
People move, start to implement the sentence
Hawkeye's panicked
Cora is jerked upright
She looks at Hawkeye in terror: Sachem is starting to depart
No
listen
(to Heyward) Tell him 'll trade him
Me for her
Tell him
Heyward translates into rapid-fire French
(shouts) am La Longue Carabine
My death is a great honor to the Huron
Take me
Cora is jerked forward by three Hurons
Magua grabs Alice
Cora strikes at Magua
He knocks her aside
Chaos & confusion
Meanwhile: (French; subtitled) This is not the voice of wisdom
go to the Hurons of the Lakes
You are women
Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca, beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind
Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves
spit on you
Those Hurons who hear, do so in deadly, boding silence
Magua and his fourteen hard core braves start out as
heard Heyward's translation
He looks at Heyward, then looks at Hawkeye and he nods his head
sees this
His eyes go to Cora
They've stopped dragging her towards the fire pit
Hawkeye steps forward to surrender
Cora is thrown at him
Cora looks around wildly
Instead of taking Hawkeye, two warriors grab Heyward
is immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse
He gasps
He's caught under the arms and dragged forward
said to trade me
Hawkeye's holding Cora
Heyward struggles to be seen
compliments, Mr
Poe
(pause) Take her and get out
(standing) What are they doing to Duncan
Duncan
He's gone
They start to ease away from the mass of Hurons
(low to himself) And my compliments to you
Alice
Hawkeye's concentration is on backing out of the Huron mob
Will the Sachem's judgment be honored
Will some warriors hack down Hawkeye & Cora
As they go
moves towards her sister
But Hawkeye holds her tightly as they retreat
' : with Magua's group crosses the path
He drags Alice behind him like baggage
She regains her feet
Magua is oblivious to her
He's heading towards the plateau
,   -  &  - Uncas sees Magua's direction
Uncas touches his father, grabs his musket and races off
Chingachgook reaches to stop him, but he's too late
Chingachgook's hand in the air
-:  & near the tree line
Hawkeye has eyes only for
' : moving towards fire pit
One turns to watch Hawkeye & Cora depart
Will he arouse others to attack
Behind him, others are doing something to Heyward and flames leap up
' are on Alice, off to the right in the meadow
tense
They're almost there
holding Killdeer
' : Sky & flames
Suddenly, Heyward's stood upright into the fire, bound to a bracket by his arms
As the flames start devouring him
& close to Chingachgook and the tree line
tosses Hawkeye Killdeer
As fast as he jams it into his shoulder he
among the hollering Hurons, is shot dead
It goes unnoticed
-  - half-way up the rock face
He's approaching an overhang
He climbs with a reckless desperation
-  & pound across the (sic) to the meadow towards Magua's path
trying to stay with them, scrambles up
- reaches the overhang
It juts away from the face six feet
Uncas' hand jams into a crack in the granite, forms a fist and twists, making a wedge
He swings out, dangling in space by the hand wedged into the rock
His right hand reaches out and up, searching the vertical face for
' a rock flake
An indentation
Anything
His fingers find a diagonal crevice and
swings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang
His features are distorted with determination
Nothing will stop him
His right hand grabs another rock
His arms snap him up
Then push
He's on the ledge
Moving fast
-  - on point are approaching the path above the promontory
Five warriors are ahead of Magua
One behind him drags Alice
Huron starts up the narrow path
Suddenly
slams him off the rock with the butt of his musket
Two's musket coming up
Uncas swings
Before he's fallen, Uncas bayonets Three
, misses, swings
Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow
Uncas' musket falls
Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the edge
running forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on
It's incredibly fast
' three tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver flashes
Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open hand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle
and Magua throws Uncas
Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit
Uncas' right arm is useless
He scrambles up
Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like Magua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough
-  - freezes
- closing, swings
Magua moves inside, stabs Uncas twice, turns him to face the edge, ripping his head left to expose the right underside of his throat
: ' knife arm punches forward
: Uncas falls down the face onto to the rocks
seeing his boy killed,  out and is charging up the path, Hawkeye following
- backs to the edge
moves on Alice
His knife is low, about to strike
She stares at him
Her eyes are like pools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific
It stops Magua
inexplicably, drops his knife hand
He's riveted by her
About him, there's a glimmer of something else
He wears a human face for this one moment
He reaches out with his other hand to offer her safety
To bring her back from the edge
looks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below
She turns to Magua with enigmatic calm
Her eyes seem to see into him
She steps off the edge
She falls to her death next to Uncas
- collapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward into her hands
are running down the path to intercept Chingachgook, charging uphill, fueled by a father's rage, and Hawkeye
One Huron aims at the center of Chingachgook's chest
past his father's side
The Huron's blown off the path
Hawkeye races to reload on the run
- sees the approach of Chingachgook
Huron warriors are an irrelevance
He slams one aside with his musket
with tomahawk, about to blindside Chingachgook, is
charging Chingachgook
Two men, like dots, race to collide at the center of the promontory
Now the others fall back
It's one-on-one
Hawkeye slows
Magua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk appearing in his right, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically holding his blade, is jamming up to gut Chingachgook
Chingachgook's dead
Except
isn't there
He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward
The massive war club crashes into Magua's back
stunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook
now up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault
destroying it, breaking Magua's right arm
And
with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left side and crushes part of his chest
destroys Magua's collar and shoulder
amazed
His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands
He looks into the eyes of the last warrior of the Mohicans
And he spins and swings
The blade side of the war club punches into Magua's chest, caving him in two
Magua dies in the dust
watching Chingachgook's heaving back
It's over
alone, kneeling in the meadow
Her eyes downcast
-   -    - Chingachgook's at the edge, facing the endless rolling forests to the west
haze of sunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds
Hawkeye is a little apart, watching his father
' : speaks to the sky
(Mohican) Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life
& We  Hawkeye's English translation in  : / (
): (in English) a warrior goes to you swift and straight as an arrow shot into the sun
Welcome him and let him take his place at the council fire of my people
(pause) He is Uncas, my son
(pause) Bid them patience and ask death for speed; for they are all there but one - , Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans
Chingachgook's hands drop to his sides
He lets out his breath with a weariness
His eyes seek Hawkeye's
They hold
is standing, her back to us, in front of a rock-covered grave with a wooden cross
Next to it is Uncas' burial platform
Cora [says a] silent prayer
Then she pauses, crosses herself
Her emotions are spent
She moves next to Hawkeye
He takes her hand
& ] Will you go back to England
have nothing to go back for
Long pause
Then will you stay in America
She turns to face him
And will you be my wife
Pause
Yes
They hold each other's eyes
She searches his face
Where will we go
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins
And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee
They move next to Chingachgook
He senses they're beside him
Hawkeye's arm is around her shoulders
The frontier moves with the sun and pushes the red man of the wilderness forests in front of it
Until one day there will be nowhere left
Then our race will be no more, or be not us
The frontier place is for people like my white son and his woman and their children
That's my father's sadness talking
Hawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder
No
It is true
One day
there will be no more frontier
Then men like you will go, too
Like the Mohicans
(pause) And new people will come
Work
Struggle to make their light
One mystery remains
What is that
Cora, listening to Chingachgook, takes Hawkeye's hand
Will there be anything left to show the world that we ever did exist
Cora stands next to her man
Hawkeye puts his arm around his father
They stare out over the wilderness
