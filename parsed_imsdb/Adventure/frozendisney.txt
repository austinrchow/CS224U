Lanterns are lit

In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single block of ice out of the water

The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it pulls away
Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a dinky little sled then head off
We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the sky
then move across the mountains
beneath the snowline
and descend upon

,  -- (8) sleeps in her bed
Her little sister  (5) pops up beside her
Elsa
Psst
Elsa
Psst
Elsa doesn't stir
Anna sits on Elsa and bounces
(') Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
(grumbling) Anna, go back to sleep
Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa
-
Lee (drama queen-ish) just can't
The sky's awake, so 'm awake, so we have to play
Go play by yourself
Elsa shoves Anna off the bed
Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated
But then she gets an idea
She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's eyelids
(mischievously) Do you want to build a snowman
Elsa's eyes both pop open
She smiles
-- Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited
-- The girls sneak into the ballroom
Elsa shuts the door
Do the magic
Do the magic
Elsa laughs and waves her hands together
Snowflakes suddenly burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball
Elsa throws the snowball high into the air
Snow bursts out and flurries around the room
Anna dances about, catching flakes in her palms and mouth
(') This is amazing
Watch this
Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink
Anna slides off, laughing
-
Lee : -Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman together
Elsa moves his stick arms around
(') (goofy voice) Hi, 'm Olaf and  like warm hugs
Anna jumps up and hugs him
love you, Olaf
-Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing
: Elsa is actually propelling them across the ice floor with her magic
-The girls slide down snowbanks together
-Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air
(') Catch me
Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna
Gotcha
Anna keeps jumping
Elsa keeps casting magic
(jumping faster) Again
Again
(struggling to keep up) Slow down
Elsa suddenly slips
Her magic accidentally  Anna in the head
Anna tumbles down a snowbank and lands, unconscious
(') Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms
streak of Anna's hair, where struck, turns white
(') The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes
-
Lee The parents burst through the frozen door
at the sight of the room
Elsa, what have you done
This is getting out of hand
(seeing Anna) Anna
The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms
It was an accident
'm sorry, Anna
(about Anna) She's ice cold
know where we have to go
: -- The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book inscribed with Old Norse runes
He opens the book, scrambles to a page with an ancient map
-- Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out of the kingdom
Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a trail of ice behind them
-- sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark woods
All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the girls, leaving the wake of ice
Ice
: -
Lee -- Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice
Faster, Sven
-- Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley
They hide behind a rock and peek out
Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa
The Queen holds the still unconscious Anna
Please, help
My daughter
Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward them
It looks as though they'll be crushed
But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet
The rocks then unfold, revealing bright faces
Trolls
The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up
" Meet
Shush
'm trying to listen
She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them close
Sven licks her face and she eyes them both
(') Cuties
'm gonna keep you
Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth
They call him
He approaches arthritically, but determined
He nods respectfully to the king
Your Majesty
(referring to Elsa) Born with the powers or cursed
Born
And they're getting stronger
Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him
She does
He examines her
-
Lee (about Anna) You are lucky it wasn't her heart
The heart is not so easily changed, but the head can be persuaded
Do what you must
recommend we remove all magic, even memories of magic to be safe
But don't worry, 'll leave the fun
Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's head
We see her memories floating right above her
Grand Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the girls in winter gear
He puts the ordinary memories back in her head
(') She will be okay
But she won't remember  have powers
It's for the best
Listen to me, Elsa, your power will only grow
As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes
(') There is beauty in your magic
But also great danger
The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes
(
) (') You must learn to control it
In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human figures to panic and attack Elsa
(') Fear will be your enemy

Lee Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest
The King wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively
No
We'll protect her
She can learn to control it
'm sure
Over the King's words we

(
) (') Until then, we'll lock the gates
We'll reduce the staff
We will limit her contact with people and keep her powers hidden from everyone
including Anna
-The castle shutters close
-Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears
-Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new room
Anna watches, confused and sad
: -- We look out on a gentle snowfall
Little Anna skips up to the window
She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes down the hall
, '  -- Anna knocks on Elsa's door and
"Do You Want to Build a Snowman

Anna peeks under the door

Elsa sits at the window looking out, longingly
Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill
-
The King slips leather gloves onto Elsa's hands
The gloves will help
He pats her gloved hand
(') See
You're good
(starting their mantra) Conceal it
Don't feel it
& Don't let it show

Anna, now 9, knocks on Elsa's door

Anna runs around the portrait room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch

Looks like no one's around

(9) (') Anna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum

'  --
Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics
The entire wall is frozen behind her
(12) 'm scared
It's getting stronger
Getting upset only makes it worse
The King goes to hug her
(12) No
Don't touch me
don't want to hurt you
He and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness

Anna, now a teenager, slides past Elsa's room without stopping

Anna runs into the room and throws herself into her parents' arms
See you in two weeks

Elsa curtsies in front of her parents, formally, not touching them
Do you have to go
You'll be fine, Elsa

The King and Queen leave on a ship

Lightning flashes
The sea rages in a storm
The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves

Anna, still in her mourning clothes, approaches and knocks

Anna slides down the door and sits with her head against it

(weak, internal) We move through the door

Elsa is sitting in the exact same pose as Anna
Her bedroom is frozen with ice
Snowflakes hang in the air, suspended by grief

Lee -- new dawn rises over the fjords
Ships pull up to the docks
Guests pile out
Welcome to Arendelle
tries to get away as his  tries to stuff him in his bunad jacket
Why do  have to wear this
Because the Queen has come of age
It's Coronation Day
That's not my fault
They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester chatting with his reindeer
We recognize them as Kristoff and Sven, all grown up
Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and nuzzles Kristoff's chest
What do you want, Sven
Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can
( ) (') Give me a snack
(') What's the magic word
( ) (') Please
Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it to Sven
Sven tries to bite the whole thing
(') Hey, hey, hey
Share
Sven takes a smaller bite
Kristoff then has a bite himself, not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber
We move on to  and , a super-excited couple who rush towards the castle
13 -
Lee can't believe they're finally opening up the gates
And for a whole day
Faster, Persi
They pass a tiny but menacing , who wears taps on his shoes to "enhance" his presence
Two  guards follow close behind him
Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner
Open those gates so may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches
(catching himself) Did  just say that out loud
We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see the Queen and the Princess
bet they're absolutely lovely
bet they are beautiful
We move past them, to a particular castle window

She's got major bedhead
She coughs
Snorts
Pulls a hair from her mouth

Lee She falls back asleep while sitting
She snores
Her head drops, startling her awake
(') Who is it
(
) It's still me, ma'am
Time to get ready
Ready for what
(
) Your sister's coronation, ma'am
My sister's cor-neration
One eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress
She bolts, wide awake in excitement
(') Coronation Day
Ha ha
: -- Anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress
She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair
Seeing the hustle and bustle of preparations, she can't help but

Elsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation
She takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter
(') '
The candlestick and ornament ice over
Elsa gasps, slams them back down onto the table
She tries to reassure herself

The rider, , sure is handsome and regal

The horse bows too, curling his hoof up and out of the boat
The boat tips
Hans tumbles on top of Anna
Awkward
Hi
again
The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it
Anna and Hans tumble the other way
Anna lands on top of him
Oh boy
Ha
This is awkward
Not you're awkward, but just because we're-- 'm awkward
You're gorgeous
(did she just say that
) Wait, what
Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again
'd like to formally apologize for hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse
and for every moment after
No

She doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's handsomeness
The bells
The coronation
-- better go

better go
She hurries off, stops, turns back
Gives Hans a little wave
(') Bye
As she rushes off again, Hans waves back
The horse waves too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat
Oh no
The boat falls, with Hans in it
It lands upside down in the water
Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air

Hans waves at her from the pews
He's changed his clothes
The crown is placed on Elsa's head
The scepter and orb are presented to Elsa on a pillow
She slowly reaches for them
(a whisper) Your Majesty, the gloves
Elsa hesitates
She breathes nervously, removes her gloves, places them on the pillow
Her hands shake
She takes the orb and scepter, then turns to the people

She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other
Hi
Hi me

Thank you
You look beautifuller mean, not fuller
You don't look fuller, but more beautiful

Lee Thank you
They look out at the celebration
(') So, this is what a party looks like
It's warmer than  thought
And what is that amazing smell
They both close their eyes and inhale
() Chocolate
Their eyes pop open
They laugh
Elsa looks back out at the party
Anna looks at Elsa
She wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start
Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts
Your Majesty
The Duke of Weaseltown
Weselton
The Duke of Weselton
(to Elsa) Your Majesty, as your closest partner in trade, it seems only fitting that  offer you your first dance as queen
The Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and a deep bow
(') (whispers to himself) One, two, three
Jump
As he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward
Anna giggles
Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself
(to the Duke) Thank you
only  don't dance
22 -
Lee (offended) Oh
But my sister does
What
Lucky you
Oh,  don't think-- The Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can protest
If you swoon, let me know, 'll catch you
Anna looks back at Elsa, desperately
Sorry
: The Duke showboats, but he's just awful
Anna tries to make the best of it
Like an agile peacock

Speaking of, so great to have the gates open
Why did they shut them in the first place
Do you know the reason
Hmm

This is so nice

(sincere) Me too
But then Elsa catches herself
She stiffens up, looks away
(') But it can't
Why not
If-- It just can't
24 -
Lee Anna's smile drops
She tries not to get emotional
Excuse me for a minute
She walks away
Elsa watches her go, saddened
Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's butt
She falls
Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches her
He smiles perfectly
Glad  caught you
Hans
He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray
He lifts her up and leads her in a romantic dance

Oops
Sorry

Elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into the light
She's free
38 -
Lee (') She turns and slams her ice palace door on us
: -- Anna rides her horse through two feet of snow
She shivers
(shivering) Elsa
Elsa
It's me, Anna
your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer
'm sorry
It's all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault
: : Anna and the horse struggle through a wooded area
(') (hearing a wolf howl) Of course, none of this would have happened if she'd just told me her secret
ha
she's a stinker
branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse
Anna goes flying off, lands face down in the snow
She sits up
Spits out snow
Sees the horse running away
(') Oh no
No
No
No
Come back
No
No
No
No
Oooo-kay
He doesn't come back
Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her
: -- The Northern Lights shine as Anna struggles, out of breath, reaching the top of a hill
39 -
Lee Snow, it had to be snow, she couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm -- She sees smoke rising up in the distance
(') Fire
Anna goes tumbling down the hill
She lands with a crash in an icy stream at the bottom
(') (from inside the snowball) Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
-- Anna shuffles up to the building, her dress frozen stiff
She shakes the snow off a sign and reads: Wandering Oaken's Trading Post
Snow drops off a smaller sign
She reads it, happily
(') Ooh
And Sauna
'   &  -- Anna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen butt and knocks her into the center of the shop
She looks around, sees only summer supplies
(
) Hoo hoo
Anna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip
(') Big summer blow out
Half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention, yah
Oh, great
For now, how about boots
Winter boots
and dresses
40 -
Lee (slight disappointment) That would be in our winter department
The winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a lonely pair of boots
Oh
Um,  was just wondering; has another young woman, the Queen perhaps,  don't know, passed through here
She brings the clothes and boots to the counter
Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear
The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a man covered in ice
Underneath is
(') You and this fellow
Hoo hoo
Big summer blow out
Kristoff walks right up to Anna
(in her face) Carrots
Huh
Behind you
Oh, right
Excuse me
Anna moves out of Kristoff's way
He grabs a bunch of carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the place, gathering other supplies
(to Kristoff) real howler in July, yah
Where ever could it be coming from
The North Mountain
41 -
Lee (to herself) North Mountain
Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter
Oaken counts on his fingertips
That'll be forty
Forty
No, ten
(sweet as pie) Oh dear, that's no good
See these are from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem
sell ice for a living
Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of ice on his sled, covered in snow
Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now
mean, that is really
(he shoots her a look) Ahem
That's unfortunate
Still forty
But  will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna
Hoo hoo
Hi, family
Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through the window of the steaming sauna
Hoo hoo
Ten's all  got
Help me out
(isolating the carrots) Ten will get you this and no more
Kristoff seethes
Stalemate
42 -
Lee Okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the North Mountain
Did it seem magical
Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer
Yes
Now, back up while  deal with this crook here
Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature
What did you call me
'     -- Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm
Okay
Okay, 'm- Ow
Whoa
Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow
Bye bye
Oaken slams the door
Kristoff sits up
His reindeer, Sven, canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly
No Sven,  didn't get your carrots
Sven huffs in his face
Kristoff turns away and sees something
He points to a dilapidated barn
(') But  did find us a place to sleep
And it's free
'     -- Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again
(teddy bear) 'm sorry about this violence will add a quart of lutefisk, so we'll have good feelings
Just the outfit and boots, yah
43 -
Lee Anna looks between Kristoff's supplies and the door
: '  - Kristoff, now unfrozen, relaxes on a bed of hay, playing his lute and singing to (and for) Sven
"Reindeer(s) are Better than People" , '   '
( ) (') (throwing his voice) ,     & &
' ,
(speaking) Oh, thanks, Buddy
(singing, as Kristoff) , '   '
(As Sven) '   , (As Kristoff) '
(As Sven) (As Kristoff) '
The door opens
Anna enters
Nice duet
Kristoff sits up with a start
sees who it is
Oh, it's just you
What do you want
want you to take me up the North Mountain
44 -
Lee don't take people places
He lays back down, closes his eyes
Let me rephrase that
sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap
Umph
He sits up
Looks in the bag
Take me up the North Mountain
Please
He eyes her
He clearly doesn't take orders
(') Look,  know how to stop this winter
He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes
We leave at dawn
And you forgot the carrots for Sven
bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face
(') Ugh
Oops
Sorry
Sorry
'm sorry didn't-- (catching herself) We leave now
Right now
She steps back outside and waits, anxiously
Annoyed, Kristoff offers Sven a carrot
Sven has a bite
Then Kristoff has a bite, contemplating
: -- Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled, which skids precariously
Kristoff mans the reins
Anna sits beside him
45 -
Lee (trying to scare Anna) Hang on
We like to go fast
(fearless) like fast
Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard
Whoa, whoa
Get your feet down
He pushes her feet down
(') This is fresh lacquer
Seriously, were you raised in a barn
Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it
The spit flies back and hits Anna in the face
(grossed out) Ew
No,  was raised in a castle
She wipes off her face
So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy
Oh well, it was all my fault got engaged but then she freaked out because 'd only just met him, you know, that day
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage-- Wait
You got engaged to someone you just met
Yeah
Anyway,  got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and  grabbed her glove-- Hang on
You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met
46 -
Lee Yes
Pay attention
But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so  just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers
Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him
Yes, they did
But Hans is not a stranger
Oh yeah
What's his last name
Of-the-Southern-Isles
What's his favorite food
Sandwiches
Best friend's name
Probably John
Eye color
Dreamy
Foot size
Foot size doesn't matter
Have you had a meal with him yet
What if you hate the way he eats
What if you hate the way he picks his nose
Picks his nose
47 -
Lee And eats it
Excuse me, sir
He's a prince
All men do it
Ew
Look it doesn't matter; it's true love
Doesn't sound like true love
Are you some sort of love expert
No
But  have friends who are
You have friends who are love experts
'm not buying it
Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm
(to Anna) Stop talking
No, no, no
'd like to meet these-- Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth
mean it
Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them
Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern
Its light reflects off
Several
(') Sven, go
Go
Sven takes off
What are they
Wolves
48 -
Lee Flashes of white dart through the woods
Kristoff hops into the back of the sled, grabs a torch
Lights it
Wolves
What do we do
've got this
You just
don't fall off and don't get eaten
But  wanna help
No
Why not
Because  don't trust your judgement
Excuse me
wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off
Who marries a man she just met
Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head
It's true love
He screams, as she
swings past Kristoff and knocks a wolf away
(shocked) Whoa
Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf
The torch goes flying
Anna catches it, shocked
Christopher
Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind
It's Kristoff
49 -
Lee wolf jumps on Kristoff's back
(') Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire
Duck
Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him
He ducks
The blanket hits the wolves
They tumble off Kristoff
You almost set me on fire
Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled
But  didn't
Sven cries out
There is a massive gorge ahead
(') Get ready to jump, Sven
You don't tell him what to do
Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up
(') do
Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness from the sled
(') Jump, Sven
Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back
Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled
Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge
Kristoff's sled loses momentum
It's not going to make it
He leaps off
He flaps his arms, claws at the air
He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff
Hanging by his hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below and burst into flames
50 -
Lee (') (shocked sadness) But  just paid it off
Suddenly, he starts to slip
He claws at the loose snow, but it's clearly hopeless
He's going down
(') Uh-oh
No, no, no
To make matters worse, an  comes flying right at his face
(') , ,
The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose
(
) Grab on
Kristoff grabs on
(') Pull, Sven
Pull
: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven
Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety
Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted
Anna peeks down at the burning sled
(') Whoa
'll replace your sled and everything in it
Kristoff groans
(') And  understand if you don't want to help me anymore
Anna walks off, sadly
Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff
Of course  don't want to help her anymore
In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again
( ) (') But she'll die on her own
( ) (') can live with that
51 -
Lee Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong way
turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip
( ) (') But you won't get your new sled if she's dead
(') (knowing he's got a point) You know sometimes  really don't like you
Sven licks Kristoff happily
( ) (') (to Anna) Hold up
We're coming
(excited) You are
(catching herself) mean, sure
'll let you tag along
: -- Kristoff, Sven and Anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain
: -- As they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of something far below
Arendelle
It's completely frozen
But it'll be fine
Elsa will thaw it
Will she
52 -
Lee (uncertain) Yeah
Now come on
This way to the North Mountain
She points straight ahead
More like this way
He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain
: -- Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows
The hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights
Sven knocks them with his antlers
They tinkle like chimes
never knew winter could be so beautiful
Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere
We'll call that voice
(
) It really is beautiful, isn't it
But it's so white
You know, how about a little color
Must we bleach the joy out of it all
'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse
While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the source of the rambling
They look at Sven - could he actually be talking
Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in branches, just as baffled as they are
In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind them
(') How `bout yellow--no, not yellow
Yellow and snow
Brrrr
no go
He stops between Kristoff and Anna
They look down at him
How did he get there
He suddenly looks up at Anna
(') Am  right
53 -
Lee Anna
Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head, sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms
(') (cheery, to Kristoff) Hi
You're creepy
Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a game of hot potato
don't want it
Backatchya
Please don't drop me
Don't
Come on, it's just a head
No
Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving
(
) All right, we got off to a bad start
Ew, ew, the body
Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down
Olaf smiles happily, then looks confused
Wait, what am  looking at right now
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat
(sympathetic) Okay
Wait one second
Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head
54 -
Lee Oooh
Thank you
You're welcome
Now 'm perfect
She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea
Well, almost
She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as Olaf turns toward her
The carrot accidentally slams all the way through his head
Woo
Head rush
Oh
Too hard
'm sorry
-,  was just
Are you okay
Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his eyes
He lights up
Are you kidding me
am wonderful
've always wanted a nose
(going cross-eyed to look at his tiny nose) So cute
It's like a little baby unicorn
Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking out the back of his head, and pushes it forward
(') What
Hey
Whoa
(seeing his now big nose) Oh,  love it even more
Hah
All right, let's start this thing over
Hi everyone
'm Olaf
And like warm hugs
Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna
That triggers a memory
It takes her a moment to place it, but then she does
Olaf
That's right, Olaf
55 -
Lee And you are
Oh, um
'm Anna
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there
That's Sven
Uh-huh
And who's the reindeer
Sven
Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused
Oh
They're--oh, okay
(accepting it) Makes things easier for me
Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose
(') Ha
Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose
(gushes) like you, too
Olaf, did Elsa build you
Yeah
Why
Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies it
It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm
Do you know where she is
(studying the arm) Fascinating
Yeah
Why
56 -
Lee Do you think you could show us the way
Yeah
Why
(bending the arm) How does this work
Olaf's dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face
Stop it, Sven
Trying to focus here
(to Anna) Yeah, why
'll tell you why
We need Elsa to bring back summer
(shocked) Summer
(sinking into wistfulness) Oh,  don't know why but 've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot
Really
'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat
Nope
But sometimes  like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come
: '   -- Olaf walks through a grassy meadow with the sun shining behind him
He
"In Summer" '  / ' /  ' 57 -

Lee (') -Olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out
He relaxes and stares at the blue sky
(') / Sven, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf have a picnic
(') / '    / 'm gonna tell him
Don't you dare
Olaf sings the final note
We swing around him and return to: He then straightens up and smiles
(') So, come on
Elsa's this way
Let's go bring back summer
Olaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain
(laughing) 'm coming
Sven hops along, happily following them
Kristoff watches all of them like they're nuts
Somebody's got to tell him
: 59 -
Lee ,  -- layer of solid ice coats everything
People huddle around weak fires
Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and guests
We pass two  fighting over a woodpile
No
No
You've got the bark facing down
The bark needs to be face-up
Bark down is drier
Bark up
Bark down
Bark up
Like a light in the dark, Hans moves through the crowd
Cloak
Does anyone need a cloak
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness
The castle is open
There's soup and hot glogg in the Great Hall
He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard
(') Here
Pass these out
Just then the Duke approaches Hans
Prince Hans, are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods
(tall and confident) Princess Anna has given her orders and-- 60 -
Lee And that's another thing; has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all
Hans's nice eyes turn to threatening slits
Do not question the Princess
She left me in charge, and  will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason
(flabbergasted, offended) Treason
Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse
It returns alone, bucking and kicking
Hans grabs its reins
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa, boy
Easy
Easy
(various) Princess Anna's horse
What happened to her
Where is she
Hans steadies the horse, looks up at the mountain
He sees all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him
Princess Anna is in trouble
(calling out) need volunteers to go with me to find her
Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush up to offer their services
volunteer two men, my Lord
(quietly to his thugs) Be prepared for anything, and should you encounter the Queen, you are to put an end to this winter
Do you understand
His two thugs sneer
: 61 -
Lee -- Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf move through hostile terrain
Wind-swept icicles face horizontal
So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather
(confident) Oh,  am gonna talk to my sister
That's your plan
My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister
Yup
Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose
He stops short, , moves carefully around the spike
So you're not at all afraid of her
Why would  be
(oblivious) Yeah
bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever
Olaf backs right into an icicle
It runs through his torso
(') Oh, look at that
've been impaled
He laughs it off
: -- Anna and Kristoff hit what looks like a dead end
The face of the mountain goes straight up
What now
62 -
Lee Kristoff looks around, sighs
Digs in his rucksack
It's too steep
've only got one rope, and you don't know how to climb mountains
(
) Says who
Sven nudges Kristoff, who looks up to see Anna trying to climb the cliff's flat face
(finding her ridiculous) What are you doing
(straining) 'm going to see my sister
You're going to kill yourself
Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds
(') wouldn't put my foot there
(
) You're distracting me
Or there
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you
(
) 'm just blocking you out cause gotta concentrate here
You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone
(
) Nobody wants to be alone
Except maybe you-- 'm not alone
have friends, remember
Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold
63 -
Lee You mean the love experts
Yes, the love experts
Anna realizes she's stuck
Please tell me 'm almost there
: she's only about six feet up
Her muscles shake
(') Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here
Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her
Hang on
He pulls the rope from his bag
Just then Olaf steps out from behind a rock and waves to Kristoff
Hey, Sven
Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go
Ha ha
Thank goodness
Catch
Anna drops off the cliff
Kristoff catches her
(') Thanks
That was like a crazy trust exercise
She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off
Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck
-- Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace
Whoa
(in awe) Now that's ice
might cry
64 -
Lee Go ahead
won't judge
Anna climbs the steps with Olaf
Sven tries to follow
His hooves slip out
He scrambles but can't get traction
Kristoff runs to his aide
All right, take it easy
gotcha
Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him
(') You stay right here, buddy
Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his tail
Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details
(') Flawless
Anna arrives at the door
Hesitates
Knock
(she doesn't) Just knock
(she doesn't
To Kristoff) Why isn't she knocking
Do you think she knows how to knock
Anna finally
The sound echoes inside
The ice doors slide open
Ha
It opened
That's a first
Anna goes to step in
Kristoff follows
She gets a thought, stops him
(') You should probably wait out here
What
Last time  introduced her to a guy, she froze everything
But, it's a palace made of ice
Ice is my life
65 -
Lee Bye, Sven
Olaf starts to head inside
Anna stops him
You too, Olaf
Me
Just give us a minute
Okay
As Anna walks inside
Olaf starts counting
(') One
two
Kristoff joins in
Three
four
'  -- Anna walks into a great foyer
The place is beautiful, but also eerie
Elsa
It's me
Anna
Anna slips
Steadies herself
(
) Anna
Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony
She sees Anna, looks to her longingly
Anna can't help but be struck by Elsa's beauty
Elsa, you look different
It's a good different
And this place is amazing
66 -
Lee (cautious, polite) Thank you,  never knew what  was capable of
Anna starts to climb the stairs
'm so sorry about what happened
If 'd known-- Elsa backs up, away from Anna
(on guard) No, it's okay
You don't have to apologize
But you should probably go, please
But  just got here
You belong in Arendelle
So do you
Anna takes another step up
Elsa backs up more
No,  belong here
Alone
Where can be who  am without hurting anybody
Actually, about that-- (
) 58
59
60
Wait
What is that
Olaf comes running in the front door
He waves
Hi, 'm Olaf and  like warm hugs
(shocked) Olaf
Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated
67 -
Lee (bashful) You built me
You remember that
(astonished) And you're alive
Um
think so
Anna kneels down beside Olaf
He's just like the one we built as kids
We were so close
We can be like that again
Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her
: : Young Anna is struck by Elsa's powers
Anna
Young Anna falls unconscious
Young Elsa races to her
: : Elsa's face sinks in pain
No, we can't
Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps
(') Goodbye, Anna
Elsa, wait-- (calling back) 'm just trying to protect you
Elsa continues to flee
Anna pursues
You don't have to protect me
'm not afraid
Please don't shut me out again
68 -
Lee Anna
"First Time in Forever, Reprise" (') '
' ` , , '
` , They arrive on the top floor, Elsa's main living space
Elsa turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined
Anna, Yeah, but-- know
, , '   ' Elsa opens up the balcony doors
(') ' , '
'
69 -
Lee '
' What
Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains
You kind of set off an eternal winter
everywhere
Everywhere
It's okay, you can just unfreeze it
No,  can't
don't know how
Sure you can
know you can
Snow starts to swirl around the room
(') , (panicking) '
'
'
The snow picks up
Anna tries to fight through it
70 -
Lee '
'    ' , , ' '
'
'
'
But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening blizzard taking over the room
(
) , Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out
'
Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake
Anna is  right in the heart
She grasps her chest in pain and stumbles back
She falls to her knees
Elsa gasps when she sees Anna
Just then, Olaf and Kristoff rush into the room to Anna's side
Anna
Are you okay
71 -
Lee 'm okay
'm fine
Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain
(scared) Who's this
Wait, it doesn't matter
You have to go
No,  know we can figure this out together-- (desperate) How
What power do you have to stop this winter
To stop me
Anna doesn't have the answer
Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls
Puts a protective arm around Anna
Anna,  think we should go
(close to tears) No
'm not leaving without you, Elsa
(heartbroken but decisive) Yes, you are
Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman
We'll call him
: -- Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their necks in one hand and Olaf in the other
Stop
Put us down
(to Marshmallow) You are a lot stronger than  think you realize
Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps
72 -
Lee (like a bouncer) Go away
Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, who's got his tongue stuck to the ice railing
(
) Heads up
Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby
Olaf
Watch out for my butt
Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the snowbank
Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle
Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs
It is not nice to throw people
Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back
All right feisty pants
Calm             Let me at him
want to get down
Woaw
Just let the snow            him
Okay
'm Calm
man be
Anna backs down
for a moment
Then she grabs a snowball and throws it at Marshmallow
The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even the slightest dent
But it's enough to infuriate him
He Spikes shoot out of his joints
Uh-oh
Now you made him mad
'll distract him
You guys go
Kristoff pushes Anna along
Sven runs off in the opposite direction
Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven
(') No, no, not you guys
73 -
Lee Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's head falls and lands face down in snow
(') (muffled) This just got a whole lot harder
Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope
They tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard right behind them
They're off again
through a maze of conifers that sag under the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail
This way
Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of the snow
The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back
(') (impressed) Ho-ho-ho
got him
Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost run right off a cliff
They stop short, toes on the edge
Whoa, stop
It's a hundred foot drop
It's two hundred
Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight
Ow
He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the snow with a pick axe
(') What's that for
'm digging a snow anchor
74 -
Lee (not trusting) Okay
What if we fall
There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow
Hopefully
They hear an angry  coming closer
(') Okay, Anna
On three
Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight
Okay
You tell me when
One
'm ready to go
Two
(pumped up) was  ready
Yes
Calm down
huge tree flies through the air toward them
(
) Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her
They hang upside down over the cliff by the rope
The rope catches their fall
Whoa
That happened
Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods
He's a complete mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places
He huffs and puffs, struggling to run
Ah
Ah
Man, am  out of shape
75 -
Lee He stops
Puts his body back together in the right order
(') There we go
Hey, Anna
Sven
Where'd ya guys go
We totally lost Marshmallow back there
Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf
Olaf turns to face him
(') (happily) Hey
We were just talking about you
All good things, all good things
Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor
(') Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not making much of a difference
(') This is not making much of a difference
Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff
(') Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff
Olaf
Hang in there, guys
Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up
Wait, what
Kristoff's head hits the cliff
Aargghh
Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll
Kristoff
76 -
Lee Marshmallow pulls them up
He roars and breathes snow all over them
Don't come back
(grossed out by his snow breath) Ugh
We won't
Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope
Kristoff comes to just as they fall
They both
: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her shoulders in the soft thick snow
She laughs
(') Hey, you were right
Just like a pillow
She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's boots, which are sticking out of the snow
(shaking the boots) can't feel my legs
can't feel my legs
Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up
He spits out snow
Those are my legs
Olaf's bottom goes running by
(to Kristoff) Ooh
Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt
Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body
(') Oh, that feels better
Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose
(') Hey, Sven
77 -
Lee Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off his nose -- and misses
(') He found us
(to Sven, funny voice) Who's my cute little reindeer
Don't talk to him like that
Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow
(') Here
He lifts her out easily
(impressed) Whoa
You okay
Thank you
They meet eyes
Wait
Is that chemistry
(') Um
How's your head
She touches the spot where he banged his head
(in pain) Ah
Ooh
He catches himself
Waves off the pain with a giggle
(') mean, It's fine
Ah
'm good
Ha
've got a thick skull
don't have a skull
Or bones
So
The awkwardness is killing him
78 -
Lee (') (shy) Now what
(shy) Now what
(then
panicking) Now what
Oh
What am  gonna do
She threw me out
can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this
And then there's your ice business-- Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business
(noticing something) Worry about your hair
She thinks he means it looks bad
She smooths it down
What
just fell off a cliff
You should see your hair
No, yours is turning white
She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white
White
It's what
It's because she struck you; isn't it
Does it look bad
(thinking) No
Olaf's head pops up
He's holding his head up off his body to join the conversation
You hesitated
No,  didn't
Anna, you need help
Now, come on
79 -
Lee He heads towards the sunset
Sven and Olaf follow
Okay
Where are we going
To see my friends
(catching up) The love experts
Love experts
Yes
And don't worry; they'll be able to fix this
How do you know
He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls heal her as a child
Because 've seen them do it before
As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven
like to consider myself a love expert
: '  -- Elsa paces, distraught
She talks to herself
(mantra-style) Get it together
Control it
Don't feel
Don't feel
Don't
She hears ice cracking
Stops
Looks around
She's left a sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor
They grow up the wall, taking over the castle
: 80 -
Lee -- The Northern Lights are bright
Olaf stares at them in awe as he rides on Sven's back
Look, Sven
The sky's awake
Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff
She shivers
Are you cold
little
He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides against it
He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do, then gets a thought
Wait
Come here
He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock- lined pass
Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path
He holds her hands over one of them
Oooh
That's nice
They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent
(taking a deep breath) So, about my friends
well,  say friends, they're more like family
Anyway, when  was a kid, it was just me and Sven
until they took me in
(moved) They did
(nervous ramble) Yeah
don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate
and loud
very loud
they're also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing
And heavy
Really, really heavy
() 81 -
Lee (') But they're fine
You'll get it
They mean well
Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly
Kristoff, they sound wonderful
Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity
Okay then
Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave of the arms announces-- (') Meet my family
: he's surrounded by rocks
(') (to the rocks) Hey, guys
As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded
(to herself) They're rocks
(realizing) He's crazy
(covertly, to Anna) 'll distract them while you run
(Loud and slow to a rock) Hi, Sven's family
It's nice to meet you
(quietly to Anna) Anna, because  love you,  insist you run
(to the rock) understand you're love experts
(to Anna) Why aren't you running
Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away
Okay
Um
'm gonna go-- Just then the rocks around her start rolling
82 -
Lee (') (panicking) Kristoff
Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff and unfold as trolls
'
() Kristoff
Kristoff's home
It's been too long
Kristoff's home
Olaf jumps around all excitedly
(excitedly) Kristoff's home
He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls
(') Wait
Kristoff
Anna watches, shocked and confused
The trolls all want Kristoff's attention
One troll yanks him down with a boulder's strength
Oh, lemme look at you
Another troll tries to pull off his clothes
Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff;  wash them
(holding up his pants) Ah
No
'm gonna keep my clothes on, thank you
(') Great to see you all
Where's grandpa
He's napping
But look,  grew a mushroom
And  earned my fire crystal
83 -
Lee passed a kidney stone
Pick me up
The kid troll jumps up on Kristoff's arm
Kristoff sinks under the weight of him
Anna still stares, confused, then realizes
Trolls
They're trolls
Silence
All troll eyes turn to Anna
Blink
Blink
He's brought a girl
() He's brought a girl
Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls
They body-surf/roll Anna over to Kristoff
She falls into his arms
What's going on
've learned to just roll with it
Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look at Anna
She studies her like she's a piece of cattle
Let me see
Bright eyes
Working nose
Strong teeth
Yes, yes, yes
She'll do nicely for our Kristoff
Wait
Oh
Um
No
You've got the wrong idea
That's not why  brought her here
Right
We're not
'm not-- Anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say
84 -
Lee (to Anna) What's the issue, dear
Why are you holding back from such a man
Bulda
"Fixer-Upper" () -, - '     ' () (') '      , '    - ,
' '      , '  - Can we just stop talking about this
We've got a real, actual problem here
'll say-- (To Anna) () '
() ' 85 -
Lee () (') '       - '    '
No,  don't
'      , The girl trolls sweep Anna away
The boys take Kristoff
(to the male trolls) Enough
She's engaged to someone else
Okay

Blink
Blink
The boy trolls turn, huddle

"" ,  ' () '      , '

Lee () (') (     ) '
Kristoff looks over at Anna
She actually looks shockingly beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals
'      , '  ' , , By this time Kristoff and Anna are being ushered into a pit by the sheer force of numbers
'      , - During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each other differently
Hmmm
Maybe those trolls are right
Sparks
Chemistry
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded-- Wait, what
You're getting married
Just then, Anna collapses
Kristoff catches her
She's shivering something fierce
Anna
He pulls off her cape and hat
87 -
Lee (') She's as cold as ice
Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd
Trolls clear the way for Pabbie
He stops at the edge of the pit
There's strange magic here
Grand Pabbie
Bring her to me, Kristoff
Kristoff helps Anna over
Pabbie looks into her weak eyes
(') Anna, your life is in danger
There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever
What
No
So remove it, Grand Pabbie
can't
If it was her head, that would be easy
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart
An act of true love
(googley, to her hubby) true love's kiss, perhaps
bunch of trolls give each other kisses
Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms
More of her hair turns white
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans
(still weak) Hans
88 -
Lee Help us out, Sven
Kristoff grabs Sven's antlers
Sven pulls them out
Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her
(') Come on, Olaf
Sven takes off
Olaf grabs Sven's tail, rides with them
'm coming
Let's go kiss Hans
Who is this Hans
: '  - Hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle
We are here to find Princess Anna
Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the Queen
Do you understand
The Duke's thugs exchange a look
Suddenly, a mass of snow rises from the ground behind Hans
It's Marshmallow, Elsa's snow guard
Go away
He slams a fist inches from Hans
Hans deftly dodges out of the way
All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow, who quickly knocks them over
Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple over Hans
Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety
He sees his sword, leaps, and grabs it
Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors
The Duke's two thugs see her
' The Queen
The thugs charge up the stairs
89 -
Lee '  -- They guards burst through the ice doors
Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace
The guards pursue
They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows
(scared) No
Please
One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa
At the last moment she creates an ice wall
It stops the arrow, inches from her face
The thugs reposition to take another shot
(') Stay away
Elsa shoots ice at the thugs
They duck out of the way and continue the attack
Get her
Get her
Elsa fights for her life
: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow
He rolls away
Jumps to his feet
And with agile might, he slices Marshmallow's leg off with his sword
Marshmallow stumbles back, off balance
And falls off over the cliff, but not before striking Hans
Hans goes over the edge
: Hans clings to the ice steps
His men help him up and they rush into the ice palace
-- Elsa is surrounded
It's do or die
In two swift moves, Elsa traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck
The other she pushes back with a wall of ice
up against the balcony doors
which  and
The balcony doors shatter
The thug is pushed to the edge
He's inches away from falling to his death
: Hans and his men run in
See the destruction and the thugs near death
90 -
Lee Queen Elsa
Don't be the monster they fear you are
Elsa snaps out of her rage
She sees the men, frightened, moments from death
She stops
Elsa looks to Hans, overwhelmed, frightened
The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony
The ice spikes lower from the second thug's neck
He takes advantage and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back
Seeing it
Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the arrow releases
The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging directly above Elsa
The chandelier comes
Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast
All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the sound of it shattering as it rings out
: Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open
She sits up
She's surrounded by stone
,  -- Elsa looks to the nearby window
Tries to rush to it
She's pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves
She's chained to the wall
Elsa strains to looks out a window
: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting further buried under the ice and snow that is falling
No
What have  done
Hans enters
He hangs a torch by the door
(') Why did you bring me here
couldn't just let them kill you
91 -
Lee But 'm a danger to Arendelle
Get Anna
Anna has not returned
Elsa looks to the storm with worry
(') If you would just stop the winter, bring back summer
please
Elsa meets his eyes, desperate
Don't you see
can't
Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes
(') You have to tell them to let me go
Hans walks to the door
He takes the torch
will do what  can
He opens the door and leaves
Elsa, distraught, hears cracking
She looks down as her shackles begin to freeze over
The storm outside picks up
: -- Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his back
Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style
Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms
She's weakening
Kristoff takes off his hat and puts it on her head
Just hang in there
(to Sven) Come on, buddy, faster
They arrive at the walls of Arendelle
Olaf slides past them, out of control
'll meet you guys at the castle
92 -
Lee Stay out of sight, Olaf
will
He disappears into the village streets
(
) (') Hello
(
) Ah
It's alive
: -- Guards see Kristoff and Anna approaching
It's Princess Anna
Sven skids to a stop outside the gates
Kristoff slides off, holding Anna, and carries her to the gate
've got you
Anna looks up at him, gratefully
Are you g-gonna be okay
(touched, reassuring) Don't worry about me
Just then the castle gates open
Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid rush to help Anna
Anna
Oh, you had us worried sick
My Lady
You are freezing
You poor girl, you're freezing
Let's get you inside
93 -
Lee Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately
We will
Thank you
Anna is swept away from Kristoff and into the palace grounds
Make sure she's safe
Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him
Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with worry at the closed gates
Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off
Sven reluctantly follows
: -- Hans stands with the dignitaries and guards
'm going back out to look for Princess Anna
You cannot risk going out there again
If anything happens to her-- If anything happens to the Princess, you are all Arendelle has left
Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to depend on him
Is he really all they have left
Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna
He's in here
Prince Hans
Anna
94 -
Lee Hans rushes to Anna
She falls into his arms
(') You're so cold
(weak, but desperate) Hans, you have to kiss me
What
Now
Here we go
She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in his arms
We'll give you two some privacy
Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone
What happened out there
Elsa struck me with her powers
You said she'd never hurt you
was wrong
Anna crumbles, weak
Anna
Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down
(shivering more) She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me
(understanding) true love's kiss
He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile
He leans in slowly
gently
95 -
Lee Then he stops
(') Oh, Anna
If only there was someone out there who loved you
What
Hans gets up, leaving her there
(') You said you did
He goes to the window and shuts the curtains
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,  didn't stand a chance knew 'd have to marry into the throne somewhere-- What are you talking about
(putting out the candles) As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course
But no one was getting anywhere with her
But you- Hans
You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that
Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table and goes to the fireplace
(') figured, after we married, 'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa
Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire
Anna tries to stop him
She falls to the floor, weak
Hans
No, stop
96 -
Lee But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her
Please
(chuckles) All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer
Hans approaches Anna
You're no match for Elsa
He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time not so gently
No, you're no match for Elsa
, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction
She wrenches her face out of his hands
(anger) You won't get away with this
Hans rises and crosses to the door
Oh,  already have
Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door
Anna struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle
(hoarse and weak) Please, somebody help
The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the floor
: 97 -
Lee -- The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm
He rubs his arms and shivers
It's getting colder by the minute
If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death
Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face
Prince Hans
Princess Anna is
dead
What
No
Mon dieu
Hans stumbles, weak with grief
The men help him to a chair
What happened to her
She was killed by Queen Elsa
Her own sister
(really putting it on) At least we got to say our marriage vows
before she died in my arms
He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief
There can be no doubt now; Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger
Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you
Hans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas
98 -
Lee With a heavy heart,  charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death
'  -- The cell ices over
Elsa looks out at the storm that is devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching
(
) She's dangerous
Move quickly and with resolve
Elsa pulls at her shackles
They crack
Just as the door busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls
The men duck out of the way
Hans pushes his way into the room
sees
The back wall is blown open
Broken shackles rest on the floor
Elsa is gone
: -- Kristoff heads into the mountains
Sven lags behind, not wanting to follow
He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes his head
Enough
He runs past Kristoff
Stops and turns to face him
He snorts and grunts
What is it, buddy
Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers
(') Hey, watch it
What's wrong with you
Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays
(') (avoiding) don't understand you when you talk like that
99 -
Lee Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to lift Kristoff off the ground
(') Ah
Stop it
Put me down
Sven drops him hard then "yells" at him once more
(') No, Sven
We're not going back
Sven shakes his head, angrily
(') She's with her true love
Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face
Kristoff gets it; he's made his point
Just then the wind picks up
Kristoff looks back at the kingdom
Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the castle
Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it
(') Anna
Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain
Sven runs after him, catches up
Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and jumps onto his back
: -- Anna shivers by the door
She looks up to see ice overtaking the ceiling
The door handle suddenly jiggles
Stops
Jiggles again
(barely a whisper) Help
The door swings open
We see a carrot in the lock and hear a giggle of victory
Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back on his face
Then he sees Anna lying there
Anna
Oh no
He runs to the fireplace
Throws in some fresh wood, including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues, before striking a match and relighting the fire
100 -
Lee Olaf
Olaf
Get away from there
Whoa
So this is heat
(considering) love it
He reaches a twig finger toward the flames
It catches on fire
(') Ooh
But don't touch it
He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to the fire
(') So, where's Hans
What happened to your kiss
was wrong about him
It wasn't true love
(confused innocence) Huh
But we ran all the way here
Please Olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt
am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you
He sits down behind her, stubbornly
Leans his back against hers and thinks
(') Do you happen to have any ideas
don't even know what love is
(confident) That's okay,  do
Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder
101 -
Lee (') Love is
putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever
Kristoff loves me
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you
His face starts to melt
Olaf, you're melting
(sweet and reassuring) Some people are worth melting for
But then
his face  melts
He panics, pushes the snow back in place
(') Just maybe not right this second
Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in
(') Don't worry, 've got it
Olaf flitters to the window
He pulls one panel of it shut but struggles with the second panel
(') (determined) We're going to get through-- (distracted) Oh, wait
Hang on
'm getting something
He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope and sees
Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain
(') It's Kristoff and Sven
They're coming back this way
They-they are
102 -
Lee Wow, he's really moving fast
Huh
guess  was wrong guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind
Anna tries to get to her feet
Help me up, Olaf
Please
He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the chess set and water jugs
No, no, no, no, no
You need to stay by the fire and keep warm
need to get to Kristoff
(clueless) Why
(realizing) Oh, oh, oh,  know why
He hops around in an excited display of hope
(') There's your act of true love, right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king
Come on
The walls crack under the ice pressure
(') Look out
They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses
-- Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall
Ice spikes grow and block their path
We're trapped
Anna looks around desperately for a way out
103 -
Lee -- Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind
-- Anna and Olaf bust open a window
The storm is so strong it sweeps the window panes away
Slide, Anna
It's a long, snowy way down
But what choice do they have
They slide down the iced-covered building
Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured
Olaf gathers snow along the way
He arrives at the bottom as a giant snowball
(') We made it
He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet
-- Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the storm
Its white-out wind pushes them back
But they fight through
Come on, buddy, faster
: Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords
Kristoff
The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart
He goes swirling off into the storm
Keep going, Anna
Anna struggles on
104 -
Lee Kristoff
: Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships
Sven struggles over the uneven surface
Come on
Come on
Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them
They give it all they've got as debris falls all   around them and the mast shatters
They make it past just as   the entire ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath   their feet
The ice opens up
Sven bravely jumps over a gap
But it's too wide
He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing water and disappears below
(') Sven
Sven
At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy water
But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a floating ice chunk
He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to go on
(') Good boy
: Anna moves blindly across the fjord
Anna's hands frost over an icy blue
She stumbles on, determined
But she's running out of time
She clutches her chest
The color in her eyes fades, the inevitable is coming
: Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to turn
But then he hears a faint-- (
) Kristoff
Anna
Anna
: 105 -
Lee Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is consuming her
dark shadow approaches
It's Hans
Elsa
You can't run from this
Elsa backs away from him
Just take care of my sister
Your sister
She returned from the mountain weak and cold
She said you froze her heart
What
No
tried to save her, but it was too late
Her skin was ice
Her hair turned white
Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done
(') Your sister is dead
because of you
Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken
And with that, the swirling storm suddenly stops
The snow freezes mid-air, hangs suspended, trapped in grief
Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out to see
Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the fjords to
(a whisper) Kristoff
Anna
Anna pushes on towards Kristoff
He runs top speed towards her
There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is giving it all he's got
He's going to make it
But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard
She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he raises his sword over his head
106 -
Lee Elsa
Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her
She gives him a longing look, but then turns away from him and then
Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa
(') No
In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice
The sword hits her instead of Elsa
The sword shatters completely
The force of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out
Anna
Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face
(') Oh, Anna
no
no, please no
Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen
(confused, sad) Anna
Elsa hugs Anna and cries
Kristoff watches in shocked despair
Sven steps up to his side
Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads
All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence
But then, Anna warms
She begins to thaw
Olaf looks up and gasps
Kristoff and Sven notice, light up
Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa
Wha-
Anna
Anna opens her eyes
She smiles at Elsa, relieved
Oh, Elsa
They embrace
107 -
Lee You sacrificed yourself for me
(weak) love you
Olaf realizes what's happened
He's so excited about it, he lifts his head right off his body and exclaims-- An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart
(processing) Love
will thaw
(realizing) Love
Of course
Elsa looks at Anna with confidence
Elsa
Love
Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks
The ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air
Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws
The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves
The villagers come out to see the warmth returning
In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm summer day
knew you could do it
(melting, good-naturedly) Hands down, this is the best day of my life
and quite possibly the last
Oh, Olaf
Hang on, little guy
108 -
Lee Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold air
He refreezes
Above his head she leaves a little, perpetually-snowing storm cloud
Olaf loves it
Hey, my own personal flurry
Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet
He marches toward him, prepared for a fight
But Anna puts up a hand and stops him
Uh
Uh
Uh
She'll handle this
She goes over to Hans
(confused) Anna
But she froze your heart
The only frozen heart around here is yours
She turns away from him, proud of her words
But not yet satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face
Ah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
He falls overboard
Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her
Over her shoulder, Kristoff meets Anna's eyes
She smiles brighter, happy
: -- It's a beautiful summer day
The mighty ships have been repaired and are sailing away
On one of the ships,  is thrown into a brig
(to Kai) will return this scoundrel to his country
We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior
Arendelle thanks you, my Lord
109 -
Lee Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two thugs to their ship
This is unacceptable
am innocent
'm a victim of fear
've been traumatized
(bad acting) Ow
My neck hurts
Is there a doctor  could
No
And  demand to see the Queen
Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock
have a message from the Queen
(reading a scroll) Arendelle will henceforth and forever no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown
Weselton
It's Weselton
The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship
-- Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff along behind her
She's so excited she can't stand it
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
She runs him right into a pole
Pole
Oops
Sorry
-- Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops
(stopping) Okay
Okay
Here we are
110 -
Lee She takes off the blindfold
Kristoff opens his eyes
Before him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled
Sven poses in front of it -- Vanna White-style
(') owe you a sled
(blown away) Are you serious
Yes
And it's the latest model
No
can't accept this
You have to
No returns
No exchanges
Queen's orders
She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer
Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's king of the bucks
What
That's not a thing
But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm
Sure it is
And it even has a cup holder
Do you like it
Like it
He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around
(') love it
could kiss you
He drops her, suddenly embarrassed
(') could
mean 'd like to
'd
may
We me
mean, may we
Wait, what
She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek
We may
111 -
Lee He smiles and goes for it
It's a true love's kiss, alright
We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer
With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the flowers, which he does
Then sneezes his carrot nose off
Sven catches it between his teeth
Olaf gasps as Sven sucks the whole carrot into his mouth
It's gone
Olaf's face sinks in sadness
But not to fear, Sven spits the carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it belongs
It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf doesn't seem to mind
He hugs Sven happily
: -- The gates to the castle are wide open
In the courtyard, stands Elsa
Are you ready
Villagers cheer
Elsa stops and creates an ice rink
The people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about
Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds some snow flurries for atmosphere
Anna comes slipping in
Elsa catches her
like the open gates
We are never closing them again
Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally made of ice) form on Anna's boots
What
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know  don't ska-- Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice
Anna slips and slides, but laughs in delight
Sven goes slipping past
Kristoff runs after him
Look out
Reindeer coming through
112 -
Lee Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna
That's it
Glide and pivot and glide and pivot
We pull away slowly, into the sky
We arrive at a bird's-eye view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been repaired with a ice
All is right in Arendelle
