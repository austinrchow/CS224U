At the southwest edge of Green River, Aron Ralston drives under the interstate into a landscape of obscurity
He looks to his right and left, not a single light perforates the absolute blackness of the San Rafael Desert

From high above, three quarters of the screen is black and we see his truck's lights running parallel with the blackness

: But no rest
: '
The doors smash open to reveal a glorious day and Aron's bike careers into it
: It's still like a wild road movie, but now on a bicycle
Having parked his motorized transport he ploughs into the land like an ad for extreme sports
Past bikers, he vanishes temporarily in their dust cloud, he wears a bandana across his face as the bikers pass by
a final telephone box, past remnants of those who tried to settle or work this unforgiving land; Aborigines, frontier settlers, ranchers
all driven away from a heartland he ploughs into
: 5
on
Wearing a pair of beat-up running shoes and thick wool-blend socks, Lycra biking shorts and a Phish tee shirt he has a back pack with equipment but hydrates through a gallon of water stored in an insulated three litre CamelBak hydration pouch which he sucks on without stopping
: His bike pummels the canyon landscape and you get a sense of the exhilaration this man gets from pitting himself alone against what nature can offer
He's clearly a fit and daring young man and these are his kicks
: Even uphill he hammers his way up the sandstone
Gasping for oxygen, his legs screaming for rest, he pushes and pushes until the crest and then down, down, instant speed and he can suck on his water again
Part of a massive clan who define themselves not by what they are, but by what they do
In a way, he's an action movie personified and the opening should be shot and cut to provide adrenaline in spadefuls
Until
: Suddenly, he hits a sand trap and hurtles forward over the handle bars, face first into the sand, his toe clips and momentum brings the bike with him
The bike has him trapped on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling
He submits, landing nose deep in the sand
He sits up, looks around quickly to see if anyone saw
Pulls out his camera from his bag and takes a a self-portrait snap of the mess
: At what seems like the only tree for miles he -locks his bike in the shade, pockets the keys, scoffs a muffin and heads off into the desert
: 6
He approaches the crest of a sand gulley and sees below him, just 30 yards down the canyon, 2 fellow hikers
He looks around
All of them in the middle of nowhere it seems
: He can see now it's 2 girls passing a map back and forth between them
He rushes towards them, initially above them as he walks along side
They're aware of him before he arrives: Hey
Are you doing the east pike
Can  come along with you for a while
The girls don't reply, just look at each other
(') 'm on my own
'm Aron
: He slides/surfs down so he's on the same level as them, arriving in a haze of dust, holding out his hand for the shake
Big smile
(looking at Megan) Sure, 'm Kristi
Megan
Nice to meet you
What a day
It's beautiful
Did you bike or come straight from the trail head
We left the car there
Pretty quiet
left mine at the Horseshoe Canyon and biked here
7
You biked from Horseshoe
That's 20 miles or more
17 and windy
The girls exchange glances
(') do this a lot
They laugh
He's crazy, but harmless
(') Wasn't expecting to see anyone in the canyon today
Yeah, you surprised us, sneaking up like that
Sorry
It's kind of nervy seeing a lone guy walking up to you in the middle of the desert
Yeah,  know,  mean there's no one around for 50 miles
and suddenly there's a guy right behind you and `wait a minute, why is he wearing a ' They all laugh
Let me guess
You're here for the paintings or the Cathedral
The Cathedral
We've got a bit disorientated and the map isn't great
Where is it
The climb's a little tricky but it's worth it
/ We climb
8
They all laugh
: Towards us comes Aron, upside down, like a tiny, fast spider, talking all the time, his voice echoing
There's thousands of holds but you can't see them until you're almost upside down and then they just keep appearing
it's a bit of a act of faith so 'll go first
take off as much as you dare as there's a bit of a surprise at the other end
(
) You behave Aron Ralston or we'll tell your mother all about where you lure girls
swear  won't look but  swear you won't care when you get out here
We've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider style
He's stripped to his underwear
He's lithe to say the least
We can't see the girls or what's underneath us but there's a feeling of the vertiginous, as much from the weird echo and the sense of reflected light as from the scale of the dome
(') and the thing is, when you get to the middle
He lets go
(') there aren't any more
We spin and watch him fall into the most exquisite emerald pool 60 feet below
: They can't see him
They can only hear the explosive crack of man on water
9
Are you ok
Of course he's ok
Listen to him
Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish song at the top of his voice
Kristi strips to her underwear and traverses away from Megan
(') Got to be there, Meg
: From the pool below with Aron we see Kristi in her underwear heading out arachnid-style to the centre
Before she gets there Megan appears too
She's left everything on except her shoes
They crash into the pool one after the other
They bob together in the centre, the light seems to come from beneath them and ripple over the heavenly ceiling
We've got to go again
And film it
: ()
Eating and drying in the powerful afternoon sun
little self consciousness has returned but it's sweet-natured and fun still
really can't eat all this chocolate by myself
Never mind, yes  can
So have you got a girlfriend, Aron
Well, there's not really anyone special
Ah, so there's lots of girlfriends
There's always a girl, you just don't know it yet
10
Yeah, we meet lots of guys and there's always a girl
Long story
With lots of characters in it
: Aron on top of a snowy peak
Self shot
Classic pose
Breathtaking backdrop
(
) 've done 46 of the 59 winter solo ascents
Wow, highest person in Colorado
Well  figure no one else is mad enough to climb in the winter
you can be the highest person on the continent
: ` 6' Megan shows the image to Aron
Didn't you see it
What
No
Yeah, it's an old cattle guardian's house - the roof's caved in and someone spray-painted  6 on the side
Smelled weird though
Just like a  6 then
: 11
Why are you on your own
Solitude
Great tunes
Empty mind
He indicates the wilderness
(') And  can sing Phish songs as loud as  like
Phish
Not those guys from
Yeah,  know,  know
() See, that's why 'm on my own
Nobody likes me or my band
They laugh as he goofs for them
He gathers all their packaging and stuffs it in his backpack
(') 'll get this
Leave no trace
: They're walking again
(') Hey, but  like a beer like the next man
You know, end of the day
: They're negotiating a steep gulley
Aron is 1/2 way down, Megan at the top, Kristi on her way down to him
'm not certified yet but that's what  want to do
An illegal instructor
12
It's hard to get the hours to qualify
Catch 22
Well, we'll sign your time-card today
Great
Now put your ass on my head
Okay but don't look and no grabbing now, if  do
Oh whatever, you love it
Shhh
Aron then quickly slips to the bottom
Megan is way high, Kristi half way
(at his most instructor- ish, talking all the time as he makes his way down) You'll have to chimney down a little ways - like here, watch - one foot on each wall then squat onto your right heel, now your butt's on the wall, so you can move your right foot across, now put your left foot under your butt lower down and scootch your butt down - watch that black part, it's slick, slime, try not to get it on your shoes - if you can get to these bomber handholds here it's like an elevator shaft and just think friction to control the slide
This is a keeper so always have someone at the bottom to boost you out
He looks up to them
didn't understand any of that
,  ,
2PM- They come to a clear fork in the paths
He watches them turn their map round and round
13
(') Kristi,  think this is our way back
Why don't you come with me to the Big Drop Rappel
can give you a lift back to your car
How far is it
He shows them on the map
About another 8 miles or so, think
You'll never get out before dark
No,  really got to do this
Anyway 've my miner's lamp
You don't climb at night, do you
No, it's great for seeing snakes in hand holds
Can  get a picture then
They pose with raven feathers in their hair
(') Listen, my friends are having a party tomorrow night
You should come
Yeah, we'd like that
What time
Where
Drive on the east road and about 40 miles out there's a huge inflatable Scooby Doo
You can't miss it
Turn off and it's about 2 miles down that track
Starts late and it'll go right thru
Lots of cheek kissing and his last picture of them
14
Come on Aron, hike out with us - we'll go get your truck, hang out and have a beer
No,  really got to do this
Okay
Scooby Doo, yeah
That's the one
'll have 3 cold beers waiting for us
12 cold beers
: And they separate down 2 different canyons shouting to each other
'hot dogs
'vegetarian hot dogs
'
'so that's 12 cold beers and 9 vegetarian hotdogs
'
'
really can't eat all these vegetarian hotdogs by myself
never mind, yes can
'
the last of the dialogue fading away as they lose earshot of each other and we pull up out high over the meandering slits of sandstone
: Aron alone
they are gone
he picks up the pace as he checks his watch
he loved them but now he's behind schedule and he's ruthless about his schedule
: His sense of momentum is established again and it's clear he's moving downhill, into the fissure of the rock
: Without warning his feet suddenly slide forward from under him and he skates/snap-kicks trying to keep his balance on a floor of scattering pebbles left there by a flood
There's a flash of the sky and dazzling sunlight
15
Only his arms and the proximity now of the walls prevent him landing hard on his ass
: /
small snake slithers away from his giant feet
: Easy Aron, easy now
He keeps moving, descending still, but a little more circumspect
He lets the change of pace allow him to whip round his pack and with the practice of thousands of times selects and plays a  without stopping, slipping the headphones over his head
: We see the  begin to spin: the display tells us there's 38:47 to play before 0:01 appears
: / '
Suddenly, louder than loud, the sound of fanatical 5,000 strong applause at the Phish live concert in Las Vegas, fills his head and ours
He's heard it many times as he alternatively anticipates/answers all the dialogue preamble mixed over the applause
Good evening Las Vegas
are you having a good time
Are you ready for
Whether we are or not, the first song begins on a wave of adoration from his fellow Phish fans
He sings along
: 16
Aron keeps descending, the canyon walls growing taller and closer, into the narrowing slot canyon
: -
dry waterfall, many months since it's seen rain
drop of maybe 12/15 ft with no obvious climb down
Way beyond his reach and jammed into the walls of the canyon is an enormous -shaped log, sand bleached and wind dried it looks like a massive reptile making its way down the canyon
Beyond it, Aron can see his route down disappearing into narrowing darkness
: To reduce the drop he scrambles down clinging to the edge, pushes away and drops the final 6 feet or so landing in a fine cloud of sand
Nothing to it, second nature
: -
He snaps the log now arching above him well out of reach
" 2:41pm
Sat April 26th
2003 " Won't be coming back this way
: (:
) He spins and continues, seeing the first huge chockstones, the size of vans, their noses buried in the floor of the canyon like unexploded bombs
He easily scrambles over one and around another-tight fit but he's skinny
: 17
The slot is now just 4ft wide and as he stops to look at massive tree logs jammed at strange angles high above him and silhouetted against the blue cloudless sky, he drinks deeply from his water bottle
: On we go and so does the concert
He pumps the air unaware as we track above him - it's like the canyon in Star Wars and he's Anakin feeling the force
One set of chockstones leads to another and he rapidly negotiates them like an obstacle race - until there's one the size of a big refrigerator which has been stopped by the walls 18 inches from the floor
: Over or under
He drops to his belly and squeezes underneath, rucking the sandy floor in front of him
He's halfway, his chest rising out the far side when suddenly he can't move
The music jams and loops on 2 notes like bad techno
He pushes but nothing
He reaches back with his hand and releases a part of his rucksack strap that's snagged
And the music releases too
He squat-jumps out and brushes off the sand
No panic -a nothing moment
: Now it's steeper
We're already 60ft below ground level and it's falling away further in front of us
Another drink and the map is out
: /
We see a section of the canyon and the tiny figure of Aron moving within it
We track in and elide into a graphic view of him chimneying his way along the canyon now only 3 ft wide at most
It's a chance to see his skill and thirst for climbing
And to see how deep he's going
18
He uses his legs, back and natural body weight to body walk along and down the towering walls
: He's moving towards a final chockstone below him jammed in the gap
You can see the way he's thinking: it's about the size of a bus wheel and used as a platform will help him reduce the 10 foot drop and get quickly down into the next section
: He reaches it at the same time we do and kicks fiercely, automatically, to make sure it's solid
Yep
And across he steps onto it
It holds
: As before he squats and clambers down the back side of the stone to reduce his drop down
: /
Just as he dangles there's a scraping sound, small but close, too close and the stone judders towards him, pulled by the torque of his weight on his side, rotating
Instantly and instinctively he lets go and drops
Like he's trying to detach a mine dragging him to the sea floor
: But it follows him down, somehow he's released its latent energy
: 19
He watches the chockstone follow him - not looking where he's going
: '
The backlit chockstone falling towards him consuming the sky
: His arms rise to protect his head but his eyes remain open and through his fingers we see the next 3 seconds
The rock's face and his
It grabs his left hand and flings it against the left wall
He pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon and careers towards his right arm which he raises, to compensate for withdrawing the left, and to protect his head
The rock smashes the right hand and wrist against the wall and drags it down the remaining distance
Like a cheese grater it tears the skin from the back of the hand and the forearm, decorating the wall
Aron is powerless to stop its force and he lands on his feet allowing the rock to jam in front of him with his hand held against the canyon wall by the stone
All this happens too quickly
We can hardly register what's happened as everything stops
: Silence
He's standing behind the rock
Like he's in a line for a bus
Like he's shaking someone's hand
hand shake with the canyon
Silence
: : 127HOURS : 20
Adrenaline, searing, roaring pain and panic
, get your hand out of there
Pulls and pulls, yanks until his shoulder will dislocate, but nothing moves
Sweat, anxiety flaring, hot pain
(') , , ,
Pushing with his left hand desperate to reverse the action; so simple to undo the moment, to reverse gravity for a split second and pull his hand out
nothing
Again and again thrusting up with knees, thighs, pelvis, left arm, head, neck
nothing
: Then slam upwards, harder than ever as though he's run at it from a hundred yards and it's a door that will surely burst open
Air exploding out of his lungs
And then a quiet hollow sound of the boulder shifting fractionally
howl of phenomenal pain - (') , , , ,
He reverses the fraction and collapses in sweat and blood, knees bleeding, good fingers lacerated
But he remains upright, attached
Unable to physically collapse
Grabs his shirt and wipes sweat away and goes to drink
He hula-hoops out of his backpack to get access to the water, gulps down 3 full throatfulls - stops mid 4th and backwashes as much as he can into the bottle - (') No, no
more water
He caps the lid tightly and drops it into his pack
(') Relax
Stop
Come on
He breathes and breathes, taking stock for the 1st time
: 21
/: Time Check

14pm
Stares at it until it changes to 3
15pm - the watch is working
: He examines the boulder at each point he can reach, stretching and contorting to see into his crushed and wretched hand where his thumb is visible above and his little finger below
No matter how much he touches them, there is no feeling
He prods up and down to see what feeling is left and where it stops
Comparing left hand to where the right hand is trapped to measure the width of his right wrist - now smaller than the width of his little finger on his right hand
He can barely get the little finger of his left hand in the gap
We reverse back on him at each contortion
He - What the fuck
How the fuck did you get your hand trapped by a fucking boulder
Its crushed, it's fucking dying man
He reaches up and touches the trail of blood, hair and skin left on the canyon wall as the rock pushed him to where he is
Looks under boulder, no blood - check
[He hears the crowd cheering on his headphones
It's been playing throughout
He switches it off] He looks above for the first time
(') : /
to see the slot canyon, back and back and back, nothing more than a dry crack in the surface of this massive land
Gradually his cries for help become inaudible
: He unpacks everything with great energy, like a stocktake, and lays it all out on the surface of the rock; 22
chocolate bar wrappers and bakery bag with crumbs of chocolate muffin inside that he volunteered to take away on behalf of the girls, 2 small bean burritos, cd player, cds , extra  batteries, mini digital video camcorder, small multi- use tool and 3  headlamp
: /:
of all these elements - these are now his only companions and their  of him reflects that as he tests each one for its potential, opening all the blades and laying them out to look at them; sunglasses - scratched, bike Ulok key, rock climbing harness, cloth goggles bag, rapelling equipment, water bottle, car keys, plastic grocery bag, empty de- hydration pack, money, credit cards, green and yellow climbing rope in black zippers bag, a stick, stones and sand
Everything
Pause
He stares at it all and it all stares back at him
: /:
3
28, changes to 3
29 : Inside the tiny gap we see
his headlamp flick on to let him assess the rock and the wall and his hand in between it
He picks a point and begins to chip away with the knife
He's back - energy, movement, purpose, action makes him happy
He occasionally stops to look at his left hand, swollen and puffy and constantly in need of flexing
He gets into a rhythm of 'tick,tick,tick', flex and back again, `tick,tick,tick' : /:
4
19pm, changes to 4
20 : 23
In a huge close up of this eye he can see in the foreground that there's a pile of steel filings from the knife itself, almost as big as the dust from the ground - Not good
He blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust
(') When in a hole
Alternative; he starts digging away at the wall instead, same result
(') Fuck
It's hard as iron
Pause
You're gonna have to cut your arm off
As if to answer that idea we
: Tapping a rock in his hand onto the top of the knife as he balances it against the wall or with his mouth
Weird close angles as he almost taps the side of his eye socket
Suddenly, he hammers down with ten times more force onto the handle of the knife, the rock explodes in his hand, showering pick dust over everything, and bouncing the knife off the rock
Once again, gravity takes over
The knife hits his shorts and as he moves to grab it, he misses it and knocks it further round the back of his leg
He pivots and turns to try and catch it but gravity is quicker than his restricted twist and it falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near his left foot - ,
: The knife is visible in the crack below and behind his right leg but he can't twist to get anywhere near it
He tries to pull the canyon wall off balance to get closer
No chance
24
Shit
He pulls off his right sock and shoe and tries to squeeze his foot into the hole
Too big
Size 10
He looks upward
He can't believe he's done it
(') Shit
: We're on a level with the knife in the little hole beneath his feet
An enormous overhead light switches on (Aron's headlamp placed above to let him see)
The stick enters from top of screen and nudges the knife in a semi circle
It's a bit Punch and Judy if it wasn't so fucking serious
Huge shadows
No success
The knife remains where it is
Maybe an ant races across it
Pause
The stick withdraws
: The stick re-enters with the top of it almost broken off, acting like a hook, we push in on the knife as the stick hooks through the little ring at the end of the knife
It lifts
: Looking down onto the ground, around his leg, his toes holding the stick like a chopstick lift the knife out and up tremulously, breathlessly, towards his good arm
He picks it off the stick gently
Big smile
First one
Sweet
: 25
: "   ": We pass through the transparent title on our way along the canyon
Half dark
We're on a wind blowing dust through the canyon walls, to find a miner in the distance digging into the rock
It's Aron of course, and his head-lamp is filled with the dust swirling through
He's using the shorter file from the multi tool and has tied a shoe lace to his wrist and looped through the ring at the end of the tool
He pulls his cap down, to keep most of the dust out of his eyes
His lips are caked but he keeps blowing on his arm, to keep it clear
: /:
The watch, now luminous, changes to 00
00
: Midnight is celebrated with a tiny, careful, sip of the water
He holds it in his mouth
Puffing his cheeks, circulating the precious fluid around
: Daylight, a lunar landscape almost, though with patches of green and giant boulders, Aron whom we sense only by being around his shoulder is out walking with his friend, Mark Von Eeckhout through this field of boulders
They come upon one the size of a house buried nose deep in the field
Wow, look at the size of this one
There's no cliffs or mountains anywhere near
We look at Mark's pleasant, unremarkable face for far too long as he looks around - (') How the fuck did this get there
It's like we're on the moon looking over Buzz Aldrin's shoulder at Neil Armstrong; it certainly sounds like that
: 26
Chip,chip,chip; stretches his arm, flexes his legs, tick,tick,tick
He changes the blade, prising suddenly at a section of the rock with his file
It bites and a dime size shred chip of rock arcs through the night light
He catches it perfectly on his right elbow
Cool
He picks it off his arm and places it on top of the rock next to where he's working
It's a grain of sand on the seashore but it's something
Boy, his arm and his legs are aching now
: ,
He's stepped into his harness and is throwing 30ft of rope up towards us
There's a tangle of knots and carabiners looking for purchase close to camera
Each time it falls back all the way
He persists, each time, varying his line of attack fractionally
Finally it catches
He pulls gently at first, then fiercely, it holds and we slide softly and slowly down the rope and as we reach him he gently takes the weight off his feet finally
Aahhhhh
Lovely relief for him, light off, his eyes close
: /
re-run of the accident
He can now witness it in detail as though it were planned and his role is to point us where to look
3 seconds become 30
We fall with his face in high definition slow motion watching his future
We fall with the rock pitilessly chasing him down to the floor of the canyon
As he lands
: 27
His eyes open and he stands unsteadily rubbing at his legs, the lack of circulation has forced him up
Doesn't think about the dream, starts chipping again
: -
Lit only by his lamp, the black shifts to grey and then there's light
He watches it arrive
rush of wind
Something flaps and he looks up sharply - Caw-caw
: black raven flies symmetrically the length of the canyon slit above him
Blue, blue sky
: Caw-caw
As he stretches his neck to follow the path of the only other living thing, he freezes stock still
The bird has gone
Nothing moves
Not him
nothing
Time passes
He switches his light off
: On top of some 4 x 4 vehicles are 8-10 ft huge Easter Island- like masks, multi-coloured
Multiple bikes are strapped to the backs of the vehicles too
More of Aron's friends, including Mark
mill around their 4 x 4s
There are multiple lights in the distance but it's unclear what it might be
The vehicles' own headlights illuminate Rana, a stunningly beautiful red-haired woman in her mid-20s, effortlessly organising the 15 or so group
As before, we remain behind Aron
By the camera's virtually complete concentration on Rana it's clear he's a fan
28
- lights off and line up alongside me
They turn off their vehicles' headlights as she draws a long line in the sand and they join her standing on one side of it
(') On the other side of this line, everything will be different
As they all hold hands and together step cross the line (Aron's keen and ever so slightly ahead of everyone across the line) the sparkling lights of the crescent-shaped `town' of vehicles and camps that is Burning Man are replaced by an astonishing sunrise in the Nevada desert
They hoot and holler as Rana smiles beautifully at Aron
(') And remember, stick together, the desert wants to kill you
: Aron is very still, looking at the rock and the open blade lying on top of it
Suddenly he looks over his shoulder to see
: dagger of sunlight appear behind him
His won sunrise
9
30am : He looks at ithe sunbeam as though it's his prey and it might run away
It makes it's way along the canyon walls towards him
He's very still
But it shifts across the floor and it's going to miss him
He whips off his left shoe and sock and pushes it towards the coming light
Slowly it climbs and caresses his ankle and lower calf
He pulls the other sock off and alternates the feet
He looks like he's doing yoga
As it leaves him passing overhead it suddenly bursts into the opening in front of him
29
It's a beautiful sight as the colors of the canyon reawaken but we can see from above that he appears to be behind a door with a room of life beyond him
: : "  ": : It's three-oh-five on Sunday
This marks my twenty-four-hour mark of being stuck in Blue John Canyon above the Big Drop
My name is Aron Ralston
My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of Englewood, Colorado
Whoever finds this, please make an attempt to get this to them
Be sure of it
would appreciate it
He takes long blinks and seems to avoid looking at himself though the screen is facing him
He looks alarmed and wide eyed, startled, in contrast to his slow slurred delivery
(') So
was hiking Blue John Canyon yesterday
and this happened
He pulls the camera round to show where his forearm and wrist disappear into the horrifyingly skinny gap between the chockstone and the wall
As he does that we : /
Flashes of the accident-almost in silhouette - like an animatic side view
It freezes just before the moment of entombment
: What you're looking at there is my arm, going into the rock
and there it is, stuck
It's been without circulation for 24 hours
() 30
(') It's pretty well gone
If the colour doesn't come across on the video, it's grey and blue
(') Unnhhhhh
'm in deep stuff
(') So  have very little water
He can't help look in the camera towards those who know what that means in this place
(') Yeah,  have about a third of a litre left
He picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the camera
: /
Different angle on the freeze-frame
: So the way  see it
there's kind of four things happening here tried to move it with some rigging
useless
and  tried chipping away at the rock think part of the problem is, is that my hand is actually supporting the rock
Which means every time chip away the rock moves a bit and settles onto my hand again can't feel it happening but microscopically, it seems to be, because the little gap over there between the rock and the wall seems to be getting smaller
And this chockstone is the hardest thing here
: 31
breeze slides through the canyon and he shudders involuntarily for five seconds
: So the third thing left was to cut my arm off
(') don't know whether  could do that but it's pretty much suicide
It's four hours to my vehicle that way and with very difficult climbing with one hand and the bike is like two, two and a half hours, that way but the climbing
fourth class climbing
which  think will be probably impossible with one hand
between the blood loss and the dehydration  think  would die if  cut off my arm
(') Which means 'm waiting for someone to come along
He summons up the guts to let the evidence out
(') didn't tell anyone where  was going and  didn't leave a note on the truck
(') Dumb
The video whirrs on until he suddenly looks straight into the lens
: He hears voices
32
: We see his reaction to this sound through the video message
: He puts the camera down and listens
People descending at the  log
He can hear them
He screams and screams and screams and then he stops
He listens again
: '
The noise is there still
Again he screams and screams
: Breathing hard, heart racing he listens again
The noise is still there unchanged
He knows now it's not people
They would have heard him
: '
He looks above and behind and sees a kangaroo rat disappearing, scuffling, behind a chockstone
: He stops, staring at the camera still recording
He picks it up, rewinds and
: re-runs the sound of him screaming for help
33
() Freaky
We just see an arbitrary view of the rock and sky on the video camera, maybe with a bit of elbow, but we hear his desperation, screaming at no one, distorting on the tiny speaker
: He stops it
The sound of his absolute helplessness and need freaks him out and threatens absolute despair
Snorts
No one's coming Aron
He rewinds to the end of the message and erases his futile calls for help
: '
Aron's Truck
We sense him in the cab but we're not inside with him yet
Music loud and pulsing as we travel towards the inflatable Scooby Doo
It's 12ft tall, powered by a mini- generator
: '
Aron swerves to affect the figure which buckles and flaps in his after-draft
: We stay with the dancing figure as his truck drives away into the landscape
The generator fan rattles on as the booming bass of the truck fades
: You can see him thinking
Will the girls go to the party
34
-
We're now high above the desert, and in the time-lapse we see the soft, grey, endless line of darkness cross right to left - : : "   ": : flashing, strobe-ing light - Aron's head-lamp bouncing back and forth off the canyon walls - but also, as he continues to chip away
: jump-cutting, strobe-lit as though by flash, of Aron madly dressing for the night
: /: We see the thermometer on his watch falling down and down from 70 => below 50
: The whole thing is almost like stop-frame animation
He cannibalizes everything he can, using his knife, his teeth, he tears holes in a cloth camera bag, he's frantically paced to occupy himself, to pass time, to create heat from energy, but he has to be careful not to stab himself in the eye
He thrusts his left arm into the newly fashioned sleeve, pulling it up with his teeth
Purple webbing around his right arm, the insulated Camelbak protects his upper arm from the chilling canyon wall
Yellow webbing wraps a grocery bag (that held the burritos) round his upper right bicep
35
The dirty green and yellow ropes are curled round his legs like pythons
Finally he puts his head inside the rope bag
: It's plastic inside and although it's black the light from his head-lamp suddenly lights him up alarmingly as we go inside with him
: He looks like a multi-coloured version of the Michelin Man, only much thinner
: He laughs, as though he can see how ludicrous he looks
We return to normal speed as he turns the light off
: - but we can hear his breathing close as in a space suit
God,  am praying to you for guidance
'm trapped in Blue John Canyon - you probably know that - and  don't know what  am supposed to do
've tried everything  can think of
need some new ideas
Please show me a sign
- Just his breath
He switches on the head lamp and the inside of the bag explodes with light
There's enough light for any kind of heaven but it's just Aron in Blue John Canyon
He looks around his bag
He stops
Silence
Only his breathing to listen to
Heart rate
fast
too fast
Light off
36
(') , then, God, since you're apparently busy: Devil, if you're listening,  need some help here
'll trade you my arm, my soul, whatever you want
Just get me out of here
You want me never to climb again,  can give that up
Just show me the dotted line
: (') Ungg-gggu-ggga-gggngh
His throat uncontrollably shudders and splutters as his teeth rattle with cold suddenly
It does sound like a demonic fit from the multi-coloured headless man
(') Yeah
Not very funny
: Aron leaves work: at no point do we see Aron
He's there, you sense him in reflective surfaces, his arms, particularly his right one and his feet occasionally come into shot
It's not a strict
, more like 'over the shoulder' but without much shoulder
What you doin'
Still not sure
'll see you Tuesday
Have a good one
Always do
: : 37
/: 11:59 => 00
00 in huge, luminous figures
: He pulls his bag off and pulls his water bottle out of the ground where he has half-buried it
It won't open
He can't unscrew it
He mutters, cursing himself for tightening the lid too much
He puts it between his teeth and levers with his head, but nothing
Is his strength vanishing so quickly
He looks at his puffy left hand
there's a tremble in it
He shakes it to get rid of the tremble and jams the bottle between his legs
He uses a bit of cloth to give his hand better purchase on the top
We're tight on the neck of the bottle as it releases, finally and he lifts it, slowly, almost ceremonially
Controlling the tilt, a half-mouthful of water slides onto his tongue
He tilts the bottle back towards upright but not the whole way
He waits
Circulating the splash of water around his mouth
: /: The bottle neck stares at Aron
: /: his eyes staring at the bottle neck
: He still holds the water in his mouth as he rewinds the top onto the bottle and reburies it in the sand to stop any evaporation
He moves to pop his contact lenses into his mouth and wash them in the moisture
First one then the other as we
: '
The images shift with the lens change back to his apartment, daylight, we sense him though he's probably in the shower
His ansaphone clicks in
38
() Aron, it's Mom
Hoping to catch you
Nothing urgent
Dad's in New York so it'll be a quiet weekend
Aron is clearly there but can't answer
() (') Call me
Lots of love
: '
In front of his bathroom mirror he's slipping his lenses in for the day
It looks like The Man Who Fell To Earth
: /:
&
Huge close-ups that freak people out who've never worn lenses
Mirror shots and lots of short soft focus
: '
We hear a girl and a guy somewhere in the apartment
He closes the door
: That was your Mom
And your Dad called
Call him
We're going
See you next week
Oh, and Rana called
: He is absolutely still
Almost absent
Flies buzz around him
Indeterminate time passes
: 39
Massive / of an ant
Huge, high-definition image, more like a -digger than an insect, and then more of them, and all moving towards the mosquitoes which hover and land near the real giant, Aron
: He watches them devour him and then he clears them away from his hand
Suddenly breaks and he's busy now well before sunrise
In the grey-white, soft morning he is involved in recycling his overnight insulation gear into a crude lift and pulley
Obsessive, inventive, analytical, he constantly adjusts and adds and subtracts, and cannibalizes
Undoing and tieing knots with his teeth and hand
Each time nothing happens to the rock
But each time he doesn't stop
He tries again and again and again; looping and re-looping throwing and catching ropes; creating footholds and bouncing in them with his foot, his knees, his ass
Finally he stops
He looks down
For a moment it's as though he will cry
He looks up to where he came from and : /
suddenly we're moving, retracing his journey at increasing and eventually staggering speed
Through the slot canyon, up and into the blazing light across the desert paths, past his chained-up bicycle and back to his truck waiting at the side of the road
But we don't stop
: '
We crash into the back of the truck and there, lying on its side is an almost-full bottle of Gatorade, and then there's a grapefruit, and another one, and they've got sparkly condensation on them -like advertising spritzer mist - all over them
And a water bottle, and an orange
And high energy snack bars and another orange
The fruit seems to roll around the empty truck
40
The Gatorade lies on its side and the liquid slaps slowly backward and forward like a Lava lamp
The liquid literally bulges with wetness, moisture texture, and we
: snap back to Aron's face
: : "  ": : Aron trying not to look at himself: It's freaking me out looking at myself so  hope you guys are with this : : We can see 2 images of him when we go behind the balanced video on the rock, as he has deliberately turned the screen away from himself
: : It's Monday - all day - bummer spent the morning trying to create a 6:1 system ration and lift the boulder but friction between the rope and carabiners is dissipating every bit of force  apply
() 41
(') All it's good for is sitting in
: : We see a more objective view of his morning's activities as he describes them
We see him below us as the raven flies between us and him
: : There's a raven flies overhead, clocked it at 8
15
'll bet it's there tomorrow too
'll film it for you tomorrow : :
We see the raven and we see him check his watch
Sure enough, 8
14 Slides to 8
15
: : have about one hundred and fifty millilitres of water left
That's four ounces
can't believe it but  peed twice today, within a few minutes of each other
How is this possible
It's two days since peed, 'm dehydrated and  had to go so quickly  forgot to save the first
saved the second in the CamelBak
Will  drink it
It smells foul, and hot but it'll settle
And  can chill it in the sand in the night
It's like Polar winter here for nine hours
: 42
: We see his precious bottle of water
It looks back at him
Next to it is the Camelbak of his stored urine
: : No number twos
Which will disappoint my insect friends
They're gonna have to wait
The sunlight appears down here for a few hours
get 15 minutes of it at 9
35
and apart from chipping away uselessly at this rock that's pretty much my morning routine
: - -: Aron is deathly still as we travel towards him with the dagger of light
His leg is stretched out and the only movement is the change of leg halfway through
He stays in shot throughout getting bigger and then smaller as the light approaches and recedes; the sliver of light leaves the canyon
: : keep chipping at the rock but just to generate warmth and give me something to do
think it's making it worse
know it's settling more on my arm as  remove material from it
The area where chipped flakes off yesterday has already rotated down onto my arm
can't feel anything
So  made a great tourniquet and  tried to cut it off
: 43
: We see him pull the elastic neoprene tubing insulation from the CamelBak
It's stretchy, supple and strong and emerges like a thin snake
It's perfect
He wraps the black neoprene around his right forearm 2 inches below his elbow
Simple overhand knot tightened with his teeth
2nd knot, 3rd knot, clips the neoprene with a carabiner and twists 6 times tight
Now real pain in his right arm
Weird smile at the success
The skin colour separates; fish belly white below the tourniquet and bright red bunched up crushes of flesh between the elbow and the tourniquet
(') Oh yeah
That aches
He takes out the multi-tool and switches to the long blade
looks at it
Then he presses the blade and draws it quickly across his forearm
Nothing
Repeats it harder
Nothing
No cut, no blood, nothing
He switches to the short knife and saws viciously at the same point
(') Shit
He releases the tourniquet and as the blood flow returns a series of angry red lines establish themselves where he was sawing
He looks at them
(') Pathetic, Aron, pathetic
: : The blades are too blunt even to break the skin
guess that's the chipping
It's not even a proper Leatherman
It's a knock-off one we got free in a gift pack with a torch
Mom gave it to me
Sis
Sonja, 'm very proud of you
() 44
(') didn't get to hear firsthand how your championships went, but heard from Mom that you placed very well at the national competitions, that you were tenth overall in speech and debate in the nation
Hot damn, girl
'm very proud of you
Not just for that but for who you are
He looks directly in the lens for the first time
(') can imagine you in your living room looking back at me
: We see his sister on her living room sofa
The sofa sits in the open section of the canyon
: 've been thinking about what my friend Rob in Aspen says to me several
frequently
Several times that, confusingly, 'It's not what you do but who you are'
kind of got hung up on that a lot, because  always thought who was, was very much wrapped up with what  did
That  was happy because of the things that  did that made me happy
If things you do make you happy, then they can also make you unhappy
think that's why  found myself being as ambitious and energetic - The wind interrupts him and he shivers
(') (mutters, bitterly) It's cold
this place is an ice- box at night
And killing winds
45
(') (he struggles to complete the sense of the ) " - to do all the outings that did"
As he loses track of what he's saying and then catches up, the canyon has become noticeably darker
He's oblivious
(') did want to say, on the logistical side of things,  have some American Express insurance that should cover costs of the recovery operation when that does happen
Bank account balances should take care of my credit-card debts
You'll have to sell my house, Mom and Dad
Possession- wise,  don't know if Sonja can use my computer and video camera
: He's interrupted by a sudden realization as he looks first one way up the canyon and then the other
He looks up at the sky above
: '
There's an angry looking black motherfucker of a cloud
: / : massive crack of noise like the land has split
His eyes staring up, unblinking, the corridor of light above him reflected in is contact lenses like mirrors
Suddenly a drop of water hits his eye like an invisible bomb dropping from the sky
: 46
We're many miles away, the dust spits as though hit by silent bullet tracer fire
Raindrops gathering and multiplying, soaking and bouncing off the desert floor, they skim and slip into a groove and then another, the slit instantly fills and water drops crash on the new surface
The spillage spreads and fills everything near it
We tilt up, the sky is furious black, and murderous
Lightning arcs across hundreds of miles
: Aron's sky darkens above him
Instantly plunging him into a dark, violet nether-light
He looks up the canyon as he pulls at his arm in panic and tries to gather his laid-out possessions into his backpack
Simultaneously he opens his mouth to gather any drops he can into his parched throat
: channel fills now as the grooves spill and multiply
The water poured from above appears everywhere, visibility is virtually gone, whether it's through mist or darkness it's impossible to tell
: Another channel explodes like a volcanic surging mass in every direction
The camera literally slips and slides as the water now seems to take a direction towards deeper gulleys, looking for something to fill, for somewhere to escape to
The floor of the desert becomes a river careering towards the slot canyons
: Now carrying debris with it the water cascades into the natural pipe-work of the desert
: 47
-
We see the  log from below as someone seems to pour unimaginable tons of water over the lips of the canyon above it
The walls glisten with force as the canyon becomes a 6FT wall of churning mud, hurtling towards the chockstones
The smaller ones are picked up and tossed downstream, smashing and breaking on the bigger ones
: We can see Aron in the distance pulling at his arm
Without time to watch it's journey towards him, it seems to skip time and hit him like a tsunami under-surging the initial push of water on the floor
: In an instant it smashes into his chest, scattering all of his possessions as he still tries to grab them
He pushes and pulls, trying to gain height but is underwater almost immediately
He tries to take a huge suck of air before he's submerged but even that is compromised by water
We hear him choke and he disappears into the liquid wall of mud
: We're with him underwater
He's trying to switch his light on
We can see almost nothing in this washing machine of churning slush and debris and malevolent water
The light flicks on
He can see his arm and the rock
Suddenly the water lifts the chockstone and his arm releases
He pulls it towards him, luminous deathly white in the mud, and flat, and too big
: We're close on Aron's face, at last free but now suffocating in darkness
: 48
:
Aron gasps and throws his night bag off his head and to the floor
He's sweating and gasping; thumped alert but
: : "   ": : the canyon is dry as Mars
He tries to control his breathing
Head down, sweat drips onto his arm - he licks it off and lifts his head - a sudden shiver - looks at his watch
: /
: The display changes from 20
29 => 20
30 : He can't believe so little time has passed
He's only just closed his eyes
It's going to be a long night
The two bottles stand looking at him
He goes back in the head bag and we go with him
: He holds the video camera at waist height and switches it to playback
He rewinds through his messages
Stops, switches off playback and rewinds the blue  screen to save battery
The light is surreal, soft  hell
: / : Battery time
Time rewinding, hurtling backwards

Stops
Plays back
: Megan and Kristi
The Cathedral
They clamber out in wet clothes - it's from after their first jumps
We see all three of them climb and fall and get out of the water and climb and fall, smashing into the azure water
Their faces are dripping wet, beaming mad, screaming and howling, completely natural, children really, on their first helter- skelter / Big Dipper
He rewinds this time in vision
Kristi's bra and pants are soaking
Megan's top cascades water as she rises out of the water
: For Aron the volume of his and their shouting is deafening and the first human sounds he has heard for days
He watches, staring, laughing; not laughing, staring, eyes tearing in self-pity
: /: There's water, joy, 2 beautiful girls, happiness, sensuality, company, freedom
: He looks at the picture and then into the bag
His breathing is hard, pronounced
He carefully tells himself
No
No
Don't
He sees the moisture on the inside of the bag, condensation
He licks it with his sticky tongue, twice, three times
He looks back at the  screen
: 50
The  looks back at him
: He kills the image and snaps it shut
: He emerges from the bag
21
05 and looks at the bottle
He takes the Camelbak and saying
See you later
swallows quickly 2 'spoons' of urine without disturbing the sediment
Tangy and bitter, the saltiness makes him wince
: '
We're in his truck again but this time over his shoulder and we can see the Scooby Doo Figure dancing in the distance
It's now lit up too, as night is falling, and we're coming at it from the other direction
As he gets to it he swerves and follows its guide to the party
: Jump cut, pulling up at the party
: Jump cut, inside it's nice, full of ordinary decent people, though no one acknowledges Aron as we stay attached to his shoulder
There's a mini-Scooby Doo dancing in the main room and there's a light, early party atmosphere
Aron searches for the girls, approaching any cluster to see which girls they contain
Rana is there but doesn't acknowledge him
51
There's no Megan or Kristi anywhere and we finally settle on the bar / drinks table where there is an ocean of all kinds of drink
And melting ice in huge buckets with bottles of beer floating around in them
And orange juice, and popsicles
And melon, and lemon and lime
And grapefruit and oranges for Margaritas are filling frosted glasses
During the ritual we
: Aron ducks out of his head-bag and shakes his water bottle
Something he always does - to check the sound of real water
To make sure he hasn't drunk it all without knowing
He opens, tilts and holds as always and then ritualistically removes his contact lenses and washes them in his mouth
Suddenly a shiver tears across him like an attack dog
He coughs a lens out and as he tries to catch it before it goes into the sand he tips the bottle in his lap
He hasn't put the top on fully
It goes horizontal on his shorts and a leak of the sacred fluid darkens his tan shorts
He whips it upright
(furious at himself) Fuck a nut, Aron
Pay fucking attention - look what you did
He stares at the stain - with all the dirt on his shorts it's already paste
He screws the lid on slowly and can barely be bothered to lift his lens into his mouth
: / : With difficulty he puts the murky lens back in his bloody eye
: The image shifts with the lens to night, everything short focus
Only one thing at a time clear, everything else diffuse
No idea where we are
We come over Aron's shoulder and he's clearly in the deep background of a vehicle
In front of him a half a dozen of his friends (boys and girls)
and Rana, excitedly chatting
Though we can hear nothing
52
Gradually it becomes clear it's night outside
They are all undressing in their seats until all are butt naked
The tone (we can't hear) is clearly more infantile than sexual
We're beginning to see there's a ferocious blizzard outside
And we appear to be badly exposed to it
Up a mountain, on the crest of a high road
Snow, hail, swirls savagely around all sides of the truck
We remain inside
It's warm, the heater blows
They prepare themselves for a mutual signal, press their window buttons
All the windows open and a  explodes inside the vehicle
: One shot outside - POVs naked arms out the windows shaking and saluting the storm
Their crazy, happy faces through the windscreen as the weather invades the vehicle
: Aron very still, listens to their screams
He looks at his knife dangling from his wrist by the shoelace
: Hundreds of miles of canyon - sunrise
The inner canyons change from dark umbers and black shadows to immense bands of pastel yellow, white, green and a hundred shades of red, a hallucinogenic movement towards light
`Good morning America
' etc
There's a chorus of 'Good Mornings' from American  & radio shows
Literally dozens of them from Texas to Oregon, Massachusetts to the Carolinas
: : "  ": : 53
Aron joins the morning chorus
Good morning everyone
It's 6:45 Tuesday morning in  Canyon
The weather is great
figure by now that Leona, my housemate - Hi Leona
- has missed me hopefully since  didn't show up last night
Another hour and a half they'll miss me for not showing up for work
Hi Brion at work
Best case scenario is they notify the police and after a 24 hour hold they file a report, a missing persons report
Which means noon tomorrow it's official that 'm gone
do still have the tiniest bit of water left
Well, actually, 've resorted
've had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that  saved in my Camelbak
sorta let it distill
it tastes like hell
So it's 70 hours since left on my bike from Horseshoe Trailhead during which time  have consumed 3 liters of water and a couple mouthfuls of piss
Pause
Did  say the weather is great
Well, it is
Though flash floods potential is still present
There's 4-prong major canyons upstream from me that all converge in this 3 foot wide gap where  am
The rock pulled down on top of me, it was put there by flood
Still, 'd get a drink
He shudders, it's ridiculous
Then composes himself during a long blink and looks straight at the camera
(') Mom, Dad,  really love you guys
wanted to take this time to say the times we've spent together have been awesome
haven't appreciated you in my own heart the way  know could
Mom,  love you
wish 'd returned all of your calls, ever
() 54
(') really have lived this last year
wish  had learned some lessons more astutely, more rapidly, than did
love you
'll always be with you
: Switches off the camera
He charges into setting up the 6:1 haul system again
Much quicker this time
He clears the rope - the rock - of his possessions and puts his sunglasses on
Ready for lift-off
He bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the haul line
It looks a better set up
(') Come on, move, dammit
Nothing
He stops
And stares directly at the knife below him
Absolute stillness
Nothing moves
Not him
Not even the insects
: The knife stares back
: Without warning he suddenly tourniquets his arm again
Twice around the fore arm, knotted twice and clipped with a carabiner that he twists 6 times
He secures the fix by attaching the purple webbing
Looks to his watch : /: 7:58AM
: 55
He folds open the knife, grasps it in his fist and picking a spot just above the rock's grip on his right wrist, he hesitates and then violently plunges the blade into his arm up to the hilt
He lets go leaving the knife embedded
He swoons and stares at it
He slowly grasps the tool more firmly and wriggles it slightly, the blade connects with something hard
He taps the knife down and feels it knocking on the radius of his upper forearm bone
He puts his ear close and we can hear the little thocking sound
Whoa, that's the bone
He pulls the knife out opening the wound more
There's barely any blood
He pokes at the gash with the tool
(') Ouch
He can see the epidermis, thick and leathery rough
Yellow fatty tissue under the skin in a membrane layer around the muscle
He thocks, thocks again and some blood finally seeps out and blocks his view
He pulls the knife out and thinks
He's sweating and puts the tool on top of the chockstone
He immediately pulls up his water bottle and stares into it
With a little shake he opens it and drinks it all gulping open throated
He shakes any last drop down and runs his tongue up into the neck
He screws the lid back on and loosens the tourniquet
There's no discernible increase in blood loss
He picks up the video again
: (') This next part may not be for all viewers at home
It's a little after eight
At precisely eight o'clock  took my last sip of clean water
and
hide your eyes, Mom
He pans across the boulder and zooms in on the wound, smattered with bright red blood
56
(') made an attempt - a short career in surgery, as it turned out - those knives are just not anywhere close to the task
've got about an inch-wide gash in my arm that goes about a half inch deep
cut down through the skin and the fatty tissue, and through some of the muscle
think  cut a tendon, but 'm not sure
'll never saw through the bones with this knife
tried, anyways
It really just didn't go well
The tourniquet is relaxed at this point
Which actually is a little bothersome, considering 'm not bleeding that bad, barely at all
It's so weird
You'd expect to definitely see more pulsing and bleeding, but oh well
'm really fucked now
'm out of water
: Stops the video and rips a section of his t-shirt to make an impromptu bandage to cover the wound
As he ties it with his teeth there's a rush of someone else's noise: the swat of wings
He grabs the camera just in time to catch the very end of the raven's flight 70 ft above his head
Shit missed it
8:31AM
He's late and  still missed it
We can hear his heart racing
He holds his left hand to it hoping to calm it down
: Like the beginning there are thousands of fans filling the screen, people everywhere, maybe holding lighters
And again like the beginning the screen splits into 2
57
: "
" : /
The rest of Tuesday and night, and Wednesday and night play out through the triptych
Repetition is used to create a trippy sense of losing coherence- sometimes there's 3 Arons doing the same thing
It could be consecutive days or he's forgotten
At key moments it resolves to one image and then back again
Things seem to loop and his close-ups almost seem to watch the loops happening again and again
This is particularly true inside the head bag at night
When his light is switched on it's bleached and monstrously overlit, like cruel  close- up - his disintegration is terrifying
When it's off we establish a night vision, of green, of blue, that allows us to witness him in hiding
The images, sometimes of himself also, play out on the interior surface of the bag
The effect is like wraparound Imax, multi-screen Technicolor
Aron has his headphones on Listening to the live concert again
The laser in the  The crowd smears, skips
dragged and distorted
It's been damaged by the time in The numbers skip on the the sand
display
As they stop
: Aron falls into the canyon

Beyond the foot 11

We don't canyon replayed in slower see above waist motion

Someone Aron lifts a carrying 2 huge huge rock onto office water his shoulder dispensers by and heaves it their necks walks to crash on into the canyon the chockstone He walks up to Aron It shatters And puts them down into dust
his side and leaves

rumbling thunderous sound grows and the inside of the bag begins to bear the image of the top of the canyon at dawn but crumpled like paper, creased like the bag [ 2 ]
The noise grows and grows

When it can get no louder Obscuring the light on a horse leaps the 6 ft gap his face once they've at the top of the canyon

: the raven beats its wings across the canyon
: We tilt down the wall (still reflected on inside of bag) to see Aron completing his obit
Scratched on wall of canyon: Aron Oct 75 =>  03
As we reverse back on Aron in the canyon there's a burst of light and color beyond him and on the sofa in the canyon a little boy sits
He's blond, about 3 and in a red polo shirt
He looks like Aron
Aron walks towards him, the sunlight hits his face like a train and Aron looks up to it but keeps moving towards the boy, walking downhill towards the sofa
The boy leaps off the sofa and comes running to Aron
62
He scoops the boy up with his left arm and balances him around his shoulders with his right handed stump
The boy holds Aron's arms in his little hands and they prance around the sofa, they giggle and shout playing bulls, giraffes, elephants, jousting knights, pretending to walk downhill behind the sofa
Like any father in any park
[ ,  ,    ]
Like any father in any park
Aron watches the image begin to fade
He switches on the light but its low and feeble
As the images on the inside of the bag fade so too does Aron's lamp
He tries to warm it up but it fades to black
He holds his breath
: It's strangely still even by the canyon's standards
He peeks out from his head bag; his contacts are cloudy and sore to blink
You can hear him blink
Eye socket rasping against eyeball
The head lolls like he's lost control of the neck muscles
His tongue rasps as he flexes his mouth to prevent sealing
: "   1st "
: He looks at his obituary on the wall
75 =>  03
Out of date
May Day
Not dead
He smirks
8:15 Waits for the raven
No sign : /
8:30
Nothing
63
8:45 No raven
: It's tough looking at him
So long without water
The dehydration is frightening
No raven today
Everything's fucked
Sonja
if you still want me to play at your wedding
there's a tape in a box in the basement of Mom and Dad's Lounge
It's me 1993 or 1994
We hear the music
Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Chopin - he can hear it as he played it until
(') There was a little boy,and he looked like my cousin Charlie but he was too young
And  don't want to die
But  really don't know what to do
Pause
Quietly, deadly: did this Aron
created this
The boulder did what it was here to do
It was waiting for me but it did the only natural thing it could do
chose to come here,  chose to do this descent by myself chose not to tell anyone where was going
chose to turn away from the women who were there to keep me from getting in this trouble
wanted it to be like this
Look how far  came to find this spot
It's not that 'm getting what deserve - 'm getting what wanted
He's empty now
He clicks the camera shut and puts it away
That's over
: 64
He looks at his 'good' hand
It's swollen and angry red like an inflated prosthetic on top and around of his real hand
He takes off his shoe and pulls the sock over his hand to cushion his palm and picks up the black rounded hammer rock again
Ignoring the pain he starts hammering at the rock surface
hate this rock
The rage blooms purple in his mind
(') hate it
His face swells with anger, nostrils flaring
(') hate this fucking canyon
small mushroom cloud of pulverized grit and dust erupts each time
(') hate this cold slab pressing me against this damp fucking wall
Smash, Smash, Smash
(') know there's water near coz of these fucking mosquitoes
The sock quickly disintegrates with friction as he hammers and hammers
(') hate this fucking mess
Finally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid around the rock
He pulls them off with his teeth and the stone drops to his feet
There's a thick layer of dust across the top of the stone and his right arm
He tries to blow it away
He fails
Tired, it's too thick and he's too dehydrated
He picks up his knife and using this starts sweeping the grit off his thumb
As he cleans up he accidentally rips away a thin piece of decayed flesh
It peels back a long way like a skin of boiled milk
The insects start to gather
(') Shit
65
He pokes the thumb with the stubbed point of the blade
On the second prod the blade punctures the epidermis like soft butter
There is a clear hiss as gases escape
The stench is death
He looks at the gangrene attached to him, poisoning him
(, ) (') Get rid of it Aron, it's dead, it's garbage
He drops to his haunches but the webbing stops him at his waist
He detaches it and drops down again, almost able to squat
His trapped arm is the only thing preventing that
His face is suddenly open
He pushes and pushes with his left hand under the boulder to create maximum downward force on his right arm
Hard, harder, It looks insane, unnatural and painful, but he says nothing
Like a gunshot in the canyon, the bone breaks
The sound ricochets
He rises and sees the bone pushing up violently against the skin
He feels it
It's a serrated, but clean, successful break
Still he says nothing
Now he humps his body up and over the chockstone, smearing his feet, one with a shoe, one without, against the wall, he pushes grabbing further and further round the dark side of the chockstone, pulling with a silent, furious intensity
Hard, then harder, and
second gun shot smashes around the canyon
He's sweating heavily and yet euphoric, possessed
He checks the underneath of the arm
It's broken too
Around the same place
He can rotate his forearm like a shaft inside a housing
Giving himself no time to wake up he grabs the knife, looks at the watch- : /:
10:32 : 66
He mutters
Ok Aron, here we go
You're in it now
He pushes the knife hard, to the hilt, in between 2 veins on his wrist
Fuck knows where the sweat is coming from but it's pouring out of him
Sawing downwards he makes as large a hole as he can without tearing any of the noodle like veins
He puts the knife in his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his right arm
Like a mechanic he looks to analyse and then he works by feel only
His sweat falls on his knife mixing with the blood
He pulls muscle nearer the surface allowing his knife to slice and pare away at a pinky 'finger-sized' fragment bit by bit
It takes a dozen actions, each time the knife goes back to his teeth
Sort
Pinch
Rotate
Slice
There's not a lot of blood
But he keeps working and working
Once the blood increases he puts the knife down on top of the rock and swiftly ties his tourniquet
He's silent, refusing to verbalize the pain
: /:
10
53 : He can't cut the tendon, no matter how hard he slices
But nothing will stop his addiction to surgery now
He folds in and swaps the blade for the pliers
He uses them to bite into an edge of the yellowy tendon
Then squeezing and twisting he tears away a fragment
Grip
Squeeze
Twist
Tear
67
Finally he finishes the tendon
: /:
11:16 : He returns to the knife
Finally all that remains inside is a pale white strand
Like swollen angel hair pasta
The nerve
He touches it with the knife edge
He explodes internally with vocal pain, through gritted teeth
The first time he has made any sound during the surgery
But it's like he's been taser-ed, he's stunned still for a minute : /:
11:17 : He looks at it
the nerve
: and the thin, swollen wire of his own nerve looks back at him
For the final time, he asks himself, `Can you do this
' : He puts the knife in and pulls it toward him, an inch, two inches, it lengthens like pulling a guitar string
Unimaginable pain builds in his whole body, like he's pushing his arm into a cauldron of magma
68
(It's difficult to tell because everything is so tight and claustrophobic but maybe the boy is there intermittently riding his shoulders slipping across and around him, or obstructed by the boulder and stopped from getting to Aron) until it breaks
He shudders in shock and drops everything for minutes
His head lolls forward dripping
His mind swarming with trauma
And then he's back on the last action stretching the skin of his outer wrist tight and sawing the blade into the wall
It's a piece of gristle on a cutting board
Everything now is forcing us towards the boulder, cramping us in with him impossibly close, he's sweating and heaving, his vision blurring with tears, his contacts failing, his breath impossibly dry and rasping and then, as simply as this all began, his shoulders open and he's free
He staggers back, one, two, three steps away from his arm
His head swarming with colours, swooning, overpowering
He stares at his obituary as he's born again
His feet stagger under him like a new foal, an involuntary dance, we see colours bleeding and blending in his
s and the colours invade our shots of him
(spitting out this declaration at the rock) : /:
11
34 am : He's busy packaging his stump in the plastic grocery sack and then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore as a chocker to keep his neck warm in the night
He stuffs the repackaged arm into the empty Camelbak backpack and throws the straps over his neck to hold the arm in a makeshift sling
Packs his bag, water reservoir, full bottle of shiny urine, video, pocket knife
Grabs his climbing rope, messy and knotted from its use as insulation, and heads off down the canyon
Stops almost immediately and hesitates for a beat
He returns 69
to take 2 photos on his still camera of the rock and his hand
Goodbye
: And now the motion and energy and life force of the action movie returns
It's like Ray Liotta's final day in Goodfellas; relentless, frustrating, pressure of life again now he's free from his tomb
Deeper and deeper, down and down into the swirling scoops of the sandstone
Couple of difficult manoeuvres, lots of slipping and bumping, despite his best effort occasionally his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops, winces and grunts thru the pain
But on he goes, 100 ft of the rope trailing behind him
As we follow its progress snaking after him we see specs of blood on the lower walls
The canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep in which he ignores the shrinking daylight above because he has another target; the twists and turns of the curricles of sedimented sandstone lead to a soft glow, red, translucent, growing and growing in intensity
He pushes forward, the tail of rope whipping faster and faster along the walls and floor
: /
Finally, we burst into the dazzling midday sun on a rock shelf halfway up a sheer walled amphitheatre, 200ft high
The scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking, the dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his dry eyes
He sees, for the first time in his new life, green
The deep green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and he knows
He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and he knows
Now he can look down
Right to the edge of vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow turgid water
Life itself
He wanted it to be there and now he's mesmerized by it
pair of swifts leave the tree and zig zag up and around him
He wobbles and has to stop himself lunging head first over the precipice
Instead he drops to the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign land
Unravelling the rope of its knots, he's baking in blazing 70
light
He can't go yet, every knot must be undone pulled open between his teeth and his hand
But he'll die if he can't have moisture
He tips the saved urine over himself and licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and listens
He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip
The rope is uncoiling over the ledge
He put it down to drink
Picking up speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left
He lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time
That was his future disappearing over the ledge
: We're far below - 6 storeys - and see him inch over the edge
Something's not right
It's a difficult overhang and he's awkward and vulnerable with only one useful arm
His bad arm catches horribly on the lip of the ledge
Suddenly he starts coming fast, faster and then hideously, much too fast, accelerating out of control and smashing into the water with deadly force
: We're underneath, deep in the pool, and he crashes in an explosive cascade of air forced into the water
: /:
His feet gently touch the sandy floor, 10ft to the side of the pool
: he's a great climber and even in his present condition has perfectly executed the descent
And the pool is a puddle, swimming with dead leaves and insects, 2 inches deep at most
He falls on it with his bottles, filling them and dipping his mouth into the water, He washes his head, drinks and fills, drinks and gargles, and drinks again-insects, leaves, tadpoles, everything
Blood splashes in beside him so out comes his map again as he plots his way out
He sees a great goose- necked avenue before him bending to the right
71
Checking the map
there's a long way to go and he's small, nothing in this landscape
: ()
He walks shedding any weight that might reduce how long he can keep going; his equipment, carabiners, headphones; his harness left like a spent snake skin behind him
He keeps to the shadows of the huge Monument Valley-like cliffs when he can
: Finally, he comes to the great gallery that we saw in the opening titles
300ft huge wall with dozens of broad shouldered figures painted to enormous scale in all shades of tan and maroon
They seem to stare back at him
He salutes them in his own way and continues
He banks left beneath a colossal alcove high up in the cliff face and makes to the flattest ground - there's no shade to hide in here
: 70 yards ahead, 3 aliens are walking away from him
2 tall, one shorter
All with elongated bodies and tiny heads, shimmering in the heat
He goes to shout but his voice catches
Then a feeble effort is lost in the vast scale of the canyon
The figures walk on bending and disappearing in the light
He digs deep
And the figures turn
There's a terrible pause of uncertainty on both sides and then he pushes out another heartbreaking - (') The figures begin to run towards him
We watch his face in close up as they come
If tears come, then now they come at the sight of humans
He mutters to himself
72
(') Hang in there Aron
At they get closer he summons a surge of energy from somewhere
(') My name is Aron Ralston
was trapped by a boulder on Saturday and 've been without food and water for 5 days
cut my arm off this morning to get free and 've lost a lot of blood
need medical attention
There's a pause as they look at this refugee from a low budget horror movie
He hungrily eyes the water bottles attached to their waist bands
This gives them a way in to his world
The moment is broken by their offering him their water
It pours down his throat bypassing the swallow mechanism
: (Erik's English is almost perfect, although accented and without humour
His family sit beside him on comfortable chairs in a  studio
They are very pleased to ) We are the Mejers from Holland
At the start of the trailhead we talked to a ranger who told us about a car that was parked in the area already for several days and that the owner might be missing in the canyon
We joked that we would keep our eyes open and that we would try to find him
After a hike of 5
3 kilometres to the Great Gallery (Indian rock art) where we took some pictures, we returned and suddenly heard a noise behind us, and after that a voice that cried "Help,  need help"
Monique and  immediately realized that this had to be the missing person
() 73
(') We didn't find him, he found us
We gave him our water and Oreos
: Back now live as Aron wolfs down the cookies and organises the Mejers in a series of jump cuts pushing us through the final stages-he's brutally practical
We are the Mejers from Holland
You should stop and rest
No, we need to keep hiking
We need a helicopter - who can run fastest
- You, go now fast
Take him
Monique runs ahead with Andy, her son
They told us you were here
Who
Who told you
The police at the parking lot Do you have a phone
There's no signal for miles
Nobody for 6 days and then like London buses another couple appears
They too are confronted by: Do you have a cell phone
No
'm Wayne
have some medical training
Is it ok for me to drink so much water
74
Sure so long as it doesn't make you vomit
Aron drinks more and more, he overhears
(') ( ) Make sure he doesn't pass out
gotta stop and empty my shoes
You'll have to tie my shoe lace
As he sits his head slumps forward
He's absolutely motionless
Wayne and Erik try to talk to him but he can barely hear them
pop song spins round and round distantly
He strains to pull his head up, and, staring, drops forward to his knees
There it is
Filling his vision like a god
Whirling screaming in front of him, dust blasting him as he kneels
: strange slightly formal man pops out of the helicopter
He almost looks like he's part of the Matrix
Are you Aron
Yes  am
Can  get a lift
: Aron looks at the beautiful white leather seat before he gets in the back of the helicopter
Surreal
It's a startling contrast to his Frankenstein, and even now it's not lost on him
'm gonna make a terrible mess of your seat
Just get in buddy
We're all looking for you
The helicopter sucks upwards into the sky leaving Wayne, Monique, Andy and Erik far below
75
_____________________________________________________________ 1000 : Underwater
figure dives in, pulling strong breast strokes down and towards us
Its Aron, fully recovered after surgery
Eyes open, he pulls and pulls down through crystal clear, oxygenated water
: /
As the helicopter and gurney staff transfer him into the medic room he's surrounded by vertical giants as he lies horizontal for the first time in 6 days
Thank you for bringing me back
The most senior of the burly men says, That's all your miracle days used up kid
You need to rest
You can stand everyone a beer later
Aron is greeted by medics
Needles
Care
Machines
Tubes
Will you look after this for me please
He opens his fist and there is the small folded up knife
: He pulls again releasing a huge chunk of air into a metallic bubble
: 76
very soft voice reading
() his love, the peace that passeth all understanding
Mom
My boy
My only one
There you are
She strokes his head so gently
Hey Mom
How are you feeling
Are you okay
You've been asleep for 2 days
We are so lucky
She's a decent woman and a devoted mum
She looks weary, worn out with worry and love for her boy
Mom, 'm sorry  scared you
Very soft voice (again) - Aron hears the same words as he drifts back into drugged rest
() his love, the peace that passeth all understanding
: Face underwater
Pull and kick
Wanting oxygen now
: (all of this without ) Flash of celebrity
His first press conference
And boy, is there a lot of press there
77
Aron, of course has his camera with him as he walks out and takes a snap of the noise and light
We see his still, it's floor to ceiling, wall to wall journalists
: We can see him beneath, swimming along the floor of the pool, like a diver building lung capacity
: The vast crowd again, floodlit, ready to begin their evening
: '
In Aron's 4 x 4 somewhere in the endless parking lot outside the stadium
Rana is wearing glasses, reading an  she's just received
- he's got 3 vegetarian hotdogs and the tickets and he'll be outside Gate 6 in 5
So are you guys ok with me
Yeah
We split up a while back when you were in hospital
Christine told me
(always to the point) Is that what this is about
Yeah
She laughs at him
What about the climbing
Aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking prosthetic arm / axe
He clinks the points together
She doesn't laugh, maybe a smile
78
(') Solo
'm gonna finish the 49ers this winter or next
(to change it) Well, all  can't figure out is what took you so long to cut it off and get one of these
They both laugh
But he also answers
Rana, before  did it  was hallucinating,  saw this child, a little blond boy - (over her glasses) Not Jesus please
No, he looked like my cousin Charlie but way too young
and didn't know why but  knew he was mine and that this was what lay in front of me
He looks at her
Pause
She doesn't say anything
(') But it's not going to be you, is it
No Aron, it's not
( ) Rana leans over and tenderly kisses his cheek
You know, everyone who cares for you, a little bit of them dies each time you go back
Before he can work out how to answer she breaks the door open
79
(') Let's go hero
If they do The Fly first and we miss it we'll never be forgiven
The concert explode into life
: `  man will rise,  man will fall
His face pushing for the surface
He surges up and out of the water, to cling by his elbows on the side of the pool
No prosthetic
: From the sheer face of love Like a fly from a wall' : There in front of him on the grass by the pool is the same sofa as in the canyon
On it and around it, his friends and family, including Rana
There's so many of them they fill the screen
Tucked deep into the sofa, is his son giggling away
They smile, simple, silent support for him
He looks right back at them
