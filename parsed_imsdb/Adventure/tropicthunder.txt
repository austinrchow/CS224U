The chopper skims the treetops heading toward a hot

As the
chopper tries to land, the gunner tosses a couple of grenades behind the Americans, sending about ten flying
But the bulk of the platoon is getting by the enemy
heavy set grunt, , looking like he is in great pain, is'running full speed for the chopper, taking fire from all over
Fats looks a 'lot like  , star of
"Doody For Dinner"
, an
18 year-old cherry from Brooklyn, is also on the move, towards the
chopper
Clutching his thick black glasses, and a
map, and triangulating coordinates, he' is frantically trying to call in an air strike on his radio backpack
ten feet away knocking him on his ass
He gets up, shaken, just in time to be
through the stomach by a

He, is a 'bad muthaf

That's for Brooklyn, Muthafucka
Underneath the hovering chopper, ,a black, buffed out Rambo-looking Sergeant, is letting loose his -16 with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower
It does
Fats grabs
the mortally wounded Brooklyn and slings him over his shoulder, Brooklyn's shirt is blown open revealing his entrails
in shock, he clutches his liver in his right hand, and is trying futilely to put it back in his body
Tropic Thunder 5
heaves Brooklyn onto the floor of the still-airborne chopper just as it gets low enough, and returns to firing
He unleashes a hailstorm of lead at the approaching

He pushes it up into Motown's neck

Tropic Thunder 6
Motown looks to Fats,:then reluctantly jumps on the chopper
It begins to hover

We     dramatically as he raises his head
Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked finger
It's him
It's Four Leaf
Everyone turns to-see
, who looks a lot like from the "Scorcher" trailer,
burst through the treeline, half limping, half crawling heroically through the massive firefight in
He is being chased
by about- _VIET
Everyone on board seems mesmerized
Osiris sees it, and can't believe his eyes
nevertheless, he screams to the pilot Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of strength,    , holds it with-all-his might, preventing it from flying away
The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm, providing weak cover for Four Leaf
The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about ten feet-off-the ground
He is, about to lose his battle with the helicopter
Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is fighting a losing battle to gain ground
He doesn't even have a gun
Tropic Thunder 7
Osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men, then at Fats
a flash of anger and compassion comes over his face
", Christ-like and arms extended, sinks to his knees, his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of lead
' Weak smiles flicker across the face of the men as they do just that
unleashing lead all around Osiris as he jumps out of the chopper like an Apache warrior
Fats drops off the runner of the chopper, shooting his machine gun in cool
Screaming a war cry, Osiris makes a beeline for Four Leaf
Dancing between the raindrops, he dodges tracer fire
Osiris finally makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf, cradling his head
Four Leaf's eyes are glassy, and his body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll
Get outta here
'm worm food, man, you dig
(beginning to cry) What, and give up all that California pussy you been talking about
Shiiit
Someone's gotta show me around
(cracking a bloody smile) Shit
the only way you're gonna get a piece of  pussy if is you go out to the graveyard and dig some up
Osiris looks down at Four Leaf's now missing arms
Well
y
you better come along and bring the shovel
He starts to choke up
Tropic Thunder 8
'm scared,
Sarge
'Scared  ain't never gonna see another sunset

at Four

There's nothing to hold

nothin' in this life, and it's kinda late to start b e i' a somethin' now

we are actually on location shooting this war scene with about 50 watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film equipment
Four Leaf, actually the superstar
playing him, Speedman, is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and
more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry
The actor playing Osiris,  , is also getting uncomfortable holding Speedman's not-crying head

(,        ' , now he is   and speaks with an American accent--
) The person perhaps most upset about it all is the skinny' young British director,
Coiled at the monitor and covered in bug bites and sunblock, wet towels around his neck, and clearly not made for jungle life
he' mouths the words "you are my brothers
'
" as if trying to will the tears from Speedman's dry eyes
(breaking character) 'm sorry, can we cut, Damien
Damien grips his headphones in confusion, looking around to his cadre of assistants and ADs
The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to fight, except a few are starting to wonder what's going on
We gotta cut, Dorf
() What
What did he say
(to 1st ) Play it through
Still rolling
Now the extras have stopped fighting -- except for a few way far back
1ST Play it through
Still rolling

Not still rolling

Damien runs towards Speedman
Fats, who is young fat comedy gross-out star , gets up from the ground, rubbing his butt

Get down Kevin, you're dead
Sandusky immediately complies, he seems to be the only actor listening to the director
'm sorry
can't do it, Dorff
Damien runs up to Speedman
They are the center of attention -- the whole crew watching them
It's good, keep going
This is a big shot so keep going, let it come
No arms, you're hanging on, it's-al-1-coming out
It's real, death, life, brotherhood and we just
let's keep it going now
He starts to back out, turning his finger in the "still rolling" motion
He gives a thumbs up to the

He is surrounded by a throng of local who all hold various types of buttons, and detonators
He punches buttons, and surveys the chaos, trying to figure out what's going on

The assistant doesn't appear to,understand English
He shrugs
Frustrated, Cody rips out an earpiece
'IYd "' Damien has his hands full with Speedman
(above the din of the ) Dorf
Seriously,  think we should cut
mean, Should Osiris be crying too
Maybe he shouldn't cry if 'm crying
Lazarus abruptly drops Speedman from his arms and gets up, shaking his head
'm sorry, so, just keep crying or are'we cutting
No, no, it's good
Portnoy is walking around massaging his butt
Damien,  think  broke my ass
Is it possible to break your ass
Get back in character Portnoy
Still rolling everyone
(to Lazarus) Great crying Kirk -- stay with that
Chris Michael, don't worry about where Kirk is at, just be Four Leaf crying right here and now and still rolling

Four Leaf wouldn't say that
Yes, well-you see, Four Leaf was there and he did say that
So
Right
So let's just go
Is he here, or is he-'at the
hotel
Because  would love to run it by him

Bitches, too
His phone rings again

What's up
Naw, nothing -- same soup, just re-heated, you know
Redykulous wanders off in another direction
The  is now yelling into Damien's ear

The chopper only has so much gas

Plenty of gas right here, -man

am trying to have a conversation here
Okay, fine

Damien throws his headphones off in frustration
and throws up his hands
Cody, sees Damien throw up his hands

There's the signal
Let's light this puppy up
Let's go freaking 11  here
i Cody and his assistants push plungers, buttons, pull levers, and drag metal wands over long lines of wired nails, they spark and fizz

climaxing with joy as he barks commands and pushes ever more buttons

Cody lands on his back, in pain, which he seems to like

Damien's mouth hangs open in shock
There is a strange quiet on the set

The cameraman turns to the  and then back to Damien, looking a bit scared
Sorry, Damien

1ST (to Damien) 'm gonna have to call it, Damien
Damien is silent, stunned
1ST (into megaphone) Okay, that's a wrap for'today
If you are injured, please find the set medic
Speedman, looking as if he had nothing to do with what just happened, walks toward Damien
think  got another in me if you want to go again, Damien
Damien looks at the scorched treeline behind them
Speedman looks too, then looks back at Damien
Your call
In the background, Cody is casually putting out a fire on his lap
He gives an ''m

We are here with an
exclusive, the first look behind the scenes at what Hollywood insiders are calling the most expensive war movie ever produced
It's called "Tropic Thunder", and first time Director Damien Dorfman has assembled an all-star cast to play the forgotten grunts who perished near here more than 35 years ago
() Tropic Thunder 16
(cont'd) Heading up the ensemble, the highest grossing action star of all time, Chris Michael Speedman
d , But the last few films have-not "blown up" for Speedntan as he's struggled to broaden his range as an
-actor
First, an attempt to change gears with a comedy
-   "   " Speedman'and Martin Lawrence, both with guns, are holding up a bank -- Speedman in drag
They yell at each other in that uptight-white-guy/loose-cannon-black-guy action comedy style
(:
) The disappointing "   ", was followed
with last year's failed venture into serious dramatic territory
-   " " - :Speedman,
innoveralls and with a bad haircut, dressed as a farm hand
He holds a pony_by the reins as he "talks" to it by rubbing his nose on the pony's neck

) "Simple Jack", the story-of a mentally impaired farm hand who can "talk" to animals was a box office disaster that many critics called one of the worst movies of all time
(as Simple Jack) You mu-mu-muhhh make me'ha-aaaapy
Tropic Thunder 17
-- (to camera) But now, the question is can Speedman "mu- mu-make" audiences happy in the true life story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in "Tropic Thunder"
And,' possibly a shot az 1

-- Julie sits with Speedman
With them is the real , a stoic, grizzled man of few words
(very serious) All  want is to make the real Four Leaf here proud
It's his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book
That's why we're here
But really,  mean, how cah we begin to understand what he-- what you --went through
Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for a beat
He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only two
Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying to "get inside" him as much as possible
() When  lost these
(holds his hooks up) It was as if  saw through these for the first time
'
(indicates his eyes) And it was only then that  really began to use these
(indicates his ears) That's great
He's like a
Buddha or something
Maybe  should rub his belly for luck
He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it funny
,Tropic Thunder 18
(to Speedman) Like for a lucky Oscar nod this time
Maybe you should rub Kirk Lazarus's belly

) British documentary director Damien Dorfman has never made a theatrical movie before, but his mission, he says, is to bring a reality to the film that he feels is missing from most Hollywood epics

Quite literally
Are you intimidated about working with actors for the first time
Intimidated

But the good news for Damien Dorfman and his troops -- the Oscar buzz is already starting
So for El News 'm Julie-- All of a sudden Portnoy, wearing a Tropic Thunder cap all askew and surfer shorts with no shirt, bursts out of the bushes

You can't do that Todd
Yes we can
The dailies are not good
Dailies are always bad
Bad dailies, good movie
Isn't that what they say
never heard that saying
Look, Damien
Fact: You're
three weeks behind and you've been shooting for five days
Fact: we greenlit this project at a very specific number, a number Walter and could get in bed
with, and fact--
,

(starting to lose it) Todd, it really isn't necessary for you to,keep saying "fact" before everything
It's kind of implied, that if you are saying
it-- Alright
'm just
trying to keep the emotion out of it, so  thought  would say
"fact" before each fact, so it would be less-upsetting -- Ok, Damien, this is Walter, 'm just gonna jump in
and bad-cop
it here for a second
Dude,  mean, 46,000 dollars for Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's miscellaneous living expenses
It sounds like the inmates are running the asylum
Well, yes, that's exactly-it,
Walter if- you actually came out here you would see that

Hey, Dorf
Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way
know today was rough, and you're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that's the way these movies go
We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of those days
Happens
(sickly sweet) Yes it does
It does
Though  do think you have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi-- Tropic Thunder 24
Oh, also needed to let you know, and
know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but  really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening
This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings
And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing
4I ' Right
well those things
those
4, 4, things
'm dealing with bigger issues right now Chris -- Yeah, of course,  just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes
He sees the caller
Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec,
He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the hooks
Rick

It's insane

We see Pedk is holding a Vanity Fair with an ad on the back: it is a picture of Speedman looking earnest, holding two baby
The caption reads: "
" The credibility factor that the pandas give you is priceless, and strangely, if' you see this picture, what really strikes me is the credibility that you give them

Yeah
Thanks
You sad
What's wrong
No 'm fine
've just been having a tough time over here
They still havn't got the TiVo hooked up and
don't know
Lazarus is getting all this Oscar buzz already -- Is that what this is about
Crazy Kirk Lazarus goes and places his entire body in some experimental Malaysian dipping sauce so he can actually be black, of course he's gonna get buzz
Listen to what  am telling you
He is clinically mentally not right
Yeah but the way they talk about him mean, he played a retarded guy and won an Oscar,  play a retarded guy and don't even get a nomination
don't know, mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my "Elf" but with Oscars
Those were your exact words
Tropic Thunder 26
don't believe those were my exact words but let's get beyond that to the root of this
Remember the moment you chose to do, this', and  wanted you to do the robot thing with Wolfgang Petersen
And said stay home be happy and you said "no, Rick  need to play a real human being" and  said "okay" and then  said "are you sure
" and you said that you needed this-for your soul
Yes but -- Which  totally respected and now you're doing the crazy surfer three
sixty move on me,
which  love by the-way-- but-you said fuck it,  gotta do it for my soul And-that's why  hate you
Because you were
And you're in
the Phuc Long fucking Delta,
in the real mud, with- leeches in your hair, 20,000 mil es from Fatburger
being an actor-And,  would wager, forcing everyone around you to rise to your level
Am  right
mean you are over there forcing a bunch of actors to gel, straighten up and
become a platoon
And it hurts
Am right
Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this Yeah
You are right
Alright, that's what
thought
Now get to work genius soldier
'll handle the TiVo
Peck hangs up abruptly
Speedman punches the button on his cordless and puts
it down

You there
Hello
Finally, after a few moments of listening to this, Damien explodes
He throws the phone on the ground and jumps up and down on it
He notices the crew staring at him
He tries to look as if that just didn't happen
He opens the sliding glass, and heads straight to the door
He continues walking through his office, out into the main offices
He motions for his assistant to join him

think-- But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug connection
They both watch him go
Hey, Mr
Dorfman,  was hoping to find you
know this is a party, but this afternoon after work  was breaking down my -16, and  have to say, in the night watch scene, a minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it
() You actually care, don't you
Oh, yeah
Of course
This is a huge opportunity
To be working with all these great actors, and you
You're the only one who auditioned
You're the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky
Yeah,  know
It was kind of weird
Wasn't the point that we were all supposed to bond
() Yes, that was the point
Damien, grabs a drink from a passing tray, and downs it
We follow   as he passes Speedman with a tray of food
Speedman, ungracefully and with his hook hands, grabs a spring roll off the tray
He resumes talking to who is deeply uninterested
r Tropic Thunder 30
guess  just watched some retarded people
mean,  spent a lot
of time
with them
watching them
Watching all the retarded stuff they did
Huh,  always found mere observation a little rudimentary
Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt
Diagram the source of the pain
Then live it
(trying
to keep up) Exactly
With Jack
was, for the first time in-my life
(searches for the word) Retarded
was retarded
in
the trailer, retarded at home
, Brushing my
teeth retarded
In a `weird way  had to unlearn what it was to be retarded
Yeah
but Simple Jack thought he was smart
Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded
So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor
Tricky tricky stuff
Hats off for going
there
Especially
knowing how the Academy is about that shit
Speedman is lost: About what
(with 'a chuckle) Are you serious
Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded
How do you mean
Lazarus sets his
drink down
School's in session
Check it out
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man
Looked retarded
Acted retarded retarded
He could count toothpicks, cheat at cards
Autistic
Sure retarded

Forest Gump

(cont'd) Retarded
Maybe
Had braces on his legs, he charmed the pants bff Nixon, and won a ping-pong competition
Peter Sellers, "Being There", infantile
Yes
Retarded
No
He claps a hand on Speedman's shoulder
You went full retard, man
You never go 14 full retard
Don't believe me
Ask Sean Penn, 2001,  am Sam
Went full retard
Went home empty handed
Speedman sees this for the truth it is
How could he be so stupid
(cruelly, driving it home) But hey, man
Who knows
Four Leaf could be your ticket to Oscar gold
'd lose the hook hands though
cripples don't give the Academy wood either
() Oh
Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass and heading for the bar
Speedman stands hurt, delicately holding the spring,roll in his hook
, Damien paces the party
He looks more miserable and high strung than ever
He discovers Redykulous, surrounded by his posse and a
Redykulous
need to talk to you
What up, money
(in a hushed tone, aware of the cameras) We're having a cast meeting, right now We need to come together as a unit -- The camera crew moves in for the close-up
making Damien uncomfortable
Redykulous takes it in stride
Throughout the scene he is   someone
Tropic Thunder 32
Uh-huh
Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch style camera move
i Do you mind if we step away for a moment
From what
Damien tries to indicate the crew
(whispering even lower now) From the
uh
you know
this area
: Oh,  see
sure They take a few steps away from the bar
The entire camera crew follows
Oh
Hah
No,  mean away from the cameras
you understand
Away from (indicating the crew) them
No
What
No
can't do that
If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my people don't get to see the real Redykulous
The show is called "Utterly Redykulous"
Well this is about work
my show so to
speak
Do you understand
guess
But not really
Your show and my show are the same thing
This is gonna help your show, trust me
() Tropic Thunder 33
(cont'd) My show  the soundtrack drops the same time "Tropic Thunder opens
So you get that crossover audience everybody wants on your opening weekend, which will dictate your revenue streams all the way through  release, pay per view, etcetera
Damien thinks this over for a second
It does sort of make sense
He then notices the chmera crew pushing in k  , 1 '144% for a close up He awkwardly tries to get away from them
Excuse me, everyone
If  could have your attention
Nothing
No one notices except Speedman
Damien grabs a couple bottles off the bar and  them together
Sorry to break up the party, but  just wanted to call your attention to a cast meeting tonight
Big meeting
Future of the film depends on it
() Not to mention my entire bloody life
Damien in a final cry of frustration,  a bottle on the bar
He succeeds only in cutting his hand
Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's shoulder
He steps to the fore
(slowly, deliberately) "When
we
'
put
aside
our
differences
we see we're kind of the same
" Within moments, the place settles completely
(Long beat
-then almost quietly
) "When we put aside our differences, we see we're kind of the same
Let's be friends,  know we will do great things together
" (beat, then more upbeat) () Tropic Thunder 34
(,cont'd) That's a quote from my children's book, "The Boy Everybody-Was Jealous Of
" know it's just a book for
kids, but think it applies to
making a movie as well
'Course
know a lot of the reason things are maybe messed up is
The guys look at each other -- maybe he's not so bad
was looking-at it all backwards
You guys are lost
You heed
me to
lead you, to help you gel, and straighten
up -- like a
long beat
(drunk out of his mind) Hey,
Speedman
That bullshit pep'talk made me
-h-h-h-h-happy
The entire party cuts
up
in loud hysterics
Speedman looks hurt
The  puts on-a Redykulous track really loud, and the, place gets even crazier
- Damien, drunk, walks along, illuminated by the light of the moon
He holds' a bottle of wine, which
he chugs
In the distance, the party rages

Damien turns around
, startled
is standing eerily in the bushes by the sand
You don't know which way is up, do you private`
You couldn't find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showin' you the way
Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant
Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes
Damien's eyes widen in fear

There's a place
About a hundred clicks from here, as the crow flies
Deep in the jungle
No trailers, no port-a-potties
Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons
Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his weirdness
Tropic Thunder 36
And
Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of
Hamburger Hill
You
get them thinking they're getting shot at, and you'll have your movie
Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten
He holds out a small squished mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis
You must put them
under your thumb the way this
bug is under mine
under control
see
yes
They would 'be under my total control
finally
could shoot the whole movie there

Away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers

yes
Put them in the real shit
Film them with real fear in their eyes
,  , Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look as    and
: - skimming the treetops, illuminated by a lonely moon
Tropic Thunder 37
Cody is piloting
Damien and Four Leaf are in the back sitting, across from Speedman, Portnoy, Redyk and Lazarus and Sandusky
We move across the faces of the actors, all in brainbuckets, who all look confusted and unhappy, except for Sandusky who seems excited
Speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his agent Rick Peck
() So, uh, any idea how long we'll be gone
Because  left most of my
vitamins back at the hotel
The other actors chime in with similar concerns, regarding sleeping arrangements, make up facilities, etc
' Save your breath, maggots
They all shrink back
Four Leaf's fierce posture is undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien sprawling onto hire
That'saright
Maggots
- The chopper lands in a small clearing as the sun rises behind a mountain
Damien and Four Leaf, in  mode, hustle the "grunts" off the chopper
Apparently they are not moving fast enough -- Four Leaf and Damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the ground
Tropic Thunder 38
The group, scared shitless, start falling out of the doors of the chopper, more like a bunch of oysters than a crack platoon
Four leaf jumps on the skid of thy chopper and motions to Cody, who lifts off
It kicksi12up a violent backwash, 0, Iq y forcing the guys to duck
and cover
See you in hell
As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts
trying to orient itself in their new surroundings
' The Jungle
Black, dense, unforgiving
All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that has been over for thirty years
grave marker,
half of an old rusted outa'downed chopper
All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who seems very upset
This is bullshit
Damien marches over to him, and    in the face
(clutching his cheeks) ' ,
'
Silence
Everyone hands over their phones
Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his
satellite phone out of the gift bag
He surreptitiously stows it down the front of his pants

Tropic Thunder 39
" ao Damien dumps them in a pile and finds a large boulder smashes the phones with a draatic flair
The guys
Damien turns on them with a crazy gleam in his eye
Okay, girls
now that  have your attention,  will tell you fuckfaces what we're doing here
You are no longer actors in a movie
You,are grunts in a war
These men around you are your brothers
The guys look at each other, unhappy
Congratulations
You've just landed in "the shit"
Your objective is to head north and liberate the village at 'ang Kwook Hill, at which point "Four Leaf" gets himself captured, at which point you rescue him, at which point we will chopper you home
We will also be rigging this entire valley of death with hidden cameras so that every glorious moment gets on film
And believe me it be glorious
If it looks real, chances are good it probably is
You wanted to be actors
You wanted to occupy the skin of another human being
Get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified
Infantry grunt, surrounded by death, crawling up Satan's arsehole
There's going to be enemy fire
Booby traps
Your own personal little slice of the 'Nam
The group shares a look -- "What's going on
" He pulls out a laminated packet
(to Spe
dman) "Four Leaf", since you're the Captain here, here's the scene list and the map
(he throws them at him) Think you can handle it
From now on, Whatever we get on film is our movie, period
Damien pulls out a walkie-talkie
Tropic Thunder 40
is your only link to, the real world
It will be used only in an emergency or to replenish our supplies if absolutely necessary
This is  a cell phone
This radio goes'to the chopper, and the chopper
The chopper is , and am Jesus Christ his
You will' depend on and pray 'to
And nobody i12ii12i12 i n ' i12IMdi124 gets home until we get the shots
(loud and confident) Now
let's'put the greatest war movie ever in the can
With that, Damien marches toward the treeline and'steps on a dormant   left sleeping for decades
, ' The group stands absolutely stock still for several long beats until
Whoa
-- group of about    , well armed and scary looking,,
notice the sound of the explosion
They begin talking very seriously in a foreign language
One of them grabs a radio: () (crackling over walkie talkie), They lock and load, heading towards the actors
-- Four Leaf scans the horizon while
Cody sets up high-tech equipment, including monitors and cameras and detonation devices
Tropic Thunder 41
So, 'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives us the go ahead, we'i12ust their cherry with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha till they come running right at, us, then a good of fashioned firefight, maintaining our distance
Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle, looking almost lost
been meaning to tell ya the whole shoot
'm probably one-a your biggest fans
Your book was kinda my "Catcher in the Rye"
It inspired me to become a gyro man
Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic stare
'm actually sort of a war nut
mean never was in the service, but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of my way of paying tribute to the real deal
And you sir, are the real deal
Nothing
Hey,  was wonderin' what kind of sidearm you carry
Looks to me like a-- (very scary) don't know what it's called
just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life
Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio
Ok, we're ready to rock and roll
(to walkie-talkie) Damien, come in
Cameras are up, ordinance are up
Ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say so
11 Tropic Thunder 42
- are close on the seemingly broken
walkie talkie,
which has heard none of this
We   to reveal the guys, staring at Damien's corpse in total shock
All except Speedman, who looks on with a smirk
think he's like
dead
: (with a chuckle) Nice, very nice, Dorf
Very nice, wherever you're hiding
don't think he's hiding
think he just died
Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse
pulls a wrist into frame
He doesn't
have a pulse
or a head
He then grabs a bent and rusty
piece of metal
Must've been one of those Claymore mines
This old Jungle must
be full of them
, You bet your ass it is
That's why a percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are helpin' solve the problem
Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle
Speedman busts up laughing
They turn to him -- what the hell
Speedman throws an-arm
around Sandusky, -like an indulgent older brother
'mon
Don't you get it
This is what Dorf was talking about -- our slice of the Nam
He's trying to get in our heads
Tropic Thunder 43
-- They are right behind the treeline, watching the guys from about thirty feet
That whole "life and death" speech in the chopper
He's meshing 'with us
What do you think all that "playing God" was about
The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief -- except Lazarus
Are you nuts, shithead
The dude is dead
Sandusky looks unsure
He doesn't want to take sides
Kirk
know you're the big fancy actor here, but, no offense, 've done a lot mote effects driven event films, and think  can spot a prop body
The  guerilla signals for all his guys to hold their fire and pick their targets
Suddenly, The walkie-talkie lying on Damien's body crackles to life: ( ) --  repeat, we are now go for mission
-- The walkie crackles unintelligibly
Speedman picks it up, showing it to the guys
See
() Alright, can we start the scene now
Or do you need a formal invitation
(checking the list) Scene 12A, ext

Ambush
Tropic Thunder 44
Speedman closes his eyes, taking a second to get into character
He opens them, and grabs
his gun and creeps towards the bushes, stealthily
(as Four Leaf) got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats
The group remains motionless
, Speedman gives Portnoy a , in "c'mon
" type look
Portnoy doesn't know what he means
said,  got a baaad feeling on this one, Brooklyn
Oh
He's acting
Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking
stealthily around
with him, on high
alert
for Charlie
Swinging his gun unpredictably
They are a mere ten or fifteen feet from Sandusky on the other side of the
trees
they back off as
he waves his gun
' (-as Brooklyn) Me too, cap'n
() Hey, cap
: If
told you something, something kinda personal, you wouldn't think  was crazy, right
Naw, man
know you ain't crazy Brooklyn
Well,
if  told you that ,  never actually, well, been with a girl
you wouldn't, like, think  was, like, queer or nothin'
would you
Naw, man
wouldn't think you was a queer
, Tropic Thunder 45
" ao Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too: (acting really "black guy" ) Sh
sh
shit
When  get back to the world, 'm gonna find me the finest piece of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it till  broke its back
The last "mugambo" you ever tasted was in your momma's soup bowl
wouldn't mind slurpin' on a little of that -- That's enough outta you Fats
Don't you worry, Brooklyn
You gotta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and  for one ain't gonna let Charlie
Lazarus can't handle it anymore
What the  is wrong with you people
Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back
He addresses the treeline
Sorry Damien
Back to one
action
(he gets back in character) Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta -- Yo, asshole
Mothafucka just
Speedman sighs, annoyed
How many more takes you wanna wreck
Some of us are taking this seriously
Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode
But instead he becomes eerily calm
He begins an impressive transformation -- Everything except for his skin color returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick
(Heavy Irish) Jaysus
There isn't going to be any movie, ya gobshite
() Tropic Thunder 46
(cont'd) Damien is dead, Speedman
Yes,_the show must go on, but this is feckin' madness
(re: Lazarus transformation) i Wow
That was really cool
Are watching this, poised to attack
Speedman and Lazarus argue, more heated now
Excuse me Kirk,  think you dropped something
He mimes picking something , off, the ground
It's called your character
Don't worry, won't tell the Academy
Suddenly:
The Guerrillas have seized the moment
The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for Speedman,
who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and debris kicks up all around him
You happy now
We're out of position for the effect
Am  the only one who read the script
This is the ambush
tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere
think they're really shooting at us
What are you guys worried about
These guys are pros
The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got hurt
The actors stay down, looking scared
Come on, you guys
Let's use this
Tropic Thunder 47
No one follows Speedman's lead
, Fine, he'll go it alone
Speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone, and doing a very good job of it, going through an assortment of absurd action style maneuvers throughout
Redykulous looks around, and then decides to get up and join him
Sandusky and Portnoy look at each other -- what the heck -- and follow
They all fire at the unseen enemy, letting out very convincing
Not knowing it's only blanks, and awed by the power of the actors' automatic weapons, and the intensity of their screams, they drop back
The guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up RPGs
- Four Leaf looks out into the jungle below, he can hear the firefight, but, Cody can't
Hear that
Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives
What
still can't get Damien on the radio
bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again
What do you say we get a little
pro-active
Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger
Still fighting, oblivious that the guerillas are about to blow them to kingdom come with RPGs
But before the guerillas have a chance-- t' Tropic Thunder 48
He pushes down the plunger
Dirt flies, the guerillas don't know what the hell is going on =- except that someone is suddenly bombing the shit out of them
They beat a hasty retreat
Cody and Four Leaf watch Cody's handiwork with binoculars
smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle
Right on
bet Damien heard that
Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring straight at 10   with their submachine guns pointed straight at them
Oh shit
Oh yeah
And with that Cody and Four Leaf are
out of consciousness
-- Speedman motions for everyone to "cease fire"
() Aaaaand
Jesus
Alright
That's the trailer 'right there
That was some sick shit
wasn't even thinking bout the camera
The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all around
Lazarus is not happy
He looks off into the jungle, sensing that someone was out there
Tropic Thunder 49
' So what do we do now
Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it
Damien said to head north
'm guessing they've got more of these "battles" and Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way
(into it) Alright, let's hump-our shit to 'ang Kwook
Let's didi double time
We got a lot of clicks to cover
Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of jungle
After a beat, he reappears, looking a little lost
Uh
Sir, isn't it that way
Kevin points in the other direction
Speedman glances down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up now
Oh yeah
Thanks, uh
(can't believe it) Kevin
Kevin Sandusky
Right
Okay, To 'ang Kwook
Lets do-it- to-it
Everyone follows Speedman
Lazarus, very reluctantly, brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle - It is a large, secret heroin processing facility, surrounded by barbed wire fencing
It is in a clearing in the jungle, by a small river
There's a   overlooking a main gate, which leads into a big open courtyard area
The main structure is a low, concrete military-looking building
It's all populated with tough-looking, well-armed badasses
Tropic Thunder 50
, both hog-tied and unconscious, are marched through the courtyard, and into a building
- We are behind the back of the person who is in charge
In front of him, we see workers busily manufacturing tar heroin, in a sweatshop like atmosphere
cadre of guerilla fighters domes in, sweaty and tired
The Lieutenant steps to the fore -- this is
He's badly shaken
The Unseen Leader shakes
his head
-- The actors are slogging along, through a tall thicket of bamboo
They look exhausted -- except for Speedman, who always manages to look like
a
movie star
So
we're just supposed to keep walking
We'll see some action soon enough
And try to stay in character
We're on camera
What do you mean "soon"
, Tropic Thunder 51
Whenever Damien decides it's time, guess
When's that
don't know
That's the whole point
Damien wants us tired and confused
Yeah, well 'm definitely qualifying for those objectives
Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break
Lazarus notices the mutinous vibe and smiles
Fine, fine
Okay, let's take a break, but be on the lookout for anything
Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break or not
Speedman plunks down and opens the map
He seems puzzled
Lazarus eyes him suspiciously
Sandusky walks off to take a leak
Lazarus then watches him go
Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee
He hears something rustle next to him
(
) Psst
Hey
Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close to him
Speedman is watching
don't have much time
don't really need to piss need to talk to you
You went to the boot camp Sandusky, right
You can read that map
Yeah
Good, good
Speedman is a tosser
That hoor's melt really thinks this is a movie
And he's got the lot of ya convinced
Tropic Thunder 52
You saying you don'tithink they're filming us
Of course not
It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us
That muppet's going to get us all killed
need to convince everyone
to turn around, but
can't do it without the map
You're the only one who can read it
Can  count on you
Well, yeah,
guess
But Good man, Good man
Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing, shaking, etc
, and heads back to the group
Speedman eyes Lazarus
What is he up to
Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee again
He hears another rustle
He turns
to see Speedman, right next to him
'm gonna level with you, bro
don't need to pee
need to talk to you
Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create a red pee
stream
Lazarus is insane
He's freaking out, and
he's gonna
ruin the whole movie for all of us
The men respect you, because you went to boot camp and rehearsal
(patting his shoulder) And you're pretty handy with that map need you on my side, Kyle
Kevin
Tropic Thunder 53
- If you stick with the program, 'm gonna talk to some of the Dreamworks brass
there'll probably be a Teen Choice award in it for you
You have that potential
Well,  -- Good man
Good man
Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look
-  - The guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown path
Speedman machetes through the overgrowth
If we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now
At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating from Portnoy
Buck up,, Fats
we got a long road ahead of us
() No
its just that  don't feel so hot
left my medication at the hotel
(to himself, snickering) Yeah, 'd like to check out some of those "meds" for my own self
Lazarus moves up to Speedman
Look, ya eejit,  mean, if there was a village don't you think we would have hit it by now
Quit your carping, we're right where we're supposed to be
Tropic Thunder 54
All of a sudden Speedman disappears out of frame
We see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a (laughing) Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that map
pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map
Yes
There is
Its just a little more' down to the
lefty-down part from the: village
(checking the scene list) Anyway,
this feels like the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act
don't see a "Sampan" boat
Any second now one should come by
Alright men, into the water
Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water
They all hold their rifles above their heads
- -et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we
We need to quit faffin' about and turn
around
And
Lazarus grabs Sandusky
Sandusky agrees
with me
Don't you, Sandusky
Kevin is caught, not sure what to d Wait
First of all
Now Speedman grabs him
Kelvin believes in this movie
And, second, need  remind you,
am your superior officer
,
Tropic Thunder 55
PAo No, yer an actor
Arid if memory serves, a pretty shite one
The actors react -- Damn
Oh Snap
Shit
Speedman steels' himself
'
That's our only chance
Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until they send help
Or maybe try to get back to the hotel
Help from where
Need  remind you that Damien's orders were to -- (right at Lazarus) --stay in character
(to the guys) Now,  already have an international box office presence, but for some of you, 'm guessing you might not want to screw this movie up
This actually seems to affect the actors
Lazarus can't believe it
okay
'mon, boys
This way
Let's go get those Viet Congs
Lazarus throws down his gun
He's had it
Jay-sus Fuck
It's Viet Cona
Not Viet Congs
Viet Cong, you plunker
And, hey, if you're so sure of yourself, why don't you let Kelvin have a look at the map
Kevin doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't want to get in the middle of this
Speedman continues to be the tough guy
Be my guest
Speedman hands over the soggy map
Kevin looks
After a long beat
Tropic Thunder 56
We've been going the wrong way
'We were supposed to be doing this: Sandusky traces his finger along the correct route -- a clearly marked, northward arrow
instead, we did this
i  i121d Iv
11M% Sandusky draws a line due East --
into a
section of the
map clearly marked with scary skull and cross-bone type 14 % warnings
(holding his stomach) Oh, man, this is not' cool, this is not cool at all
Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky
can't believe you people
You're pussing out on me
We are supposed to be a unit
No one is "pussing out
" They just prefer not
to die
out here
Sandusky, can you get'us back to the landing zone without the map
It might be tricky, but maybe
Okay, which is it, gentlemen
Playin' war with Mister Box Office
Or staying alive
Unbelievable
Are you guys really gonna abandon this movie
long tense
beat -- finally, Sandusky walks towards Lazarus
Everyone follows him
Speedman looks stunned
After a moment, he shakes his head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle with both hands over his head
,
Tropic Thunder 57
So that's the way it,,is, huh
Fine
'll finish the movie alone
(turns to Lazarus, under his ) And when  give my acceptance speech, 'll be sure to thank you, Lazarus, for staying out of that scene
And come Oscar night, we'll see who feels a little "full retard"
He reaches the other side of the river
Chris, You have no idea where you're going
Yeah,  do
(consulting the scene list) 'm going to "' "
And,  can shoot it alone
They'watch him trudge into the foliage
U2' "   " comes up as the men watch Speedman disappear
--   -- We slowly push in on a lone figure silhouetted against the purple sky, trudging along the top of a trail to nowhere
Speedman walks through the scary jungle, exhausted
He is tired, lonely and hungry
The jungle is making all sorts of terrifying noises
Finally he stops and regards the treeline
What's the deal with a meal break
Are they gonna chopper stuff in later on
don't wanna be a prima donna or anything, but, we gotta eat, right
() Damien
- 'Tropic Thunder 58
Clearly no answer
He trudges a bit further finally 'plunking down
by the trunk of a huge tree
, He empties his pack, within which is the gift bag
from his
agent
He 'surveys his wares: An i-pod
Nano, an In Style magazine, a neck pillow, Cherry Chapstick, a, tonight--show baseball hat, some packets of equal, and an unopened "
'
-, Our Guys, led by Lazarus, are humping through a dense section of jungle
Portnoy is beginning to make all sorts of pained and horrible noises
Uhhh
() Ohhhhh-Maaaaaaannn
'm cold
It's -
- (after a beat) Ohhh
Is'anybody
It's like a sweat lodge out here
Make a note gentlemen,
unwittingly, Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art
(to Portnoy) new frontier for you, Funny Man
When this is all over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience
Portnoy looks a little hurt
You know what
think  actually liked you better when you were a nigga
You know, Redykulous',  respect what it is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking -- invented by the Irish  might add
() Tropic Thunder 59
(cont'd) Yet you ooze this hostility towards me
Why do you think that-is
"Why"
dunno
maybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy
Oh
see
Put another way -- you're mad because  can act "black" better than you can
Take it easy guys
(to Sandusky) You better rein in 'black like me' over here, before  put a foot in his white ass
Niggaz always got to be niggaz
This is truly over the line
Redykulous lunges at Lazarus
They fight
Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw
Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart
Okay
That's enough
Jesus Christ
It's not enough we have people shooting at us
Now we have to kill each other
Let's pull it together
This place is full of land mines
Or doesn't anyone's sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel
That shut them up
Sandusky is right
we could all learn a little from his common sense approach
From now on we walk Indian style, footstep upon footstep
Sandusky
you take first position
He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and pushes him out front
Sandusky gives him a look
Tropic Thunder 60
Your bravery shames us
Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for land mines with the branch
The guys follow at a safe distance
-   l u ,  nhy Speedman's face
After a beat
a drop of water hits him in the
forehead
Then another
to reveal a pathetic shelter made
out of headphone
wire, and the In Style magazine
' The drip-is now becoming full on
He clutches an Equal packet and
the Cherry Chapstick
Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh
He then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents into his hand,
and takes
a lick, savoring every granule
He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him rodent
Food
Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and begins to stalk his prey
Now another movement behind
the bush, and a flash of
fur
Stealthily, he moves towards it
With cat like quickness, and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush,    is heard
: , ,  ,
Speedman is slashed,  has got him in a choke hold
He reels around screaming
and stabbing wildly, brutally pummeling his attacker
He is
covered in blood, but looks ecstatic
Die
Die, you son of a bitch
Die
Speedman deals a death blow
And unleashes a primal Spent, he finally gets a good look at his victim: small, cute, cuddly
Speedman looks horrified
,i ,Tropic Thunder 61
" 1 on a    from ' He stumbles back against a tree
Suddenly we hear an odd
He jumps, and - frantically jams his hands in his pants it is the forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back when
--    " " Speedman answers
--
-- Rick is on a Pilates machine in is office with a working him out
got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu's ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly to your bedroom
But the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper

Alone
Alright
Listen to me
want
you to
get your hands on some-bleach, some hydrogen peroxide and some lime
Your gonna wanna cut the body in quarters
the femurs are gonna be a bitch
that's normal
Speedman'nods eagerly, absorbing it all, not noticing a Suddenly, he'is being choked
-He drops the phone, gasping for
air
(
) Chris
Breathe
It's gonna be ok
'm calling that publicist right now, the one Lo hired when she was'hammered and killed that kid with her Jetski
guerilla shoots the phone
They quickly tie Speedman
up and whisk him'off into the jungle
-- Speedman is being led through the courtyard in:shackles
He looks up to the guard towers
There are security cameras everywhere
In Speedman''s mind, movie cameras
He nods, into it
(under his breath) Alright
camp
Scene 67
Bring it on Dorf
' Cody is just coming to
Four Leaf is already at the slatted window, watching
Where are we
Tropic Thunder 63
In a detention hut
And they got Speedman
'
-- guard shoves Speedman hard with a rifle butt
Speedman over "acts" the pain
Cody gets up, starting to freak out What
Why
We gotta get outta here
Are they gonna kill us
Four Leaf turns on him, grabbing him with one of his hooks
Pull it together private
Shut your trap before you get us killed
You understand me , lilydick
Cody backs off, still scared
-- Speedman is in a windowless hut, his feet and hands tied to a chair
There are security cameras in the corners of the room, which Speedman continually plays to
Byong stands across from him, watching him calmly
What were you doing in our poppy fields
() Poppy fields
Who sent you here
("") Corporal Four Leaf Tayback
Serial number 694529987
'Tropic Thunder 64
() Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing
a little easier
You bastard
What
just thought you might like
some
Corporal Four Leaf Tayback
And oh
yeah
is from my uncle
He   Byong in the face,
sending him reeling into the back wall
Beat
(under his breath) You
ok
You leaned into it, man
orry
: -- pissed off Byong and a couple of guards throw Speedman into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge of-a marsh
He looks around, impressed with the production design
He looks up,
sees another security camera observing him
He turns it on
May God protect you from the mighty arm of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end
My men will seek you out and mete
out a cruel justice
- Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused
: -- Looking up we see a circle of faces
Our guys, looking down on something awful
that thing is: Tropic Thunder 65
, delirious and groaningt think he's dead
wet fart seeps out of Portnoy
No
Just smells like hens dead
Smelled 44M like that all night
What's wrong with him
() Nothing
Probably just the beginning stages of some
kinda
jungle fever
More bad noises
If we can work out some rig to carry mi12 think it might subside in a little bit
No one touches him
Alright
Sandusky
Sandusky looks up at him
Is he serious
What
You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy
God help you
He marches off
God help me
God help him that bitch ever find his blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world
Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up Portnoy on a make shift stretcher
Tropic Thunder 66
Our guys are humping, with Fats in the makeshift stretcher
They look exhausted
As they crest
the ridge, Redykulous spots something
'' ,  n n4i12N11 Look
From behind, Sandusky grabs him and forces him to the ground
Everybody down
The guys hit the dirt
Lazarus crawls up to join them
He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene
It is the Flaming Dragon compound
" Fook me
knew it
- Knew what
"
-- "
Oranges and Lemons,,, the bells of St
Clements
Speedman was right
We 'are shooting the movie
Sandusky grabs the binoculars and starts'looking
(to himself), How could  be so stupid
don't think so
looks to me like some sort of heroin processing plant
Look at the cooking vats, and the guards
Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars
Tropic Thunder 67
How do you know all,this
It was a long trip
read the in-flight magazine
We're in the Golden Triangle, the biggest drug producer in the world
Uh-oh
It is , who is being dipped in and out of the water in his bamboo cage, while a bunch of guards stand around and laugh
Whenever he comes up for air, he is : 1 (into the water, then out) CUT1
' What do you see
It doesn't look good
Lazarus grabs the binoculars
Sweet Mother of Jaysus
Suddenly:
have spotted them and are running at them, firing automatic weapons
The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the hill
Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his stretcher for dear life
In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill
when suddenly
He falls into a
stops and turns around and runs back to him, heroically pulling him out
Tropic Thunder 68
There is more fire coming all around
He gives up, reverses tactics, and starts , trying to
11 Ow
Fuck Dude
What the fuck
He screams in pain
Finally,
He disappears into the'hole
whistles for the guys to join him, and they all pile into the hole
, Totally black
they huddle, trying to muffle their heavy breathing
The guerillas all frantically look around for the guys
No sign of them
One of them signals for them to keep moving
Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area
Sandusky lights a match
Portnoy is weeping in pain
Must be one of those underground tunnels
The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them
Je-f-f must have found one of the entrances,:
Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering
My ass
think  took one in the ass
Lemme see
Sandusky rolls him
over, and off camera, helps him remove his pants
All the guys recoil in horror
How did it get infected so fast
More ad libs of disgust
Tropic Thunder 69
' Okay Jeff
This is gonna hurt like hell, but  have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is, and if  can dig it out
Take a breath
Redykulous, hold his hand
Beat
Sandusky puts his hand off camera
Hey Dude
What are you doing
Cut it out
That's not the bullet hole
The bullet hole is over here
It dawns on the guys that they have  been looking at the bullet hole
Ad-libs of even  disgust
my bad
You just got grazed
You're gonna be fine
-- Speedman is exhausted, slumped in his cage
He is covered in a few leeches
Byong appears with his usual cadre of guards
He nods, and they grab Speedman, and drag him out of the cage
- Byong leads Speedman to the center of the courtyard falls over the soldiers
They begin to part, as someone very important is arriving
Finally, the unseen leader emerges
He is a  , no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer
He smokes a cigar
This is
He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down
Then, in a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off, revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a rat
He holds a stick
() Uhhh
don't think  got the new pages
Tropic Thunder 70
, Tran points across the courtyard where
"4 Iv
InM y Cody looks scared out
of his mind
Speedman takes this in
Traci nods, and   start to    out of Cody and Four Leaf
Then Tran gets out his own stick and starts to
No
Puh-Puh-pulease don't h-h-h-hurt them Tran cocks his head curiously
He stops beating him
He signals
for the guards to stop beating the others
long beat
Say that
again
, Please don't hurt them No
like you did before
Silence
He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils
Puh-puh-puhlease don't h-h-hurt them
hush falls over the crowd
Tran'seyes widen
(louder, to the crowd) Tropic Thunder 71
1 '  -- Speedman is now seated in a comfortable, ornate chair, though his feet and hands are still bound
Tran and Byong and a few cohorts, stand across from him, whispering
' Nyam nook snep jawk
Please
Excuse me, What are you saying
Nyam nook snep Jawk
(almost shyly) You are Simple Jack
What
You
You saw Simple Jack
We love the tale of this man, Simple Jack
Tran snaps his fingers, and an assistant shows Speedman a battered
Speedman looks lovingly at it
We do not have many luxury here
Simple Jack is the only movie we possess
We have watched it many, many times
How is the word
Genius
Speedman smiles big
They smile back at him
It's a small world after all
(broken English) You should have got Oscar
Thanks
mean even just the nomination
You were nominated
Tropic Thunder 72
No,  mean it is great to
be nominated,
if you are, or that's what  hear
Whatever
It's a popularity contest
It's totally political, you have to lobby for like a year for it
ilia i n nMd () My apologies for almost
beating you to death before
No problem
So are you going to let me go
No
We will hold
you,for ransom
--
much more money now
He pulls out a cell phone
Is it possible to
have picture
Oh, sure, absolutely
Speedman tries to throw an arm around Tran, a guard grabs the arm
, and twists it back
Speedman shrieks in pain
You mustn't touch me
The guard snaps the picture
That came out really good
-- The entire camp is assembled
Guards lead Speedman onto a platform; behind Tran
The people  some more
Tran turns to Speedman
Tropic Thunder 73
Now, do the movie
Excuse me
Do the movie
The whole movie
Yes
Begin
Hey,  know you're big fans and that's -- Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt
Speedman crumples to the ground
The crowd cheers
Tran stands over him, screaming into his face: ,
DIE11
- 1 Speedman gets up, begins a scared, unenthusiastic : Aww, puh-puh-Pa
Whu-why you guh-got to muh-muh-make ffffffun of me
More stupid
Awww, puh-puh-paaaa
Tran turns to one of his men Get him some overalls
And give him the Simple Jack haircut

-- Sand}asky slowly lifts his head out, surveying the territory
It looks clear
He drops back down
-- The actors look miserable
Portnoy-looks
like his face is going to fall off It looks clear, but  can't be sure say we stay in here till it's dark
can't believe this is how it ends for Redykulous
'm a triple platinum recording artist
, Shit
(shivering and wheezing) gotta get back to the hotel
'm not gonna make
it
Forget it
That guard patrol knows we're out'here
They'll be looking for us
Anyway, Speedman's in that compound
And no one else knows but us
That's right
So here's the plan
Everyone leans forward expectantly
We sneak out of here, make our way back to the hotel and once we're safe, we alert the government of Speedman's situation
Sounds good
Whoa whoa whoa
wait
So, we're just gonna leave him here
Tropic Thunder 75
Yeah, and  don't wanna spend another minute getting the full on smell'o vision in this hole with his stinky ass
Everyone agrees
They start packing up
Sandusky looks horrified
Au II4 Look,  don't think 've met a more wildly self involved human than Speedman, but you're just gonna leave him here mean, come on
He's a person, guys
These drug lords are killers
mean, they eat their enemies
We leave him alone now, he doesn't have a chance in hell
, That tosser is in there because of his own stupidity
As far as 'm concerned, he brought it on himself
Besides, how could we possibly rescue him
Get real, Sandusky, we don't know what the fuck we doing out here
We've gotten this far
Look, we're making a movie about one of the greatest rescues ever
It's a true story,, right
mean, those guys weren't superheroes
They were just put in extra-ordinary circumstances, and they rose to the occasion
Yeah, but they were trained soldiers
They knew how to take care of themselves
And we don't
They believed they could do it
They believed in each other
Look, 'm not saying it's gonna be easy
() mean, some of us might not come back
You mean, like, not on the same flight
Sandusky just looks at them
They know that is not what he meant
Tropic Thunder 76
Jeff --  know this is really hard for you,
abut you're gonna have to kick some time, and it might as well be now
(he turns to Lazarus) Kirk, 've always admired you as an actor
But as a person,  have to say, not that impressive
' You got a
few Oscars
Got any balls
Lazarus takes this in
Redyk
Whadda
you say
You talk a good game, but how's it gonna feel when you're sipping Cristalle with your homies
in the hot tub back in
Cali knowing you left
a man to die back here
You gonna rhyme about that
, There is a long beat
Shit
only wish they was filming this for my show
'm in
He looks to LazaruS
,Lazarus takes a long dramatic pause
Then
(with resolve) We could fooster about for donkey's years
Let:'s quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller
The guys look at each other
What did that mean
'm in
: -   -- Peck squeezes a stressball as his comes in
Chris Michael is on the line
Tropic Thunder 77
(he hits a button) Chris
What is this craziness
(
0
) Hi, Rick
It's Chris-- - Byong presses pause on a tape recorder he's holding up to Chris's satellite phone
Tran watches, very serious
(
) Chris
Yes, that was Chris
But you will not speak with him again
And do not bother trying to trace this call
What's going on
Who is this
We are Flaming Dragon
Speedman is with us now
There is a long silence as Rick processes this
Then he nods slowly
Oh
Really
Well  never heard of your little agency
But if you wanna poach my client
Lemme tell you something
His career's been in a death spiral since Simple Jack, so why don't you all go fuck yourselves
Oh, and  bet he hasn't even told you about the whole panda thing
He killed a panda
And next time you're at a cocktail party with Paris Hilton, or at Kate Mantellini's choking down some egg whites with Ron Howard, ' , because chances are,
Rick slams the phone down
Tropic Thunder 78
-' Byon,g stares at the phone, amazed
He looks to Tran
() -- Up on the
hill
, our guys
are back up top, watching Speedman through binoculars
-- Speedman is acting like Simple Jack, with his new bad haircut
,He is performing for a small group, of chuckling
GUARpS
-- Jaysus
We're too late
They brained him
grabs the binoculars
Sees for himself
He's right, man, that ain't right
Messin' with a man's brain
We gotta get him outta there
--  -- The guys have set up a camp, with
a small fire
Everyone watches as Sandusky diagrams a plan in the dirt
' Here's us
Here's the compound
Here's where Speedman was
It looks like they move him at night, cause he's not here now
Unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place is
() Tropic Thunder 79
(cont'd) But Speedman does
If we can get in there, and find him, maybe he can help us sneak him out
(sweating and in pain) got an idea
Everyone turns to Portnoy
11  0 6 III4" It might be a little crazy, but
Crazy is better than nothin'
What is it
(intermittent pain noises) Back in '98,  did a low budget titty comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp"
Anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls' camp
So we did it by building a catapult
They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down
The guys all look at each other
then finally: That's the stupidest idea 've ever heard
Yeah
Sorry Portnoy
That's lame
say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence
Take our chances
You guys ok with that
The group nods in approval
Good
Then let's get some rest
Me and Redyk are on first watch
(to Lazarus) 'll wake you in two hours, and we'll switch
They break up
Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely freaked out
Tropic Thunder 80
'm not gonna make it
Yes you are
Then you gotta tie me up
'm serious
Tie me to a tree
No matter how much scream, or however much- plead, you
must not untie me
will be cunning,  will be in pain, and Iwill lie
The devil works this way
will say, do, and excrete many regrettable things
But
no matter what
you must leave me alone
Beat
Okay
Lazarus, you heard him
Tie him up
We'll get you through it
-- Speedman has now been moved back to the cage
He is doing a "late show" for a crowd of toothless old women bodyguard plays a supporting female role, he wears a mop for a wig
(heav-i-l-y-accented Eng-l-is-h) Jack
could never go -to the county ho- down with you
would be laughed out of town
And what would Chet say
The bodyguards laugh woodenly at Speedman
-b-b-b-but  am a -g-g-ggggoood Dd-d-d- d-dancer
Speedman bows, exhausted and exhilarated
The old women politely applaud
new group forms in front of his cage
Speedman stands
He sighs, and begins the movie over again
Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty sssssssunrise, uh-uh-uh-uh-ain't it

Go do your chores, slowpoke
'   -- Cody and Four Leaf watch through the slat in their window

Looks like they coo- coo nested him
() So what's the plan
What plan
To get us out of here
Come on man, yoi4 lived this, you gotta have an idea of how we can get out of here
Right
Four Leaf looks a little at a loss
(trying to be stoic) Sometimes the flowing stream can only move when
the water
dries up
No offense, but what the hell does that mean
It means 'm,sick of your yappin'
Come on man, you heard him back there
They wanna off us
We gotta escape
You -- Four Leaf suddenly puts his hook hand right up to Cody's neck
Cody instinctively blocks it with his hand
gotta what
Take on the whole compound by myself
Stop it man
You're chokin' me
Tropic Thunder 82
Cody tries to push him away
They get into a wrestling match, hand to hook
Cody is pushing against Four Leaf
then four Leaf tries to pull away
But Cody holds on to his hooks
he holds on until Revealing
Who the hell are you
Four Leaf looks down, sheepishly

tied to a tree, looking miserable and fidgety
We    to

Sandusky smokes a cigarette
It's quiet except for the hum of cicadas, and
the odd jungle noise
Wow
look at all those stars
Makes a guy feel pretty small
Yup
Back in , we don't get stars like this

(
) Ohhhh
jeeesssusss

then:) When  think of the nights, alone in my penthouse, when 've longed for the gentle touch of another dude, to feel his skin against mine, or his sweet breath on my face

(

Sanitation Detail at the United States Pentagon
So you were some two bit criminal who got caught and sentenced to clean toilets at the Pentagon
God-dammit, would you
was a fuckup, sure, but one day as  was cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big- wig,  came across a file headed for the shredder marked top secret
It was Four Leaf Tayback's file
nobody
No family
Nothing
Killed in Action
They were gonna bury the whole thing
Total black op
So you decided to take his identity
gave him one
wrote the story And  gave the American people a hero
Yes,  am not technically Four Leaf, but if  didn't pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he was
See what 'm sayin'
Tropic Thunder 88
And you cashed in
was a fuck up my whole life
This guy had a story worth-telling, and nobody woulda ever known
Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost
'm sorry, man
'm responsible: for this whole mess

the tree, looking like shit
But realizes something-that makes him ecstatic: 'm clean
'
He struggles to his feet, doing a celebratory dance
He immediately gets nauseous again and heaves

His Hot Assistant comes in

' Shandra, get tech support to put a trace on this email attachment, let's find out where this "Flaming Dragon" agency is
Call the travel department
See if they got a nonstop to Bien-Ben-Wherever-the fuck-it-is
-- as the guerillas ready for an attack
-- - The guys are suiting up for combat
They apply burnt cork to their faces for camouflage
This is it
You know what you need to do
' Tropic Thunder on three, two, one
They make their way down the hill

The coast looks clear and they each scamper over
Finally, it's ' turn
He's clearly too heavy
The fence groans under'his weight
He launches himself -- and
Slams painfully into the razor wire of the fence

They raise their weapons and listen
They see nothing in the pre-dawn darkness
The actors run to the wall and clumsily pull down, just in time
Everyone's inside the perimeter
they quickly make their way along the fence line to the entrance of the main building, ducking away to avoid a

Sandusky makes a series of hand gestures, indicating for them to'split up and search for Speedman

The guys all shrug, not understanding
Sandusky repeats the hand gestures
Finally he has to speak
i 1, 11 11^i12% 4I4 (in a loud whisper, also signalling what
he's saying) '
, nci 16, , give the signal
We follow , working his wayldown a hall
He peaks around a half opened door
turns on his flashlight to reveal he is in fact in
Wall to wall packets, ready,for shipment
is paralyzed
He spots a box with the words "For
, 100% pure, dilute before ingesting"
His mouth  waters, and'a drop
of
spittle oozes from his bottom lip
He doesn't know what to do
He gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box
marked "pure"
It's like holding two grenades
Sandusky moves silently toward a door
He kicks it'open to reveal
Shackled to the floor
Delirious, he sits bolt upright
You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy
Oh sweet Jesus
Hold tight, Buddy
'll be right back
Sandusky runs off to get the guys
Tropic Thunder 93
" 1 Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of his eyes, signalling that he's got "eyes",on Speedman
They take a step in that direction
Redykulous stops them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for "Where is Portnoy
", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy
No one knbws what he is doing
() Where is Portnoy
Shhh
muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be emanates from a nearby door
They run towards it
Redykulous kicks it in
The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags, crying
What are you doing, man
Come on, let's go
We found Speedmani don't care
It doesn't matter what do
'll always be a screw-up
No one will ever respect me
That's not true
Listen, back in the day,  used to think  couldn't produce a record simply because
he's gay
Uh-oh
That's not what Redykulous was about to say
Beat
Actually  was going to say poor
Sorry
Tropic Thunder 94
Listen
Don't be crazy Portnoy --you're not a fuck up
You'make millions of people laugh
You said my farts made them laugh
Leave me
, That ain't true Portnoy
Lotta people be fartin' and not be gettin' 20 large a pop for it
hear the noises inside, head
in to check it out
The guys hear the guards enter the far side of the room
They can't see the guys through the
shelves packed with heroin packets
Damnit
We need to go
No,  can't do it
(-l-ooking-in the-pac-ket ) need it
need it
This'is all deserve
Come on, man
And
the guards emerge
around a corner
They jab their rifles
at:the guys and The guys all slowly raise their hands
Then, in a moment of craziness, , -
The guards let off a      as Portnoy grinds it into their noses
Tropic Thunder 95
'   -- They hear the fire
Four Leaf runs to the window
Through it he sees the commotion
What
Something's happening
Get me the hooks
Portnoy watches as the white faced guards fall to their knees, choking and groggy
After a beat, they collapse
Let's move
We got about sixteen hours before they wake up
They run out
' The guys run in
Redykulous breaks the lock off Speedman's ankle with his rifle butt
Sandusky keeps watch by the door
, , 'mon
We're busting you out
Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack
Some folks call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack
What's wrong with him
think he thinks he's Simple Jack
Like from the movie
' Shite
was afraid of this
The same thing happened to me when  played Neil Armstrong in "Moonshot"
They found me in an alley in Burbank re-entering the Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator box
Tropic Thunder 96
heard that movie was good
Can you fix him
'll try
Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to look at him
You're Chris Michael Speedman
Ah 1-1-likes pie
You're the greatest star in the world
There's a flicker of intelligence in Speedman's eyes
It passes
'   -- Four Leaf wedges one of the hooks in the
door jamb, and Cody does the same with the other
In one fell swoop, :they bust
the door off its hinges

----------- They emerge into the chaos runs by, Four Leaf uses the hook to trip him up
Cody knocks him out and grabs his machine gun
He tosses the guard's pistol to Four Leaf
By the way, what's your name anyway
Marvin Kaminsky
you ever been in this jungle
Nope
First time outta the states actually
He shoots off a round and they run for cover
Tropic Thunder 97
'  -- Lazarus is right in Speedman's face
He seems to be getting clearer
The world needs you
It` needs its stars
You make people forget how awful and 1i12  Ii
1 ,14M depressing their lives are
People love your work
And
love your work, too
Speedman is quiet
Uhhhh-uh-'m
Spah-speeedman
Simple Jack was magnificent
Is it working
Give me time, Sandusky
'm not re- programming a
(back to Speedman) You really committed yourself
And for that you
Speedman registers this
() ' Lazarus's own words make him stop and think
(almost to himself) You know who you are
you do Chris
Long beat
Unlike me
What am  doing
can't do this
How can  convince a man he is who we know he is, when  can't even convince myself of the same thing
He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down
Tropic Thunder 98
Yo, c'mon, man
Why is everybody gettin'
so insecure alla a sudden
You're Kirk Lazarus
You're like the greatest actor in the motherfuckin' world
Guys, let's go, we gotta get outta here

am  just acting like that's who  am
No
The sad fact is
'm not Sergeant Osiris
or Father 'Malley
or' Neil Armstrong

The guys look at him
it's the first time he has let his guard down
Kirk, this is  the time

He winks at Sandusky
That's right
We're
not what we're called, or who we pretend to be
We are what we are in our hearts
And to me, looking into your heart, you're a hero
Lazarus looks to Redykulous
You mean that
Yup

Thera,
from off camera
And 'll second that
They all'turn to see
The million-dollar smile is back
Now let's get the hell outta here
Speedman leads the men to the door
Sandusky tosses Speedman'a machine gun
Thanks Kevin
My name
you remembered my name
You gotta show us the way outta here Chris
Follow me
This time they do
The guys run toward the opening to the courtyard, Speedman leading the way
-- They huddle close to the wall, unseen, surveying the situation: about 20  on full alert
a  about 30 feet away
beyond that,   with the compound's chopper, maybe 200 yards in the distance
That's their supply chopper
If we could create a diversion, we could get to that jeep and drive it right over there
"Ttopic Thunder 100
Anybody here know how to fly a helicopter
Cause that would come in, handy too
You want a diversion
'll give you a diversion
Is this baby loaded
He holds up the machine gun
Yeah, but
And with'that, Speedman runs out in to the courtyard,
the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a  ' turns to,see
him
he does a- , landing perfectly and (to
himself) they're blanks
There is a long moment of silence as the guards just stare at Speedman
He seems a
bit surprised that
they are not dead,
as do the guards themselves
They cock their weapons, about to shoot him when
,
- -erupts-behind-the-gu-ards
They turn
, Let's move
The
guys jump into the jeep, Sandusky at the wheel, and 'gun it
Chris, come
on
Speedman jumps
into the jeep as it passes by
They are speeding toward the helipad
, Four Leaf
Effects guy
Come on
Tropic Thunder 101
But they can't break away, they-are trying to run toward the jeep but are under too much fire
,
Sandusky swings the wheel hard
the jeep careens back toward the firefight
they come in hard, and 1
Cody jumps in the jeep, but   '
Get in the Jeep
You go
got real bullets
'll cover you
It's the only way you'll make it
Marvin, you gotta -- Just go
Sandusky looks at Speedman
they both know he's right
They go
leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still firing
The jeep speeds up to the helipad
the guys jump out
Just as the last guy is out
Across the courtyard is
who just fired an  at our guys
The guys are freaked and shaken, but start to get in the chopper
Sandusky pushes Cody in
Start the chopper now Cody
Cody nods, getting his bearings
and hitting the ignition
the     , Portnoy grabs Cody's gun and hangs by the runner, shooting towards approaching guards
: Tran is reloading his

and

' Cody reluctantly pulls up the throttle
The chopper
begins to

Portnoy is not being heroic, he, is genuinely having trouble getting in

But then Speedman sees something
It's him
' much-like
Speedman playing him in the beginning of the
movie
Arms extended, his body riddled with bullets
Cody lowers the chopper
Speedman jumps out
Cover me
Speedman runs towards Four Leaf, through a hailstorm of bullets i- Tropic Thunder 103
Speedman reaches Four Leaf and collapses beside him, cradling his head
Trap's men continue to bear down on them
Go on
get outta here
'm worm food, you dig
'
(then totally surprised) You have hands
The guys are busy shooting off their attackers, but they see this moment happening
The life is draining from Four Leaf (Marvin)
ain't Four Leaf, Chris
We're in this mess because of me
(can't get over it) How did you get hands
ain't never been worth a nothin'
and it's too late to start bein' a somethin' now
Speedman tries to understand
He is welling up with emotion
real emotion
() But you
you can tell the story
You have to tell the real story
And Four Leaf
or Marvin
dies
Speedman begins to weep
Tears
Yes, he is crying, for real
Tropic Thunder 104
Only

the audience, suirrounded-by his Tropic i12i'4 1,

Don't you die on me
Don't you
And his weeping continues

After a few moments
: -- Peck is tied up, in ragged, prisoner clothes, hanging in the cage
He has been there a while
Ok, look, you wanna go through this again, let's do it
see more for you than this
This whole 'big fish in the little scary jungle pond' thing
see you as a front man, as a leader, not just of this little rebel guerilla warrior group
see it big picture
Is it music, is it movies
Is it a series on Fox don't know
But  do know it is not happening with you staring at me doing my " Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" routine for you and the peanut gallery for another six months
It's old school already
and some  watch, unamused
Tran nods, one of the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into the water
After a moment, it comes back up with a soaking Peck
(not missing a beat) And it makes me sad to see you chomping on the stogie and you're not even fourteen or whatever

" can be a partner to you, not just a captive
() Tropic Thunder 106
(cont'd) But you have to allow me into your inner workings, into your headspace to facilitate that
And"to do that you gotta let me outta the cage,'both figuratively and literally
Until you can let me go, you
can't let you go
Do you get that

Obviously not
Dare  bring up
a sore subject
Can we do a little business on the blackberry privileges
Cause you're killing me here
