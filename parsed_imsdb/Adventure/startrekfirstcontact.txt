Star Trek: First Contact Story by Rick Berman & Brannon Braga & Ronald
Moore Screenplay by Brannon Braga & Ronald
Moore First Draft September 29, 1995 1                                                      1 We can hear movement
Strange skittering sounds, like razor-claws on metal
the hiss of pneumatic hoses
the whirr and click of servos
liquid gurgling
an eerie, alien cacophony
2                                                           2 appears, hanging now in the starry blackness
The alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear the muffled  of what could be a distant explosion
Alien  suddenly appears next to Earth, and we we are in -- 3
3 The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is only one of  of  covering a huge wall
We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre -- a mixture of organic and mechanical elements
Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with what looks almost like arteries and organs
We can still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises
Occasionally, a   sweeps past the camera, vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is
All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad and  -- all related to
The screens show everything from written Chinese
to Renaissance paintings
to black and white newsreel footage of World War Two
to what look like clips of space battles from the 24th century
The entire range of human history dancing across the monitors
The effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever is watching this is studying the human race
There is another  and the wall of monitors slightly
We hear the  of what we will come to know as the   -- thousands of voices speaking at once : Restrict search parameters to 1-9- 9-8 through 2-0-8-4
The images on the monitors now change to show us images from 21ST  Earth history
Again, it's a collection of still photography, video footage, text, artwork, etc
We hear snippets of sound- bites, music, speeches from the period
lot of enticing details
As the images race across the monitors, we should learn the following
-- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos
Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations
Societal break-down
Crime, starvation, desperation
--  Third World War
Nuclear explosions, environmental disasters, tens of millions dead
The United States ceases to exist
All political authority vanishes
Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second Dark Age
-- The image of a single man -- visionary scientist
He see the spacecraft he created out of a nuclear missile
He flies the first warp test, breaking the light barrier
It changes history
-- Grainy black and white images of a landing on Earth
They saw Cochrane's flight, followed him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the human race
-- Humanity turns the corner
First Contact with an alien civilization brings the planet together as never before
Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning to solve long-standing problems with new technology
We see an early replicator producing food for the starving millions
new World Government is formed
-- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form an Alliance
They call it the United Federation of Planets
And they commission a fleet of starships for protection and exploration
They call it Starfleet
-- These are images recounting the birth of the Star Trek universe
Another muffled , this one stronger, the entire wall
One of the monitors   in a shower of sparks
And now a new voice, a woman's voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic inflection, speaks for the first time: ' Stop search
Calculate temporal coordinates
-Fourteen
Another explosion  the room and it takes us to: 4
-                                      4 huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser shot from an unseen vessel
The  smashes into the Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues
The Sphere returns
the Borg fire to -- 5                                             5 locked in battle with the Borg Sphere
The Borg fire the Federation ship in a fiery blast
6                                                        6 as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this is just one small part of -- 7                                             7 involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged in a fierce  as far as the eye can see
Ships turning, twisting, firing, exploding
Lots of movement
It's a spectacular sight
The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading off in another direction
8                                                        8 In the middle of the battle
is attacking a smaller Federation starship
The starship is taking quite a beating
explosions all along the hull
it doesn't look like it can take much  more of this
Suddenly a spread of   come blazing in from
The torpedoes  into the Borg ship, causing massive damage
9       1701-                                9 into view and moves to protect the beleaguered starship
The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful vessel
An elegant and majestic ship
But unlike the last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons and other defensive armory
We get the feeling this Enterprise is ready for anything
10
- -                                   10 The Bridge has been redesigned
single Captain's chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard instant access to his officers
in the Captain's chair
at a new Ops station
at the helm
at Tactical
at Communications, various  at their posts
The ship is at Red Alert and everyone is tense
Signal the Endeavor to fall back
We'll cover them
Aye, sir
She works her console
11
-   &                       11 The Endeavor moves off as the Borg  at the Enterprise and  the saucer section
This should also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the traditional "bubble" shielding, the new armor of this Enterprise  the blast and dissipates the energy across the hull
The ship is undamaged
12
12 The ship is  by the blast
Dispersive armor is holding
Bring us about
Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery
Port battery, ready sir
Fire
13
-                                   13 As    leap out from half a dozen points along the ship's port side
(: The phasers also look different, more along the lines of a gatling gun)
The Borg Cube
The Enterprise flies through the debris
14
14 Including  , which has a view of the chaotic battle surrounding them
Another Borg vessel looms into view
Starboard battery -- fire
15
15 The Enterprise fires a burst of phasers -- but this time, the phasers have no effect
We see a strange appears around the Borg ship
16
16 On the main viewer, the massive Borg ship looms closer
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain
Our phasers will no longer be effective
Ready quantum torpedo
Aye, sir
Only three left
Another  as we're hit
' La Forge to bridge
Go ahead
: 17
17 Where  and
Engineers are rushing about, hard at work
Geordi is no longer wearing his  -- he now has artificial ocular implants for eyes
They have a distinctive electronic look to them
Captain, 'm starting to worry about the hull integrity
We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight
don't know how much longer it's going to hold up
Understood
Keep me informed
: 18
18 The Borg cube is huge on the main viewer as the Enterprise rushes toward it
Incoming transmission from the Borg
On screen
Data works and the viewer changes to a view of the of the
vast  crammed with of   standing upright in individual alcoves
They're everywhere -- on the ceiling, walls, floor
This is a   -- hundreds of Borg that form a gigantic "hive" mind
The Borg are half- man/half machine
No individual personalities
No feelings
They have only one goal in life: to assimilate new races into their collective
To become a Borg is to experience living death
When they speak, they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices speaking as one: Your defense perimeter is useless
You will be assimilated
(to Borg) Break off your attack
By now, you must realize you can't win
Your opinion is irrelevant
We are the Borg
Resistance is futile
We'll see about that
(to Worf) Fire
Worf works
19
-   -              19 out of the launcher and heads toward the Borg cube
This torpedo is completely different than the traditional photon torpedo
It oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks toward the Borg ship
20                                                    20 as the quantum torpedo
But instead of exploding on the surface, the torpedo  the ship like an armor-piercing shell and momentarily from view
The ship then  like a star going supernova -- bright light and shock waves
21
21 The ship is  violently by the shock wave
People hanging on
Main power still on-line, Captain
Riker looks at his console
Casualties are light, Captain
Minor buckling on the port nacelle
Nothing serious
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid
Admiral Hayes
On screen
The viewer shows   on the Bridge of his starship
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc
We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far
and only lost fifteen of our own
(beat) But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth
Can you handle it
Absolutely
Good hunting
Hayes out
Mister Data, set a pursuit course
Maximum warp
22
-                                   22 as it breaks away from the battle
and races 23
-                                           23 There are Starfleet satellites and space stations in close orbit
The Borg Sphere seen before enters frame
The satellites open fire, but they have little effect on the massive Borg Sphere, which returns fire, them in orbit
The Sphere heads down toward the Earth
24
24 We are approaching the Terran System, Captain
Go to impulse
Where's the Borg ship
It has entered Earth orbit
(off console) Correction -- it is not in orbit
It is heading directly toward the surface
What
Picard gets up, moves to Data's console
(incredulous) Some sort of suicide tactic
Unknown, sir
Suicide tactics are not normally associated with the Borg
Data reacts to his console
Sensors show a temporal signature emanating from the Sphere
High concentrations of tachyons
Picard studies Data's monitor
And chronometric particles
it's as though they're trying to create a temporal vortex
beat as Picard makes a shocking realization
Time travel
they're attempting time travel
(beat) Full power, Mister Data
Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command
Aye, sir
25
'                                      25 The Borg Sphere   and beginning to burn with friction as it  toward Earth
26     -                                    26 plunging down into the atmosphere, giving chase
27
27 Urgent
Range -- fifty kilometers
temporal vortex is forming directly ahead of the Sphere
28
'                                      28 Just ahead of the Sphere we see a opening -- a maelstrom of light and energy stretching into infinity
explodes from the vortex as the Sphere begins to go inside
29                                                  29 as it's  by the tremendous energy blast from the vortex
The ship spins around, nearly rips apart
30
30 Everyone  to the deck
Consoles sparking
Power failing
Main power off-line
Switching to emergency back-ups
Riker checks a console
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex

now
Worf works

'                                      31 Another   is launched from the Enterprise
But just before it hits the Borg Sphere, the Sphere  inside the vortex
The torpedo hits the roiling energy of the Vortex and detonates with a harmless flash
The Vortex itself starts 32
32 The shaking subsides

Where's the Sphere
They have traveled into the vortex
through time
Disturbed reactions
The vortex is collapsing, sir
Contact Starfleet Command
No response
(reacts to console) 'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector
(off console) Captain, 've scanned the planet
The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine
The oceans have been chemically altered, as well
On screen
She works, and on the View screen  appears as seen from orbit
The crystal blue marble is now covered by a thick, turbulent   -- polluted and ugly
Reactions
Life signs
Population
thirty-five billion
(reacts) All Borg
shocking moment
(off console) The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology
(beat) So is the moon
and three other planets in this solar system
But how
They must've done it in the past
they went back and changed history
(stunned) They did it
they assimilated Earth
But if they changed history
then why are we still here
We were caught in the temporal wake from the vortex
It must have protected us from any changes in the time-line
Worf's console sounds an alarm
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position
(making a decision) Data, set a course for that vortex
Captain
We have to follow them back
repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line
(working) Course laid in
Engaging impulse engines
The ship is suddenly
33
-  &   ()              33 The Enterprise is being chased by    as it heads down toward the planet
The Borg vessels  on the Enterprise
34
34 As before
The ship is shaking
Hull integrity down to thirty percent
Steady as she goes
35     ()                                35 Ahead of the ship, we see the  collapsing
The shaking increases
console
Borg vessels are closing to two thousand meters
The ship is
On the View Screen, we're nearly on the vortex, but it's closing fast
Take us in
36
-  &  ()                  36 The Enterprise just barely makes it inside the vortex as it finally
Both the Enterprise and the vortex
: 37
37 An empty star field
Suddenly, the   and the Enterprise comes  out into space
The vortex  behind the ship
38
38 The shaking subsides
Everyone exchanges a look, tries to re-orient themselves
Report
We're still in Earth orbit
On screen
39                                              39 Which shows Earth
The Borg pollution is gone
What year is it
(working) According to our astrometric readings
the year is 2063
Captain, 've found the Borg Sphere
It's on the far side of the planet
firing at the surface
(to Data) Intercept course, full impulse
(to Worf) Weapons status
Phasers are off-line
we have two quantum torpedoes left
But the computer targeting system has been destroyed
Go to manual
Worf pops open a panel and a high-tech  console emerges with a small  and a traditional - in the center
Worf grabs the targeting hand- controls -- futuristic joysticks
40
-                                   40 The ship is  its weapons down toward the planet as the Enterprise comes up over the horizon
41
41 As before
Worf works his controls
complex array of grids, coordinate information, speed data, and other weapons info on the monitor screen
He begins trying to focus the cross-hairs on the Sphere
(over above action, to Troi) Track their weapons fire
(off console) Western hemisphere
North American continent
We are within torpedo range
They've seen us
They're taking evasive action
(urgent) Mister Worf
Worf struggles with the targeting system
Target
The crosshairs keep missing the image of the Borg Sphere, which is now twisting and turning to evade us
Troi reacts to her console
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo
in central Montana
(struggling) Target
(worried) Montana
The crosshairs finally  on the Borg Sphere
Target locked
Fire
42
-                                   42 The quantum torpedo streaks in from off-camera and slams into the Borg ship
It penetrates the Sphere as seen before
a long beat
and then it
43
43 As everyone reacts to the destruction of the Sphere
But Picard has no time for celebration
(to Data) Mister Data,  want to know the exact date and time
(to Riker) Give me a damage report on that missile silo
(works) Today is March second, 2063
The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five
(works) Looks like they damaged the silo
Life signs
Can't tell
Long-range bio- sensors are off-line
Picard thinks for a moment
makes an instant decision and turns to Worf
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three
Civilian clothes
Aye, sir
Worf works
Riker turns to him, curious
Captain
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test
from a missile silo in Montana
If 'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship
(nods in understanding) And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow
(beat) As First Officer  should be the one beaming down
Normally,  would agree
But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history
You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian
He grins slightly, has to agree
Good luck, sir
'll keep in contact
You have the Bridge
Picard
: 44
44 Picard, Geordi and    are checking their phasers and tricorders
Everyone is wearing civilian clothes
Geordi has a large engineering kit
Transporter Chief pulling on a civilian jacket
She looks a little frazzled - it's been a long day in Sickbay
Will somebody please tell me where we're going
Beverly joins them on the pad
Montana
(to Chief) Energize
Montana
Well, that answers everything
Why the hell are we -- They
: 45
-  -                       45 Picard, Geordi, Beverly and the Security Team on the vast, rolling plains of Montana
(continuing) -- going to Montana
Picard and Geordi take out their tricorders and start scanning the landscape
(off tricorder) have the silo, sir
Bearing three one zero
distance, three hundred meters
Let's go
They start walking
Go where
Hello
Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane
He may be injured or dead
Cochrane
the inventor of warp drive
Yes
But he's been dead for three hundred
(realizes, long sigh) Oh God
we've gone back in time again, haven't we
'm afraid so
If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans
Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age
an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place
Picard gives her a look
As they keep walking
: 46
-                                   46 hanging in orbit of Earth

47 lying on her back
sheet is covering her face
hand reaches in, pulls back the sheet, revealing the face of a crewman
Lieutenant Sandra Farrel
to  Troi and Data
Data is holding back the sheet while Troi scans the body with a tricorder
There is repair work going on in the b
g
Two medical s stand by
It appears death was caused by a plasma discharge
(beat) 'll note in her record that she never left her post
Troi glances at Data, who is clearly disturbed by the sight of the dead woman, holding his  in check with difficulty
Did you know her
Not very well
We met shortly after the Enterprise- was commissioned
found her to be a most
promising officer
Troi looks at him in concern
Data
are you sure you're all right
am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming
Grief, loss, remorse
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action
Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done
Data considers
No
Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should
will admit
there are times when  wish  had an emotion chip could turn on and off
' Riker to Data
(taps combadge) Go ahead, Commander
: 48
48 Riker, Worf,
s at their stations
We're reading some kind of gas leak in the Environmental Control Room
Take a repair team down and check it out
On my way, Commander
As Data

-                                   49 of the ship
the of the ship, moving underneath of the hull, pushing in on an area at the very bottom of the Enterprise
50
50 Data and    through a set of doors
The lights are off in the room, dim
This is a large room crammed with many conduits, gas tanks, 24th century machinery and monitors
It's normally unmanned -- this is where oxygen, gravity, heat, and other environmental conditions of the ship are controlled
In a far corner of the room a  leading to a series of high-pressure  labeled "-O2" has ruptured and is  a corrosive, poisonous
Data scans it with his tricorder
(to Porter) One of the diathermic oxygen tanks has been damaged
(shocked) Diathermic oxygen
It is a new subsystem of Nova Class ships
It regulates hydropressure and temperature variance
(beat) Remain here
The gas is highly corrosive to organic material
It would liquefy your flesh on contact
Be my guest, sir
Data walks over to the spewing gas tank, and without concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas
groping around for the broken conduit, finally grabs hold of it
and with android strength  the metal conduit back into the bulkhead
The gas stops leaking
Data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas
(to Porter) Begin a diagnostic on the safety interlocks
There appears to have been some damage during the attack
Right
Porter moves around a corner, behind some equipment, out of Data's vision
51     -                                           51 who opens a  on the wall
But instead of the neat and orderly Starfleet technology, he is confronted by a bizarre amalgam of organic and mechanical cabling, diodes and what almost look like arteries
Some of the tubes are pulsing with fluids and energy
Porter reacts
What the hell
Porter pulls aside a large conduit and stops
Buried deep within the tangle of bio-circuits is what looks like a   covered with cybernetic tubes and chips
It's barely discernable in the darkness and clutter
Porter isn't even sure what he's looking at
He leans in for a closer look
and suddenly the eyes open
52                                                           52 who hears a  and a sickening liquid  from off camera
He takes a few steps in that direction
Ensign Porter
He stands there for a moment, puzzled
Then a faint can be heard -- like tiny claws on a metal surface
He  whirls at the sound
Ensign
are you all right
No response
Data walks around the now deathly quiet room
turns the corner to where Porter was working
He's gone
The open panel is still there, and there doesn't appear to be any place Porter could've gone
Data looks puzzled, takes a step forward when his boots make a squishing sound
He looks down
(taps combadge) Data to Bridge
No response
Data to Security
(beat) This is Lieutenant Data to anyone who can hear my signal
need assistance in the Environmental Control Room
Nothing
Data quickly turns and heads for the door
There's a metallic  above him and he looks up -- 53                                                        53 are climbing to the ceiling like two spiders ready to pounce
One of them has Porter and appears to be inserting some horrible Borg device into his head
Before Data can react, the second Borg suddenly lunges at Data
: 54
-   -                     54 The  is buried deep underground, but on the surface there is a large, poured concrete
Built to withstand a nuclear blast, the door has nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the Borg attack from orbit
There are large, smoking all around
Part of the ground seems to have to a depth of ten feet, like a sinkhole nearby
Picard and his team approach
This must be it
How serious is the damage
(off tricorder) 'm having trouble scanning underground
There's a lot of radiation leaking from something
Probably from the nuclear warhead
Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive
As they speak, Beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives everyone injections
This will protect us from the radiation
Geordi moves to the thick, concrete missile door, scans it
'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below
There should be an access hatch nearby
Everyone spreads out
looking for the hatch
One of the guards --  -- finds it
Over here
Everyone rushes over to him
There's a small  on the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and brush
Geordi kneels down, starts working a complex- looking  on the hatch
Alphanumeric lock
We need a password to get in
have the password right here
Picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back
He aims and  at the hatch, which is  , revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness
As they start to crawl inside
55
-                              55 This is the "mission control" for Cochrane's test site
The underground room is filled with 21st century equipment, consoles and monitors
One entire wall of the room is dominated by a huge   , which is now closed
We will learn that on the other side of that door is the nuclear missile/warp ship itself
The ceiling has partially collapsed
Chunks of concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the equipment
Only a few of the consoles are active, most are dark or fritzing sporadically
The lights are out, and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires
Four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room
It's a scene of destruction
56                                                         56 and his team  the dark and smoking ruin
Beverly and Picard move to one of the dead men, while Geordi and the Security Guards move to the other three
Beverly rolls the man onto his back -- he's clearly dead
The name stitched on his uniform says Rippert
Picard looks up
(to others) See if any of these men are Cochrane
Geordi and the Guards start checking the dead bodies
Mitchell
DePaul
This one's a woman
named Kirby
Picard and Beverly move toward the immense blast door
As Beverly scans it, Picard glances at a nearby desk
57                                                        57 is littered with debris and various documents and schematics
are pinned to a bulletin board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and two angles of his warp ship
The photos are odd- looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of cloth
There's a life sign behind this door
about ten meters below
Geordi moves to the door
Blast door
It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched
There should be some kind of manual release
They hunt around for a moment
Geordi runs his hand along the edge of the blast door
Picard turns to the Guards
(to Lange) Get those fires out and then try to restore main power to the control room
Aye, sir
The Guards move off
Got it, Captain
Geordi has found an emergency  with several pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled "emergency use only
" He pulls down the lever, there is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly into the floor
We can now see the itself beyond the door
Picard, Geordi and Beverly step into

-                               58 Picard, Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk, which surrounds the Silo walls
In the middle is the itself
It should look like an advanced missile with a  in place of the warhead, and with numerous modifications to the fuselage
The cockpit is on the same level as the control room
On the side of the missile is the name "Phoenix"
The missile itself extends down another
There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders connecting the different levels
Beverly sees something below
There

They all scramble down the ladders past the massive missile
(: Because of the design of the Silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few shots
For the most part, our view is limited to sections of the missile
) Beverly reaches the man, who is lying face-down on the metal grating
She scans him
Severe radiation exposure
Geordi looks over at the section of the missile on their level
The side panels have been removed, revealing complex circuitry within
Picard joins Beverly, who turns over the injured man
It's   -- the man whose picture we saw on the Borg monitors
Beverly begins pulling devices out of her medkit, injects Cochrane with a hypospray
Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties
He has a youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation burns
It's Cochrane
've stabilized him for now
but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy
want to take him to the ship
Picard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out a combadge
Picard to Enterprise
(no response) Enterprise, please respond
It could be the radiation, Captain
Try from the surface
Picard nods
then takes a deep breath, tries to orient himself to the task at hand
there's a lot at stake and a lot to do
He turns to Geordi
Mister La Forge, listen very carefully
If you remember your history
in less than twenty- four hours, a Vulcan ship will be passing through this system
When it does, this ship needs to be in space, flying at warp speed
Geordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order
'd better get started
Geordi goes to work
Picard bends down and carefully hoists Cochrane up into a fireman's carry
Beverly follows him up the catwalk
: 60
-                                      60 Minutes later
Cochrane is lying on the ground
Beverly is kneeling beside him, unfolding a portable stretcher from her medkit
Picard is checking two combadges with a tricorder
It's not the radiation
and there's nothing wrong with the combadges
the Enterprise just isn't responding
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now
As  recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here
They might have a hospital
Picard looks troubled at the thought
What are we waiting for
Let's go
It may not be that simple
This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history
Are you saying they won't help us
'm saying they might shoot us on sight
You have to remember
these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them
There must be some good people
even in this time
Let's hope so
Because if Cochrane dies
the future may die with him
Picard kneels down and they begin to carefully put Cochrane on the stretcher

roars through the Bridge and everyone hangs on
Troi is ripped out of her chair, flown across the Bridge, slams up against the bulkhead, struggling to hang on
Worf runs over, grabs her arm, keeps her from flying out

We   slightly, revealing Data is lying on some kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints
He tenses his arm and tries to move, but he is unable to break the restraints
About two feet in front of his face is what appears to be a bulkhead
There is a cacophony of strange background  -- scratching, hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums
Suddenly, the table begins to

It's a disorienting moment as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright

And we realize we're in -- 67
67 The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now been transformed into the - of the
The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical jungle of cybernetic equipment
The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet technology and materials into the living, bio- mechanical look of the Borg
We see one Borg drone attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate it
The pod immediately sends out a   of which covers the Starfleet console inside and out
It's like weeds overpowering a flower bed -- within seconds the console has been
The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with the  that make up the
Borg drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and other conduits connecting them to various equipment
while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying out various modifications to the room
At one point, we see Ensign Porter
He's been completely Borgified
His skin pale, expression blank
No hint of humanity left
68                                                           68 still strapped to the table, which is twisting and rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the room
new image appears --    are clustered together in one section of the room, each with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits connected to its face
Through the tubes we can see an exchange of  and pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre "feeding" or "renewal" is going on
The tubes all seem to lead toward the ceiling
Data is now horizontal on his back and the table into position
Borg drone    on the side of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of optical cabling to it
(to Borg) Your efforts to assimilate me will be unsuccessful
The Borg ignores him, activates a console
and the cabling connected to Data's head   with power
They're trying to connect him to the Collective
Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly
and then suddenly there's a  of  from the cabling he's been connected to
The lights on the cable go out
Data has thwarted their attempts
(to Borg) It would appear that resistance is not always futile
Suddenly a new  is heard echoing through the room -- a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly: ' Brave words

And for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a  unlike any Borg we've ever seen

a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish technology
And then it's gone

-   -                       71 Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people -- a rural, Western community that's probably existed for at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of the original ranching community in some of the architecture
But it's also a community of the 21st century
The most striking feature of the town is that it sits in the middle of nearly a hundred  , which provide the only source of power for the town
The blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them are little more than simple poles
Some are sleek, fiberglass, futuristic
others have a more cobbled together, make-shift appearance
At the moment, only a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze
Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods carrying the stretcher
They exchange a look at the sight of the city and then head toward it
72
-                                 72 few minutes later
Picard and Beverly carrying Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the end
As they walk along, we get our first taste of post-apocalyptic 21st century life: This is a recognizable American community, but it's definitely a futuristic town
Clothing, architecture, technology -- all have changed over the course of seventy years
But it is a broken future
What used to be high-tech public   are rusted and abandoned
We can see the corroded hulks of - lying idle in the streets
Futuristic elements now useless
At one point, they pass a large polyurethane  -- the inside surface is covered with condensation and we can see the silhouettes of people moving within
The entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard
Later we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the only place where they can grow uncontaminated food
What used to be a McDonald's, or some other recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop
People are fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and tongs
The sidewalks are populated with , who congregate in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves, others just staring vacantly off into space
Many of them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies -- victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental dangers
few of them are applying a special lotion to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic elements
long   snakes around a block, as people line up to get their daily rations
few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with curious or suspicious looks
This is not a community that welcomes strangers
At one point, they see a man dressed in futuristic  carrying an automatic weapon -- we will learn he's a
He stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks off
The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look about them
They're going through something that makes the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience
But there's also a toughness to these people, a resilience and determination to survive in the face of overwhelming odds
We are looking at our future
and it's on the verge of collapse
: 73
-   -                         73 short time later
Cochrane is being lifted onto an operating table
Picard and Beverly step back from the table as a  and two  look him over
The doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered, tired look to him
The hospital itself is like the rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard times
The light in the room is provided mostly from the sunlight streaming in through the windows
Light bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital -- we get the feeling they have very little power
How long has he been unconscious
At least four hours
He checks Cochran's head injury as Beverly takes out her tricorder and scans him
It looks like he has a cranial fracture, but 'll need -rays to be sure
(to Nurse) Get Ruby in here
One of the nurses runs off
(off tricorder) He has a severe fracture of the left occipital plate
He's not hemorrhaging
but the radiation has damaged his  and his cell count
He looks at her curiously
" cell count
" What the hell are you talking about
(quickly) Doctor Crusher has been
studying some advanced medical theories
(re: tricorder) What is that
It's a
new medical scanner
It's a little more precise than an -ray machine
The Doctor eyes it
Is it Japanese
Um
yeah
(beat) Now he's going to need a respirator
Do you have one
We have two
but we don't have the juice to run them
Juice
Power
There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks
Most of the batteries are depleted
Don't you have any generators, or other fuel sources
The Doctor throws her an irritated look
Maybe you'd like to take your patient to the hospital in Bozemen
it's only two hundred miles away
Cochrane wheezes -- breathing becoming labored and ragged
Beverly scans him, urgent
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating
We've got to get him on a respirator
(to Nurse) Bag him
The nurse picks up a portable respirator sack -- puts it on Cochrane's face and squeezes the bag, forcing air into Cochrane's lungs
Picard has been thinking through this scene, finally has a solution
Beverly -- your tricorder
She hands him her tricorder
(to Doctor) Where's the battery room for the hospital
told you, there's no -- Where
Outside, around back
Next to the water tank
Picard rushes out the doors
Beverly checks Cochrane's pulse
His heartbeat's irregular
Beverly climbs up on top of Cochrane, straddling him, begins giving him 24th century
She takes charge
Adrenaline -- ten 's
As they rush to save him

-                                          74 The back of the building
Picard rushes out and spots an old, dilapidated   providing power to the hospital
He quickly yanks off the back panel, revealing a tangle of wires, and several large batteries
He kneels down, then removes the back of the tricorder
75                                               75 as Picard pulls out a small   -- about half the size of a dime
The blinkies on the tricorder go out
76                                                         76 holds the power cell with one hand, and starts pulling out wires from the batteries with the other

Everyone reacts with shock

The lights and equipment here  , as well
Doctors and patients alike react with surprise
79
-   -                         79 Picard enters
They've placed a  down Cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his chest
Beverly has just finished giving him an injection with a hypospray
The heart monitor in the background is now beating regularly
The doctor turns to Picard
What did you do to the batteries
Oh
just a little tinkering
How is he
He's stable
for now
(with meaning) But it would be better if we could contact
our friends
Yes
But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got
That'll be interesting
' : ' What happened to him
Everyone turns
80                                                       80 revealing   standing at the front of Cochrane's bed
striking woman in her mid-to-late thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard day's work
She's wearing an old lab coat
But the most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence we can see in her eyes
She's looking directly at Picard for an answer
Picard realizes he has to say something
He looks into her eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just might follow up
But at the moment, he shoves that electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer
There was some kind of explosion out at the missile silo
She looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him without expression, as though probing the truthfulness of his statement
Ruby, we're going to need a series of cranial -rays tonight
(nods) have a fresh set of plates at home
'll have them here by eight
She turns back to Cochrane, moves to his side, gently takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection
(quiet) Take care of him
He's a very special man
Yes, he is
She looks up at Picard, and again there's a slight feeling of chemistry in the air
And then she turns and starts to walk out of the room
Picard's combadge Reactions
' La Forge to Picard
(stopping) think there's someone in your pants
Excuse me
have a
telephone call
Picard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out of his pants pocket, taps it
Ruby watches him a beat, then walks out of the room
Picard here
' Captain, we have a problem think you'd better get back here
'm on my way
Picard out
Picard moves to Beverly
(sotto) have to go back to the silo
Will you be all right
'll be fine
(re: Cochrane) He's a different story
Beverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll have to work with as Picard exits
81
-                          81 short time later
Picard walking down the main street back toward the gates
People passing him, taking no notice of him
Picard's mind thinking ahead
He happens to glance down a side street, then he stops
82                                                       82 Looking down the side street
Ruby, the mysterious woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera bag now slung over her shoulder
She stops for a moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover car
stares at it
then pulls a home-made out of her bag and snaps a picture of the car
She continues on her way
Picard is intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is she could be taking a picture of
Just then -- ' Catch
Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal canister with a screw-top
The man who threw it steps into view
It's Scrimm is the head of the town's militia
While not a physically threatening man, there is a quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility
He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always carries a sidearm
Before the war, Scrimm was probably one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came true
At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his friendliest face to Picard
(pleasant) Think you'll need that
Picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it
It's no zone solution
(off his look) You know
"No ozone
" He points to the sky
Oh
yes
ultraviolet protection
Thank you
Mister
Lieutenant, actually
Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm
'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force
(beat) And you are
Jean-Luc Picard
Great name
French
Yes
You don't sound French
Scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never leave Picard
was raised in England and here in the States
Thank you for the
no zone
Picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any citizens of the town
Scrimm falls in next to him
Where in the States
Oh
here and there
You know how it is
Not really
was born and raised right here
Never had much use for travel
He casually steps in front of Picard, blocking his way
Where are you from most recently
(thinking fast) California
San Francisco
Beautiful city
Used to be, anyway
didn't think anyone still lived there
There's a few of us left
Picard steps around him and continues walking down the street
Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him again
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries
How'd you do it
It wasn't a trick
used to be an electrical engineer
Huh
He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but a little bit of a smile fading from his face
Picard realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily
And what were you doing out at the missile silo
'm an old friend of Cochrane's
wanted to see how he was doing
Lucky for him you came by when you did
He might be dead now
Yes
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo
We heard some explosions out there this morning
think he was running a test on an old rocket engine
and one of the fuel cells burst
Scrimm eyes him evenly
You seem to have an answer for everything
Something wrong with that
Not yet
tense beat
Then Scrimm smiles easily
(re: balm) Be sure you put that on
You need a lot of protection around here
He holds Picard's eyes for a moment
Thank you
But 've never had much trouble protecting myself
Now it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm
Picard walks around him and heads for the gates
Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression -- clearly, he's more than a little suspicious

84
84 Worf and a large   -- a dozen or so men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim looks on their faces
They are carrying new powerful- looking phaser rifles and other equipment
The feeling is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous mission
They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a , exposing a large  in the floor
Worf hits his combadge
Worf to Bridge
We're in position
85
85 Riker in command, Troi nearby
Riker is standing at the security station looking at a monitor which displays a schematic graphic of the ship
The position of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are on Deck 46
This is the Bridge
'm releasing the emergency force fields
He nods to Troi, who works a console

86 Worf and his team watch as the  protecting the hatch flashes off
Worf reaches down and releases the hatch, which slides open with a soft whoosh
He glances at his men for a moment, then  down the hatch

47 -                                      87 As Worf lands on his feet
The light is dim, no power on this deck, hard to see
He looks around warily for a moment, phaser at-the-ready, then activates his wrist beacon
We immediately notice that we can see Worf's breath -- it's freezing cold down here
He shines the light around the darkened corridor, then silently motions his arm for the others to follow
beat, then we see the security officers start to drop into the corridor from the hatch above
88     -                                         88 As Worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at- the-ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers
We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their own light sources, intended to illuminate the target before you shoot at it
The Security Officers are constantly moving their lights back and forth through the chilly air
Worf gives hand signals -- holds up two fingers, then a fist, and points forward
Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet, stop, and take up firing positions
then two more members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them and take positions further down the corridor
Classic military deployment
Worf starts scanning with a tricorder
(hits combadge) Worf to Bridge
' Riker here
There's a dampening field in place on this deck
Our tricorders are useless
The team continue to explore Deck 47
It's spooky, eerie, a sense of menace around every corner
They open doors, check room by room, section by section, still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold darkness
90                                           90 The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall, ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry and machinery of the ship itself
Unlike the rest of the corridors, there does appear to be  flowing through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off an eerie glow
We can also see that some of the machinery has been altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads -- there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring, equipment being rearranged
Clearly, a lot of work has gone on in this area of the ship
Worf steps forward, examines the corridor closely
What the hell is going on
Borg
Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin picking their way down the Borgified Corridor
It's not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and machinery
Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some circuitry, which gives off a
The entire team suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention
Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue their search
They continue making their way down the spooky corridor
and as they turn a corner
92     -                                  92 where the machinery is now  and more - in appearance
Tubes and cabling hang down from the ceiling
If anything, it's even colder in here
The deeper they go, the worse it gets
We can now hear a low, sinister  of alien power
At the end of this corridor is the   , as seen earlier
The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird pulsing  fills the room
Worf stops his team at the sight
From this vantage, we cannot see directly into the room, but clearly something is going on in there
Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on Environmental Control
Worf to Bridge
We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room
' Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves
As Work and Riker continue talking, we   Ensign Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation, covering the rear
He's shining his phaser-beacon into the empty darkness
He can't help looking back over his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where the action is
As he turns, his beacon moves with him, throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of darkness
(continuing) Negative
However, they've reconfigured the  network
and re-routed all power on this deck into Environmental Control
As Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something in the distance -- a shadow
The Ensign freezes, brings his rifle up
But did he see it, or was it his imagination
tense beat as he waits, heart pounding
but nothing happens
On the wall next to his head we see what can only be described as a -  creeping out of the wall
which begins slowly heading for the Ensign's neck
Just as he begins to sense that something is happening behind him, the cable around his neck and  him deep into the bed of circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast we have trouble following it
Worf turns his head at the sound
Stand by, Commander (to team) Where's Ensign Hawk
Everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there
Everyone is alert, keyed up
The tension is thick
Utter silence, except for the hum of the machinery and the frosty breathing of the team
' Worf
Is something wrong
Something is very wrong, Commander
We're falling back
Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out
But just as they start to fall back, everything happens at once
93                                                     93 ,
What follows is a  of action happening so fast and furious we never get a true sense of what's happening
flurry of violence and motion and images: --  snarling Borg face -- half-human, half-machine, a cybernetic nightmare
-- Strange, bio-mechanical  extruding from Borg bodies,  into human flesh
--  crewmember  into a bed of machinery
Fire at will
But the Borg are already on top of them
It's a brutal fight in close quarters with no escape
Phasers and Borg lasers lighting up the corridor, bodies flying through the air
utter chaos and terror
The fight goes hand to hand and Worf sees that they don't have a chance
(throwing off a Borg) Fall back
The team starts backpedaling,  as they go
but the Borg are unstoppable now -- they put up personal force fields to protect themselves
Go, go,
Worf pushes his men down the corridor
Everyone turns and  like hell
Worf bends down and grabs a frightened Lieutenant by the collar, pulling him along
94    :                                              94 -- The team running through the corridors, behind them at the pursuing Borg, to no effect
-- Two of the Borg raise their arms and out of their arms and wrists, taking  two Security Guards
Worf sees them fall but there's no time to go back
95
46 -                                      95 As Worf's team starts   and out the dark hatch in the floor seen earlier
96
47 -                                      96 As the last member of Worf's team climbs out to safety
The Borg swarm is about to overpower Worf
He quickly hits a few controls on his phaser, sets it to overload
We hear the building
He  straight up into the air,  onto the hatch rim, pulling himself up
He barely manages to vanish from view just as the phaser  in a  , taking out several of the Borg drones
97
46 -                                       97 The conclusive  comes up through the hatch, causing Worf to duck for a moment
Worf reaches out to close the hatch, when a bursts up from below and  his forearm
It's a test of strength
Worf reaches over with his other arm, hits a control and the hatch  , the Borg arm in a shower of sparks
Worf to Bridge -- force fields
The force field  into place
Worf and his team sit there a moment, catching their breath, stunned at what they've just been through
' What the hell happened down there, Worf
Commander
we have a problem

-  -                            98 Geordi and Picard are walking down the catwalk ladders toward the missile's massive engines
Now that the smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a bit, we get our first good look at the ship and the damage done in the Borg attack
(on the move) Cochrane was going to use this solid rocket booster to lift the ship into orbit
Before the warp drive took over
everything would depend on these old chemical engines
(beat) Now here's the problem
They arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see a large section of the engines have been  , leaving a deep, ugly  -- broken conduit lines, wires that now lead to nothing
It's clear that a key piece of equipment has been destroyed
(re: damage) This used to be the throttle valve assembly
(observing it) It controls the thrust of the engines
It's been completely vaporized
and without it, there's no way to launch the ship
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve
Yeah
if  knew what it looked like
There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours
(beat) There must be some design schematics
blueprints
We're tearing this place apart looking for them
but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files
so far, nothing
They look at the damage in frustration
If it was just part of the warp drive, 'd know what to do
But this
it's like trying to rebuild Orville Wright's airplane with canvass and sticks
Picard thinks, remembers something
Wait a minute
99
99 Moments later
Picard and Geordi are looking at the three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the headshot of Cochrane and two different angles of the three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the warp ship with people working on it
Picard spreads them out on the desk
Yeah,  looked at these already
Geordi points to a photo of the ship -- a worker is walking in front of the throttle assembly, blocking most of it from view
You can almost see the throttle assembly in this one
but this guy walked in front of it when they took the picture
Picard considers, absently sticks his hand in his jacket pocket
He pulls out the canister of balm Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table
Could you reconstruct the throttle from a photograph like this
if that man wasn't blocking the view
Geordi thinks it over
Maybe
(beat) Sure
Yeah
As long as  could get a clear look at the intake configuration
But so far, we haven't found any other photos
(staring at photos) If there are other photographs
think  may know how to find them

100 It's a while later, and the Borg are making progress
Data is strapped to the table,  open on his and
Three Borg drones are working methodically on his inner-circuitry
The jagged voice of the woman cuts in: ' Your resistance is
illogical
To us, your neural net is simply another piece of technology
We will learn its secrets
Data stares at the murky ceiling
Who are you
' am the Borg
That is a contradiction
The Borg act as a collective consciousness
There are no individuals
' am the beginning
the end am the one who is many

Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room the

She has no legs
Her torso is by a complex rig of  and
Her face and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty- pale white of Borg flesh
Her  have a silvery glint to them
Her demeanor is seductive and sensual in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings
She is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and mechanical
With the soft  of hydraulics, she  herself down to where her face is very close to that of Data's
Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg
Intelligence
ambition

She studies his face with a certain child-like quality
It's unfortunate we will have to destroy you to obtain the information we need
You are a
unique lifeform
(beat) Synthetic
and yet far more than a simple automaton
You have no idea how close to perfection you are
She stares at him intently, and we get the hint that her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation
She seems fascinated by him
Data picks up on this
How do you define perfection
The Queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating herself
blending of the organic and the synthetic
The highest form of life in the galaxy
Data eyes her, considering
An interesting definition
But it is not one that applies to me am completely artificial
have no organic components
She looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind
She might've just found the chink in Data's armor
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which  have no frame of reference
She smiles
That
can change
The Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them a silent command
The drones immediately stop working on Data's open panels
and shift their attention to his right
One of the drones tears off the sleeve on Data's uniform, exposing his bare arm
Another then uses a small cutting device to   the synthetic skin from Data's arm
As Data prepares himself for the worst

The security guards turn to run down the hall, but then there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal
They drop to the deck and take combat stances

They make adjustments to their weapons just as the bulkhead doors   in a blinding flash
The guards shield themselves against the fire and debris

The phaser blasts   a few of the
but then we see the distinctive   of the other Borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no longer affect them
#1 That's it, they've adjusted -- fall back
They turn to run but    lances out from the Borg soldiers and  them apart

102 The mood is tense, grim
Riker, Worf and Troi are gathered around a  of the
The lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by the color , representing the Borg advance through the ship
they watch, another section of compartments and corridors suddenly turn
Riker lets out a wary breath, starts pointing to various points along the schematic
All right
we've lost control of eight decks
three Cargo Bays
one Shuttlebay
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with
We saw at least thirty
and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing
including Commander Data
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective
Even Data
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise
Command codes, security protocols
If they control Data, they control the ship
grim beat
We can't worry about that right now
Let's concentrate on what we can
They stare at the schematic
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations
Main Engineering
or the Bridge
We have to cover both possibilities
(to Troi) We'll take care of the Bridge
Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering
Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in
Worf nods and
As Riker and Troi exchange a tense look

-                              104 Picard walks down the hall, stops outside a door marked "-
" The   is on above the door, but that means nothing to Picard
who opens the door and steps inside
105
-                                   105 Much like a traditional darkroom, trays of chemicals and washes, etc
But everything has a slightly futuristic and cobbled-together feel
They are developing -rays by hand instead of by machine
The room is lit with an  glow
As soon as Picard opens the door, we hear Ruby's voice: ' Shut that door
Picard quickly shuts the door behind him, looks around the room
Ruby, who's working at a tray of chemicals, turns around in fury
What are you, an idiot
Didn't you see the red light was on
Ah
yes
but,  didn't realize that -- Thank God this plate was already fixed
She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably from a window) out of a tub of water
holds it up to the light
And there on the glass is a - of a man's Picard moves to her
(re: -ray) Cochrane
Yes
and  only had enough silver halide for one shot
So you're lucky you didn't screw it up
'm very sorry
She glances at him, sees he feels genuinely bad
She softens a little
Don't worry about it
She picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to dry off the pane of glass
Did you need something
Yes
wanted to ask you about some photographs  saw out at the silo
There were three of them
printed on some kind of fabric
Bed sheets
(off his look) used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints
Not the best material, but  haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket
The -ray is now dry, and Ruby turns and looks at him
Sure
(jokingly) Why, did you want to buy them
Picard doesn't realize she was kidding -- jumps on the opportunity to get the photos
Yes
don't have any money right now, but  may be able to get some
Ruby looks at him for a moment -- is he serious
She gives him a curious smile
"Money
" So you can get dome money
can try
You'd have to try real hard
No one's used currency in over ten years
What are you, from another planet
Picard hesitates, smiles at her, tries to laugh it off
No
but sometimes  feel that way
(beat) What  meant was, 'd be willing to trade for the photographs
Trade
Okay
The photographs
for a straight answer
(beat) Who are you
And how do you know Zephram
'm an old friend
met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in -- (cuts him off) 'Fraid not
Ruby walks past him with the -ray
106
-                         106 Picard follows Ruby out into the corridor
She has a satisfied smile on her face -- it's not easy to put one over on this woman
And the truth is, she's enjoying Picard's frustration
As they walk along
What
(casual) You're lying
What makes you say that
You're not someone who lies very easily
so it's obvious when you do
at least to me
Are you always sucha good judge of character
She stops, turns, looks at him
Always
Ruby turns and walks off
Picard follows her, doggedly determined to get those photos

-   -                      107 Beverly is holding the -ray glass Ruby made up to the light, as the Doctor seen earlier looks on
The occipital fracture is widening
we're going to have to fuse the bones
'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments
If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage
As Beverly and the Doctor examine the -ray, we Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane
He's still in bed and on a respirator
She smoothes his hair with affection
Picard stands on the other side of the bed, watching her
Were the two of you
involved
No
not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be
(surprised) How did you know about that
Ruby looks at him with a smile
didn't
Her smile widens, and then she leaves the bed to join the Doctor and Beverly
Picard shakes his head and smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same time
(to Doctor) We can't take any more -rays until  can mix up a new batch of the silver halide
Can you do it tonight
We may have to operate
Sure
It'll be ready by morning
Ruby turns and heads for the door
Picard moves after her
Ruby
need to talk to you about those photographs
It's very important
'm sure it is
But it'll have to wait until tomorrow
It can't wait until tomorrow
Too bad
(beat) Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies
She flashes him that smile again, then darts out the door
Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he can't let it go at that

-                               108 Worf and a team of    are preparing for battle
They're setting up large, heavy-duty phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking weapons on tripods
There are two of these weapons aimed at each entrance to Engineering
The Security Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons, building makeshift barricades over each of the doors
Worf is in command, directing the action
(to team) Double check each assault phaser
make certain that the range setting is no more than thirty meters
We don't want to blast through the hull
Worf turns and picks up his '  off a nearby console
He checks the sharpness of the blade
Are you sure you don't want something a little more
sophisticated, sir
Mind your post, Lieutenant
The Lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and moves off
Worf makes a quick practiced motion with the sword
decides he's ready

109 Riker and Troi watching the schematic
Riker works a control and the display   to display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting Engineering and the surrounding deck
of representing the Borg is advancing on Engineering
(to com) Riker to Engineering
Mister Worf
the Borg are approaching your position
' Understood
We're ready
Riker and Troi watch as the  move closer
closer
right up to the perimeter of Engineering
The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks like it's being swarmed over by a sea of ants

110 As before
The security guards have taken positions around the room, all weapons trained on the doors
Worf is standing in front of the warp core, Bat'leth in- hand
(calls out) Charge weapons
massive  of power fills the room as all of the phaser weapons begin charging
It's tense -- everyone standing ready with their weapons charging
This is the moment of truth
Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the other
This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready for battle
111
111 Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of the ship
The  representing Borg have now completely surrounded Engineering on all sides, including the deck directly above and below
In essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the rest of the ship
112
112 As before
Worf and the security team in their positions, tense
few beats of silence
then they start to hear soft  coming from somewhere behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering through the walls and ceiling of an old house
Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their weapons
a couple of hard swallows
then from somewhere up above a ,
Then a large,   that seems to start at one end of the room and travel to the other
There's an overpowering sense of creatures just outside those walls, moving about
It's unnerving, even for crack Starfleet troops
113
113 Riker and Troi watching the display
The Borg dots teeming around Engineering like ants on a candy bar
114
114 The clawing, skittering, clanging noises increase and get louder
we expect to see the Borg bursting into the room at any moment
Worf tightens his grip on his Bat'leth, teeth bared
Unbearable tension and then
The noises begin to
eventually disappearing all together
If anything, the silence is even scarier
Worf's eyes narrow
He looks around the room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest sign of the Borg
but nothing happens
115
115 Riker and Troi react to the diagram as the Borg dots begin moving away from Engineering
It looks like the swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the ground, moving toward the forward part of the ship
They're bypassing Engineering
Where the hell are they going
the mystery

116 '
His eyes are closed -- he is in the android equivalent of sleep
and on his face as we hear the overlapping sounds of  from Data's past -- Picard, Riker, Troi, the Enterprise crew, aliens he's met, Data's own voice
bits and pieces of his life
The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling him, Soong talking to his son, etc
The last line of dialogue we hear is Data saying " want to be more human
" ' Data
Data's eyes fly open, now awake
We revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg operating table
his right arm and shoulder are encased in some kind of strange cybernetic , obscured from view
Clear tubes run out of the shell into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the tubes
couple of Borg drones are moving about the room, carrying out various tasks
There's been a change since we've been here last
There are now several Plexiglass  surrounding Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of murky red fluid, which is swirling around
Every once in awhile, something that looks like   bumps up against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again
We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're definitely creepy
Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do, he's still immobilized
Suddenly the table  and begins to  up toward the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling
It stops a few feet away
and Data finds himself face-to- face with the Borg Queen again
You've taken your first step toward perfection
How does it feel
do not know what you are referring to
That's because you haven't been properly
stimulated yet
of hydraulic power signals another movement by the Borg Queen
She slithers through the air and down slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data
She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing Data's right arm, which  at her silent command and moves away
We can now see that all of the skin has been removed from Data's right arm, showing the - of his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc
But on the top of the mechanical forearm there is something new -- a small  of   held in place with various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes carrying blood
It's a delicate, fragile piece of organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface
Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little puzzlement
(re: flesh) Do you know what this is, Data
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure
What a cold description
for such a beautiful gift
She smiles slightly, utterly confident
She leans her face in close to Data's still immobilized right arm
117      - '                               117 We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see the individual hairs
The Borg Queen's  move into frame, and she  a long and sensuous breath
We see   form on the skin, and the hairs stand straight up in response
118                                                      118 As Data's eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in surprise -- this is a sensation he's never felt before
The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles
Was that good for you
Data can barely describe the sensation
But clearly, it was pleasurable
It was
interesting
He looks at her
Do it again

'  -                                   119 tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the most, in serious need of repair and maintenance
No yard
The house sits on dirt
The nearest other structure is at least a hundred yards away
very solitary place
The windows are dark, painted over from the inside
Some large pieces of exotic-looking  are sitting off the front porch
After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft, feeble light
Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size plastic jug
The light from the house now lights the equipment a little, giving us a better view
There's a contraption that appears to be a  of some kind, with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several stages of filters and tubing in between
Ruby sets the jug underneath the spigot
then sits down for a moment on the edge of the porch
She takes a breath and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back, trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck
An exhausting day
120                                                        120 is watching her intently from afar
He's concealed behind a supporting beam of one the town's many He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view

she's wearing a pull-over shirt
and in one motion she pulls off the shirt, revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off long ago
She stands up
kicks off her boots
undoes her pants
and begins sliding the jeans off her hips
122                                                        122 is surprised

This really isn't why he came out here

and steps into a large  , a bulky one-piece with gloves and helmet attached

She walks over to an   marked with a distinctive - She carefully opens the lid
takes a metal pitcher
reaches down into the drum and scoops out a pitcher-full of
She closes the lid, walks over to the pump-filter contraption
She pours the sludge-like waste into the funnel
primes the pump
makes a few adjustments to the filters
and then turns the spigot
After a beat, a trickle of   starts to come out of the spigot
Ruby steps back and pulls off the helmet

pulling on her shirt and jeans
grabs her jacket
turns off the lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind her
She begins walking toward the windmill

waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill without a glance and heads into town
After she's gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house
131                                                    131 Picard opens the front door and goes inside
but he doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm
132
'  -                              132 Picard  and closes the door behind him
It's dark
He fumbles around for a light switch
finally locates one
and a soft, golden glow fills the room
The house has only one room, which functions as a living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc
This is also Ruby's
The windows have been painted black, and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo- equipment all around
But the most striking feature of the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed They vary in size and shape
Some are hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid- air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of furniture that's here
The absence of paper has forced Ruby to print photos on anything she can find -- bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of carpeting, etc
Picard stands there for a moment, taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace quite like this
The cloth photos give the room a feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery
Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to photo
hunting for the elusive shots of the missile silo
and as he does, we get our first close look at Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about her
She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the mundane and the ugly
There are pictures of hope amidst despair
beauty amongst devastation
There seems to be a theme running through the photographs -- a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism
At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes
It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the streets of Resurrection
It's an ugly, decrepit piece of junk
but there in the center, spot-lighted by a single ray of sunshine
is a tiny flower about to bloom
Picard takes in the image for a brief moment
then pushes onward
goes to a file of photos sitting in a box
begins sorting through them quickly
we see - photos printed on real paper
They show a younger Ruby with her parents
Resurrection the way it used to look
Ruby with a dog
Picard pauses, frowns
gets the odd feeling that someone is watching him
He turns around to see
133                                                       133 three foot    is drying in the air behind him
Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the street talking to Scrimm
It was taken through a telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks focused, determined, heroic
It's a remarkable shot of the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by the image
She's captured the essence of the man
-
The sound of a shotgun being cocked
Picard freezes
slowly turns around to see who's there
134                                                         134 is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at Picard
You should pay closer attention to those little red lights
Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing red light in the doorjamb
He's busted
You know, 'd be perfectly justified in shooting you right now
Picard glances at the photograph of himself
'd say you already have
Don't flatter yourself
take pictures of a lot of junk
She perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from Picard
Okay, let's hear it
'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship
It's been damaged and -- We
Myself
and a few other friends of Zephram's
Friends from Cornell
Some
Lie
That's one
Keep going
key piece of the ship has been destroyed
and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like
(considers) All right
Truth
believe that one
Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon
Or
Picard has to come up with something -- decides to throw her off with a high-tech explanation
Or the shielding around the plutonium core will begin to deteriorate
Within a day, the entire silo will become so radioactive that no one will be able to come near it for a hundred years
Ruby eyes him evenly
Lie
That's two
One more, and pull the trigger
Picard is starting to get angry
Why are you being so difficult
All 'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs
It'll take five minutes
And all 'm asking for is the truth
That would take five minutes
(beat) For all  know, you caused the explosions at the silo
and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship
am not a thief
Ruby's had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off the couch, takes a threatening step toward Picard
No, you're a petty burglar and a liar
(beat) You're no friend of Zephram's
He is a great man
He's not like you or me or any of the other zombies walking around this town
Picard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality: No
He's a man with vision
He can see beyond the problems that surround us
He knows there's a better future out there for everyone
a future where crime, poverty and war are things of the past
a future where we reach out and seek our destiny in the stars
(beat) believe in that future, too, Ruby
believe in it in every fiber of my being
And 'm telling you
if we don't launch that warp ship tomorrow, there's a very good chance that future will never happen
She eyes him for a moment -- and we're not sure if his words have had any effect
Ruby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her gut
and finally hands him the photographs
Picard glances through them -- his expression tells us the photo he needs is in there
You won't regret this
They share a look
and then Picard turns and walks off into the night
Ruby watches him go
and we can see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions
Something about that man has touched her
135                                                 135 telescopic, green and white image of Picard walking away from Ruby's home
136                                              136 is watching Picard through a set of night vision binoculars, perched on the roof of a nearby building
He frowns, wondering what Picard is up to
: 137
-                        137 The giant   at the front of the ship -- a giant, round, bowl-shaped array used for communications and shielding
As we watch, surrounding the dish and  start to emerge from the interior of the ship and   on the hull
The Borg do not need pressure suits or breathing equipment -- they crawl around the hull with ease and onto the deflector dish
: 138
-                         138 Where Riker, Troi, Worf and
s are watching this image on the Viewscreen
What are they doing
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish
To do what
If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay
Deflector dish
why the deflector dish
It doesn't make sense
The deflector is only used for shielding and long range sensors
Riker stares at the screen
notices something
Computer -- magnify grid twenty- one alpha
The image on the Viewscreen   to a specific point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish
They appear top be modifying power conduits in some fashion
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits
Computer -- thermal enhancement
The image now is overlaid with an   of what they're doing
The power conduits are glowing bright red, very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped coil, which is pulsing
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications
(realizing) They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg
the Borg in this time period
What kind of message
(thinking) If it was me
'd say "attack Earth now
in the 21st century
they'll be too strong in the 24th
" They think about this for a moment as they watch the Borg swarming on the deflector array
We have to stop them from sending that message
Agreed
Options
Destroy the deflector dish
Can we aim our dorsal phasers at it
Riker shakes his head
We've lost control of all weapons systems
Transporters are down
we can't get to a Shuttlecraft
and it would take us too long to fight our way down to deflector control
They think
There is another way, Commander
Do you remember your zero- combat training
Riker looks a little wary at the suggestion
remember it made me sick
(to Worf) What are you suggesting
think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll
their expressions
: 139                                            139 Another one of Ruby's cloth-printed photos, this one a clear view of the base of the missile engines -- Cochrane standing underneath the massive rocket nozzle
Above him on the fuselage is the crucial throttle-valve assembly
' 'm almost afraid to say this, Captain
but  think it's going to work
we're in: 140
-   -                     140 The cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk
Geordi and Picard are watching a couple of
s attach the newly-built throttle assembly to the side of the ship
The
s are using high-tech welding tools and sparks are flying
As they talk, they head back up the catwalk toward the control room
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself
They used copper pipes in their plumbing
so  melted it down
and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings
(beat) It's not the strongest alloy
but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel
141
-                      141 As Geordi and Picard
Lange is checking out a launch console
The room is now humming with power -- it's beginning to look like the place is up and running
Picard stops near the desk
Mister Lange -- have you brought the computer systems back on-line yet
Aye, Captain
This trinary language is pretty archaic
but think  understand it now
Good
As they speak,   in on the metal canister of lotion Picard set on the desk earlier
142
-  -                       142 Scrimm and three militia guards are huddled around a cluster of military surveillance gear, listening to Picard and Geordi's conversation
Far in the distance, we can see the missile silo
' Are we on schedule
The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours
' It'll be tight, but we should make it
' What about our warp signature
It has to be strong enough for them to detect
' 've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it
' Well, with any luck
the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning
and Earth will never be the same again
Scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm -- it sounds like Picard is planning an invasion
143
-                      143 As before
All right
'd better start familiarizing myself with the flight controls
console
Lange moves to it, and activates a small color video
It shows an external view of the  silo, just outside the hatch
Beverly can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious Zephram Cochrane
Doctor Crusher's at the access hatch, Captain
Let her in
Lange hits a couple of buttons
: 144     '                                    144 short time later
His head is bandaged, and he's conscious, but frankly he looks like hell
He sits back, looking a little overwhelmed
Let me get this straight
you're from the future
'm about to change history
and all  have to do is sit here and let you fly my ship
145                                                         145 Picard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a corner of the Control Room
That's right
He studies their faces -- sees they're serious
He smiles a little ruefully
And people say 'm crazy
Picard smiles
assure you, Doctor, that after today
no one will ever call you that again
Cochrane considers them
finally nods, what the hell
Just do me a favor
bring my ship back in one piece
That's a promise
Picard turns and walks off with Beverly
Geordi moves to Cochrane with a little bit of awe
Doctor
my name is Geordi La Forge
'm an engineer
Can shake your hand
Cochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect
They shake hands
wish  could go with you
Is there anything  can do to help
Not really
but  do have about a thousand questions 've always wanted to ask you
Since time is short
why don't you pick the top ten and fire away
Geordi smiles
146                                              146 have moved to another part of the room
Beverly looks exhausted
She sets her medkit on a table and plops down into a chair
Mid-conversation
(surprised) You actually performed surgery
It was an experience
Metal scalpels
needle and thread
She looks up with a smile, pulls a small  out of the medkit -- a surgical transporter
(re: device) But  had a little help
Surgical transporter
used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain
How did Doctor Almack react to that
He was so confused by what  was doing,  don't think he even noticed
(beat) Any word from the Enterprise
Not yet
You think they're still up there
(wry) If they're not
we'd better get used to living in Montana
(light) That might not be so bad
at least for you
She's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive
What's that supposed to mean
There is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's attitude, she's simply making an observation about someone she cares about
saw the way you looker at her
and  know that look
Picard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's a pointless conversation
Regardless of how  may feel about Ruby
our fates lie along different paths
Nothing can change that
You want some advice
Don't do this again
(off his look) You know exactly what  mean
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and
'd call them excuses
And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty
" We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else
And you know what
It's not
She holds his look for a moment
(neutral) have a ship to launch
Picard turns and leaves
Beverly watches him go
wondering whether her words had any affect
147
'  -                                     147 Ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter-pump
The plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid -- silver halide
She caps the jug, picks it up, begins walking up on the porch
then hesitates for a moment
looks out over the horizon
She hesitates
then frowns and goes inside
Ruby comes inside, sets down the jug
begins to pick up some more glass plates
stops
thinks
looks up
Only a few feet away is the large picture of Picard
She doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want to think about him
but there he is
She glances back at the open door
struggles for a moment
then makes a decision
Despite herself, she can't get Picard out of her head
With a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and heads for the door

150
150 as the Borg Queen descends from her nesting place down towards the camera
ultimately stopping just a few feet away
She speaks directly to the camera
How do you feel
151     '                                        151 His right hand is made of  -- it has color, fingernails, hair, sweat
It's completely human in every way
His fingers move slightly, and then the hand begins to rise
We follow his hand as it comes up and touches his , which is also
The gold color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural-looking
Even his eyes are real now -- blue
He touches his face tentatively, his expression confused
but intrigued
Different
The Borg Queen descends closer
Data's arms are now free, but he is still restrained on the table
The rest of his body is still android, mechanical
Data touches his two hands together, feeling the sensations, flesh against machine
He touches his face and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way
My internal sensors tell me the ambient temperature in the room is ten point two degrees Celsius
(wondrous) But my skin tells me it is cold
As he talks, we can see that he's becoming seduced by his own newfound senses
My visual acuity has been reduced by seventy-eight percent
and can no longer perceive light beyond the ultraviolet or the infrared
(beat) But  can see It's an amazing moment, Data riding a wave of feeling and emotion like he's never had before
The Borg Queen watches, pleased
She hovers close to him
Until today
your emotions were trapped inside an artificial shell
You didn't know what it was to truly feel (beat) And there's so much more for you to experience
will guide you into a world of sensation unlike anything you can imagine
(beat) All you have to do
is give us access to your neural net
Data looks at her, suddenly shocked back into reality
No
will not betray my friends
They're not your friends
they've held you back
kept you from your destiny
That is not true
They have tried to help me
Have they given you what  have given you
Did they even try
do not want this
But his words have a certain hollow quality to them
He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the Borg Queen notes this immediately
She reaches out with a hand and gently strokes Data's cheek
You're becoming more human all the time, Data
Now you're learning how to lie
wish to
go back to the way was
More lies
She  him hard across the face
Data feels the pain , the shock
small trickle of blood comes from his mouth
He looks at her in surprise, but before he can say anything she moves forward and  him on the mouth deeply and intensely
It's a disturbing and erotic moment
She pulls back
Data reels, trying to sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain
Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer to him, face-to-face
seductive
beguiling
Have you ever know a woman
Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face
her skin against yours
flesh against flesh
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things
'm your creator now
She rubs her body against his, cat-like
then pulls him to her and kisses him deeply
Off the image of their bizarre embrace

The helmets are the same -- they conform to the contours of the skull and face

and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation
(beat) There's only one torpedo left
guess 'd better get it right the first time

Set phasers to rotating modulation
The Security Officers check their phasers and wait as Riker and Worf finish putting on their suits
Riker straps a tool case to his suit

-  -                           154 As Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the top of the saucer section
It's a spectacular sight as the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready, marches toward the leading edge of the saucer
The scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth, which hangs above the ship
155     &                                             155 As they approach the edge
Worf gives a hand signal and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical deployment and drops down onto their bellies
They crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause
Worf looks at Riker, who looks a little queasy
(to Riker) Are you alright
Just a little queasy
Try not to look at the stars
keep your eyes on the ship
Right
And Commander, whatever you do
do not vomit in your exo-suit
It would be
unpleasant
'll keep that in mind
Riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself

They all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the underside of the saucer
The     with them as they traverse to the underside of the hull -- they're upside down relative to their previous position, but there's no up or down in space and their magnetized suits hold them to the hull
It's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to their new position
From this angle, the Enterprise appears to be upside down
Once they're on the underside of the saucer, they can see the rest of the ship laid out above them
156     -                                        156 The deflector dish (which is now above us ) is covered with dozens of Borg drones, who are working to modify it
Some of them turn and see us
157                                                  157 Begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer
(Running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the hull at all times
) Several Borg   whip past them as the Borg open fire
158                                                       158 of them leave the work on the dish and begin skittering down (which is normally up) the interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight

Borg phaser shots hitting all around him
The open hatch cover provides some protection from the Borg fire
Worf
'm going to need at least five minutes

Worf and his team lie down on the hull and begin exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg
They pick off a few Borg, who also go  into space

From their prone positions, they try to keep the Borg at bay, them off the hull one by one
They have taken cover behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of the ship
The Borg have to cross an open field of metal to get to them, making then easy targets
Suddenly the Borg change tactics
From the deflector dish high above them, Borg begin directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the dish and flying through the vacuum of space like paratroopers
This tips the balance
There are too many targets to defend from above and below
One of the flying Borg  into a Security Guard and a vicious hand-to-hand  erupts
The Borg the guard's pressure suit, which  killing the man instantly

' Thanks
Now, why don't you join us and we'll have a little talk
Picard unstraps himself and takes off the headset
Captain
we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system
We've got to go now It'll have to wait
Come on
Geordi quickly starts unstrapping himself
177
-                                 177 Picard and Geordi stop outside the massive blast doors, which are separating them from the control room
Geordi, can you see into the room
Geordi looks at the blast doors
and he does so, the electronic  in his eyes rotate, change shape and color
178   '                                                178 high-tech   of the door, but we can't see through it -- it's opaque
179                                                        179 No
the door's too thick
(frustrated) Then we'll just have to assume it's still there
What's still there
Get a tricorder
You're going to have to track my exact position in that room
Geordi moves off
Clearly, Picard has a plan
: 180
-  -                   180 Riker finishes working on the torpedo
he closes the panel
turns and reaches for the fire control mechanism
She glances up -- there's a  flying through space directly at him
Riker tries to bring up his phaser, but it's too late
The Borg  into him
Riker makes a desperate grab for the torpedo tube itself, trying to hold on, but the momentum of the Borg impact is too great -- they both tumble off into space together away from the ship
: 181
-  -                       181 shocked Troi watches Riker and the Borg tumbling away into space on the Viewscreen
They are engaged in a zero-gee hand to hand fight -- an incredible sight
Self-destruct in three minutes
: 182
-                             182 Scrimm still has the gun on Ruby
The blast door is just being lowered, revealing Picard
Geordi has returned to the Phoenix cockpit
console separates Picard and Scrimm
What do you want
The invasion plans
Invasion
These people you're calling "Vulcans"
who are they
Where do they come from
How many troops
What kind of weapons
183
183 Geordi is working a tricorder furiously
We're not sure what he's doing
: 184
-  &                                   184 As they tumble through the void of space, in a desperate fight
The Borg manages to get his hand around Riker's throat
begins choking him
Riker looks like a goner
Suddenly they are both enveloped in a 185
-                                    185 Troi in command
(off console) Tractor beam engaged
We've got 'em, Commander
Prismify the beam
Get rid of that Borg
186
-  &                                   186 As the tractor beam from the Enterprise  in two and separates Riker from the Borg
The second beam disappears, throwing the Borg off into space, while Riker is towed back toward the hull of the ship
187                                                       187 As the beam moves him back toward the ship

(to himself) Don't look at the stars
don't look at the stars
: 190
-                             190 Picard still stalling for time
(firm) There is no invasion
Wrong answer, Mister Picard
Try again
He shoves his gun against Ruby's head
The tension rises a notch
All right
You want the truth
(beat) The Vulcans
are highly intelligent aliens
191
191 Geordi working the tricorder
he can hear their conversation in the other room through an open com channel
' Aliens
that's what  thought
From where
Canada
The tricorder  and he smiles
192
192 As before
From another planet
(beat) Oh,  almost forgot
they have green blood and pointed ears
(skeptical) And you know all this
because you're a space-man too
'm afraid you've caught me
am a space-man
Scrimm smirks at him -- what gall this guy has
But Ruby seems to discern some deeper meaning in Picard's words
She frowns in puzzlement
(quiet) Truth
he's telling the truth
Picard looks at Ruby, and at that moment something on a console behind her catches his eye: a  on Beverly's   is now
No one else notices
You're an entertaining man, Mister Picard
But you're also full of shit
Scrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol he's holding to Ruby's head
The following happens very quickly -- Picard reaches out his hand, trying to stop Scrimm
Now, Geordi
-- The gun in Scrimm's hand
Scrimm reacts in shock
-- Instantly, the gun  in Picard's outstretched hand
He quickly pushes the barrel to Scrimm's forehead
Actually, you're full of shit
Everyone is in the room stunned by what's happened
Picard takes charge before anyone can recover
(continuing) Now, tell your men to drop their weapons
There's a beat, but then Scrimm sees he has little choice
Weapons
down
The other militia soldiers drop their weapons, which are quickly picked up by Beverly and a Starfleet
Picard hands his gun to Lange, who covers Scrimm with it
Ruby turns to Picard
Are you all -- Ruby throws her arms around him and pulls him close
He hugs her back, grateful she's alive
Ruby pulls away
think you have a plane to catch
Picard smiles and heads back toward the Phoenix

-  -                           193 Riker slams into the hull and the  goes
He gets his bearings quickly and then  toward the torpedo tube where Worf and his few remaining men are still fighting the Borg, who are about to overrun their position
194
-                                    194 As before

He activates the monitor, which begins tracking over toward the deflector dish

He ducks out of the way as the torpedo is  with a

The dish  in a burst of
blowing away the Borg who were working on it

s react with relief
The countdown on the monitors are stopped at 00:03

-   -   -               205 as the concrete missile doors slide open and the Phoenix is  up into the sky, riding a pillar of fire and smoke
This is our first real look at the ship and it resembles an oversized  with a specialized cockpit on top

Ruby is watching the missile launch on a video monitor
She smiles

207 Picard and Geordi working the controls as the ship bounces and shakes
The g-forces push them back into their seats
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms
Altitude fifty kilometers
Entering the upper ionospere
There's a red light on the second intake valve
Ignore it
We'll be fine

After a beat, the first stage booster separates from the ship and  , leaving three-quarters of the ship in space
211
211 , head tilted back, eyes closed, smiling
a few droplets of  fall from above onto his face
He smiles wider, reveling in the sensation
212                                                         212 Data is still restrained on the table, but a conduit has been placed above his head and is dripping condensation onto his face
Data is now a completely new being
His entire  is now made of
It's a shocking sight -- for anyone who ever wondered what Data would look like human, we're now getting our first look
213                                                  213 from her nest in the ceiling
She watches Data for a moment
rubs the moisture into his face
Borg in all but name
Data, although clearly enraptured with his new sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain his own sense of identity
(weak) am
grateful for what you have given me
But  still do not wish to be assimilated
universe of sensation is waiting for you
don't you want to explore it
with me
To his surprise, Data finds that he is becoming drawn to this strange creature and all that she can offer him
Yes
Then take the final step
give me the Enterprise
and we can be together
always
He struggles, but ultimately there's only one answer
No
cannot
Without taking her eyes away from Data, she reaches out a hand and touches a control on a nearby console
The color of Data's  turns an   --  as though the blood has drained from his skin
Another droplet of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek -- but this time his eyes widen in shock
The sensation of human feeling is gone
've deactivated the sensory inputs
That flesh on your body is just meat, now
No
no, please
you cannot
She moves in close on him, an edge creeping into her voice: You must give me what  want
now
Without the deflector dish, we can no longer send for an early invasion
We must assimilate Earth ourselves
need this ship
She hits the control, and the  returns to his face
Data gasps -- filled with feeling once again
The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her attitude seductive and affectionate once again
Isn't it better like this
Yes
but the Enterprise
my duty
is to yourself
Don't make me hurt you again
She touches the control again
Data is shocked back into his cold, android self
He's like a heroin addict being denied his "high" with the flick of a switch
No
no, it's so
empty
please
give it back
need it
And  need to control this ship
Let me into your mind
Data struggles, anguished
we've never seen him like this before
completely beaten down
finally, he nods
The Borg Queen touches the control again sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data
And the Queen kisses him on the mouth
This time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into the emotion of the moment
She pulls back a little, looks at him softly, passionately
Data stares back at her, breathless -- he seems to be completely in her thrall
In order to access my neural net
you will need to create a positronic interface
(beat) will tell you how
the Borg Queen's smile of victory
: 214
214 As before
Picard and Geordi work the control in silence for a few moments
The ship is floating in space, now a good distance from Earth
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles
As they used to say
all systems are go
Geordi works his console
215
-                                     215 Two fifty-foot long sheets of metal fall away from the ship on either side of the Phoenix, revealing primitive tucked inside the craft
The warp nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward on either side -- the basic designs of the nacelles should be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a starship
This is the beginning of a long-standing architectural design element of our ships
216
216 As before
The Vulcans should be out there right now
We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention
Bring the warp core on-line
'll lay in a heading
The nacelles are charged
nuclear warhead standing by
We're ready to ignite the warp drive
Engage
217
-                                     217 The warp nacelles  with power and the ship begins moving forward in space
218
218 They're   into their seats from the massive -forces
Warp field looks good
structural integrity holding
Picard activates a monitor which begins showing a digital display of their speed
(off monitor) Speed
twenty thousand kilometers per second
219
-                                     219 The ship is going faster
faster 220
-                                    220 Troi is standing outside the emergency airlock with the Ensign, who is working the wall panel
The airlock door  after a beat, and Riker, Worf and One Security Guard
They're exhausted after the pitched battle
Troi smiles at them as they remove their helmets
have to admit there was a moment there when -- (holds up a hand) Hold that thought
He turns away and then doubles over behind a console and begins vomiting off screen
Worf shrugs
Strong heart
Weak stomach
light beat, and then suddenly the entire Bridge --
Console, monitors, everything
Report
We've lost Bridge control
Emergency override
(works) Nothing
221
221 The Borg Queen is floating in the middle of the room, surrounded by Borg consoles and technology
Data is still on the table, with some kind of specialized conduit connecting his head to a group of monitors, which are inactive at the moment
He appears to be caught up in the rapture of his new sensations, and his personal connection to the Borg Queen
All thought of his Starfleet responsibilities are gone
(to Queen) am re-routing Bridge command functions to this location
Data thinks for a moment, and the monitors suddenly and the equipment around the Queen with
Information about critical Enterprise systems flows across the monitor screens -- we might recognize graphics from the Bridge displays
The Borg are now in control
Eliminate their remaining defenses
will send Borg to assimilate the rest of the crew
Data nods
but then one of the consoles
(reacts) There is a perimeter alert ship has entered sensor range
Vulcan
No
Data tilts his head and -- 222                                                      222 shows an exterior space shot
The image rapidly on the distant
The ship is racing through space
(reacts, to Data) Give me helm control
Data nods
Another console lights up
She moves to work it herself
223
-                                  223 As the ship turns and begins moving off at impulse speed
224
224 As before, Picard is now steering the ship with a 21st century
The ship is moving faster and faster, trembling now, a  building
Passing one-half light speed
The starboard nacelle's running a little hot
'm on it
The  shakes a little
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating
don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second
weird  passes through the cabin like a wave, then vanishes
There's no temporal shielding in here
We're starting to pick up relativistic effects
One minute to warp threshold
225
225 The warp ship  by
and then a moment later, the into view, chasing the tiny ship
226
226 Geordi glances out the window
does a double-take and looks back up in surprise
Captain, the Enterprise
(taps combadge) Picard to Enterprise
(beat) Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me
No response
Their com system must still be down
Well,  feel a whole lot better with them out there
We may need some help
227
227 As before, the Queen floating above the helm control console
The warp ship is on the monitor, getting closer
have repaired the weapons array
Phasers are on-line
floating  appears on the monitor showing the warp ship
The Queen works the console
The crosshair moves, but refuses to lock onto the warp ship
She frowns
The targeting lock isn't working
Data looks puzzled
do not understand
The optical data network has been repaired, and all systems are functioning
The Queen works furiously, still can't get the crosshairs to lock onto the ship
Your diagnostics are in error need weapons
(thinks) The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology
Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow
Can you configure it
believe so
Do it
She hits a series of Borg controls on a nearby console
and the restraints holding Data to the table are
Two Borg drones move to him
as he stands up and heads for the Queen, the specialized cable still attached to his head
228
-                                  228 closing in on the tiny warp ship
It's like a shark chasing a guppy
229
229 Ship  with power and acceleration
Approaching light speed
Geordi glances out a side window
They're getting awfully close
what the hell are they doing
We're crossing the threshold
The ship is really   now -- and the compartment is  slightly, stretching, everything becoming elongated
230
-                                     230 The ship is  in the familiar "rubber band effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp
but this effect is much slower It's on the verge of hitting warp speed
The Enterprise still on their tail
231
231 Data is standing right next to the Queen, and is studying the Borg console intently
Two Borg drones stand nearby, watching closely
believe  see the problem
In the blink of an eye: -- The drone is knocked off its feet
-- The second Borg rushes at Data, swings his arm at Data's head
This is the same Borg with the deadly stiletto-tipped   seen earlier
The spikes into the flesh of Data's neck, drawing
-- Data reacts in pain
He  the Borg's arm and with android strength      at the same time
The Borg  , causing the cybernetic  to  from its socket in a shower of sparks
-- The Borg Queen  down at Data for the kill
But Data's too quick for her
With one swift motion, he turns and  the   like a  across the room
232                                                      232 As the spikes on the severed Borg arm  one of the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier of bursts out of the ruptured tank
The  of roiling gas sweeps through the entire Borg Hive
(screams) No
She lunges at Data just as the gas envelopes them
233
-                                     233 As it    -- it shoots forward and streaks away from the Enterprise
234
234 As Picard and Geordi are slammed back into their seats and the stars   the windows in the familiar warp effect
235
235 Data and the Borg Queen tearing and clawing at each other amongst the spewing gas
The Borg drones try to get away, but they are  by the rush of gas, fall to the deck, twitching in pain
Data and the Borg Queen both fall to the deck, grappling with each other
236
-                                    236 As it   -- the warp ship flying at top speed
237
237 Data and the Borg Queen struggling against each other
the gas swirling around their bodies
and as it does, we see the  on their bodies start to and   in a horrific ooze of blood and skin
238
238 As before, but the ride has smoothed out considerably, Warp stars streaking by
Bring us about
beat as Geordi works
Dropping out of warp
Out the front windows, the warp stars
the ship slightly
turns to the left
Earth can be seen in the distance
They smile
It's a moment of victory
Let's begin the landing procedure
239
/                                    239 The onrush of gas is gone
But it has affected every surface of the room like an acid wash
Every piece of Borg machinery is smoking and hissing
The two Borg drones are lying on the floor, dead -- all organic matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies, leaving only raw mechanical skeletons
: 240                                           240 lying on the floor, still locked together
Data is a shocking image: all of his human flesh has been , leaving only his pure android self
His metallic skull gleams in the dim light
even his eyes are gone
His mechanical left arm is still intact, but the right human arm is completely gone
His torso is stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with no soft human touches
Data as we've never seen him before -- raw and mechanistic
Data rolls over
still locked around him is the of the Borg Queen
metallic spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading off it
and a blinking, electronic   at the very top of the spine
Data throws off the grotesque form
The Borg Queen carcass writhes and claws at the air
She speaks in a flat, mechanical voice
(fritzed) Data
Data reaches out with one hand
grabs the metal spinal column just below the brain stem
and The blinking brain stem
241
241 Two Borg Drones moving down the hall suddenly stop
twitch
the blinkies on their bodies
and they both
Their connection to their Queen severed
242
242 Another Borg Drone reacts
lights out
slumps over 243
243 Data releases the remains of the dead Borg Queen
He leans back a little, as though exhausted by his remarkable experience
, emphasizing the loneliness of this smoking, scorched android sitting alone in the ruins of the Borg Hive
: 244
-                                     244 The missile doors now open, the ground badly scorched from the launch
Scrimm and his militia guards are sitting on the ground, while Lange and the other Starfleet
keep a watchful eye on them
Cochrane is sitting against a rock, while Beverly checks him over
Ruby is pacing, lost in thought
' Isn't anyone going to say welcome back
Everyone looks up to see -- 245                                               245 standing a few feet away, tired but triumphant
Did it work
Picard nods
Beverly, Lange and the
look relieved
Ruby takes a few steps toward Picard
246                                                      246 smiles up at Geordi
Mister La Forge
now 'd like to shake your hand
Geordi smiles and walks over to him
247                                                 247 stop a few feet away from each other, their eyes locked
They drink in sight of each other
there's an undercurrent of unspoken feelings and words
She smiles
he smiles back

sense of urgency -- something's going on
(
) And it appears the Vulcan ship has detected the warp signature and is now on its way to Earth
Suddenly something in the night sky catches their attention
is moving down towards the city
We now realize this is what people are reacting to
249                                             249 Just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the massive     down onto the ground
Dust flying everywhere
Windmill blades spinning wildly from the exhaust
250                                                250 squinting into the wind, trying to make out what's happening
251     -                                      251 good distance away, but with a good view of the entire scene
Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi and Geordi watching from a distance as the Vulcan ship
252                                             252 Picard, Ruby and a bandaged, but much healthier Zephram Cochrane watching the landing
People from town are surging around them
Everyone is shocked and amazed at what they're seeing
Picard watches with satisfaction -- this is the moment he's been waiting for
Cochrane and Ruby are particularly awestruck
253                                                 253 settles, engines whining down
dust settling

Doctor Cochrane
this is your moment
Cochrane looks a little bewildered, tries to grapple with the moment
My God
they're really from another world
That's right
And they're going to want to meet the man who flew that warp ship
Cochrane looks at him
And that's supposed to be me
Zephram, you had the vision to build that ship when no one else on this planet could see beyond their own problems
(beat) You flew that ship
all  did was push a few buttons
Cochrane looks at him for a moment
takes a breath, nods
All right
(beat) And don't worry -- 'll keep your secret
They hear a mechanical  and a  of air
255                                                      255 as a  opens on the Vulcan ship
The townspeople behind them react with shock and fear
a few people take a step back
Picard looks at Cochrane, who hesitates for a moment
then finally takes a deep breath
and strides out toward the alien ship
man alone about to change the course of human history
Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around him
and he puts his arm around her
256                                                       256 As the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment
they glance at each other with excitement as they watch history unfold
257                                                    257 Cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the hatch swings completely open
light streams out into the night air
and  , They stand across from Cochrane -- a moment frozen in time
258                                                258 watching in awe
259                                                 259 watching
260                                                 260 pulls his hood back, revealing the familiar slanted eyebrows and pointed ears, holding himself with that austere, regal dignity we've come to associate with his race
He steps forward to greet Cochrane
raises his hand as if to wave
Cochrane raises his hand automatically, as if to wave in return
But then the Vulcan splits his fingers in the classic Vulcan greeting
Live Long and Prosper
Cochrane tries to emulate the Vulcan hand-sign
but can't quite do the awkward finger-split
Um
thanks
The Vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him
The very first Alien-Human relationship is underway
261                                                 261 are now surrounded by townspeople, who are watching the scene unfold
262                                                       262 Our heroes share a glance with each other and smile, Riker taps his combadge

The crew
263                                                 263 have now moved away from the crowd
no one paying attention to them
The bright lights from the Vulcan ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette
Picard turns to Ruby
It's the moment he's been dreading
This is goodbye
She looks at him
You're leaving, aren't you
have to
Where
And don't tell me San Francisco
No
It's a lot further than that
It's the future, isn't it
Just like you told Scrimm
(beat) knew you weren't from around here
(with humor) No
'm from France
don't care if you're from France or Venus
just take me with you
That's impossible
Why
This may be hard for you to understand
but 'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here
any more than is absolutely necessary
You've been interfering with my life ever since  met you
(with meaning) Don't stop now
Picard struggles
he doesn't want to do this, but he's torn between his heart and his duty
Ruby
'm sorry
(remembering his words to Beverly) But our fates lie along different paths
long, difficult moment
then he lets her go
turns and starts walking off into the night
She stands where she is, watching him go with tears in her eyes
Picard hits his combadge
Picard to Enterprise
One to
He stops where he is
' Riker here
Captain, we didn't get your whole transmission
Picard turns, looks back at Ruby
Their eyes meet
and he makes the decision
To hell with fate
' Say again, Captain
He starts walking towards her
She sees him coming
starts running to him
She throws herself into his arms and he holds her close
They kiss
magical moment, then
Enterprise
Two to beam up
They  holding each other tight

Picard  with Ruby
Everyone reacts to seeing her there
Ruby stays in the Turbolift, staring around the Bridge in amazement
Picard takes her hand and leads her out onto the Bridge
How's Mister Data
Riker glances at Ruby uneasily
He's in Sickbay
Doctor Crusher says he can be repaired
but we have to wait until we
He glances at Ruby again, awkward
But Picard finishes his thought
Return to our own time
Yes, sir
Then make it so
Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex
Picard sits in his chair
Riker hesitates
Yes, sir
But Captain
are we
all going back
Unless you'd like to stay
No, sir
Ruby stands stock-still, staring at Worf
Worf looks up at her with a Klingon smile -- teeth and all
Ruby manages a weak smile in return, then moves off to stand next to Picard

Admiral
what's the status of the Borg fleet
It's been destroyed
The Borg threat is over
(beat) Are you all right
The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment
We're fine, sir
It will take some
time to explain
look forward to reading your report
The transmission ends
Ruby turns to Picard with amazement
That makes two of us
Picard gives her a gentle smile

He's now been fully restored to his original android self

Geordi moves to him, puts a hand on his shoulder
You look good as new
You could say that 'm back to my old self
That's great
Geordi's smile fades a little as Data walks into the room
Her remains

Geordi points over to a corner, where some

Data walks over
Geordi goes with him
The

The broken, mangles pieces of machinery are all that's left of the Borg Queen

Data stares down at the remains with a haunted look
never realized how powerful an emotion temptation could be
Temptation
You said in your report it was all a ruse
you were manipulating her

She was

In her own way

Geordi smiles a little

Data looks up at him -- his expression unreadable
Geordi's smile fades
Data reaches out, closes the lid on the storage container, turns and walks out of the room
Geordi watches him go, left to wonder what Data is really feeling

This is the place where man first reached out to the stars, and the architecture has a distinctive uplifting feeling -- spires reaching up toward the sky
Shuttlecraft and aircars are taking off and landing
