(   )- 4:50 (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex- girlfriend
(
) Billy Boy
(mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters the office
Get your ass ready
It's almost five o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his drink on
notices his friend pining over the photo
Oh God
Give me that
'm burning it once and for all
snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter
Just as the flame is about to touch the photo,  grabs it back
Don't
Dude, it's been six months
You have to move on
nods knowingly
You know what'll cheer you up
Some hot chick riding your jock all night long
You're such a romantic,
It would help get your mind off of Sarah
ponders this for a moment
Whatever
Even if  wanted to meet other women,  wouldn't even know what to do
've been out of the game so long
Billy, you come out with me tonight, and promise you'll get laid
28 2003   2
Sounds tempting, but  can't
Berenson needs me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign investors
So what
It's Friday
You have all weekend to do that
No  don't
The Germans are taking an earlier flight back, so the meeting's been moved to tomorrow
thinks for a moment
Well, why don't you just get somebody else to do your work then
Who
gets a big smile on his face
He has an idea

'  - 4:55                                  2 (22 years old, the typical Asian-American workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day
and
approach
Harold, listen,  need you to update these models for me
(confused) But aren't you supposed to
know, but something came up
have to meet with some clients tonight, so won't be able to get to it
It's your responsibility now
Okay
Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to protest,
steps forward
And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine o'clock sharp
() 28 2003     3
(cont'd) With all the downsizing going on around here, we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson that you've been slacking
He's just dying to figure out who he should fire next
Uh
okay
no problem
drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk
3
- 5:00                     3 and
are walking through the parking lot
Wow
can't believe how easy that was
Dude, how do you think  get all my shit done
'm telling you -- those Asian guys love crunching numbers
You probably just made his weekend
The guys have reached
'

'                                        4 Billy and
enter the car
Now get ready
It's time we embark on
Operation Get Some
And with that,
presses a button in his car that causes the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy song kicks in
Intercut: 5   /
'                                     5 Billy and
think they're hot shit as they cruise through the parking lot blasting their tunes
When the lyrics kick in,
begins lip-syncing passionately
Billy loves it
When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner
gives a thumbs up to an    as his car zooms out of the parking lot
from
's Convertible and   to Harold standing at a window watching as Billy and
zoom off
He looks at the stack of papers they gave him
28 2003   4
Fuck
6                                                                6 7
'  -                     7 (22, Indian, Funky Hair) is answering questions from his  Medical School interviewer,
Woodruff (middle aged, erudite, very professional)
Kumar has
He's American
Mononucleosis or mono is an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus
Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness and loss of appetite
Excellent, Kumar
have to say you're one of the best applicants 've ever interviewed
Not that it's a surprise
Your father is very respected in his field
You know he and  had some pretty wild times when we were in med school
Really
Yeah
We started our own basketball team-- the Hemoglobin Trotters
(cracking up) Yeah, we were crazy
Kumar nods and smiles
Woodruff finally stops laughing
Anyway-- just one more question
(reading from a clipboard) What are some potential symptoms of pancreatitis
Let's see
There might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness
Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong
Dr
Woodruff is confused
Kumar pulls out his cell phone
It's his personalized ringer
28 2003   5
(to Dr
Woodruff) 'm sorry
Can you hold on one second
Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone
(into the phone) Kumar's phone
Kumar speaking
(listening) Oh, hey
(listening) Nothing important
can talk
What's up
Dr
Woodruff is offended
He takes a sip of from a mug of coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office
Intercut: '  - Harold is talking on his office phone
'm not gonna be able to partake in our usual Friday night ritual
've gotta stay late at the office
(into the phone) Fuck that shit
We had plans
Dr
Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words
know, but  gotta get this work done
Oh come on
When has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work
Dr
Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands
Hot coffee goes all over his shirt
Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin
(
) Listen, 'd love to go home, but
No fucking buts
just bought a quarter of the finest herb in New York City, and 'm not smoking it alone
() 28 2003         6
(cont'd) So you're just gonna have to chill the fuck out, bring your work home, and prepare to get blazed, because in a couple of hours  expect both of us to be blitzed out of our skulls
Got it
Okay good
See you later
Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down
Dr
Woodruff is stunned
(to Dr
Woodruff) Okay, where was
Oh yes
More symptoms of pancreatitis
Um
decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock
(livid) Mr
Patel
This is supposed to be a proper interview
Do you actually believe after the way you've behaved that  would ever even consider recommending you for admission
No
'd actually be pretty surprised
Dr
Woodruff is flustered
He doesn't know how to react
Look, 'm just interviewing so my dad will keep paying for my apartment
'm not really planning on going to med school
(confused) But
you have perfect  scores
Well, 'm not an idiot
Dr
Woodruff is at a loss for words
Kumar notices a framed picture of a    on Dr
Woodruff's desk
He picks it up
Wow
Is this your daughter
disturbed Dr
Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's hands

'                                            8 Harold shuts down his laptop
He then puts the laptop along with all his paperwork into a bag and leaves the office
9
9 Harold walks to the end of the parking lot, where his car is parked
As he walks, the strap of his laptop bag breaks and falls to the ground
Harold is frustrated as he picks it up
10
10 After other cars zoom through uninterrupted, the stops Harold and checks his  before letting him leave
11
- 6:21                11 Harold's driving his   G20
He finds a spot
Yes
Right in front
Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park
As he starts to pull in,
The jeep is loaded with "alternative" stickers, and has a , -, and other sports equipment on the roof
Harold almost hits the
He knows this car
(frustrated, to himself) Those assholes
The driver,  (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud mouth), puts down his window
is joined in the jeep with his , who all laugh at Harold
(mock Asian accent) This is America, dude
Learn how to drive
#1 Better ruck tomorrow
Frustrated, Harold turns around and continues driving
28 2003   8
11A
-                                       11A He ends up parking far from the building
He has to parallel park
He's anal with his parking, going in and out a bunch of times, until the car is positioned perfectly in the spot
11B
'                    11B Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building
He walks up the steps to the   of his building
Suddenly, he stops in his tracks
Through the glass door, he sees
--  beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of Puerto-Rican descent
She's standing by the elevators
can't move
He's mesmerized
This is his dream girl
Harold takes a deep breath
Okay, be yourself
Don't be nervous
11C
() -                        11C Harold enters the building and walks over to Maria
They give each other a friendly smile
We hear a "" sound, indicating the elevator has arrived
The doors open and Harold and Maria walk inside
12
12 and  are standing silently as the elevator goes up
Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak
So Maria, what's been going on
Oh, nothing
It's just been a long week
How about you
My week was great
Work wasn't too bad caught up on some sleep
Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change
Really
(deadpan) Oh wait,  meant the exact opposite of that
Work sucked
barely slept
And the guy next to me still smells like crap
But a man can dream, right
28 2003   9
Maria laughs
Harold's pleased that his joke worked
So what are you up to tonight
Actually, 'm probably gonna work out a little bit, clean up the apartment, and then go over to my boyfriend's place
He's cooking me a really nice dinner
(disappointed) Really
(smiling) Oh wait,  meant the exact opposite of that
(beat) 'll actually probably just sit on my ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch Blind Date
(playful) That sounds awful
Harold laughs, as does Maria
They smile at each other
Well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place
(flirty) Maybe
We hear the "" of the elevator
13
()                                 13 We're back in the lobby Harold and Maria enter the elevator
14
14 and  stand silently while the elevator goes up
It's clear Harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have the courage
They reach their floor and exit the elevator
15
15 Bye
28 2003   10
walks over to her apartment and goes inside
Bye
16
'  - 6:30                   16 Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment
The place is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a poster of "
" Kumar
(
) Yeah, 'm in here
Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside
It's Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc
On his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters
is everywhere
We see a Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr
Kumar is not in the room, however
Kumar
(
) In here
Curious, Harold walks over to   (neat, tidy, furnishings), where he sees -
There's a "clipping sound" coming from Kumar's direction
Harold stares at him, shocked and appalled
Harold walks inside
Kumar, what the hell are you doing
'm trimming my pubes
Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple more snips
On the floor, we see
Why aren't you doing this in your room
The mirror's in here
(re: his crotch) Hey, check it out
It looks like a Bonsai tree
'm gonna puke
Get your clothes on
28 2003    11
Chill out
It makes my Johnson look bigger
Besides, if  don't do this, 'll end up with pubes like my dad
You've seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right
notices something
Are those my scissors
Oh my God trim my nose hair with those
Dude, 've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months
Kumar puts the scissors down and
Harold shakes his head and sets up his laptop on his desk
16A
'                                         16A Kumar puts on some boxers and a -shirt ( love Bush: the pussy not the president)
(calling out to Harold) So what the hell is your problem, anyway
(
) Other than my roommate's boney ass
17
'                                         17 Harold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working
(calling out) One of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight
Kumar walks back into Harold's room
assume you gave him the appropriate "go fuck yourself
" If by "go fuck yourself" you mean "no problem sir" then yes, he got the message loud and clear
shakes his head in disgust
28 2003   12
Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me today
Dude, you gotta learn how to say "no" once in a while
Now lets get high
No
got a lot of work to finish
Kumar shuts Harold's laptop
Fuck that
You'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later
Come on, let's smoke a couple joints
Harold thinks for a moment and then caves
One joint
One and a half
Now let's do this
Kumar exits the room
hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see organized in rows of suits and button downs
18
18 Kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds Kumar lifts open the cover-- inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana
Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy
The phone next to the book starts to ring
Kumar doesn't care
He lets it ring until the answering machine picks up
(on the answering machine) Kumar
it is daddy
hope your interview today was good
'm calling to remind you that you have another one tomorrow morning with Dr
Wein from Cornell at 10:00 a
m
Do not be late
Kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the
book and starts rolling a fat blunt
It is very important you show up on time
Mommy and  will be very upset if you do not go
Good luck, Kumar
Remember, the meeting is at ten o'clock
Bye bye
28 2003    13
Harold (still wearing his button-down shirt, only now untucked) enters the living room
Kumar is now licking the blunt
Don't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously
At some point your dad's gonna get really pissed
So what
It's not like there's a shortage of Dr
Patel's out there
My dad's a doctor
My brother's a doctor
Just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean  have to
Well, then what are you going to do
'll tell you what 'm gonna do
'm gonna smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to eat
Sounds like a plan
: 19                                                            19 20
- 7:00                                    20 takes the first hit off the blunt
He nods to Kumar, as if to say "that's good shit
" Kumar takes the blunt from Harold and inhales
: 21
- 7:30                                    21 Harold and Kumar are now smoking out of an  , while watching
The room is filled with smoke
- It's an episode of "The Router Workshop
" - think we've already seen this one
Harold changes the channel
28 2003   14
- It's an anti-marijuana commercial
Two teenagers are listening to rock music in a house without parents
One teenager (blonde) passes a joint to the other (brown haired)
Come on, dude
Just take one hit
Don't you want to be cool
Nervously, Brown Haired Kid takes a hit of the joint
Right after he exhales, he walks over to his '   and takes out a
Hey man, what are you doing
'm so high
Nothing can hurt me
The Brown Haired Kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth
We see Blonde Haired kid in slow motion go "Nooooo
"
(
) Marijuana kills
- They're laughing their asses off at the commercial
love that shit
Harold continues flipping channels
- We see a News report Tonight
a Cheetah escaped from the Morristown Zoo
- Harold and Kumar Harold's not interested
He continues flipping
Nice
Sixteen Candles is on
And the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to
() 28 2003       15
(cont'd) (mock opening an envelope) Harold Lee
Come on down
Take a bow
Oh come on
It's a John Hughes movie
It's a classic
It's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved
Hey look
It's you
Kumar points to the  where we see a --[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie] Kumar laughs
Harold isn't amused
We see another  [Long Duk talking about the chores he does for the grandparents]
Hey, when are you gonna start doing some chores around here
Harold gives Kumar a "don't even joke" look
He then violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it
Kumar laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke
We're so high right now
We're not low
don't know about you, but 'm hungry as balls
No shit
Let's eat
bends down and picks up      that have been left on the floor
Nah,  don't feel like delivery tonight
What about
Nah, we've been there too many times
(beat) want something we haven't had in awhile
Something different
Something that'll really hit the spot
want the perfect food
28 2003   16
Are you hungry
and  turn their attention to the , where they see     taking place
In the commercial, we see     lined up in a row
Then come to White Castle and try our Slyder Special-- six burgers, fries, and a soft drink for only 2
99
and  start salivating, as they see Imagine all those burgers in your stomach right now
Mmmmmh
and  move closer to the  to smell the burgers
Don't you like food that's tasty and delicious
Almost in a trance,  and  nod agreeingly
Then what are you waiting for
Head over to White Castle
It's what you crave
The commercial ends
and  look at each other-- this is clearly an emotional moment for both of them
22
- 7:45                        22 and  exit their apartment
You're sure you know how to get there haven't been to White Castle in ages
'm telling you, there's one right around the corner from that multiplex in New Brunswick
They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment
On the side of the doorway is a Harold and Kumar walk in without knocking
23
'                      23 and  walk into an apartment that looks almost identical to theirs
(Instead of a " " poster, there's one of "
") 28 2003   17
Sitting on the couch is  (a seemingly "nice Jewish boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and  (a more depraved Jewish boy, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the -- underneath the picture we see the words, "    13, 2004")
Both of them are taking bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching  as Harold and Kumar enter
Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up
We're going to White Castle
Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the
Wait-- we're watching The Gift on
No waiting
We're starving
Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg & Goldstein's coffee table
(scolding Harold) Put that down
We're not eating `til we get to White Castle
Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and Goldstein, he slips it his pocket
(to Rosenberg and Goldstein) Now come on guys, let's go
Sorry man
We're not going anywhere
Supposedly, Katie Holmes shows her milk paps in this movie
Is that all you Jews ever think about
Tits
We're talking about Katie Holmes here
You would never think a sweet, innocent girl like her would ever take her top off
Which is precisely why we have to watch her do it
28 2003   17A
Dude, the things 'd eat out of her ass, you have no idea
(beat) Bacon, shellfish, milk with meat, you name it
28 2003   18
(to Goldstein) That's a very vulgar statement
So is " want to pound Britney Spears in the pussy
" But it's true
Touche
(to Harold and Kumar) Anyway, if you guys want to wait till the movie's over
and  have already shut the door
24
- 7:50                                24 presses the "down" button
notices that Harold has his   on his shoulder
What the hell are you bringing that for
Harold hands Kumar his keys
You're driving
'm gonna try to get some of my work done in the car
Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty
Shit,  forgot my cell phone
Why don't you just run back and get it
(thinks for a moment) Nah, we've gone too far
Reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door
"Bing
" The elevator door opens and the guys enter
25
25 As Harold and Kumar enter, we hear a   behind them
They turn around and see  locking her door
She hasn't noticed Harold and Kumar yet
Hey, there's your girlfriend
You actually gonna talk to her this time
28 2003   19
Harold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the "door closed" button repeatedly
The door closes before Maria sees them
What the hell are you doing
That was a perfect opportunity
You could have asked her if she wanted to go to White Castle
Harold doesn't say anything
He looks down in shame
You're worthless
'm not worthwhile
26
()                             26 Harold and Kumar exit the elevator
Dude, it's only awkward because you're a pussy
Just talk to her once and promise you it won't be weird anymore
It doesn't matter
The only girls interested in me are girls  have no interest in
Like Cindy Kim
Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier
One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight
God, she invites me to everything
So what
She's fucking cute
Let her touch your penis
They exit the front door of the building
26A
26A Harold and Kumar walk down the steps, where they see  and the    doing lame skateboard tricks on the sidewalk near their jeep
They're about to get back in the jeep, when Cole sees Harold and Kumar walking near them
Hey look, it's the Brother's McFag
(to Harold and Kumar) Let me guess, the yellow one's the catcher
28 2003   20
Harold is uncomfortable
Kumar just ignores them
(to the Punks) Come on, guys
Let's get ourselves some fucking Mountain Dew
#1 Extreme
They take off, driving by Harold and Kumar
Harold gives them a pissed off look as they drive away
Why do  have to be the catcher
Dude, forget about those pricks
Let's just go
They continue walking
27                                                            27 28
28 Harold and Kumar finally reach Harold's car
(getting frustrated) Jesus, that took forever
You know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking
(beat) And what kind of parking job is this
You're like a mile away from the curb
Don't even start
(laughing) Just fucking with you
Now let's go out and get those burgers
'm fucking starving
They get in the car and slam the door
The engine starts and the car takes off, revealing that they were parked next to a '
29                                                            29 30                                                            30 31                                                            31 28 2003   21

- 8:30                                        34 We see Harold's Infiniti driving down the highway
35
'                                        35 Harold is meticulously rolling a joint
Hey, Rold-- do you think C3PO is gay
Of course he's gay
You remember in the first Star Wars when he was like
(in a gay C3PO voice) "Thank the maker
This oil bath is going to feel soooo good
" Kumar laughs
36
- 8:45PM                                        36 Harold's Infiniti approaches a line of
37
'                                        37 pulls up to an
Dude, give me thirty-five cents
sorts through some change in his hand and gives Kumar the money
tosses the change into the basket and waits for the    to turn green
It doesn't
What's going on
It didn't register
(beat) Dude, give me thirty-five more cents
don't have anymore change
Should  just go through
No
don't like breaking the law
Harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on
28 2003   22
can see that
Kumar turns around and sees a number of cars lining up behind them
Right behind them, leans his head out of a car
Hey
Move your ass
(to Harold) 'm going through
Just hold on
'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened
The honking continues as  starts to open the door
(over the honking) Move, you fucking twat
Kumar can't take it anymore
Just as Harold is about to get out of the car, Kumar hits the gas and screeches away
Are you crazy
Oh shit, we're dead
Harold throws the joint out the window
What the fuck is wrong with you
(paranoid/looking back) You just tore out of there
The cops are gonna catch us
No they're not
Take this exit
What
28 2003   23
38

'  - 9:00                             39 and  drive through the dangerous streets of Newark
They're very quiet, until Kumar breaks the silence
That was the last of our weed
Look,  get a little paranoid sometimes
Now we're in Newark of all places
You know we're gonna get shot
Maybe it's not as bad as they say
It's probably just a bunch of hype
They look out the window and see another  and  guy (Daniel and Shankar) walking down the street
Suddenly, jump out from an alley and start beating the living shit out of Daniel and Shankar
Kumar gives Harold a dirty look
Let's get the hell out of here
continues driving
He makes a turn
All of a sudden, he stops short, causing he and  to jerk forward quickly

We have to if we want to get out of here
Kumar points to a sign indicating that the  is ahead
Forget about it
No way
Come on
How do you know they're not peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys
With that, the In celebration, he violently bumps chests with his teammates
Turn the car around
Why
Are cars not allowed to go through when a game's going on
When we were kids, we used to move to the side when we were playing in the street
The     stares  and  down
For some reason,  don't think this is the same thing
'm going through
begins inching forward
Don't
The   slowly begin moving aside
Look
They're moving
told you
Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar, they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all times
Harold is scared shitless
He then notices the holding the basketball
Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us
How do you know
28 2003   25
Look at him
The     has an
Oh fuck

Make that face again
Okay, okay, okay
suppresses his laughter and tries to make the face
He bursts out laughing again
Shit
can't do it
His friends laugh harder
He tries to regain his composure
Hold up
Hold up
He manages to make his angriest face for two seconds, before bursting out laughing again
43
- 9:45                                         43 We see Harold's Infiniti back on the highway, driving fast

Oh man, 'm so hungry

God, where the hell is this place
Don't worry, we'll find it
sees a   up ahead
There's the multiplex
That means the White Castle should be just around the corner

, '
What the hell's going on, Kumar
That doesn't look like a White Castle to me
We gotta get to the bottom of this
48
- 10:00                      48 drives right up to the   , where we see a chubby
28 2003   27
'm sorry
You have to order at the drive thru menu
What happened to the White Castle
Excuse me
There used to be a White Castle right in this spot
Where is it
(remembering) Oh yeah
There was a White Castle here
Look guys,  hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Burger Shack bought this location four years ago
and  look at each other, devastated
Please tell me there's another White Castle in town
Nope
Are you sure
Do  look like the type of guy who would be unsure about something like this
and  are freaking out
Shit
What are we gonna do
don't know
Should we just eat here
Do you really think that'll satisfy us
The    senses their desperation
There's a 24 hour White Castle in Cherry Hill, about forty-five minutes away
28 2003   28
(to Harold) can make the trip if you're willing to
Kumar,  have a shitload of work to finish
And you have that med school interview in the morning
Forget about the med school interview
It's a non-issue
If  may interject for a moment
(beat) 've been an employee here for three years now, and if there's one thing 've learned, it's that when you're craving White Castle, the burgers here simply won't cut it
(in his own little world) In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers and those grilled onions makes me want to burn this place to the ground and re-build a White Castle in its place
(back to reality) If  were you, 'd suck it up and make the trip
looks at
The guy makes a convincing case
is clearly torn
We sense that this is an important moment for the guys
(enticing Harold) You can always do your work in the car
thinks for a moment, then licks his lips
Let's do it
Then it's settled
No matter what, we're not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs
Agreed
puts his hand out
shakes it
Agreed
28 2003   29
Wise choice
Besides, you wouldn't want to go near our special sauce tonight
Some of the guys and  added an extra ingredient, if you know what  mean
and  look confused
'll give you a hint
(whispering) It's semen
We hear Harold and Kumar scream in disgust as Harold's Infiniti zooms out of the drive thru

White Castle, here we come

He's     -- trying to get his work done
Meanwhile, Kumar notices a sign on for the
Nice
Princeton
We're getting off here
Kumar takes the exit
Why
We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into finding us some weed
Oh no
'm not seeing Cindy
Why the fuck not
You talk to her on the phone all the time
She calls me
Then she rambles on about her East Asian Students club or whatever
() 28 2003     30
(cont'd) And  have to pretend like  actually give a shit, or she'll call me a twinkie
twinkie
You know, yellow on the outside, white on the inside
Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our weed out the window, so now it's your duty to make sure we're high as shit by the time we're eating those burgers
Well,  can't help you out there
Cindy doesn't smoke
She's not gonna help us
As long as she buzzes us into a dorm, we're set
Give me ten minutes in there and  guarantee 'll find some hizzy
No, forget it
'm not seeing Cindy Kim
51
'   - 11:                         51 is sitting on a bed, next to   (very cute, prim and proper, Korean girl)
Sitting on the floor are -- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy clothes, etc)
Harold is kind of creeped out by them
'm so glad you showed up, Harold
(unenthusiastic) Yeah
Me too
Did you like the Hibiscus petals  glued to the envelope  sent you
Uh, yeah
They were
nice
Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students () raises his hand
looks at him strangely, and then over to Cindy
"Does this guy think 'm a teacher or something
" Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while
(to Kenneth) Uh, yes

Kenneth Park

Is it true you're an analyst at Brewster Keegan
Yeah, 'm a junior analyst
Awesome
high-fives with the nerdy Asian student next to him
He then raises his hand again
rolls his eyes
Yes
Uh, this is actually a two-part question
'm applying for a summer internship at Brewster Keegan, and  was wondering a) what it's like being an investment banker and b) if you would write me a recommendation
What it's like being an investment banker
Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's pretty
looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian students
He can't bear to tell them the truth
awesome
All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other
As for the recommendation,  may be able to make a call or two
looks at her watch
Actually Harold, we should be getting to the party
We can discuss all this stuff there
It's just down the hall
All the Asian students get up
Sorry, Cindy
can't go
have to wait for Kumar
28 2003   32
You'll see him when we're done
Trust me, you're gonna love this
Kenny's mom dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae

He sees one   walk by
Hey
You know where  can get some chronic
The   doesn't respond
Kumar is frustrated
What kind of Ivy League school is this

Eventually, a - (Phish t-shirt, Birkenstocks) taps  on the back
Heeey, Man
Lookin' to toke up
breathes a sigh of relief
Thank Christ
Look, just give me a dime of your finest herb
The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack
Inside, Kumar sees He's awestruck
Oh my dear sweet lord
Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his hand away
Yo, man
Not cool
This is my baby, man
28 2003     33
Hippie Asshole sizes Kumar up and then gives Kumar him a measly dime bag
That'll be eighty bucks
Eighty bucks
It's worth forty tops, bro
The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar
'm not your bro

And if you feel like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy it
That's cool with me

Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are you
One who understands the concept of supply and demand, dude
Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down
After a couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off
He takes out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole
(laughing like a prick) Dumbass
Suddenly,  and  (  , , ,  ,  ) approach carrying take-out bags

The sound of the door shutting causes  and  to look over at that stall
Oh great
Now  think  have to go

They then look at each other grossed out
From above, we see  and  struggling, while the girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls
Ahhhhh
and  look horrified
There is silence for a few seconds until

All the "nerdy" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each other as
Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock
Some of the dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot
Kenneth jumps off the couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of
Pot brownies for everyone
Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air
People grab at them
Harold and Kumar can't believe it
Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth
#1 Hey, -dog
Can we have some brownies
To tell you the truth, 'm running low
But a quick titty flash may persuade me
The Korean chicks look at each other
"Should we
" "Okay
" They lift up their shirts and bras, revealing their boobs
Dude, 'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party
Harold gives him a dirty look
Then, suddenly, the from before appears in the hallway with (#2)-- Hey, you
The guys turn and see the guards running at them , 28 2003   40
Further down the hall, they pass the party
The partygoers watch as the guys run by, except for Kenneth, who makes a quick grab at one of the topless girl's boobs
When she notices, Kenneth quickly looks away, as if he did nothing
Cindy Kim notices Harold

Kumar
They continue running
The guards are still running after Harold and Kumar, who see the   just ahead

28 2003   41
(using his fingers) can't believe it
We were this close to getting high and getting laid
Oh, come on, you always exaggerate
We weren't gonna get laid
Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex with us
And what about Cindy
She was looking hot tonight
The fact that you're not into her just might make you gay
know Cindy's cute, it's just
What
You'd rather have Maria
From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head
Look, it doesn't matter
'm gonna end up with Cindy anyway
It's just more practical
Now can we drop this and get our asses to White Castle
Fine
Suddenly,  pulls the car over to the side of the road
Now what are you doing

Harold rolls his eyes

Suddenly,    ( ) walks over to him
The Creepy Guy unzips his pants and starts urinating    ,
Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused
The Creepy Guy simply goes about his business
It's clear that Kumar wants to say something
He remains silent for a couple seconds, until he can't take it anymore
Excuse me
'm sorry,  just have to ask you
why are you peeing here
What do you mean
Why did you decide to piss here right next to me
Why not that bush over there
Well, this looked like a good bush to pee on
Why'd you choose this bush
Nobody was here when  chose this bush
(getting heated) So you can pee here and nobody else can, is that it
was just saying
Is this like your special bush or something
No,  just
(beat) You know what
Forget about it
'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now
The   calms down

The raccoon's arms and legs are scurrying around-- trying to escape
How the hell did that get in here

Man,  have the yellow plague
There's nothing sexier than a hot Asian chick

Goldstein starts moving towards Harold, and reaches out to grab his cock
Harold quickly backs away
(reaching for cock) Come on, let me suck it

Jewish swordfight
Harold backs away as the other three laugh
Will you stop it

Next to him are  and , who are both badly beaten and nursing their wounds

Harold enters the room with a band-aid on his neck

turns around and sees   standing next to (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five years older than Kumar)
Both are in doctor attire
Oh, now  see why you didn't want to come to the hospital
Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches
' (thick accent) hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today
Dr
Woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics
and neither am
(no accent) What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar
Look at me
own my own house
drive a beamer
And  get laid whenever  want
You can have all that too, if you'd just get off your ass and go to med school
Eat my balls, Saikat
God, you're 22 years old already
When are you gonna grow up and stop with this post-college rebel bullshit
Like your life is so tough
Kumar doesn't have a response
Saikat's right
' will not tolerate this business from you any longer
You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one 'm setting up for you
() 28 2003      48
'  (cont'd) If  hear from Dr
Wein that you were anything short of spectacular, 'll completely cut you off
Oh, come on, dad
' "Daddy will not be coming on anything
" You will be there and you will behave
've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up
lowers his head
He's been put in his place
You're right
'm sorry
gives   a hug
He even gives  a hug
It won't happen again
' Good
'll speak with you tomorrow
'  gives  a quick kiss on the head, then he and  walk away
is stunned
Wow
So  guess you're going to med school after all, huh
Fuck that
Like  care what my dad thinks
can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out  skipped the interview tomorrow
He wants to cut me off
Fine
don't need his money
(extremely confused) But
you just hugged him
just needed to get my hands on these
holds up  and  '
Two words-- medical marijuana
shakes his head in disgust

74A
'                                        74A Using the  , Harold and Kumar walk into a room where there are loads of medical supplies, including
Kumar grabs a couple and hands one to Harold
They put them on
Look, 'm telling you, they see   an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and   they'll just assume we're doctors
Then   we walk right into the pharmacy and get   the weed
Harold does not appear happy he's doing this
75
75 and  (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks) walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway
If we get caught, you're taking the blame
This wasn't my idea
We're not gonna get caught
We're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious White Castle-- just like we planned
All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind
Freaked out, they turn around and see a   (frazzled, touchy feely)
Dr
Patel, thank God  found you
need your help immediately
The  drags them to a nearby emergency room
76
76 The scene is very fast paced, with several rushing around
Harold is confused and concerned as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a patient
(whispering to Kumar) What the hell's going on here
He must think 'm Saikat
Don't worry
Leave the talking up to me
On the operating table is a
He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain
28 2003   50
The patient was brought in by  five minutes ago
He has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior abdomen
No exit wounds
sees blood squirt out of the ' chest
Oh shit
This guy's gonna die
It's a good thing  found you two
All the other surgeons are working on other patients
The  hands  a surgical instrument
Wait
Hold on
You see you got this all wrong
We're not doc
interrupts before  can tell her the truth
What Dr
Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest
looks at  confused and nervous
Alright
'll get the anesthesiologist
The  is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him
Hold on
What we should probably use is marijuana
That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery
(confused) Marijuana
But why
We don't have time for questions
We need marijuana now
Get as much of it as possible
Like a big bag of it
shows the amount he wants with his hands
28 2003   51
But doctor, we don't have marijuana in this hospital
gives  a dirty look
(to himself) Shit
Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest
Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous
We're losing him
You gotta do something
(disappointed) Very well
guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way
puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face
Harold gives Kumar a look-- "What the fuck are you doing
" (') First, we need to clear his -spine want stat x-rays of the chest and abdomen
Give me two large bore IVs and start a ringers lactate push
Nurse, we need 2 units of  neg on board
Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient
Harold can't believe what's going on
Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing
He's gasping for air
The   monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace
Doctor
The patient is desatting
Kumar quickly examines the patient's chest
Ah,  see
The Patient's got a collapsed lung
Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat
After a couple seconds go by
What's taking so long
28 2003   52
The  hands  what is essentially a
Kumar directs the needle in the direction of the Patient's chest
It's a tense moment
The Patient is scared
So is Harold
The Nurse looks hopeful
Kumar looks determined
With a quick thrust, Kumar jabs the needle into the Patient's chest, causing a rush of air
The Patient breathes easier
His heart rate drops back to normal
Great catch doctor
His sat is up to 94
Kumar is cool and collected
He turns to the who have been aiding the surgery
(casual) Will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up
chorus of "yes, doctors
" (taking off his gloves) Well, it looks like my work here is done
Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous
He then leans down to the  , who is just barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits
(') Say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the White Castle in Cherry Hill from here, do you
77
- 1:00                                   77 Harold's car is cruising down some streets lined with stores
78
'                                        78 Harold is very excited
Kumar is proud of himself, but playing it cool
'm telling you
That was amazing
Even your dad would've been impressed
(nonchalant) Yeah
It wasn't bad
28 2003   52A
This is perfect
We're back on the road
We have directions now
The rain let up
And guess what
28 2003    53
clicks on the "" option on his laptop
'm officially done with my work
(beat) 'm telling you, things are finally starting to go our way
While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his surroundings and notices something
Hey, check it out
Your movie's playing
Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater we see: "
- 9:00
- 11:00
And look who went to see it
Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees standing outside, all by herself
He can't believe it
Holy shit
You see
You thought you two had nothing in common
But it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies
Hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to White Castle
No way
Forget about it
Just drive
Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his undivided attention
Harold
It's one in the morning
We're an hour from home
And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and  was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment 'd tell you "this is a sign
" Stop it
28 2003   54
Come on
Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan
with bigger tits
Besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way
Let's just go
presses a button  '
What are you doing
(calling out) Hey Maria
looks up Hey, get your hand off the gas
Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas
Just then, (looking up) Oh shit
Harold's Infiniti grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car safely
is bumping around on the way down the hill
Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a
You asshole
My car's probably all scratched up now
Don't blame me
You're the one who ran us off the road
told you  didn't want to speak to her
(composing himself) Whatever
Let's jut get back on the highway
28 2003     55
Fine
presses the gas
Suddenly, we hear a "
"   Harold and Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated
79
- 1:15                                79 examines the flat tire
Kumar is standing nearby
There's not another car in site
Godammit
You know how to change a flat
Please
Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire
Harold looks in his trunk for the spare
It's missing
Where's my spare tire
don't know
Shit, where the hell is it
Kumar suddenly remembers
Oh yeah
Don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float
What bridge
What the hell are you talking about
(realizing) Oh shit
That's right
was with Goldstein
We borrowed your car that day
My bad
Your bad
What are the hell are we gonna do now
Suddenly, they see   -  driving in their direction
and  wave it down
The truck stops in front of them
The door opens and a   begins walking towards them
Harold and Kumar are nervous
As soon as the  reaches them,
28 2003   56
It's the     -- he's in his fifties, wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, Harold and Kumar jump back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him
You boys need some help
The   takes off his mesh cap
Even his haircut is freaky
He has a  (       )
and  look at each other, freaked out
80
- 1:20                                     80 The  '  tows Harold's Infiniti down a dirt road
81
81 The   is driving
is in the front seat, on the passenger side
is sandwiched between them
Thanks for helping us out
No problem at all
Saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself, "what would Jesus do
" Harold and Kumar look at each other
They then notice a bobble-head doll on the dashboard
So, you boys worship Christ
The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond
Uh
Yeah
Sure, he's great
Great
Good to hear it
The name's Randy
but everyone calls me Freak Show
'm Kumar
This is Harold
Good to meet you, Mr
Freak Show
Pleasure's all mine
After a while,  starts to notice that they're driving in the middle of a dark woods
It looks very sketchy
So where exactly are we going
28 2003    57
Don't worry
My place isn't too far from here
Once we get there, 'll have your ride fixed up in a jiffy
The guys silently continue driving, until  notices a '
(whispering to Harold) Eww-- check out those boils on his neck
nudges him to be quiet
looks back over at and sees that
(whispering) Oh my God
You gotta look
One of them's actually pulsating
(whispering) Will you shut up
He's right next to me
He can hear you
sees that
(whispering) Now there's some sort of puss
It's the most disgusting thing 've ever seen
(whispering) What's the matter with you
You think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying
He's two feet away from us
He can hear this entire conversation
He can hear me talking right now
(whispering) Don't worry, he can't hear anything
Not with all that crust in his ear
gives  a hard elbow to the stomach
He then looks nervously at  , who doesn't seem to have heard a thing
Harold seems relieved
heard every word you said
doesn't say anything else
and  don't know how to react
They feel really uncomfortable
The fact that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them
28 2003   58
82
'  - 1:30                             82 (with laptop in tow) and  stand by their car, as brings out some tools and a new tire from his house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere
Now it's gonna take me a little while here, so if you boys like you can go inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have something to drink, watch tv-- anything you want
Mi casa es su casa
Just don't do anything Jesus wouldn't do
gives  a pat on the back and starts changing the tire
and  look at each other
Slowly, they walk towards  's house
Am  deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife
He couldn't have said that
But he did
It may have been in mid- sentence, but it was still clear as day
They reach the front door and are about to enter
Who cares
You've seen Freak Show
What do you think his wife is gonna look like
83
'                                       83 and  walk inside and see () walk out of the kitchen
She is dressed Daisy Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest
Hi
'm Freak Show's wife, Liane
Would you boys like some pink lemonade
and  can't move
They're awestruck
Let me go bring in a pitcher
leaves to go into the kitchen
Along the way, she turns   on a record player, which starts playing a and  look around the house
There   are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with Freak   Show and Liane's wedding picture
28 2003   59
Okay
It's official
We've entered the Twilight Zone
Dude, Liane is fucking hot
She's not ugly
comes in with the pitcher of lemonade
She pours them drinks and hands them the glasses
Thanks
(beat) So, tell me Liane-- how are things between you and Freak Show presently
Oh, never been better
We love each other very much
looks disappointed
, however, is intrigued
Can  ask-- how does a guy
like Freak Show
end up with a woman like yourself
Well,  met him at choir practice `bout four years ago
Freak Show was very shy back then-- you know, because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck
But he had the most amazing voice -- like a baby canary
Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we talking about the same Freakshow
" Well, one day after Easter service, told him how much  enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out
The rest is history
And we've been in love ever since
ponders this for a moment
He and  begin drinking their lemonade
So you boys gonna fuck me or what
and  spit the lemonade out simultaneously
They look at each other in complete shock
Kumar turns to Harold
28 2003   60
Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first
Wait a second-- what about Freak Show
and this whole Christian thing you guys have going on
(a little offended) Oh, so just because we're passionate about our Lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time
No,  just
Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt
Harold and Kumar stare unabashedly
Harold looks outside the window, where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy
Nevermind
(to Kumar, swinging his hand) Okay, rock, paper, scissors
Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time
Huh
Come on
Give me the double stuff
and  look at each other confused
'm not sure we quite understand
want you both inside me simultaneously
and  look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed
Kumar turns to
Um, are we talking about one hole or two
However you want to do it
28 2003   61
Sorry, no thank you
(to Harold) Shh
Two holes it might not be that bad
(beat) Shotgun anus
Forget it
don't want our balls rubbing against each other
No way
turns to  in desperation
What about blow jobs
Can we get blow jobs
Well
okay
(to Harold) Can you help me with this
Liane walks over to Harold, seductively
Harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do
She takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt
Harold looks over to Kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod
Harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt
The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts
(to Harold, re: breasts) Do you want to play with them
Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane
Okay, let's do that
Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts
Kumar looks on enviously
Liane moans in pleasure as Harold starts to massage her chest
,     , holding a particularly threatening -
Hey boys--  changed your tire
sees  with
What the hell are you doing with my wife
28 2003    62
(scared shitless) Uhh
you said outside that we can have sex with her
runs over to  and grabs him by the collar
most certainly did not say that
No
You did
We both heard you
(calming down) Are you sure
Positive
ponders this
Oh
my mistake then
No problem
Well, since we're all here, why not make it a foursome
Who wants the first reach-around
84
'                                       84 and  burst out the front door and run towards their car
They get in and peel out as fast as they can
85
- 1:45                                      85 Harold's Infiniti is driving down a dusty trail in the woods
86
'                                        86 Okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened
Agreed
28 2003   63
searches for some clue of where they are
Dude,  have no idea where we are
All of a sudden,   waves them down up ahead
Hey, a hitchhiker
Should we pick him up
And get chopped to bits
Are you crazy
Kumar pulls over to the side of the road
Oh, calm down
We're lost
He may know how to get us back on the highway
Fuck that
It's my car
We're not picking up a hitchhiker
The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car
Yo, man, thanks for picking me up
and  look at  and then look at each other
Harold is no longer angry
(to Neil) Uh
excuse me, but
are you Neil Patrick Harris
Yep
Holy shit, dude
Doogie Howser,
was my favorite  show growing up
You were my idol
(curt) Hey, that's great
Do you think we could get going
'm bored as shit back here
87
87 We see Harold's Infiniti drive back onto the road
28 2003   64
88
88 So, Neil,  have to ask you-- did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set
Dude,  humped every piece of ass ever on that show
Even the chick who played the hot nurse
No,  didn't go all the way with her
Hey, you don't know how to get back on the highway, do you
don't even know where the fuck  am right now
was at this party earlier tonight, and this dude hooked me up with some killer
Somehow  ended up getting thrown out of a moving car, and 've been tripping balls ever since
and  both find this to be quite strange
Well, our night's been pretty crazy too
We've been driving around for hours, trying to get to White Castle, but we keep getting sidetracked
Dude, forget White Castle
What we need is some pussy
Huh
It's a fucking sausage fest in here
Let's get us some poon-tang
Then we'll go to White Castle
You don't understand, Neil
We've been craving these burgers all night
've been craving burgers too
Fur burgers, that is
() 28 2003       65
(cont'd) Let's pick up some trim at a strip club
The Doogie line always works on strippers
and  look at each other-- weirded out
Hey, there's a gas station
Let's stop and get directions
quickly makes a turn onto a - leading up to a gas station in the distance
89
/  - 1:50                   89 and  get out of the car
is still in the backseat
The car is still running
We'll be right back, Neil
shakes his head, disappointed
Harold and Kumar start walking over to the
What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris
Why's he so horny
don't know
But we can't let him interfere with our quest
Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them
They have to jump out of the way
Cole parks the jeep and exits with Late night math league meeting, homos
#1 (to Cole) Extreme
(upset) Oh shit
These idiots
Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk into the store
Harold and Kumar enter after them
90
90 and  walk into the store, where they see Cole and the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves
They then begin playing  with a -like
The  (an ) throws out a couple indecipherable protests
28 2003    66
(to Cole and the punks) Please
the pies
do not
Cole and the Punks ignore him
Harold and Kumar then approach the Indian Cashier
Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here
The   shrugs his shoulders
(to Harold) He probably can't speak English
, '
Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to explain it
He mentions numerous streets and routes
It sounds like it's very complicated
Meanwhile, while they are talking,  suddenly sees enter the store, They carry the kayak to the back of the store
Harold has no idea what the hell is going on
and the are too busy talking to notice
Harold watches nervously as
Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off
The guy says the highway's just down the road
We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes
is still focused on  and the
(to Kumar) Huh
Oh, good
(
) , , and the   immediately turn and look at ,     -- In slow motion, we see  swing his paddle around in mid- air,      --   , ,   ,
The    cheer  on, while , , and the   watch in disbelief
28 2003    67
The kayak lands on the floor
gets out and celebrates with his friends
That was so fucking extreme, man
#1 Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten-- one being not so extreme, ten being extremely extreme, 'd give it a nine point five
Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves, bothering other customers
The   begins yelling at them in
Extreme   Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of various   kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an other
Finally, he stumbles upon
He goes   apeshit over his find
#1 Extreme Cheddar
He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth, getting the chips all over the place
The   is still yelling
Cole picks up the Cashier
Extreme Cashier
Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the around and around
Somebody should do something
(to Cole) Hey asshole
Why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something
Oooooooooh
Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the floor
He's pissed
It's clear to Harold that they may get their asses kicked
28 2003   68
(to Kumar) didn't mean you should do something
Cole slowly walks over to Kumar
The two stand face to face
Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior
It's a tense moment
Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit Kumar, trying to get him to flinch
Kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye
The Punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up
Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before
Caught off guard, this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling
(pissed off at himself) Shit
Cole and the Punks burst out laughing
Yeah, that's right, bitch
Try fucking with me one more time
Just try it
Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest
(to Kumar, embarrassed) Come on, lets get out of here
Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated
With their leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating
(like Apu) Thank you, come again
91
/                            91 and  walk back towards their car
Kumar-- you okay
Yeah,  just hate those dicks
(beat) Fuck it
At least now we know where we're going
'm so friggin' hungry
, '
28 2003   69
' , ,   , ,    ,
Harold and Kumar stand there for fifteen seconds, without saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the distance
Eventually, Harold breaks the silence
(calm) Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car
think he did
(to Kumar) You
You had to pick up a hitchhiker
Rold, calm down
Why the hell did you leave the keys in the car
figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy
How was  supposed to know that he'd fuck us over
This is all your fault
This whole fucking night
You know  leased that car
They're gonna make me pay for it
Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store
Where are you going
'm going to call the police
don't want to talk to you anymore
Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face
"Extremes" all around
There's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes
28 2003   70
Harold turns around and walks back towards the street
Kumar walks with him, keeping his distance
They reach the street
On the other side, he sees   "' " Harold presses the ""  on the post next to him
So after you talk to the cops we're still going to White Castle, right
'm not speaking to you
Harold waits for the "' " sign to change
It doesn't
""
You know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster
The computer responds to the first press
Every press after that is extraneous
Thank you, Mr
Wizard
waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again
Jesus Christ
When are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency
The "' " sign still won't change
Kumar looks to the left and then to the right
The street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide
This is ridiculous
Just walk across
It'll change in a second
They stand there for another ten seconds
It doesn't change
Come on, there's not a car in sight
Alright fine
You want me to cross
'll cross
Just leave me alone
Harold starts walking angrily across the street
Finally
28 2003   71
Before Kumar has a chance to follow, a Shit
Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the car and walks over to them
(looking at cop's name- tag) Good evening
Is there a problem, Officer
Palumbo
Is there a problem
Ever hear of jaywalking
Yes
Yes  have
'm so sorry
promise 'll never do it again
Yeah, like  give a fuck
'm writing you up a ticket
begins writing a ticket
Kumar walks over, flabbergasted
ticket
Are you serious
Harold motions Kumar to "shut the fuck up
" (to Kumar, unthreatened) Who the fuck are you, shitwad
(stepping in front of Kumar) Let me apologize for my friend
promise will pay the fine
But actually, 'm glad you're here
You know the  show Doogie Howser,
You see, Doogie Howser just stole my car and
Pipe down and give me your
(to Officer Palumbo) Wait
Hold on
() 28 2003     72
(cont'd) How can you give him a ticket for jaywalking
mean, look at this street
He wasn't causing traffic or anything
Kumar, shut up
(to Kumar) Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass
Bust my ass
Yeah, Koo-mar
Bust your ass
(to Harold) What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with like three o's and shit
What happened to good old fashioned American names like Dave, Jim
Harold points to his
Harold
Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo
Yes
Harold
That's a great name
You should be proud of that name, son
Thank you
hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk away
As you were, ladies
Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it
220 dollars
Are you crazy
Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys
Kumar,  swear to God, if you don't
(to Officer Palumbo) No, no, no
understand what's going on
28 2003   73
Harold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block him
Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement towards him
Hey, hands down
No sudden moves
Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with Palumbo improvising little responses
Let me guess
You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right
You'd pick on guys like us every day
But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, "How can  still give them shit
know
'll become a cop
" Well, congratulations
Your dream's come true
Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed
Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to Palumbo
(to Officer Palumbo) Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket
Or better yet, arrest him
Lock him up
With that,
Kumar sees Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks
Harold's fist ends up hitting   in the face
Oh shit

- 2:30                                     92 The
Harold is behind bars
(calling out) Hey, are you gonna do something about my car
Hello
Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with and his
The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check
Thanks, Mrs
Ogelthorpe
Your donation to our Police Charity is very appreciated
28 2003     74
' Well, thank you for being so understanding about Bradley
promise you he won't ever do it again
Oh, 'm sure he won't
Not after the talk we had, right Brad
Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look
(shaken) Mom-- please take me home
The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a frightened child
Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we see  '    , along with Harold's and
He then starts filing a report on Harold
Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars
Can  at least give you my car's licence plate number
Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio
The search for the   escaped cheetah continues tonight
It was last spotted in Randolph Township,   heading South
Harold turns around and examines his cell
Inside with him is a black man () sitting down, reading a book
Harold sits down, across from Tarik
While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it
So what are you in here for
For being black
Come on
Seriously
sits up
He looks at   who, with his Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation
28 2003   75
am serious
You wanna know what happened
Harold nods
was walking out of a Barnes and Noble, and a cop stops me
Evidently, a black man robbed a store in Newark
Therefore, since 'm black, it was probably me, right
Harold shrugs his shoulders
Well that was the logic the cop used told him  haven't even been to Newark in months
Then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest said, "Hey, 'm not resisting anything
" So he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting
Holy shit
What did you do
kept saying, " understand that 'm under arrest
Please stop beating me
" But that didn't work
Then another cop showed up
Then another
When it was all said and done, it took nine cops to bring me in here
That fucking blows
Tarik nods and continues reading his book
Harold sees that Tarik is remarkably relaxed
don't understand how you're able to be so calm about all this
Son, 'm fat
'm black
can't dance
And  have two gay fathers
've had people messing with me my whole life
(beat) learned a long time ago, there's no point in getting all riled up every time a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time
Because in the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should
28 2003   76
Harold takes this all in
So what are you in here for
Assaulting an officer
They tried to pin that shit on you too
No
actually did hit the cop
But only because  was trying to hit my friend
Well, ex-friend
Suddenly,   hangs up the phone on his desk
He shouts out to the other officers in the room: Hey, listen up guys
Multiple gun shots fired in Millbrook Park
It sounds bad
Finally, some action
'm going
Another cop,  , gets up
No-- 'm going
All six officers in the room jump out of their desks and run for the door
Harold and Tarik can't believe it
93
-                             93 We see the officers get into their   and drive off
94
-                                  94 Harold and Tarik are now left all alone in their cell
That was strange
Suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks
What the hell was that
(
) (from inside the shaft) Rold
Is that you
28 2003   77
Although his voice is muffled, we can hear Kumar's words
Tarik is very confused
(shouting out) Kumar
What the fuck are you doing
(
) Are the cops still there
No, they
Wait a second, did you
(
) called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook park
Jesus Christ
What did you do that for
(
) 'm fucking starving
figured 'd bust you out, and we'd get over to White Castle
Forget it
don't want to get in any more trouble
'm already in here because of you
(
) Hey, fuck you
What did you want me to do
Stand there and take the hit
You know, 've never taken a swing at you before
Never
Well,  never got your car stolen
Hey, 'm trying to read here
(
) Look, Rold, 'm sorry
But you're not the only one dealing with shit
My dad's cutting me off, remember
Hey asshole, 'm in jail
Don't bitch to me about your problems
Just leave me alone
don't want your help
(
) You don't want my help
Fine
'm outta here
28 2003   78
We hear a couple banging sounds from the ventilation shaft
Then a couple more
Then a couple more
Pouting, Harold pretends to ignore it
(
) Uh
Rold
How do  get out of here
Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief
How the hell should  know
(
) This isn't good
We hear the banging noise again
And again
Suddenly, Jesus Christ
Tarik shakes his head
Ow
my ass
Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell
You sure you don't want to get out
And become a fugitive
Are you nuts
The guy has all my information
Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report, Harold's
, and his laptop
So what
We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave
(beat) Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow
Harold thinks about this for a second
Fine
Hurry up
Kumar smiles
He begins searching for a key
28 2003    79
95
-                             95 We see
96
96 Kumar finds      on Palumbo's desk
Yes
was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys
Now  get to try all of them to see which one will
Kumar, hurry the fuck up
Kumar runs over to the cell door
He tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something
What's that smell
Kumar turns his head and sees the     on Officer Reilly's desk
Kumar
Kumar
Kumar can't hear Harold
He's in a trance
We begin to hear a romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the

104
104 Kumar walks away from the cell, goes over to the desk, picks up the bag of weed and caresses it
What the hell are you
Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room, pushing a black man wearing pajamas ( )
Nathaniel seems very gentle
He's even wearing a turtleneck sweater
(to Nathaniel) You thought you could get away with this, huh
Where am
was in bed
didn't fire any gun,  swear
Suddenly, Officer Reilly looks over to the jail cell
(pointing) Look
All the cops turn to the cell
Kumar is still holding the weed
He doesn't know what to do
Harold is scared shitless
(re: Tarik) Shit
Jackson's trying to escape
Tarik looks up from his book
What
Oh, not again
The cops handcuff Nathaniel to the leg of a desk, and run over to the jail cell, ignoring Kumar and the weed
Stop trying to escape
'm not trying to escape
Look at me, 'm sitting down
They turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm into the room
Harold stands back, confused
Tarik leans against the wall, ready to be handcuffed
The cops grab him and throw him down against the bed
28 2003   82
He's trying to break free
Hold him tight
In the midst of all the action, Kumar grabs Harold and pulls him out of the cell
' , along with the police report
They start running out of the room
Kumar's still clinging to the weed
(to Kumar) Wait-- shouldn't we do something about this
(to Harold) If  were you, 'd get out of here as soon as possible
With that, Harold and Kumar run out
105
105 and  (still clinging to the weed) burst out the door and run down the steps
They race through the street and start heading towards a
Hurry up
106
- 3:20                                      106 and  have stopped running
They start catching their breath
Jesus Christ
That place was a fucking mad house
Thanks for getting me out of there, dude
Hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there
(beat, re: weed) Dude, look at this
It's like we went from being broke to being millionaires
Suddenly, they hear what sounds like  '
What was that
Just a coyote
Don't worry
28 2003   83
Aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes
That's only because they sound scary
In one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down
, (') Now cheetahs, they're another story
The  stares  and  down
We're gonna die
Just calm down
Cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit
They're not known for eating humans
, -   '
We're gonna die
Okay, 'll admit, that's not a good sign
But 'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone
and  stand silently
, the  begins walking directly over to
(whispering) This isn't working
Shhh
Suddenly, the '

'
continues screaming for the next
Eventually, he calms down and looks at the
28 2003    84
' (annoyed) thought  told you not to take that jerky
simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten
The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins licking Harold's face in friendship
He likes me
Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up
Dude,  think  have an idea
What is it
'll tell you, but first we have to get really high
Kumar opens the bag of weed
Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse
We see smoke coming up from below
Pan back down
107                                                           107 108
-                                            108 Harold and Kumar are now sitting on top of the , smoking joints
Kumar has a belt around the cheetah's neck like reigns on a horse
Has it come to this
Are we really gonna ride this cheetah
Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet
It's as good as a car
Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away
This is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done
puts his arms around  to hold on
Kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt
28 2003    85
Well, we'll soon find out
(like to a snow dog) Mush
Mush
, ' ,
Dude, am  just really high or is this is actually working
Both
This is great
We'll be at White Castle in no
, Harold lands on the ground-- his head bleeding
His eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious

-                               109 is an -like world-- the entire terrain, with all it's rolling hills,

Along the way, they run by

is shoveling some burgers from the ground into a wheelbarrow
He waves to Harold and Maria
He then takes out a  and starts cutting off the arm he's waving with
and the  , who are playing Twister, while getting high
After a spin of the wheel, Kumar reluctantly gets in a position where it looks like he's taking the Male Nurse from behind
Kumar's not happy
Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill, Harold picks up a burger from the ground
Maria does the same
They proceed to feed each other their burgers
They munch on them, looking into each other's eyes
28 2003   86
love you, Harold
love you, Maria
gets up and runs away
playfully chases her
Maria runs over to a (
) Wow, you guys are really extreme
turns and sees
extremely gay that is
,      ' ,
is shocked
He turns around and sees , She smiles at him Oh Harold
Yes
Yes
Oh, God-- you have the biggest dick of all time
It's so long
And wide, for that matter
Suddenly, Harold turns and sees the lying down near them
He is staring at them, with no expression on his face, with his hand down his pants-- rubbing his penis furiously
Harold is disturbed
Don't worry about him
rolls over so ' ,

What the hell are you doing
'm sorry
You've been out cold for the past half-hour
figured that maybe if did some gay shit you'd wake up
wipes his face with his sleeve
He then gets up-- he sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves
What happened to the cheetah
It ran away
But forget about that have some bad news and some worse news
(nervous) Tell me the worse news first
checked out some road signs
The cheetah took us in the wrong direction
That sucks
What's the bad news
Your laptop is completely destroyed
Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag, broken in pieces
It smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah
Why the hell didn't you say that  was the "worse news"
Well, the laptop really only effects you
Whereas the White Castle situation effects both of us equally
Oh no
No
No
Don't worry, dude
Your laptop's insured
28 2003   88
It's not that
All my work was saved in there
Now  gotta go back to the office and re-do everything
Exactly
First, we'll take a cab over to White Castle, then we'll
Forget White Castle
There's no time
Come on, Rold
You can get that shit done in a couple hours
We can't quit now

112
112 Harold and Kumar stand there, speechless, as Neil drives right past them, splashing a puddle in Harold's face
They stand there, watching silently as  drives off
Harold is now drenched
Muddy water drips from his hair and clothing
He gives Kumar a dirty look
Kumar knows he shouldn't push Harold any further
Fine
We'll find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office
Harold, furious and almost in tears, simply nods "yes
" : 28 2003   89
112A
112A Kumar, disappointed, walks down the road with a miserable Harold
When they reach the corner
(pointing) Look, there's a Krispee Kreme
We'll call from there
113
113 Harold and Kumar walk over to the parking lot
Unfortunately, they notice a familiar
Oh great
Here we go again
and the    are hacky-sacking in the parking lot
Their skateboards are sitting nearby
(
) (to Kumar) Hey Apu
laughs
Kumar tries to ignore him
Who's running the Quik--Mart while you're gone
pounds fists with his friends
(to Rold) Fucking asshole
Suddenly,  stops in his tracks
He's noticed something through the Krispee Kreme window
He stops  and points
Look
Through the window, we see  and  inside, sitting at a booth
They both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk
It looks like they just sat down
Goldstein savors his first bite of his and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his
and  watch through the window longingly
28 2003   90
(yearning) want that
What
chocolate cream filled
No
want that feeling
(beat) The feeling that comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires
(beat) that feeling
Are you saying what  think you're saying
We gotta go to White Castle
gives  a hug
Yes
knew you had it in you
Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside
Someone else is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table
Is that Cindy Kim
Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein
Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut
It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are "an item
" You should have boned her when you had the chance
Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack
Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold
(to Cole) Hey, why don't you just leave us alone
Oh yeah
What are you gonna do about it, Mr
Miagi
Cole gets in the   a la
Harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at Cole's little racist routine
He then lets out a little laugh
28 2003   91
Nothing
Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee Kreme entrance
Kumar follows
In the background Cole and the Punks are laughing about what a "pussy" Harold is
(pissed off, but powerless) Fuck
'm so sick of their bullshit
(totally calm) Don't worry
The universe tends to unfold as it should
Kumar gives a "What the fuck is he talking about
" look
Besides,  have a plan
Follow my lead
Your lead
Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads towards the   at a brisk pace
follows
,   ' '
One of the Extreme Sports Punks sees Harold doing this
#1 Hey, Cole
Look
Cole turns to see Harold in his car
Kumar is about to get in the passenger's side
Cole and the Punks start running towards the car
Kumar sees this and quickly gets inside
puts the car in reverse, nearly hitting the punks
114
'                                       114 Harold is shifting gears
What the hell are you doing
'm stealing their car
This is your plan
It's working isn't it
28 2003    92
Harold drives the car out of the parking lot
Cole and the Punks give chase on their skateboards
(laughing) Hey, slow down to like 25 mph, so they think they have a chance to catch up
115
115 Harold drives '  down at a speed just slow enough for  and the  to think that they have a chance
116
'                                       116 Kumar then sticks his head out the window
(in thick Indian Accent) Thank you, come again
Harold guns it-- leaving Cole and the Punks in the dust
117
117 We see Cole and the Punks watching in disbelief as Harold and Kumar drive off with their car
#1 Dude, that was so  extreme
know Extreme Sports Punk #1,  know
The Extreme Sports Punks walk away, leaving Cole by himself
118
'                                       118 and  are laughing and slapping five
Victory is sweet
Nice job, Roldy
had to do something
begins sniffing something in the air
Wait
Do you smell that
keeps sniffing
He turns around to the back seat
He reaches back and picks something up from off the floor
It's a   bag
He pours out the contents and we see fall onto Kumar's lap
28 2003   93
Those assholes got to have White Castle
This world is so unfair
Don't worry
Forget about that
We have a car now
We're back in the game
Pretty soon we'll be eating our own White Castle
Want me to drive
No
've got everything under control
We should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after our feast
Just find us some tunes
tape is resting in the tape deck
pushes it in
and  look at each other amazed that  has some lame chick song on his tape
Those guys are fucking posers

We see signs indicating they're getting closer to Cherry Hill
120
'                                      120 Harold and Kumar are now listening to another lame chick song
While they aren't fully embracing the song, it's clear they're kind of enjoying it

125 They're speeding down a road lined by forests on both sides
We see the Jeep speeds by a
126

126 (middle-aged, tough, toothpick in his mouth) sees the yellow jeep speed by
He reloads his rifle
Bingo
127
'                                       127 and  are still singing
All of a sudden,  and  hear a

And 'm gonna need back-up

The Jeep pulls away

'                                       131 looks determined as he puts the pedal to the metal
What are you doing
'm not going back to jail
We've come too far
Now buckle up

Buckle up
Kumar buckles his seat belt

132 The   goes around a turn in the road and then ,
We then see the   go around the turn
It passes by the point where  and  entered the forest
133
133 From  ' , we see that he has a long stretch ahead, with no cars in sight
What the hell
He puts his foot on the brakes, bringing the car to a screeching halt
gets out of the car and looks around wondering where the   went 134
- 6:35
134 The Jeep bounces up and down as it heads uphill in the woods
135
135 Harold is holding onto the wheel for dear life
Kumar is scared as shit
They're both bouncing up and down
Where the hell are we going
Just hold on
136
136 The Jeep continues going uphill, higher and higher
137
137 Harold and Kumar are still bouncing up and down
It's a good thing  have an empty stomach, or else 'd puke right now

Don't worry

Everything's gonna be

Shit
Fuck

- 6:40                                         138 We see the jeep stop just short of the cliff
Harold and Kumar get out of the jeep and walk over to the edge of the cliff and look down

,
(pointing) Rold
Look out there

Oh shit
We're trapped
Kumar notices something
Not necessarily
walks over to the  and points to the -
No
No way
Not a chance
'd rather turn myself in than die
Dude, it's okay
used to hang-glide with my dad all the time when  was kid

You hang-glided

We did it on our trips   to India swear

've even done it with   two people at the same time
My brother    and  did it
() 28 2003       97
(cont'd) Just hold onto the outside bars and let me take care of the rest
No, Kumar
'm not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers
walks over to  and stares him in the eye
You think this just about the burgers, huh
Well, let me tell you-- it's about far more than that
walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the
The sun is still rising
The scene is very picturesque
Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger
Hunger, Harold
They were very, very hungry
And they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals land where their kids could study and get into good colleges
land filled with hamburger stands
And not just one type of hamburger
Hundreds of types-- with different sizes, toppings, and condiments
That land was America
(turning to Rold) You think this is just about the burgers
No
This is about achieving what our parents set out for
This is about the pursuit of happiness
This is about the American dream
walks over to
And so we've reached this point
The point which all men eventually have to face
The point of no return
(beat) We can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle
Or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom
leave the decision up to you
From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are getting closer
Harold turns back, facing Kumar
28 2003    98
hate you, Kumar

- 6:45                                 139 , -
Hurry up
they're almost here
Grab onto the end of the bars and hold on tight
does as he's told
They are both holding onto the bars (Harold behind Kumar)
Okay
Here's how this is gonna work
On the count of three, we're gonna run to the edge of the cliff
When  say "jump," launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool, got it
(nervous) think so
Don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine
Are you ready
's too nervous to speak
gets into position
Okay, here goes
One

and
Good job, Rold
Keep running
'
Rold, there's something  gotta tell you
've never hang-glided before

28 2003   99
The hang glider coasts through the air for a couple seconds
, ,
, Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Dude, it's working
can't believe you lied to me
Hey, how else was  gonna convince you to jump off a cliff

- 6:46                                           140 gets out of the car, holding his rifle and runs over to the jeep
He looks inside
(to the walkie-talkie) It appears they've escaped
They ditched their jeep
opens the front door of the car and peers inside
He notices
He opens it and    in the same way a drug cop would taste cocaine during a bust
(to the walkie-talkie) Good news
found enough dope in the car to send those skateboard punks to jail for the next couple years
Looks like they've terrorized their last convenience store
Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth is strangely appealing
He thinks for a beat as he eyes the bag of weed
He then takes another taste of it
He looks again at the bag
Like Kumar, we can tell that he's in love

- - 6:50                                        141 Our triumphant heros are gliding across the morning sky
Harold and Kumar look down as they soar above the trees
Dude, we're so high right now
We're not low
They continue gliding though the sky for a while
Hey, Kumar
Yeah
How are we gonna get down
Uh
well
guess it's just gonna go down at some point
That's a great answer
Made me feel really comfortable
Thanks a lot
looks down as they fly over a playground
Is it a problem if we fly into birds
Why do you ask
28 2003    101
Because we're about to
looks up and sees at least Oh shit
Numerous birds collide with their faces
Ahhhh
My eyes
Don't peck out my eyes

We're gonna die

- We're gonna live
Ha
Ha
We're gonna live

That wasn't so bad

(breathing heavily) That's it
'm gonna kill you
Stop

That's the point

Rold
You're gonna die
(pointing) Rold

' , -- '    , 142
- 7:00                                   142 Harold and Kumar walk inside
Their shirts are torn and tattered, their bodies are scratched up, and they're covered in dirt
Everyone in the restaurant turns and stares at them
They approach the counter, where
Looks like you guys had some night, huh
Harold and Kumar look at each other, and then back at the teenager
Their expressions are stone cold
want thirty slyders
want five french fries
want four large Cherry cokes
Same
Only make mine Diet Cokes
Wow
That comes to
forty-two dollars and seventy-five cents
and  take out their
Hey
hey
hey
where's my money
28 2003   103
You don't have money
Shit,  gave all mine to that asshole at Princeton
Fuck that hippie fuck
This can't be happening
We're so close and we're fucking broke
'  (
) Let me take care of it
and  turn around and see finishing his coke
He throws it in the trash
and are stunned
What are you doing here
You guys kept talking about White Castle last night
It made me start craving it too
Where's my fucking car you prick
Yeah
Sorry about that
Like  said, was tripping balls last night
don't know what came over me
Your car's out in the parking lot
Here are the keys
tosses  the car keys
Do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car
know
It was a dick move on my part
That's why 'm paying for your meal
Harold and Kumar look at each other, relieved
Thanks,  guess
hands them some cash
Here's fifty for the meal, and two hundred for the car
(concerned) What happened to the car
28 2003   104
made some love stains in the back seat
You'll see
Anyway, take it easy guys
'll see you around
Where are you going
Wherever God takes me
With that,  walks out of the restaurant
and look at each other, confused
Hey guys
it's gonna take a little while to make all those burgers
You might as well sit down
and  walk over to a booth and take a seat
Dude, we're here
Isn't it great
know
can't believe we made it we got the car back
If we can just get out of here in a half hour,  can get back to my office and get the work done
Hey, look
points to a  in the corner of the restaurant
On the screen we see
: Today's top story
Rutgers professor Tarik Jackson and attorney Nathaniel Banks are suing the state of New Jersey for racial discrimination and police brutality
We go live to the municipal state courthouse in Muckleburg
Tarik and Nathaniel have a bunch of microphones in front of them
What happened last night was a complete moral travesty
My family and  are outraged and will not settle for anything less than justice
28 2003   105
We see Tarik joined by his parents (Two Old Gay Black Men-- one is comforting the other)
Nathaniel walks in front of the microphone
(very professional) And by justice, we mean somewhere in the ballpark of ten million dollars
(to Kumar) Hey, good for those black guys
: We see footage of   and    taken away in handcuffs
'm not racist
This is bullshit
If those black bastards think they're gonna get away with this, they've got another thing coming
Me and my white buddies are gonna [bleep] them up
Officer Palumbo gets shoved forcefully into the back of a police car
Harold and Kumar enjoy this
: This just in
police have arrested a gang of hooligans
We see a picture of  and the    in the corner of the screen
after they found their abandoned car in the forest in Clifton, containing a large bag of marijuana
The young men could face up to five years in prison
and  slap five
: 28 2003   106
And finally
the Muckleburg Police Department has informed us that they looking for   who escaped from the Police Station last night, along with a companion, believed to be his accomplice
'
He's scared shitless
: Police have made the following sketch of the two fugitives, which they believe to be quote "extremely accurate
" ,        "" and ""-- ; ,
(to Harold and Kumar) Hey, guys
got your orders
and  run out of the booth
151
-                              151 and  have put three tables together, on which we see    --
-  ( and ) stare at Harold and Kumar's orders, amazed by their size
They then look at their own orders and realize how worthless they are
and  are sitting across from one another, looking at the smorgasbord in front of them ,
Wait
let's do it together
, 28 2003   106A
, 28 2003   107
'
152
- 7:45                                152 and  have finished their meals
They both look full and satisfied
Harold takes one last sip of his soda
Oh
that hit the spot
It was the best meal of my life
Mine too
The two of them sit there, looking at all the empty containers and wrappers
After a long pause of silence, speaks
Dude, you know what
think  may actually go to my interview today
Seriously
Yeah
You know, my whole life 've been afraid being just another nerdy Indian guy turned doctor
Well, tonight got me thinking
, -- '
There are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine
pretends to be listening to -- , who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door
Like having boils all over your face
Or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through
(not paying attention) Uh-huh
28 2003   108
Besides,  have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night
Somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris,  realized that 've always wanted to be a doctor-- 've just been too scared to admit it
sees that  isn't paying attention
Hey, Rold, are you listening to me
'm having a major epiphany here
'll be right back
At that moment,  and
walk in the restaurant with their women,  and , respectively
looks like some bimbo slut that
picked up at a strip club
, On the other hand, has a sweet   quality about her
She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple
Hey, Billy-- you paying for this or what
'll be there in a second
and  check out the menu
takes  aside-- whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you complete me" moment
Look,  have to admit something to you
At the start of last night, all  really cared about was getting some
But then met you, Zoe
You're so different from all the other women 've ever met
You're smart, funny, artistic
guess what 'm trying to say is
(
) What the fuck is going on here
turns around and sees
Harold
What are you
Never mind me
What are you doing here
thought you and
were busy all night with "clients
" Isn't that why had to do  work
28 2003   109
hears the commotion and turns around
Hey
What the hell is going on here
Back off, cock boy
What  have to say to him goes double for you
sees what's going on-- he can't believe it
Cock boy
'm sorry, but did you just call me "cock boy
" Yeah, you know  did
You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback
Oh, 'm not quick enough
(to Billy) He thinks 'm not quick enough
(to Harold) Well,  got news for you
(long beat, thinking) am quick enough
(beat) cock boy
is embarrassed
tries to placate the situation
Listen Harry
(to Billy) Don't even bother with him
We'll just tell Berenson later
Tell him what
That 'm your work horse
That you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet Asian guy in your office
Huh
is stunned
Now he's a little nervous
No, no-- you don't understand
No,  don't understand
'm not doing your work anymore
() 28 2003       110
(cont'd) And if either one of you douchebags ever tries to pull this shit again, 'll go to Berenson and tell him what's really going on
Harold notices Traci and Zoe listening
And 'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore
and  hear this and are freaked out
They slowly back away from  and
Now, if you'll excuse me,  have to get going
See you on Monday
leaves the
follows
Billy and
are left embarrassed and in shock
153
153 and  walk over to Harold's Infiniti
Way to go, Rold
Where the hell did that come from
don't know
Eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man
Now 'm actually looking forward to work this week
No shit
guess you're worthwhile after all
'm not worthless
So those dudes have gonorrhea
Beats me
(beat) Now, come on, let's get going
What's the rush
There's plenty of time before my interview
28 2003     111
have some unfinished business to take care of
They both get into the car (Harold gets in the driver's side)
The car zooms out
154                                                           154 155

- 9:02                       157 The elevator doors open
Harold and Kumar exit
Kumar gives Harold a pat on the back
Good luck, dude
stands behind, while  approaches ' door
, , -- -,    () What do you want
'
(lying) Oh
uh
nothing
wrong room
(
) Come back to bed
(calling to woman) Hey, Papi's coming
Hold on
(to Harold, laughing) This girl is crazy, man
() 28 2003       112
(cont'd) She seemed so sweet at first, but it turns out she's into some pretty freaky shit
She even did this thing where she took a lollipop and shoved it
(grossed out/depressed) Look,  really don't need to hear it guess  just made a mistake
Sorry for interrupting you guys
Harold starts to walk away, almost crying
, Kumar feels sorry for his friend
Just then, Luis leans his head out the door
Hey-- if you're looking for Maria, she left for Europe this morning
Harold quickly turns around and runs back over
Huh
She's going to Amsterdam for ten days
'm Luis -- Maria's brother
Luis shakes Harold's hand
Harold suddenly feels better
Oh
Maria's brother
You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps talking about
Actually, 'm Kor
wait a second-- she talks about me
(), wearing only a bra and g-string, walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him
Are you coming or what
Hey, 'll be there in a second, baby
Do me a favor-- make me that omelette you were talking about
You know, with the sun-dried tomatoes
Aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen
Luis gives her a little a slap on the ass
Harold doesn't quite know how to respond to this
28 2003   113
(to Harold) So you want me to leave her a message or something
Uh, no thanks
'd rather do it in person
Then take it easy, hermano
Luis shuts the door
Kumar runs over to Harold
Dude
we gotta go
Huh
Where
To Amsterdam
We can pack up right now and take the next plane
What are you talking about
Are you out of your mind
What about your interview with the med school guy
Whatever
'll tell my dad to reschedule it
He won't have a problem, as long as 'm taking it seriously for a change
Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria
She's coming back in ten days
It's not like 'm never gonna see her again
For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is the kiss of death
There are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over her
By the time she gets back, she may not be available
Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying
Forget it
'll just wait till she comes back
Harold starts to walk away from Kumar
Hey, Rold
Wait
28 2003   114
Harold stops
You do realize what's legal in Amsterdam, right
