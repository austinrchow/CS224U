Hey, you're Jake right
Tom's brother
You look just like him

Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it
He was a great guy -- funny
It was a big shock to all of us
Yeah
Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on
Norm walks with him
And duh
-- obviously you look like him

That's why 'm here
So -- you want to go check it out

Yeah, they mature on the trip out

Yeah, they've got great muscle tone
Give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin

No, it looks like you
This is your avatar now, Jake

) The idea is -- every driver is matched to his own avatar -- -- facing the camera, talking directly to the lens

Or something
Which is why they offered me this gig, because  can link with Tommy's avatar, which was insanely expensive
(looking off camera) Is this right
just say whatever in these videologs
, showing Norm working nearby with Max
Yeah
You just need to get in the habit of documenting everything -- what you see, what you feel -- it's all part of the science
Good science starts with good observation
13
Right
(to camera) So, whatever
Here  am
Doing science

He leads Jake and Norm through the short corridor to the -- : - The   contains a dozen   , which look like coffins crossed with  scanners

She's fifty, with a strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes

Around here they jump when Grace barks
Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach
And here she is, Cinderella back from the ball
Grace, 'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Ja -- Norm
hear good things about you
How's your Na'vi
14
(Na'vi, subtitled) May the All Mother smile upon our first meeting
Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette
() Not bad
You sound a little formal
() There is still much to learn
Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na'vi
Uh, Grace, this is Jake ---- (turning to Jake) Yeah, yeah,  know who you are, and don't need you
need your brother
(to Max) You know -- the PhD who trained three years for this mission
He's dead
know it's a big inconvenience to everyone
How much lab training have you had
Ever run a gas chromatograph
No
Any actual lab work at all
High school chemistry
But  ditched
Grace wheels on Max
You see
You see
They're pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain
(turning away) 'm going to Selfridge

She shoves past Jake
Grace, that's not a good idea
But she's already out the door and clomping down the corridor
Max turns to Jake with a pained look
Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred
Try to use big words

Selfridge is young, charismatic, focused
Some would say ruthless
He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a practice cup across the control room floor
He glances up as Grace strides toward him
Parker,  used to think it was benign neglect, but now  see you're intentionally screwing us
Grace
You know  enjoy our little talks
need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout
Selfridge looks down and hits the ball
Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past
Selfridge looks at her with a sigh
Actually, we got lucky with him
Lucky
How is this in any way lucky
As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball -- 16
Well -- lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an oral hygienist or something
Marine we can use
'm assigning him to your team as security escort
The last thing  need is another trigger happy asshole out there
Look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts and minds of the natives
Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show
If you look like them, if you talk like them, they'll trust you
Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby
Grace follows
But after -- how many years
-- relations with the indigenous are only getting worse
That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them
On Selfridge's desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid- air, in the invisible field, is a lump of

He grabs it and holds it up between thumb and forefinger, in front of Grace's eyes
This is why we're here
Unobtanium
Because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo
No other reason
This is what pays for the party
And it's what pays for your science
Comprendo
He places it back in the magnetic field
Those savages are threatening our whole operation
We're on the brink of war and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution
So use what you've got and get me some results

Norm slips into his  , expertly donning biometric sensors
How much link time have you logged
Five hundred and twenty hours
Grace looks pointedly at Jake
Like -- an hour
Tell me you're joking
Grace opens the hood of Jake's link unit
Jake starts hauling himself across from his wheelchair
She reaches to help him but -- Don't
got this
Grace steps back, hands raised
He drags himself into the unit
So you just figured you'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went
What was going through your head
He meets her eyes with a defiant glare
Maybe  was just tired of doctors telling me what  couldn't do
Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the link chair by hand

Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit
It seems to enfold him
Grace adjusts his biometric sensors, then lowers the   -- Relax and let your mind go blank

The link is stable
Blinking, Jake slowly sits up on the gurney
He looks down at his  , touching his chest with one hand
Take it slow, Jake
We need to check your motor control
Try touching your fingertips together -- But Jake isn't listening
He's staring at his legs
He eases them off the gurney and -- touch the concrete floor, taking his weight
, feeling the strength in his legs
His expression is child-like with wonder
-- looking down at the med techs, who seem the size of children next to his 9' tall frame
He sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm and he   in alarm
As he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a table with a crash
Jake laughs and grins at Max
Easy, Jake,  need you to sit down -- But Jake takes a step, then another
The wires to the bio- monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest
Jake
Wait, we have to run some tests -- But Jake pushes past the protesting med techs, toward the door and -- - Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun
He finds himself in the   -- a living and training area
Nearby, a couple of  are playing one-on-one in front of a (non-regulation height) basketball net
Others go about their daily activities around the compound

Jake flexes his legs --  -- and lands a little unsteadily, but his expression is joyful
He takes a few steps and breaks into a
People are calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's running
He finds himself in the  , and stops amid neatly tended rows of
He looks down, wiggling his toes in the warm soil
Then inhales deeply -- revelling in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest
He looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world

) Hey Marine
Jake turns at the familiar voice to see -- statuesque   walking toward him is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach and firm athlete's breasts
She wears shorts and a -shirt
In human years she would be about 35
Grace
Well who'd you expect, numbnuts
Think fast
She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches
Motor control is looking good
Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin

Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his eyes scanning
Flanking the squad,   drives an , his massive feet  through the underbrush
As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the trail -- an intricate  of woven sticks, bones and feathers hanging across the trail like an orb-weaver's web
He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it into the mud as he moves on
- Jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropical-style construction -- beamed ceiling, open sides covered by screen
Around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night, pulling insect netting around their cots
In one hand, Jake holds the end of his long braided  of hair

That's kinda freaky

Jake sits in the twilight, listening to the  and from the forest
Finally he lies down, and -- - -- his eyes
Jake blinks, disoriented, as Max opens the upper clamshell of his link unit
In the next chair Grace sits up, yawning and cracking her neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette

Grace is engaged in a heated conversation with another
Jake, isolated from the conversations around him, notices -- approaching, dressed in her flight suit
She's a rock-hard former Marine with thousands of flight hours out in the badlands
Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in the Armor Bay
Jake gives Norm a puzzled glance and pivots from the table
He wheels away, led by Trudy

There are the heavily armed  as well as several -2  work-horses outfitted with door guns and rocket pods
You guys're packing some heavy ordinance
Yeah, `cause we're not the only thing flyin' around out there
Or the biggest

Yeah, no problem
She extends her fist and he taps it with his
See ya on the flight-line, zero nine
(she points) He's down there
Jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the Armor Bay, passing rows of  standing in service racks
Techs clamber over the `suits, loading ordinance with cranes and lifts
24
At the end of the row is a makeshift  area

This low gravity makes you soft
(pushing the last rep) You get soft, Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning
Quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded

Venezuela -- that was some mean bush
Nothing like this here, though
You got heart kid, coming out here

Quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder
The   yells from the nearest  -- That servo's in, Colonel, if you want to try it
Quaritch crosses to the `suit, with Jake following

More than a few
Two tours in Nigeria, not a scratch

They could fix this if  rotated back
But you know what

Reminds me every day what's out there
Besides,  can't leave -- He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree- line
This is my war, here
Quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit, throwing some switches
The `suit's gas-turbine spools up with a rising
25
The avatar program is a joke -- buncha limpdick scientists
But we have a unique opportunity here, you and recon Marine in an avatar body could get me the intel  need, on the ground, right in the hostiles' camp
The  is now a roaring  as the `suit trembles with power
The air boils above the exhaust vents
Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one huge hand
He nods to the waiting mechanic -- Looks good
(to Jake) need you to learn about these savages, gain their trust
Find out how  can force their cooperation, or hit `em hard if they don't
Maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you
Or bagged-and-tagged
() That sounds real good, Colonel
So -- am still with Augustine
On paper
You walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me
Can you do that for me
Jake nods
Quaritch brings the `suit to life
He steps forward and pivots smoothly
He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong, graceful arcs
Jake realizes he is doing a -
flawless display of strength and control
He's impressive, and Jake is impressed
Quaritch is the kind of man he respects -- focused, hard
Determined
Look, son --  take care of my own
Get me what  need, 'll see you get your legs back when you rotate home
Your real legs

That means you're in my world, got it
Got it
She turns and enters the
Grace crosses to the controls of Jake's
As the others catch up -- That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough
All this -- (indicating link room) -- exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much
But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't even talk to us anymore
Then how's this supposed to work
27
We have a new face
(turning to Norm) You're fluent, you've studied the culture
You're non-threatening
The ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan -- may give you a chance
Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good
This is failing as a pep talk
Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link
How do we contact them
We don't
They contact us
If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect -- (pointedly to Jake) Not trampling everything in sight -- they may reach out to us
Or they may skin us and make a drum
Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body

She banks to follow a shallow river
() Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock
Norm grins and points, excitedly
Jake looks in time to see-- herd of  -- massive six-legged creatures reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river
Looks like a bull, six cows and some juveniles
The bull has the red on the dorsal armor
Grace nods approvingly
-- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight from a lake, startled by the Samson
They skim the water above their own reflections
-- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a hundreds of feet high
Trudy banks hard, rolling in on the gorge below like it's a gun-run
Wainfleet  while Norm looks like he's about to puke
Yo Chacon
Get some
Jake grins into the airstream
: - small meadow among towering trees
The fern-like "grass" is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson settles to the ground
Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and hefts it like an assault rifle
He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the , scanning the tree- line warily, weapons aimed
Grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning Trudy to shut down
Trudy kills the Samson's
Grace, towering over Wainfleet, motions him to hang back

Stay with the ship
(for Jake) One idiot with a gun's enough
Whatever you say, Doc
Jake takes point as they enter the jungle
() Ya'll have fun out there
- The forest engulfs ,  and  in cyan gloom
The shadows are alive with the  sounds of unseen alien wildlife
as he moves through the foliage, hyper- alert -- looking around like a tourist in Hell
monkey-like leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing through the sunlight streaming down in shafts
with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he passes
This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that react and move like animals
Jake white-knuckles his rifle as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death
Relax, Marine
You're making me nervous
She pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower his muzzle as he follows her
Grace moves nimbly on the path, seemingly unconcerned
: / as the party moves between the huge trees, tiny as ants
The trail has gotten steeper, the going tougher

It is covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it

How will they know we're here
'm sure they're watching us right now
Norm gulps
Jake looks behind him as they approach the school, feeling unseen eyes
: '  as he steps among dried leaves and a few moldering '
Floorboards
(
) The kids were so bright, so eager to learn
they picked up English faster than  could teach it to them
as Jake explores the room
Grace and Norm are selecting from storage cases on a wooden table
Bring the soil probe -- right there, yellow case
Jake looks up at a  among the dark rafters
Roosting eye him warily, fluttering their wings
Grace picks up a moldering copy of "The Lorax" by Dr
Seuss from the floor and puts it back on a shelf
() The stingbats knock them off
guess always hope somebody will come back and read them
Why don't they come back
() The Na'vi learned as much about us as they needed to know
Jake sees something, and approaches the blackboard -- reaches out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate
Unmistakably

(turning to her) What happened here
() Are you going to help with this gear
We've got a lot to do
She turns away
Jake watches her as he jams equipment into his pack

Curious, Jake touches another --
And another -- like popping balloons after a party
chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into the ground,  -- Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but twice that size
Its massive, low-slung head has projections of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark
Its baleful eyes lock onto him
Jake raises his rifle
Grace, alerted by the creature's , runs to where she can see the tableau
She presses her
Don't shoot
You'll piss it off
32
The bull  bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide sledgehammer of a skull
It's already pissed off
Jake, that armor's too thick
Trust me
Jake starts to back away
The hammerhead bellows again, pawing the earth
It's a territorial threat display
Do not run, or he'll charge
What do  do
Hold your ground
The hammerhead  its head sideways, splintering saplings
It bellows again, lowers its head and  -- Jake  at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide and runs straight at the thing

Who's bad
That's right

It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored head and massive distensible jaws

The bull wheels around,  in fear, and  away through splintering undergrowth

That's right motherf-- guttural  behind him
Jake spins in time to see -- of rippling thanator  over him, landing between him and the hammerhead
The ground shakes
The thanator emits an earsplitting , enraged that the hammerhead got away
It twists on itself, turning to face Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal
What about this one
Run, don't run
What
Run
Definitely

With rippling muscle the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but -- dives under a massive root system, and -- Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the root-trunks above him
Claws  down next to him as he rolls and crawls -- Glistening jaws  and  against the barrier trunks, sending chunks of wood flying

The beast  an ungodly  of pain and rage and --  the away

Jake is swept over the falls, with the thanator  at him from a rock, just  and -- Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract
- The water boils below the cataract
Jake's head bursts through the surface, and he gasps for breath
He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a limb on a fallen tree
He weakly pulls himself up, and just lies there gasping on the trunk
Above him, on the cliff, the  , a roar which echoes across the jungle
: - , wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant leaves
He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip
- with Jake as he walks through the forest like it's a minefield, carrying his  white-knuckled
He is freaked and hyper-alert
35
The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the sky
few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the cyan gloom
-- looking down through leaves we watch Jake move warily through the forest
--   , bright in the shadows
as Jake passes under a tree limb
Invisible to him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking ' She watches, only her eyes moving
She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders, and nubile breasts
And she is devastatingly beautiful -- for a girl with a tail
In human age she would be 18
Her name is (nay-Tee-ree)
Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious

In one fluid, sinuous movement she  an arrow to her  and , aiming Utterly silent
Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing for the shot -- -- and  drifts down in front of her,

Grace looks to the west
The sun setting behind alien trees
Shit
Sorry, Doc
He's just gonna have to hang on `till morning
He's not going to make it till morning
Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard, thundering away toward the setting sun
: - --
The giant planet rises behind the black trees
Jake's got a new problem
He sees shapes moving with liquid grace in the  shadows behind him
He is being stalked by a pack of
Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking black movement -- then nothing
Darkness
--   Jake's hands as he knots his -shirt around the butt end of the spear
trickling down a tree-trunk
Jake jams the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it
from his survival kit lights the torch
The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing, leaping shadows
Jake turns warily as he moves along the trail
Behind him are several pairs of reflective green
Another pair flanking him beside the trail
Black-on-black which seem to flow like liquid
He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead
Another on his opposite flank
Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic
The  can run like a dog and climb like a monkey
They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees
37
by torch-light, on the edge of panic
He reaches a steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it on a horizontal trunk -- -- and   on the other side
The torch illuminates cutting ahead of him across the trail
The viperwolves have him encircled
The psychotic  become more intense as they signal each other, getting excited
at him, angling on his legs from behind but -- , jamming the torch in its face
It yips and goes past, but  moves in -- He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it , retreating, baring its fangs
Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees what he's up against
The  are six-limbed with shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery
Intelligent eyes
Glistening black teeth in dead white gums
Jake realizes that he is making his final stand
He whirls the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay -- And feels a rush of adrenaline
It goes through him like a lightning bolt and the fear is gone
() don't have all goddamn night
Come on
Come on
With snarls and a blur of motion
Jake  the spear down on one, then  as -- at him and he plants the spear in it, striking true, but -- Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes flying
Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his  as-- , sinking its teeth into his arm
He  in pain and fury,  with the knife which -- deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go
, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf leaps,  him by the ankle with its fore-hand
Jake tears away, sprawling,  to get up as -- 38
charge at once
The nearest  at his throat just as -- -- an  appears in its chest
The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight
He pushes it off in time to see -- emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw and  in one fluid motion
as another wolf falls
right over Jake, and  her bow down on the skull of a circling wolf
at her and she drops under its weight, but rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand
Her knife  down, buried to the hilt in its chest
, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he  it away, but -- It  and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its throat in time to keep the   away from his face
Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves
Rrreeyaaah
Hyaaaah
The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past them
Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and-- They bound away through the foliage as she  after them-- Raaaarrrr
Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his weight
Finally it stops thrashing
Panting, he releases it and looks up at -- Her tail  as she scans the forest, listening to the fading  of the wolves
Satisfied the attack is over, she turns
She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him
Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream
Wait, don't -- 39
Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still see
In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest is transformed
The jungle has come alive with  -- spots and patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light
Jake scrambles to recover his spear
Neytiri kneels beside -- It's  are pitiful
It paws the air, trying to raise its head
She pulls her  from its chest
(in Na'vi) Forgive me, my brother
She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries
She touches its head gently, regarding it with sadness
Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her waist
She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling the arrow from its heart
Look, um,  know you probably don't understand this
But -- thanks
Thank you
owe you
Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal
(in Na'vi) Forgive me
May your spirit run with the Great Mother
would have been screwed if you hadn't come along -- She rises and walks away without looking at Jake
Hey, wait
Wait
Where you goin'
He crashes through some plants, catching up to her
Slow down a second will you
just want to thank you for killing those -- He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and -- 40
She  him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat
He looks up to see a  standing over him
Fury who speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English
Don't thank
You don't thank for this
This is sad
Very sad, only
Okay, 'm sorry
Whatever  did -- 'm sorry
She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves
All this is your fault
They did not need to die
They attacked me
How'm  the bad guy -- She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat
Your fault
You are like a baby, making noise, don't know what to do
You should not come here, all of you
You only come and make problems
Only
Jake gets up, slowly, facing her
Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends
So why not just let them kill my ass
What's the thinking
Neytiri -- looking away
Finally, reluctantly, her eyes for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big gold orbs
Why save you
Yes, why save me
You have a strong heart
No fear
She leans closer -- 41
But stupid
Ignorant like a child
She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her

Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far above the forest floor
Throughout the following they move through a

Sky people can not learn
You do not See
She leaps to another elevated root
Jake follows, surprised that he made it
Whooaa
He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace

" She stops and he almost runs into her
No one can teach you to See
Then she turns and trots on

Vines hang down a hundred feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other night flyers

Look,  think we just got off on the wrong foot and -- 42
Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height
--you just have to get to know me

Jake Sull-- vine catches his spear and spins him off balance
He drops the spear and almost falls off the root
Whooaaa -- shit
Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep
He watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river
She pulls him upright

You should not be here
So take me with you
No
You go back

She seizes his hand and pulls him after her
Come

He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence shiver through them

The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach

Feel her heartbeat, her breath
Feel her strong legs
Jake closes his eyes, nodding
One with the horse

The magnificent animals drink from the edge of the pool
Tsu'tey watches Jake's riding lesson with disdain
You may tell her what to do -- (she touches her head) -- inside
For now, say where to go
Forward

Jake flops around, with no idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly
He lands painfully in the mud
He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads the horse back to him
Again
-- Jake falls off the horse in various ways, seemingly landing harder each time
, face down in the mud of the riverbank
He painfully rises to hands and knees
Which is when he sees -- ' and another  thundering across the shallow river on their direhorses
Spray blasts up from their hooves
Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu'tey stops his horse next to him, looking down with disdain
' You should go away

Tsu'tey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back
' () This alien will learn nothing
rock Sees more
She sighs in agreement
Tsu'tey and the other hunter wheel their horses around and   into the woods
gestures to Jake's horse
Again
: - Grouped around a table are ,  , and few  and
Jake is talking them through plans he's made of Hometree's inner structure
You've got outer columns, then a secondary ring here, and an inner ring
Then a core structure, it's like a spiral, that's how they move up and down
'm going to need accurate scans of all these columns

He's been watching Jake talking rapidly to Quaritch, but can't hear him
Frowning, he backs away, down the stairs

'm not about to let Quaritch and Selfridge micro-manage this thing
(she looks pointedly at Jake) We're going up into the mountains

(cont'd) There's a mobile link up at Site 26 that we can work out of
The Hallelujah Mountains
That's right
Yesssss
(off Jake's look) The legendary Floating Mountains of Pandora

In the  , Norm is up front, sitting left seat so Trudy can talk him through the flight controls
Jake and Grace are behind them, in the jump-seats
Grace and Norm's   ride in the open back compartment
It only takes tiny inputs
Here, put your hand on the cyclic -- She points to the stick between her knees
Norm hesitantly reaches over and rests his hand on hers
Feel how small the moves are
You barely have to think it, and the aircraft reacts

See these magnetic formations
We're getting close
Yeah we are
Look at my instruments
On the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out
58
Yup
We're in the flux vortex
, a cloud bank parts, revealing -- Right in front of them
Oh
My
God
Jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out the front canopy
'  -- enormous islands of rock are hovering a half mile above the ground
They are overgrown with rainforest, and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them
Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at the bottom
, staring in amazement
It is both awe-inspiring and disturbing
Trudy turns, grinning at Jake
You should see your face
-- the Samson is tiny as it approaches the floating islands of rock
An archipelago among the clouds, they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below
(
) Yeah, so what does hold them up
Grace explained it to me -- some kind of maglev effect because unobtanium is a superconductor, or something
At least somebody understands it
Just not me

There are 4 bunks, a clutter of science gear, and -- through a short connecting corridor --    in the second module
As Grace powers up the Link equipment, Jake stops to look at which are taped and tacked up around her workstation
-- Grace posing at the school with various grinning children
There is one of her with two lanky girls, a younger Neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her
Jake, take number two, it's the least glitchy
Norm,  need you to operate Jake's link
Norm glares at Jake as he passes
Hey
You got a problem
Norm turns to Grace, his frustration boiling over
trained three years for this mission
speak the language fluently
(he points at Jake) He falls off the frickin' turnip truck and all of a sudden he's cultural ambassador
It's not our choice, Norm
He glowers at Jake
Yeah, well  didn't come out here to wash the dishes while you're on some interspecies booty call
He stalks off
He can't go far
60
She points to Jake's link
Let's get you in
: /
- the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the ground
Villagers are ant-like
Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core trunk like a lemur
He climbs the last section, arriving out of breath beside her
She leads him , onto -- large branch
Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like enormous umbrellas above the rainforest
strides out across the branch toward some kind of -- a  made of thick woven fiber clinging to it stir with a leathery
Neytiri makes a series of  and
One of the shapes  toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight
huge
Much larger than the forest banshees, this thing is taller than a Na'vi with a 10 meter wingspan
leathery , like the crack of sails, as it alights on the branch right in front of her
Holy shit
Do not look in her eye
Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it  and gulps down
She murmurs to it and strokes its
It lets out a signature , and some of the others in the shadows nearby answer
Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the Banshee's
It shivers and stretches its wings as the neural connection is made
Ikran is not horse
Once shahaylu is made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter in the whole life
She climbs smoothly onto the animal's back
61
To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must choose your own ikran
And he must choose you
When
When you are ready
The  shivers with anticipation
Heeyaaahh
Jake ducks as the great wings   and the banshee off the branch
It swoops down across the forest canopy, banks hard, lets out a  and beats its wings in a power climb
Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close , and Jake instinctively ducks
-- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount, the rainforest rolling beneath her
: - / -  -- Jake has just switched on the camera
He looks tired
Do  have to do this
need some rack
, behind him, looks up from her , scowling
No -- now, when it's fresh
Yeah, yeah
(to camera) The days are starting to blur together
The language is a bitch, but  figure it's like field-stripping a weapon
Repetition

) Neytiri thinks 'm some kind of retard

Norm blushes and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads
(
) Norm's attitude has improved lately

Thank you
Ireiyo
Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation
Irrrreiyo
Irrrreiyo
You've gotta roll the , r-r-r-oll it
Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated
(
) It's good he's back on board, but he thinks 'm a retard too
'  as he runs over rocks, leaping onto a thick root, running on across the rough bark
(
) My feet are getting tougher
can run farther every day
63
Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are running 30 meters above the ground
He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up
She  and  with the ease of a spider monkey
(
) have to trust my body to know what to do
With Neytiri it's learn fast or die
Neytiri  off into space, falling, falling until -- She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its  to slow her fall
She lets go, plummeting, and catches another
in a leap of faith
with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush
He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a game trail
He is exhilarated to still be alive
Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed
That he lived
, in the shack
Thinking as he looks at the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school
--   formally greets '
The Matriarch looks on as  kneels to hug children she knows
Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi
(
) sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass
Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning
Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching
It is an awkward moment between them
Grace makes the formal gesture of greeting
(Na'vi, subtitled) See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite
See you, Doctor Grace Augustine
--  kneels on a game trail, pointing out the tracks in the mud to Jake
She touches the edges of the plants around her, and sniffs the air
64
(
) 'm learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds
watch through a screen of leaves as -- of huge, armored  walks through the shallows of a lake
In the middle of the herd, the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents' legs
One of the  trumpets, and a flock of  takes flight, an explosion of purple wings
Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau
--   utterly still, except for her ears, which move with a life of their own
Her eyes are closed
She speaks very softly to Jake -- When you hear nothing, you will hear everything
When you see nothing, you will See everything
(
) Sometimes  have no idea what she's talking about
Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male -- a six legged deer-like creature
Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri watches
He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow, then  his arm
Zen archery
(
) It's been a month and 'm still not allowed to make a kill
She says the forest hasn't given permission
and  crawl through the undergrowth
She points and he parts some leaves to see -- bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk around her legs
She licks their faces
(
) There's a lot of crap like that
She's always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not -- 65
-  --   talks into the lens
He's changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow
Pale
() just hope this treehugger shit isn't on the final
Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples
(without looking up) This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there
You need to listen to what she says
Try to see the forest through their eyes
Excuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay
move through the  , surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence
They move gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits
-- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated
The night forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources
, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing  at the bottom of a pool
large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow
Jake drills it
He holds up the fish, triumphantly
-- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow
Only now her hands are as they move on his arms, his shoulders
Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken
Their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly
-- they enter a  filled with chest-high ferns
Neytiri signals him to move slowly
They approach a creature on one of the ferns
An ugly, stick-like - perched on a frond
As he approaches -- long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening like a Chinese fan
It  , a living Frisbee
across the clearing
66
Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a
An as dozens of   take flight
Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until they are all flying
And for the first time, she is unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him
-- Jake's eyes open in the darkness
He doesn't know where he is
He weakly pushes open the lid, blinking at the light
(
) Everything is backwards now
Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream
silently drawing his bow, his eyes focused in intense concentration
beat -- the arrow flies
the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede
He dispatches it with his knife
He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na'vi
(') See you Brother, and thank you
Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People
watches with approval
clean kill
You are ready
: - Lying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin
Norm helps Grace get him to his chair
You're still losing weight
Here -- She hands him a microwaved burrito
He looks at the now alien food
Bites into it without enthusiasm
made a kill today
We ate it
know where that meal came from
67
Other body
You need to take care of this body
Yeah yeah
Jake, 'm serious -- you look like crap
You're burning too hard
Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out
Get rid of this shit, then you can lecture me
'm telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time
Not now
Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya
walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee
Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee
Or die trying
That's right, Grace
This is what 've been working for
And this is your check up from the neck up, Marine
You're getting in way too deep
(she turns away) Trust me,  learned the hard way
Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace's workstation
What did happen at the school
looks up from making coffee
Her eyes track across the pictures of the laughing children
Finally -- 68
Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped coming to school
She was angry about the clear-cutting
sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste
One day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up -- they'd set a bulldozer on fire --  guess they thought  could protect them
' voice stays oddly  as he tells this terrible story, while getting  out of the refrigerator
The troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse
as she pours the milk -- her hand is
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway
Right in front of Neytiri
Then shot the others
() got most of the kids out, before they shot me
Jesus
Yeah
Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it
scientist stays objective -- we can not be ruled by emotion
But  poured ten years of my life into that school
They called me sa'atenuk
Mother
(turning to him) That kind of pain reaches back through the link
sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake
It's a job
Learn what you can -- but don't get attached
69
looks at him with real  in her eyes
It's not our world, Jake
And we can't stop what's coming
: - ' leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two and , who's riding well enough to keep up
The horses' hooves  right next to a sheer drop into a misty canyon
(
) Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven
It's the test every young hunter has to pass
' signals a stop
-  is an astounding formation
Thick vine-like trees have trapped large   of  in their gnarled grip
hundred meters above them more boulders are  into the twisted vine-trunks
This is some sort of freak natural occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the clouds
There is a  , like an artillery barrage, and the ground
Jake looks around at -- One of the   grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa
huge rockfall is set loose
The mountain is drifting toward them, filling half the sky
The Hunters dismount
looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds
He turns to Tsu'tey, who is checking the young hunters' gear
We doin' this
Jake leaps to catch up as Tsu'tey and the hunters swarm up the base of the beanstalk
: 70
- 200  up the , the hunters nimbly climb along the vine-trunks
They clamber over one of the unobtanium which is lifting this incredible tree
looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick
chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it -- it floats upward
They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk
Above them, the craggy underbelly of  Veritatis looms
Spray from one of the waterfalls hits them
Some of the   are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss
One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass
Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling over nothingness
They climb toward the floating islands above
- cross a causeway of vines connecting a small island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis
looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome -- the sheer side of Mons Veritatis
Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of sunlight
Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below
/  - waterfall  down into the void like a faucet of the gods
Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below -- a view from Olympus
and the   of leathery wings -- ' swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto
She dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven It waits, docile, as -- She joins Jake and the hunter party
Tsu'tey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a
And Jake sees -- The
of banshees huddle on rock out- croppings as far as the eye can see
They cling to the walls with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges
71
' Jakesully will go first
Tsu'tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes
The two teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough
Tsu'tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge
() Now you choose your ikran
This you must feel -- inside
If he also chooses you, move quick, like  showed
You will have one chance
How will  know if he chooses me
He will try to kill you
Outstanding
Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it
Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didn't happen
He is on his own, on the ledge with -- The
They eye him as he approaches
Several and take flight
Others flap their wings and yawn, showing rows of fangs, in a threat display
Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended
spreads enormous wings, , and glares straight at him
Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it
Let's dance
The challenged banshee  and leaps at him, jaws wide as-- Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him,
Jake  the bolo across its snout
The weighted thong whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut and it  at his stomach with razor talons but -- 72
Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the banshee around the neck
It topples on its side, and he -- arms around its thrashing head
Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his queue but -- The bony head  sideways, and
-- clocks him right in the face, almost knocking him out and -- , flinging him to the ground
He slides on the rock and almost goes over the edge as -- gasps
Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly
The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way pissed off now, but -- Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it
Claws rake his leg but he gets his arms around its head and They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top, pinning it and -- Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams the end of his queue into it
They  together and -- The banshee stops struggling
It lies there panting
They are locked together, literally eye to eye
That's right
You're mine
-- the pupil like a deep black well
Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over the creature's back
Neytiri runs to him
First flight seals the bond
You cannot wait
Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power
He grips a hank of the beast's main, and -- Heeeyyyaaaah
The banshee is off like a shot
Jake as they  off the cliff -- the banshee  and -- 73
They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is almost tossed lose
The thing is  and  so much he can't think
Shut the hell up
It does
Level out
Fly straight
It levels out
Jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left" and the animal complies
He settles the banshee into an easy loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath
'  falls into formation with him
She signals "follow me" and
Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her
Neytiri's banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky
after them as Neytiri leads an arcing around the flank of Mons Veritatis
The scenery is stunning
They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines
Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the cliffs
They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight
Jake is getting the hang of it
He jinks left, then right, then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back
He's reckless, fearless
Half in control and
Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long  of joy
: /
/  - : squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight principles like one fighter pilot to another
a sheer cliff
Jake and Neytiri dive their mounts    , pulling out and soaring into a series of aerobatic turns

) may not be much of a horse guy
But was born to do this
74
in close formation with ' and the young , 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist
Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri among the clouds
They are wild and free in a wild world
She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can
He after her
, by firelight, '  snaps at a piece of meat which he playfully pulls back
He's teaching it to take the food more slowly
He strokes its long head
' is nearby with the young hunters
He eyes Jake with frustrated hostility
-- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily
She points and Jake sees -- Arches of magnetic rock form rainbows of stone above a deep
In the center of the caldera is a single, enormous  , gnarled and ancient
This, we will be told, is
: flies with Neytiri along a forested ridge
She is teaching him to hunt from his banshee
They carry their bows at the ready, scanning below them for prey
covers him and Neytiri  a warning
Jake looks up to see -- in a delta-dive, whistling straight at him
Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king predator of the air: the
Striped scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying
The hunter has become the prey
snap-rolls and dives toward the forest canopy
He plummets into the gloom as -- - -- the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following him down, both diving like missiles and -- yanks into a hair-pin bank, right through a gap between two huge branches -- Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud  of wings
It banks away with a frustrated
Two flaps of its mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy

, as its fanged mouth opens in a bloodcurdling  which echoes among the mountains
The lord of its domain
, shaken
Neytiri flies up, her expression the Na'vi equivalent of Oh my God
beat -- they both crack up
: - Jake ponders images Grace has called up at her workstation-- science graphics of the Leonopteryx
Trudy and Norm are crowded around as well
The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial predator
Not only rare, but the sightings tend not to get reported
Trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb
There usually isn't time to key the mike
The People call it Toruk
() Last Shadow
Last one you ever see
saw one take out a gunship once -- Total frickin' yard sale
Ate the crew like peanuts
-- Grace is scanning through images and Jake stops her on one -- a 3D aerial shot of the strange arched formation
That's it
Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls
It's their most sacred place
She moves the virtual camera, and we seem to fly around the Well of Souls, catching only a glimpse of the interior
76
Something big is going on in there, biologically
'd die to get samples, but outsiders are strictly forbidden
-- Jake looks through the pressure window at and  outside
Wearing masks, they are taking readings from some time-series experiments Grace has set up
As  watches,  works fast to download Grace's images of the Well of Souls onto a memory chip
They're coming back
Jake pulls the chip, then hesitates
Torn by what he is doing
If you don't give him something, he's gonna shut us down
He hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her flight-suit just as Grace and Norm enter from the airlock
Hey, guys
: - up at the  , which we now recognize as that of a
watches as he reaches up to touch the tall indigo crest
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow
Toruk chose him
It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs
That's a long time
Neytiri takes his hand, because that's what the Na'vi do when they're telling you something important
Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow
All Na'vi people know this story
77
on the skull totem, then -- : - ,  and other   swoop low above a -- a rapids of thundering muscle
Dust rises from this living river like steam from a python's back
the herd
appears in , astride a direhorse at full gallop
The sight is breathtaking
He hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest  down, flipping twice from momentum
like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming
He draws and fires his bow
The arrow strikes true, in the plexus between the armored shoulders and -- crashes to the ground
Skids to a stop in a cloud of dust
swoops in next to Jake, arms raised and grinning wolfishly
', banking around Jake's kill
Jake looks up, and Tsu'tey  in grudging admiration
: / - The central space is lit by a , around which the is in full swing
Wild dancing
People gnawing on massive sturmbeest ribs
bowl of some kava-like intoxicant is passed around
dances in a flowing costume as the
is dancing seductively with his own tail
, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx attack with his hands
The leaping fire-light plays across the eye sockets of the  , bringing it to life
It seems to watch Jake
' squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face
Jake braces himself -- and Tsu'tey holds up the  , offering it to him
challenge or an olive branch
Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm
78
Watch that stuff
It'll knock you into next week
Jake offers the bowl back to Tsu'tey
They lock eyes
Tsu'tey drinks
--    drops, landing on a pile of empty bowls near the fire
and ', sitting amid the rowdy hunters
Tsu'tey looks a little blearily at Jake
Finally, he
' thought -- enough drink -- you would not be so ugly
Sorry
Tsu'tey looks deep into the fire
' Your warriors -- hide inside machines -- fight from far away
(he looks at Jake) did not think a sky person could be brave
Before Jake can answer, ' lithe shape runs through the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them
She takes Jake by the hand and pulls him up -- You must dance
It is the way
' watches as she leads him away, his face darkening -- the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger
The hunters  and  as Jake joins the circle of dancers
Jake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting
lets the  and  flow through him
He lets himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal energy
is rocking out, grinning
We see the young girl, so repressed, who lives within her
Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are looking only at each other
79
couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle are giggling and talking about them
Mo'at and follow their look, seeing the obvious connection
' () We cannot let this seed grow
Her path is with Tsu'tey
, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked with Neytiri
: - -- mist blowing through the treetops as the morning sun burns it away
spectacular panorama of a vast, primeval land
among the trees, the sunlight shafting down like light in a cathedral
(
) It's hard to put in words the deep connection the People have to the forest
of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping nectar which is sweet and thick as honey
An incredibly sensuous image
(
) They see a network of energy that flows through all living things
They know that all energy is only borrowed-- of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops
blue hand picks the flower
(
) -- and one day you have to give it back
into a hole dug among tree roots
The body of an old Omaticaya  lies curled there like an unborn baby in the womb of the earth
The purple flower is gently placed on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads
Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places a , a seed of the Great Tree, on the body
Earth is poured over the  and we   -- 80
in the Link
as a coffin
He pushes the lid off, letting in light, and lies there
He looks pale and haggard, with a scraggly beard
(
) Hard to believe it's only been three months
in front of the video log camera, late at night
It is many log entries later
He has lost a lot of weight
He looks like a junkie watching a test pattern
(to the lens) can barely remember my old life
'm not sure who  am anymore

Good of you to stop by
How's it going out there
Our blue friends all packed up yet
Selfridge swings his  with good form
See,  keep hooking it
It's the damn pack
drops into the mud just past a marker which reads 220
walks over to retrieve it
The low gravity and the high air density cancel out so -- You called us back to report -- you want to hear it or not
Go ahead
Jake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months
But -- we need more time
81
Not what  was hoping to hear
It starts to rain
Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from his golf bag and snaps it open
Parker, it's their ancestral home
They've lived there since before human history began
You can spare them a few more weeks
This thing is inevitable
What does it matter when it happens
'm sorry, Dr
Augustine
You're out of time
He leaves them standing there to get drenched
: break table, under a harsh overhead light
Quaritch pulls up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake
He studies Jake's pale, sunken face
The scraggly beard
You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are you son
Jake can't meet his eyes
Your last report was two weeks ago
'm starting to doubt your resolve
From what see, it's time to terminate this mission
Jake eyes flare with alarm
No
can do this
Look, you've given me plenty of usable intel
Like this "Well of Souls" place -- 've got them by the balls with that, when it turns into a shit-fight
Which it will
Jake feels hollow inside, knowing what he's done
82
So you'll get your legs back, like promised
(puts his hand on Jake's ) It's time to come in
Jake ponders this
Isn't this what he was doing all this for
've gotta finish this thing
There's one more test -- the Dream Hunt
It's the final stage of becoming a man
Then 'm one of them
They'll trust what  say
It's hard for him to even form these words -- and  can negotiate the terms of their relocation
Then you need to get it done, Corporal
: - Strange horizontal  branches through the floating mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields
The sky is black and heavy with clouds
- Jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking pretty
is smoking furiously
Jake,  can't allow this
You're just not strong enough
It's the last door -- 'm going through it
You can help me or get out of the way
Jake pushes past her toward the corridor -- (grabbing him) Will you listen to me
Sometimes the Na'vi themselves die in these vision quests
The venom takes you to the edge of death
() 83
(cont'd) And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm- - we have no idea what that'll do in an avatar brain
Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor
follows  as he crosses to the Link
sheet of flashes across the sky outside
Norm is initializing the Link
Calibrating
Thirty seconds
She puts her hands on his shoulders
No matter what you prove out there-- you are still in here
(shaking him) Right here
have to go all the way -- become one of -- () Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of them
Norm looks up, startled at the  in ' voice
Our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain
You visit -- and you leave
During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside
() You can never truly be with her
Jake stops, pinioned by the truth
He seems suddenly very lost
You know why 'm here
Because Quaritch sent me
What
84
That's right -- to embed with the Omaticaya
To find out how to screw them out of their home
By deceit or by force, he didn't care
And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it
Norm is in shock
But Grace is eerily calm
And what about now, Jake
'm not that guy any more
Grace nods
She's been on his journey every step of the way
know
But if  tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me out --  never see her again
And if  tell her the truth, the clan throws me out -- that's if they don't cut my heart out and show it to me
Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them
In his own perfect Hell
They won't understand what you've done
They don't even have a word for "lie" -- they had to learn it from us
Grace sees he is on the verge of tears
Lost and alone, between worlds
know
taught it to them
() Grace
've gotta go
They're waiting
Link is ready
Grace stops him as he tries to close the lid
85
Jake
You can't carry this burden much longer
(smiling wanly) It's okay
Mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the Dream Hunt anyway
Grace closes the lid
It feels like closing a coffin
She watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar, somewhere out in the night
(to Norm) Prep my link
'm going in
: / - , eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron -- the Dream Hunt
When your Spirit Animal comes, you will know
Their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer

Jake barely sees her as he goes down the spiral
She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter
, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters
An  is slowly rapping a large
-- ' purifies him with smoke from burning herbs, in a low monotone
Jake, squatting, washes the smoke over himself with his palms
- ''  unwrap a piece of wood riddled with holes
She catches the end of a glowing purple , and draws it out of the wood
' () Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree -- bless this worthy Hunter with a true vision
86
' places the worm on Jake's out-stretched
It twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it
She indicates he should chew
He does
--    is opened
removes a writhing black , the Pandoran equivalent of a scorpion
He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses
The insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and -- Jake grimaces
Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake alone in the circle
Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant
on Jake
His eyes
He looks around at the faces -- they seem to , becoming threatening
Jake looks down at the palms of his hands

-- pupils  black
He looks around and -- The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees, which seem miles high
The whole image is bathed in spectral radiance
Jake looks down -- '  -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which connect to the roots of the trees and -- -- Jake is on his hands and knees,  in the dirt
He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom contracts his muscles but -- Jake stands serene on a covers him, the unmistakable silhouette of a diving

He feels the wind of time blowing through him as -- claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while -- ,   he  over the landscape of Pandora -- --but the forest is

It lets out an almighty which seems to echo to eternity and -- to Jake, on his back,  -- back in his body
He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room
' It is finished
Neytiri's face is flooded with relief
The faces of the clan elders look at Jake expectantly
() Did your Spirit Animal come
Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders
How can he tell them what he has seen
Mo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to peer into his troubled soul
' (to Jake) Something has come
(to the others, subtitled) It will take time for the meaning to be clear
She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand
He gets up, weakly
88
-- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the others
The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what has happened
Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem, which seems to stare down at him
watches, her eyes brimming
Proud
Relieved
Amazed
Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them there
() You are now a son of the Omaticaya
You are part of the People
All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest -- hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone
: - and  run silhouetted in the night
Behind them waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light behind the trees
from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water
Jake follows her and -- , they swim over glowing
They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden of waving shapes
Tiny purple fish swirl around them
Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float weightlessly, as if between worlds
: Laughing, they run together into a stand of
Their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai
Long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains
Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly
It  to their footsteps with expanding rings of light
It is an exquisitely beautiful spot
The willows stir, responding to their presence
She holds up her hands, letting the  caress her
89
This is a place for prayers to be heard
And sometimes answered
Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers, his palms, his forearms
His eyes go wide
We hear the  of ancient Na'vi
It's like -- a sound you feel
We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of Voices
The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa
few  circle around them, some alighting on their shoulders and arms
They stand, very close together now
Her eyes are intense, almost luminous
He feels drawn into them
But she pulls back a little
You are Omaticaya now
You may make your own bow from the wood of Hometree
(she looks away) And you may choose a woman
The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual
Jake suppresses a smile
We have many fine women
Ninat is the best singer -- don't want Ninat
There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter -- Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her
've already chosen
But this woman must also choose me
She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving gently over each other
90
She already has
He puts his face close to hers
She rubs her cheek against his
He kisses her on the mouth
They explore each other
Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling
Kissing is very good
But we have something better
She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other on the faintly glowing moss
Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it
Jake does the same, with trembling anticipation
The tendrils at the ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined
-- The tendrils  with gentle undulations
rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers
The ultimate intimacy
They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of moss, and ripples of light spread out around them
sway, without wind, and the night is alive with pulsing energy as we   -- She is collapsed across his chest
Spent
He strokes her face tenderly
Neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping
She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest -- This body is real
(she touches his forehead) This spirit is real
Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep
When  was first your teacher,  hated all Sky People
But you have also taught me
() Spirit is all that matters
91
She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his heartbeat
am with you now, Jake
We are mated for life
We are
Yes
It is our way
() Oh
forgot to tell
He rouses up, making her look at him
Really, we are
We are
Jake considers this
It's cool
'm there
He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering him as he sleeps
- Jake's eyes open in the darkness
He just lies there, thinking
In his coffin
In another world
: - in the sacred glade
Shafts of orange morning light
Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms
Maxfield Parrish painting
But then -- Neytiri awakens with a start
The ,  of forest being crushed under enormous treads gets louder
in growing horror as the  of a bulldozer becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows
She shakes Jake, shouting at him in Na'vi to wake up
92
Jake
Wake up
Where ever you are, come back to me now
Jake
- is in a hurry to get back to the link
, still groggy, chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs
Here -- eat this
'd hate to have to force-feed a cripple
She slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the plate under his nose
() She's not going anywhere
He sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs
- Neytiri  as -- The willows begin to fall before the blade, to be ground under the treads
is directly in the path
She tries to lift him, but he is too heavy
She is screaming at him, frantically trying to wake him, as -- - Jake adjusts himself in the link chair
He hands Grace the empty plate
And when was the last time you took a shower
Jesus, Marine
Jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down
wakes up to see -- dragging him, screaming
He leaps up as -- pushes inexorably into the glade, splintering the trees, plowing the earth before it
into the path of the bulldozer, waving his arms
93
Hey
Heeeey
Stop
Stop
He positions himself where the camera-eyes of the robotic juggernaut will see him
- -- Jake shouts but there's no sound feed
as the   sees him and pulls back on the remote throttles
He yells to his
Hey,  got one of the natives blockin' my blade here
This attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to the workstation
-- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable
(to Selfridge) What do we do
Roll on
He'll move
These people have to learn that we don't stop
as the operator pushes them forward
Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side
grabs a rock and  onto the dozer
He climbs quickly to the
The rock crashes into the lens of the camera
Jake beats the rock furiously against it, pounding it to junk

But the  of engines continues because -- and  advance nearby, crushing the forest before them

From behind a screen of leaves, they watch as -- advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving only mud and wood splinters in their path

She sobs as the willows die

Freeze it, right -- there

Son of a bitch

He turns and strides toward the door, shouting to his as he passes
Get me a pilot

() Tsu'tey will lead the war party
Tsu'tey steps forward, face full of hate, raising a war cry among the hunters
() Please -- this will only make it worse -- ' You do not speak here
and  cross the commons toward them
Jake feels all eyes turn toward him
He takes her arm, stopping her
(to Neytiri, low) Okay, listen
There's something  have to tell you
It's gonna be hard
just need you to -- He sees ' striding toward them, his face a mask of fury
' You
Tsu'tey walks right up and  Jake in the chest with both hands
It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass
' You mated with this woman
Oh shit
Jake stands
He reaches out for Neytiri
She goes to him, clutching his hand
' Is this true
() We are mated before Eywa
It is done
Tsu'tey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished
96
' () Neytiri was promised to me
Everything is changing
Everything is being destroyed
Tsu'tey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage
' () These aliens kill everything they touch, like poison
' Neytiri
If you choose this path, you can never be Tsahik
Your life will be wasted
Neytiri looks at her mother -- sees the grief in her eyes

Tsu'tey draws his knife and -- ' Yeeeeeaaa
, who's ready this time -- he sidesteps, blocking the knife, and elbows Tsu'tey  in the face
Tsu'tey reels back, nose bleeding
He starts forward on a second attack but -- Eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around
() Stop
This is not a proper challenge
Tsu'tey glares at Jake while sheathing his knife
' challenge you
Jake, don't -- accept

Did  tell you to announce us
Sorry sir, it's procedure
Norm punches buttons on the comms console
Samson One Six
Trudy
(no answer) Crap
He looks helplessly at Jake and Grace's link units -- no way to warn them
- '   square off
Each holds a long, solid staff
The entire clan crowds around them in a circle
What the hell are you doing
It's the only way to get him to goddamn listen
'  at Jake with a sharp cry and Jake parries with his staff
The staves  off each other as the two combatants ,  and  furiously
Tsu'tey sweeps Jake off his feet with a roundhouse hit to the ankles, but -- Jake  out of it and catches Tsu'tey in the belly with the blunt end
98
26 - '  lands
and a posse of troopers jump down and rush the Shack
' wades in with a series of short, sharp blows
Jake swings with equal fury
Both fighting from the heart
The staves whistle through the air, and  together like gunshots
Jake presses hard, and Tsu'tey staggers back, stumbling as -- Jake lands a  , dropping him to his knees, just as -- bangs open and  stomps toward Grace's Link controls
Hey, hang on, you can't interrupt a link in progress, it's dangerous -- wait

Tsu'tey puts one alongside his head
Jake sprawls, completely inert
Tsu'tey pokes him with his staff, then raises it and lets out a piercing
- the Link, amped from the fight, furious -- Are you out of your goddamn mind
You crossed a line
Quaritch
Jake flops back, dazed
The troopers yank him out and - his wrists

' draws his , and bends down, grabbing Jake by the hair
' () This is a demon in a false body
It should not live
He puts his knife to Jake's throat but -- - him at full tilt
Tsu'tey sprawls, rolls, comes up to see -- Neytiri crouched like a lioness over Jake, her  and teeth bared, her ears flattened
She  with primal fury
Tsu'tey stands panting
He pushes through the crowd and walks away, calling for his hunters

The shot on Jake's
--   sits, bruised and bleeding, watching himself on the monitor
and  stand nearby, rubbing their wrists where the zip-ties bit in
and watch with disdain
You let me down, son
You got a little local pussy and completely forgot what team you play for
Jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare
Parker, listen, there may still be time to -- Shut your fucking hole
Grace is momentarily stunned by Quaritch's fury
But she meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch
100
Or what, Ranger Rick
You gonna shoot me
(to Selfridge) You need to muzzle your dog
Can we just take this down a couple notches, please
(to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive
Start by listening to her
Jake nods to Grace to continue
(to Selfridge) This is bad, Parker
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine
You know what
You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern
'm not talking about pagan voodoo here -- 'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest
() Which is what exactly
Grace's nerve fails
rush of conflicting emotions -- the need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific rigor
(to Jake) can't do this
How am  supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate
Just tell him what you know in your heart
She turns to Parker, steeling herself
101
Alright, look --  don't have the answers yet, 'm just now starting to even frame the questions
What we think we know -- is that there's some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees
Like the synapses between neurons
Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora -- That's a lot 'm guessing
That's more connections than the human brain
You get it
It's a network -- a global network
And the Na'vi can access it -- they can upload and download data -- memories -- at sites like the one you destroyed
What the hell have you people been smoking out there
They're just
Goddamn
Trees
You need to wake up, Parker
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground -- it's all around us
The Na'vi know that, and they're fighting to defend it
If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them
We understand them just fine
Thanks to Jake here
Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a on the main monitor -- -- -  of Jake, looking haggard and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue

We're a horror to them
We're the monsters from space

watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the people he has grown to love

Quaritch  the recording
Since a deal can't be made -- it gets real simple
(to Jake, icily) So thanks

Parker, we have to talk, like rational people
Well, 'd cherish that, but unfortunately you're out of here on the next shuttle

The rest of the squad
Six bodies -- that's all of `em
And the equipment is totalled
Christ

'  - Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan
can do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous
We'll clear them out with gas first
It'll be humane
More or less
Selfridge sighs and rubs his face
Hey, don't go limp on me now
This is exactly the incident we needed
Alright, let's pull the trigger
: and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment, under the watchful eye of armed -
, ,  stare bleakly at each other
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response
They're fabricating this war to get what they want
can't believe that
Yup
That's how it's done
When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy
Then you're justified in taking it
into the lab, breathless

Sec-ops is rolling the gunships
They're gonna hit Hometree
When
Now
We're spooling up now
gotta go

My God
Jake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following
- surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the gunships, loading ordnance
He turns as  and charge toward him
Parker, wait
Stop
These are people you're about to -- They're fly-bitten savages who live in a tree
Look around --  don't know about you but  see a lot of trees
They can move
For God's sake, there are children in there
Babies
Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind of blood on your hands
Let me try to talk them out
They trust me

The two enter their units, as  and prep the system
You've got one hour
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the axe comes down, you get them to evacuate
One hour
Jake lowers the upper clamshell
Norm starts the sequence
: - The entire clan is gathered, with Eytukan and Mo'at presiding
Jake looks around, feeling the gaze of the People upon him
He steels himself, and speaks in clear Na'vi -- 105
() Eytukan,  have something to say, to everyone
() Speak, Jakesully
() great evil is upon us
The Sky People are coming to destroy Hometree
They will be here soon
murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd
() You have to leave, or you will die
' Are you certain of this
They sent me here to learn your ways
So one day  could bring this message, and you would believe it
What are you saying, Jake
You knew this would happen
He is unable to meet her eyes
Yes
() At first it was just orders
Then everything changed
fell in love-- with the forest, with the Omaticaya People -- (he looks at her) -- with you
And by then, how could tell you
Neytiri can barely breathe
She is shaking with the enormity of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain -- trusted you, Jake
106
Neytiri
Please,  only wanted to -- You will never be one of the People
' yells to his  -- () Bind them
They grab Jake, who doesn't resist
Others seize Grace
Both are driven to their knees, and their arms bound

At the head of the formation is one much larger ship, a monster 150 feet long -- the -21

Quaritch watches a targeting screen -- a telescopic image of Jake and Grace tied to posts
Well, 'd say diplomacy has failed
' and another  hold knives to the throats of the two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships
think they mean to cut their throats if we don't back off
Make sure you get a nice close-up of that
can tack it onto the after-action report
to Neytiri, Tsu'tey, the others gathered nearby -- 107
You have to get out of Hometree
Run to the forest
Please, 'm begging you
scowls at Jake, then  ' and yells -- () Take the ikran
Attack from above
Tsu'tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree
Quaritch grows impatient
Alright, let's get this done
Give me forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the front door

The villagers pour out of Hometree
Everyone is yelling

High up in the trunk, ' and his hunters leap rapidly from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball

Out of the smoke, ' appears in front of Jake
She raises a  and -- Jake looks down, surprised, to see his bonds falling away
He meets her eyes, which are filled with horror, but also something else
Call it faith
' You are one of us
Help us
Jake takes the knife and cuts Grace free
We've gotta move
He's gonna blow the columns
As Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they
Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion
, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches
That's how you scatter the roaches
Okay, switch missiles
Give me -'s at the base of the west columns

) Copy, switching missiles

It holds that position -- waiting

Panicked yelling fills the comm freq

Wainfleet's  is brief
Neytiri's demon mount rears up and its triumphant  echoes through the forest

Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max

He stumbles, dazed, toward the battle
/ and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged creatures
is the scene of a pitched battle
Na'vi hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves, overwhelming the troopers
are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in
They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage
The panicked   slams a switch and the ramp begins to close, a second before he is cut down by a spear

He swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and lands, tumbling on the shuttle's broad back as -- try to swing their guns toward him but he  them with his , still running forward and -- two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the pins out with his teeth
He hurls them down the intakes of the  turbofans as -- in a tight arc back toward him and -- 140
as the grenades , shattering the turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and -- , landing on the back of his mount and reconnecting
They flap away, gaining altitude as fire out of the bottom of the shuttle

Get me airspeed
The pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and -- The   , thrusting the shuttle forward
It still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until -- '  the tree tops when it gets enough translational lift to fly and -- back on the stick, lifting the nose
We're good

Valkyrie Two is breaking off
And if any of ya'll want to get off this piece of shit planet, you better cover our ass, `cause we're the only way back to orbit
Roger that
Quaritch watches the shuttle bank away, with most of the remaining gunships following
Get back here you worthless pukes
141
Are we breaking off
Quaritch draws his pistol
What do you think
He is over the edge-- no logic in his brain now
Only death
/ Techs and troopers crowd around consoles, listening to all the yelling and confusion as they try to plot the disintegrating battle
(in growing alarm) What the hell is going on out there
: Regular troopers and volunteers  through the jungle, scrambling to board  as they touch down
The pilot listens to comms from Hell's Gate
Sir, all ground units are falling back to the
Quaritch's jaw clenches
Stay on target
Mo'at   as the  appears over the trees like the shadow of Death
Around her, the Na'vi mothers clutch their children to them
We see '  among them

He pulls out, skimming over the ship
Uncoupling, he rolls backward off his mount and -- , skidding, on the hull of the Dragon
He rolls to his feet, already running as -- sees the leonopteryx  overhead and flap away with no rider
He snap-looks aft to see -- along the spine of the ship, yanking two grenades from his battle-harness, pulling the pins with his teeth, then -- 's hand shoots out and  the pilot's hard over
lurches sideways, rolling sharply with a  of protesting rotors and -- off his feet
The grenades miss the One bounces off the ship
The other lodges against a cowling and -- the ship, falling as -- -
The grenade blows a two meter hole in the hull -- Pandoran air swirls inside
(to the pilot) Put your mask on
Quaritch leaps out of his seat, heading aft as -- the edge of a weapons pod, his feet dangling over open space

Jake sees him aim his massive

Rounds clang next to Jake's head
He  , plummeting into the trees -- Jake plunges through jungle canopy
He catches a  , as Neytiri taught him -- it bends down, breaking his fall -- 143
, dropping again only to catch  , and then another, and -- with him through this green blur
Jake drops to the ground in a feral crouch
Unhurt
(into his headset) Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of Souls
He's got a clear shot
Hit him, anybody that can
Do it now
Trudy Chacon is all business
On it

She pours on the coal and the Samson leaps forward, straight at the

grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open front of the fuselage
Wind howls through wreckage where the pilot used to be
The forest rushes up to meet him and -- through splintering trees,  in a lake with a   of water

- Norm takes a few steps and drops to his knees
Imploded by grief

Dragon is down
It's off the board
What do you mean, off the board
Selfridge is stunned
Suddenly the  of an  makes them all look up

Selfridge  as -- -
The   of the - tear through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air
Alarms go off
The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of glass and shredded debris
The slash-cutter head pulls back, and through the gaping hole into the Ops Center -- The  look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down at them
The battle is over in seconds
The avatars are holding the Ops Center
Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask
In shock
How could this be happening
: lies half submerged
Out of the water , a shape rises -- a
Inside --  , his face bloody, his eyes burning
He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest
145
'   relentlessly through the jungle
He sees something through the foliage ahead -- the
Jake is oblivious under the link
Through a window we see Quaritch's  step into the clearing
levels his -90 at the shack
His finger goes to the firing button-- six-legged   tackles him
Quaritch pivots as he falls,  the cannon
It misses Neytiri by inches
He grapples with the  as its razor claws  over his metal armor
twist and struggle
a long burst from the cannon
Rounds tear into the creature, which but -- wills it to  the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but -- Quaritch  the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost crushing Neytiri
one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's and -- violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator's chest armor
The creature  and Quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing
The thanator slumps, pinning Neytiri's legs under its great bulk
She is trapped
Quaritch looks down at Neytiri
She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant
(
) It's all over Quaritch -- Quaritch turns, seeing Jake  from a tree limb
The `suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun
Nothing's over while 'm breathing
Kinda hoped you'd say that

closes fast, snatching up the broken  as -- 146
Quaritch   with the knife and Jake parries, blocking it with the cannon
He  faster than the suit can move and -- -
--  the end of the cannon into the canopy, crazing it with a web of cracks as   air with the huge knife
Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and -- the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying
catches him with the other arm, hurling him away
Jake rolls just before -- -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was
He scrambles up as Quaritch  and -- another round-house,  forward to smash the canopy again -- then again -- until it is  with cracks
Quaritch manages to  the cannon barrel but -- , he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass
the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks
The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and -- we see it  against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating
Jake's link sits just inside
, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and -- -
-- the canopy  , flying through the air
Quaritch can see again
He dons his breathing mask
Bends to pick up his
struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator
, panting, glowers at Jake
How does it feel to betray your own race
Then, inexplicably, he
Walks away
the shack, we see him charge straight toward us and -- -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window
He is reaching inside for the Link when -- in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and -- 147
around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder and, yanks him forward ,  his face into the edge of the cockpit but -- flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake slams to the ground
Jake is holding his breath as the toxic Pandoran air swirls in
shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull her other leg out
charges, the knife flashing down and -- just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as -- pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat
Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as -- reaches his throat as -- in Quaritch's chest
He looks up
-- a  released
classic archer figure, she  another arrow
Then draws and releases smoothly
-
The machine  off Jake and lies still
at the two arrows in his chest
He touches the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic laugh -- he dies
runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn
Seeing Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow
sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and -- out of the Link, slamming to the floor where he gags for breath
With his last strength, he claws toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room
He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness
through the shattered window, landing in the debris like a cat
She  the mask and flashes to Jake's side -- puts the mask over his face and -- 148
drags in breath after breath
He looks up at Neytiri, studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for the first time
Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue of her skin
There eyes meet across the glass of the mask -- together, separate
Worldless
: - ' tends to the mortally wounded ' as arrives with Neytiri
Mo'at has bound his wounds, but by her expression, it is clear he cannot be saved
Jake kneels and Tsu'tey opens his eyes
Through a haze of pain, he recognizes Jake
' (') See you, Jakesully
See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan
' Are the people safe
They're safe
Tsu'tey weakly clutches his severed queue
' can never ride again, or bond with my woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa
can not lead the People
You will lead them, Jakesully
No
'm not officer material
' It is decided
Now do the duty of Olo'eyctan
Set my spirit free
'm not killing you
' am already dead
149
No
' It is the way
And it is good
will be remembered -- Tsu'tey's voice is weak, but thick with emotion
' --  fought with Toruk Macto, we were brothers -- and he was my last shadow
''  clasps with Jake's in a fierce grip
Jake draws his knife
''  -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun
falls across Tsu'tey
(') Forgive me, my Brother
Go now to the Mother Spirit
By his movement, we know that he has ended Tsu'tey's pain
Jake's eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the prayer for the dead, and his Na'vi words carry over as we -- : '  - Na'vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell's Gate
Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats flutter about, unimpeded
The   are silent, and the  are open to the forest
(
) few chose to stay
Fewer were chosen
Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold 's as the personnel of Hell's Gate file up the cargo ramp of the remaining shuttle
The evicted humans are sullen and angry, like 's

His eyes -- the eyes of a lost soul -- meet '
He disappears into the ship

What remains   is a virgin, primeval world
Spanning the black continents is a vast reticulated lace-work of -- a ghostly  connecting all of Pandora
: - The sun's rays shaft down through the layers of canopy
(
) The forest will heal, and so will the hearts of the People
New life keeps the energy flowing, like the breath of the world
, obviously pregnant, is bow-fishing in the shallows
Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river
(
) This is my last videolog
-- Jake sits in a chair, talking straight He is thin, pale
He looks around the high tech room
The science guys will keep the lights on, here
But  won't miss this place
- glow softly
The entire Omaticaya clan is gathered, seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree
(
) better wrap this up
There's a funeral tonight, and  don't want to be late
It was someone very close to me
, moving in across the concentric rings of people, all plugged-in and softly chanting
toward the center, over the figure of Mo'at, to hover above -- , kneeling beside two  on the dais -- 151
and his  lie head to head
Human Jake is wearing an exomask
Both figures are still, hands folded, covered in translucent silken shrouds of -
as Neytiri removes the mask from Jake's human face
She gently closes his dead eyes with her fingertips
Then bends and kisses him
on   as Neytiri's hand comes into frame, stroking his cheek
slowly to-- '
Hold a beat, then -- They open
