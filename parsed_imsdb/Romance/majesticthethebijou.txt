the magic is all around you
All the time
Everywhere
In every thing
The trick
is to see it
" the insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat of -
Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up
in the blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumbling g-e-n-t-l-y, a picture-postcard: "

and another, each one dropping through frame, a gentle rain
In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and- footprints in the wet cement
Another postcard: "'      &
" In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at the Brown Derby
Or Ciro's
Or the Coconut Grove
More postcards
Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones that you and  know today
These are palaces
Temples
Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian
The Carthay Circle
The Paramount, the Million Dollar
From a time when moviegoing was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall
The ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded jackets and guided you to your seat
The popcorn was hot and fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil
: a wild jumble
Then, one   drops lazily on top of the pile
It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet of lights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt
Lee's most famous resident, the fully-lit

Postwar autos fill the muggy midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of , a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come
Darkened outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town, a swath of garishly bright concrete called '  (
) Of course, it's not like the postcards say it is
This is what it's like
'm Pete Appleton, and this is my town
Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the street to '
'  (
) Born and raised here, thank you very much
Sometimes, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else
But everyone loves the movies, so Hollywood is everyone's town, and they come here by the busload
To them, Grauman's Chinese Theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet
To me, it's the theater that's playing "The African Queen
" And like the man said, the film on the marquee is " "  Still the same shot, buses disgorge , who move into the forecourt of the theater
The doff their hats and mop their brows
The  pull their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks

Newsreel's just starting, folks
'  (
) That's me and my girlfriend
Her name is Sandra Sinclair, and this is her town, too -- she's from Cleveland
She came out here to be an actress, and that's just what she's doing
The first picture ever wrote, a little potboiler called "Sand Pirates of the Sahara
"  Okay, it ain't "Citizen Kane," but you gotta start somewhere
an explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend
Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting and golden light
We   the lobby, still in the same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect and we move into As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we  the soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the same shot -- we see the screen
As the march  to a crescendo, we '  : Bringing the news of the world to you
Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee Hearing Room, a title blares "
" Four years ago, in one of filmland's darkest hours, ten men, the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were called to testify before the House Committee of Un-American Activities, investigating the proliferation of the dreaded Red Menace in Hollywood
We see several shots of  engaged in heated verbal battles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman
and the Majority Counsel,
Refusing to answer the lawmaker's questions, cowering behind the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, the ten motion picture writers dared Congress to come after them
Well, come after them they did
And after years of court wrangling, it's now time to pay the piper
Over shots of several of the "Hollywood Ten" being led to jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues
And so, it's off to jail, the charge: Contempt of Congress
This should give you fellas something to write about now
new round of investigations begins this fall, the mandate: Get the reds out of Hollywood
In the audience, one man  "Lock up the commie bastards
," and a few others cheer and laugh
As the newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we Pete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and Sandra's a starlet pretty girl in her mid-20s
As she rummages in her purse, Pete watches the newsreel
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn
You bet, honey
Pete kisses Sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints up the aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin on his face
'  (
) We were young, we were in love, and we were working in pictures
Life
was good
: -   - Pete pulls up to the guard kiosk in his spiffy yellow convertible Plymouth
The Guard, , steps out to meet him
Pete lights up a cigarette
We get a better sense of him now
Though earnest, he's jocular, and a bit of a fast talker
(very chipper) Mornin', Ray
Whaddya know whaddya say
Me and Sandra caught "The African Queen" at the Chinese last night
Great picture, great picture
Ray is nonplussed
Tips his hat
Regards Pete suspiciously
Mr
Appleton
What's with this "Mr
Appleton" crap
Your boss hiding in there
You're clear to go in
What's that mean
Ray heads back to his kiosk, shaking his head
Have a pleasant day
Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot
- '  - Pete pulls up, hops out, grinds out his cigarette, looks around and goes inside
'   - Pete comes down the hall a few steps, stops
Something's wrong
It's awfully quiet
He pokes his head into the door marked "
" - sea of black Underwoods -- all silent
The lights in the room are off, and hard shafts of morning sun stream in through the windows
One typists, , is going from machine to machine, pulling covers over them
Louise
what gives
She looks up, startled
Oh Pete
they, uh, they gave everybody the day off
while they sort things out
Sort what out
Are my pages done
They took 'em
They took 'em
Who took 'em
Louise, what's going on
Pete, 'm not even supposed to be talking to you
She rushes past him
Pete doesn't quite know what to think
'  (
) Good morning, Peter
Pete turns
The voice belongs to Pete's agent,  , a rotund man in his fifties
He wears a perfectly tailored silk suit
Leo
what's going on
: - , we watch as Leo and Pete come out of the Writer's Building and join a flood of  , all done up in Puritan pilgrim garb and heading for the commissary
As they move through the mob and emerge on the other side, it's clear that Pete is reeling from something he's just been told
Peter, their hands are tied
You see that, don't you
don't believe this
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings
They say you did
Who the hell is this "they
" Congress, the , Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is
"They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters
(deliberately) Now, did you go to any meetings
(on the spot) No
Yeah
don't know
Maybe  did
Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor
was in college
It was a bunch of kids, and  was just one of 'em
didn't believe in what they were saying
Hell, didn't even know what they were saying
So, you're saying that it's true
You went to a meeting of a known communist organization
Leo,  was trying to impress a skirt
You know me, 'm non- political
Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway
You should watch what you say
don't know who fingered me, but 'm not a communist
Kid, that cuts no ice with them
(frustrated) What
That 'm accused of being a communist when  don't happen to be one
They know you were at that meeting, Peter
They've been told, and they know
Leo, you're my agent
Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss
didn't do anything wrong
fought in the war, for crissakes
Fought
Come on, Pete, you ran the at Fort Dix
was decorated
know
Purple Heart
Exactly
You broke your arm
You were coming out of a bar
You were drunk
At least  was on our side
Look, they want me to testify
'll testify
'll tell 'em anything they want to hear
Jesus, Leo, this is my career
You can't testify
Why not
Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket, offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself
Don't take this personally, kid
If it were up to me, 'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible
What can say
like you
Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own
Puts a fatherly hand on his shoulder
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them
They just don't want you writing pictures for now
That's all
(under his breath) Yeah, well, that's enough
Peter,  believe in you
More to the point,  read your new script
um
"Ashes To Ashes
" That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes
" think it's great
But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head
You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, 'm gonna do everything  can to make that happen
So, it is a blacklist
(defensive) Don't say that
There is no such thing as a blacklist
(calm) Now, are you gonna play ball
(sullenly) Yes
(then, pissed) Leo, goddammit
this isn't fair
Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke
(hand on Pete's shoulder) Kid, this is the United States Government we're talkin' about
Fair ain't the point
: ' /'  - Prominent on the wall is a framed " " poster
Pete reaches up and takes it down
He leans it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden swivel chair
He swivels around to see standing by the door
He's watching Pete's every move
Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's belongings
Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk drawer
He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the desk
He looks at the cover of the first one: "    " By Peter Appleton United Pictures Production February 19, 1951 Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the second one: "  " By Peter Appleton He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box, which contains somewhat more personal items
ragged gold pillow with tassels
Legal pads of notes
An old tin-toy fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn
He turns it around in his hands
(musing) Huh
Red
Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door
(
) Pete
Pete
Sandra appears in the doorway
She's in costume -- a Louis courtier
She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and embraces him
Oh, Pete
They kiss
The Guard watches their every move
What happened
What exactly did you hear
That you got let go
wasn't alone
Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in
He was, but he got sick
We got a new director today
Why
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching
You mean, he was
let go, too
(sotto, an appeal) They're saying 'm a communist, Sandy
But 'm not, you know that
'm gonna fight 'em, and 'm gonna win, but 'll need your help
During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling away from Pete
lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do
Hell, even if  was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be
Right
Sandra glances at the Guard, who is watching everything
(nervously) Of course, but
don't know how
how much help  can be to you
This is the sort of thing
someone saying you're a communist
it can ruin your career
Pete sees where this is going
She's edging toward the door
Will you help me, Sandy
'll have to think about this have to get back
should go
And she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye
Pete looks at the Guard
So nice to be a pariah
The Guard turns away
Pete moves back toward the boxes
Rummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels with barely one swig left
He regards the bottle for a moment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't), pops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it
He looks at it thoughtfully as we : -     setting down on a bartop
- The bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietly getting stewed
The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive, dimly lit and full of character and characters
It's a quiet night and getting quieter, as several  are just leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, , early 40s
Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of the bar
Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot
Good boy, he got most of it in the glass
Pete
You think maybe you've had enough
Bought the bottle, didn't
(raises the shot) To the United States of America
Long my she wave
He knocks it back and Jerry pours him another
(trying to light a smoke) Thanks, Jerry
Tell me something
What
You tight with
Edgar Hoover
(helps Pete light his cigarette) The -man
(thickly) Zackly
Pete, if
Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress,  wouldn't know him
Too bad
He says 'm a communist
(glancing around) You should watch what you say
You don't know who's listening
You know 'm not a communist, don't you, Jer
Sure,  suppose
That why you're on a bender
This is not a bender yet
This is the start of a bender
But  can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike
Pete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar
He watches Jerry, who is not about to refill it
Pete reaches for the bottle, but Jerry is faster
Pete
go home
Come on, 'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name
Sandy
(laughs) Sandra Sinclair
Gimmee her number, 'll have her pick you up
Sandra Sinclair
Wanna know her real name
Bella Iskowitz
No one's who they really are, Jer
Everyone's someone else
Even you
Even me
Especially me
'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist
wanna close up soon
'mon, let's call her
Peter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled bills on the bar and grabs his hat
Nope
Can't
We're through
Then 'll call you a cab
'll save you the trouble
(beat) 'm a cab
There
Did it myself
Pete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his car keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in his condition
'Sides, car's right outside
'll be seein' ya, Jer
Pete
And he's out the door
- Pete takes a few steps, stumbles, stops, takes a deep breath, then totters briskly towards his car
He hauls the door open and sits inside heavily
/
'  - Sitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably be a good idea
(mumbling) Drive
Drive
Bad idea
Too drunk to drive
He looks at his watch
One-thirty
Huh
Early
Can't go home yet
He turns the key and hits the starter
The engine hums to life
Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze and puts the car in gear
The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt and stalls
Oops
He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and down the deserted boulevard
: ,   - The full moon is low over the ocean
Pete's car is parked at the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away
The ferris wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight
Pete is asleep in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his face, snoring
The waves  against the pilings and startle Pete awake
Huh
Whatsa
Instantly, he grabs his head
'  (
) had no idea how  got to Santa Monica, but it certainly was a good idea
don't think  could've faced the headache  had alone in my apartment
At least  had the ocean air
Pete takes a deep breath
and starts coughing
He gets out his cigarettes and lights up
He takes a puff and glances at his watch
'  (
) Three forty-five
had only been there for a couple of hours at most
Truth be told,  was still fairly drunk
He starts the car and heads for the highway
'  (
) 'd head north until the sun came up or  ran out of gas, whichever came first
: - Pete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop
Waves crash to the shore below the roadway
/
'  () - Pete is finally relaxed
He takes off his hat and jams it down in the back seat
He takes a deep breath -- with the wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at peace
He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the fuel gauge
- Pinning on "empty
" Shit
'  (
) Guess which came first
He scans the road ahead -- nothing
Glances to his right
' The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance
Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that will take him toward the lights
He passes a hand-painted sign that gives him hope: " - 1
" : '   - Pete's car rolls up and stops
There's a light on the sign and another in the station's window, but the place is deserted
'  (
) should've known better than to think that a service station in the sticks would be open at this hour, but it wasn't like  had a lot of choices
Pete looks ahead toward the town
Its few lights twinkle in the distance
'  (
) What the hell
At least there'd be a diner opening in a couple of hours
'd get some pie and coffee, and then  could worry about the gas
Pete pulls out onto the road
- Pete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted roadside sign which reads: -   - /
'  () - Pete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading " ," just in front of a small wooden auto bridge
Barely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge
- his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless possum
Pete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the edge
- and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and into the rapidly-moving water below
- The water is flowing very quickly, and the current is intense
Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat (thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the windshield
But
his left sleeve is caught on the door handle
Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface
- Pete breaks the surface and gasps for air
His fight isn't over yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream
He swims with all his might toward the far bank
- Drained, Pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to his feet
(gasping) Oh my god
don't believe
oh my god
He stumbles along backwards a couple of steps
and his heel hits a rock
Pete falls backward -- and his head strikes a glancing blow on another rock
He rolls down the bank, unconscious, and lands face down in the mud
, we slowly become aware of a panting, breathing sound -- the sound of a dog
: ' yellow labrador, full frame
It takes a couple more sniffs, then starts licking furiously
'  (
) Maggie, whatcha got there
Huh, girl
Whatcha find
- Pete is still laying face down on the bank, being fervently licked in the face by the dog
no-nonsense sort in his late-60s, he wears overalls and an old railroad cap
He comes down to Pete, and using his walking stick, pokes him in the side
Mister, who are ya
my dog likes you, but that don't mean much, she likes skunks, too
Sweet n'stupid, that's why  keep her
Pete blinks up at the Old Man, his mouth gaping open
Mister, you okay
You look wet
You in an accident or somethin'
don't know
He sits up, and the Old Man gets a look at his head, which is caked with mud and blood on one side
You best come with me
Can ya walk
yes,  think so
He stands up shakily
The Old Man gives Pete a hand
Come on, we'll have the Doc look you over
My head hurts
shouldn't be surprises
You smell like that was quite a night before you had there
(to the dog) Maggie
Let's go now
And they head toward the road to town
, we them pass a roadside sign: : , 1869 275
1755 () Name's Stanton Lawson
My ancestors founded this town
Ancestors
Actually, my grandpap
But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it
(hands Pete a handkerchief) Here
Pete takes the handkerchief and wipes the mud and some of the blood off his face
suppose
Thanks
You look familiar, fella
What's your name
Pete stops, thinks for a moment
'm
honestly don't know
: - ,  - Pete and Stanton walk along Commerce Street, the main drag through the center of the small town
Lawson is a bit run down, creeping inexorably toward decrepit
Despite that, there's a timeless quality to the small buildings, a familiar All-American feel
Several of the  walking along the street take notice of Pete and nod to Stanton, who nods back
They all know you
'Course they all know me
And know all them
Town's got my name, don't it
They pass the window of the drug store, '
Pete looks down and sees in the window with two faded photos, all decked in tattered black crepe
Two boys, no more than 18 and 19, who went off to war and didn't come back
Stanton notes Pete stopping to look at the stars and photos
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor
Lost both his boys in the war
Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy
(thinking) The war
(points across the street) Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max
Okinawa, believe
- ' typical small-town greasy spoon -- with one faded star prominent in the window
On  , a sweet-faced woman in her 30s
She stares vacantly into space, her reverie broken by a customer needing a coffee refill
All told, this little town gave sixty-two of its finest to the war
Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone
More'n its share,  should say
Got us a letter from President Truman
City council commissioned a war memorial
Been sittin' in the basement of city hall these six years
Town never had the heart to put it up
Place just hasn't been the same since the war
Pete looks longingly toward the diner
Stanton takes note
You hungry, son
Yes
Very
Got any money
Pete rummages in his pants pockets, and comes up with three quarters
Six bits
More'n enough to buy some breakfast
'mon
And they head across the street
: fork comes into frame and tears into one of the slices
'  - Pete is fairly shoveling the pie into his mouth, pausing only to wash it down with gulps of coffee
stands nearby, watching in amazement as her pie is consumed in record time
Pete notices that Stanton and Mabel -- and the other , for that matter -- are watching his feeding frenzy
He stops in his tracks, and starts chewing leisurely
He smiles at Mabel
(mouth full) Pie's
good
(wryly) Like you could tell
(to Stanton) Where'd you find him
Down by the wash
We gotta put a rail on that thing before someone else gets killed
(to Pete) Three people have died there, Mister
You're lucky to be alive
(draining the coffee cup) Thanks
More coffee
Mabel obliges
As she pours the coffee, she looks at Pete
You know, you look familiar
You ever been in here before
Pete shakes his head
He don't remember who he is, Mabel
Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon as he gets in
(distractedly) Doc should be in for his coffee and bear claw any minute
(to Pete) You sure you never been in here
Pete looks up at Mabel and smiles winningly
'd remember this pie
Mabel, thoroughly charmed, smiles back at Pete
(patting his hand) 'll just get you another piece
- stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner
There's a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man who has little to smile about because he has little to care about
After a couple of steps, he's met up by , a vigorous man in his 50s
He comes up behind Harry and claps him on the back
'Mornin' Harry
Fine day, isn't it
Morning, Doc
Yes, yes it looks just fine
Plenty to do today
(vaguely) Oh, yes, plenty
Plenty
They're at the door of the diner
Doc opens it for Harry
After you
'  - Lardner comes over to Mabel, who hands him a tall paper cup of coffee and bags him a bear claw
Mornin' Mabel, Stan
Mornin' Doc
Got some new business for you today
Lardner and Pete make eye contact, and the doctor notices the bump on his head
Hello, son
How'd that happen
He don't know
And he don't know his name, neither
Found him down by the wash
You'd better come with me, son
(to Mabel, indicating the coffee and danish) On my tab
You bet
Lardner, Stanton and Pete rise and move to the door
Pete turns back, takes the three quarters out of his pocket, and puts them on the counter, smiling brightly at Mabel
Thanks
Great pie
(blushing) You're welcome
Come again
seated at the opposite end of the counter
He glances up at Pete
' as Pete smiles at Mabel and turns to go
His mouth falls open, his hand moves to cover it
He's just seen a ghost
'  -
as the three men pass by the diner's window
- (wide eyed) Sweet Jesus
: -- moving left-to-right, right-to-left through space
' Follow my finger
Just use your eyes
That's it
Good
- Doc Lardner is checking Pete's eyes
Pete sits on an examination table, his shirt off, his head freshly bandaged
Stanton lurks in the corner, Maggie curled at his feet
He was passed out cold
Maggie woke 'im
Uh-huh
He looks familiar
(to Pete) Open your mouth
Say "ah
" Pete does
Lardner has a look as Stanton pulls out a pocket watch
Said as much myself, Doc
Can't place him, though
To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker
(looks at his watch) Well, morning's half-over
'm off
Thank you, Mr
Lawson
Don't mention it
Whoever-you-are
Stanton and Maggie exit
Lardner checks Pete's ears
Any idea how you got here, son
No, sir
Lardner sniffs him
Been drinkin' a bit, have we
don't remember
guess so
Smells like it
(smacks his lips and frowns) Tastes like it
Well, you've been wet to the skin
You must've fallen in
guess  did
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean
Lardner takes a shirt off his counter and hands it to Pete
Here, one of mine
Thanks
Pete puts on the shirt
Do you remember if you were driving a car
Maybe you went over the bridge
No guard rail there, it's easy to do
It's happened before
It's possible
just don't remember
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right
(frustrated) no,
just can't
(gently) It's okay, son
We just need to call you something
That's all
Pete stifles a laugh
What is it
Call me
Ishmael
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick
" : '   - Lardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling his bear claw
Pete is standing, nosing around the office -- diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks
He zeros in on one photo in particular
one of Lardner and a beautiful
They've been fishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catch than Lardner
(into phone) Stanton found him by the wash
Not hurt too bad, but he took a nasty bump on the head and he can't remember who he is
We both think he looks familiar, but we can't place him
You bet
He'll be here
Lardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures
That's me and my daughter Adele
My pride and joy
Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does
She's very pretty
Thanks
Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are
Lardner stares at him
Pete takes note, turns toward him
sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me
Wish  could say the same thing
: '  - The Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and , 45, gets out
As he gets a few steps from the door, Harry Trumbo jumps out from around the side of the building and stops him
(excited) Cecil
Cecil, there's a young man in there
(startled) Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office
Listen to me
The young man in there
Eldridge keeps moving to the door
(interrupting) Stan Lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning, and 'm here to investigate, and if we find anything interesting, it'll be in the paper, so why don't you just
Harry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by the shoulders
Cecil, listen to me
The sheriff stops
(breathless) It's Luke
: '   - Sheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete
He's staring at him intently
Silence
No wallet, huh
No identification at all
(beat) What're you thinkin', Cecil
What 'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here
mystery or a damn miracle
And by god  can't tell which
(to Pete) Boy, you say you have no idea who you are
That right
Yes
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge
No
But
But what
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something
What's that
"It's a Wonderful Life
" The Jimmy Stewart picture remember that one
Saw it over at the Bijou
So, you remember that, huh
"It's a Wonderful Life
" Or the Bijou
Either one
remember the picture
but don't remember where  saw it
The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door
Doc, with your permission,  want to bring someone in here
Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory
By all means
Eldridge opens the door
(to someone offscreen) Harry, why don't you come on in here
Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head of snow-white hair
He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and slowly turns to face Pete
He looks closer
and closer
Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze
Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe
looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face
has tears forming in his eyes
smile turns up the corners of his mouth, and quickly lights up his whole face
(softly, to Eldridge) Are you saying that he's
(smiling broadly) Shhhhhh
Harry takes Pete in his arms and hugs him tightly, burying his face in Pete's shoulder and sobbing
knew all along
knew you were alive
Oh, Luke
Pete doesn't quite know what to think
He clearly has no idea who this old man is
(mouth agape in disbelief) Mother o'god
(to Pete) Give the man a hug, boy
That's your father
Pete looks at Harry
It's not so much that he remembers anything -- he's swept up in the moment
My father
Pete wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tightly, glancing over at who look on goofily, fighting back tears
They smile at Pete, who smiles back tentatively
: '  - Harry, Pete, Eldridge and Lardner come outside
'mon, 'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou
The Bijou
That's where you live
We live in a theater
Only one in town
(he opens the car door for Pete) Get in, son
(sotto, to Lardner) Ben, when's Delly due back
(sotto) Tomorrow afternoon
(seized by a thought) oh my god
(sotto) Exactly
Break it to her gently
Eldridge and Harry get in the car
Lardner comes over to Pete's back seat window
Get plenty of rest, Luke
You took a pretty big wallop there
He turns to move away, then turns back
Good to have you back
Eldridge starts the car and they drive away
(: Henceforth, "" will be known as "
"  It'll be easier to keep track of things, since everyone's now calling him Luke, anyway
Trust me
) : '  () - Harry sits next to the Sheriff, and Luke has the back seat all to himself
He leans forward toward the front seat and taps Harry on the shoulder
Excuse me
what's your, um, your name
Harry, son
Harry
And
what's my name again
Albert Lucas Trumbo
But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby
Ah
(taking it for a spin) Luke
Luke
like it
Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street
Shops are open for business,  are going about their lives
few stop and watch as the Sheriff's car goes by
How long have  been gone
Eldridge looks at Harry, who stares ahead
How long
Pause
The silence is too thick, and Harry has to answer
He turns around in his seat and faces Luke
(gently) You never came back from the war
We were told you were missing and presumed dead
When did  leave
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor
January seventh
nineteen forty-two
Luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in
Nine and-a-half years ago
Nine and-a-half years
Comin' up on the Bijou, gents
- Eldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops
Here we are
Well, son, you're home
Luke peers across the street
his mouth gapes open
-
The Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of building styles
It's as though the architect took random parts of a Chinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly built the result
As a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was "The Bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message "    " was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet
And now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " " sign becomes apparent
Train tracks run right behind the building on an elevated trestle
As we watch, a Everything shakes
It's not an earthquake, it's a trainquake
The "" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers
stares at the monstrosity
His face is ashen
His heart has sunk to somewhere below his knees
The Bijou
Harry jumps out of the car excitedly
Thanks for the lift, Cecil
Don't mention it
Welcome home, Luke
(faint smile) Thanks
Luke opens the back door and slowly steps out
Harry grabs his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket
Wait'll you see the inside
(deadpan) Can't wait
: - The interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by the exterior
Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in shards and pieces from the walls
It's sort of a cross between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable combination of questionable taste and neglect
Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is -- probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole theater -- Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and scatter it in a hundred directions
Luke and Harry standing below
Luke is lost in a gulf somewhere between surprise and disgust
We've been closed for a while
(smiling wanly) Ah
Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one open
- The ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved itself up against the row behind or in front
is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin, framed by ragged red velveteen drapery
In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old upright piano
Luke walks a few steps down the aisle
He picks a seat on the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits
As he does, a , an orange tabby, leaps out from under another seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and backstage
Harry comes over and sits behind him
(turning to Harry) Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed
Hmmmm
after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died
we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight
Why
(deep breath) Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies,  guess
Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco
Wasn't much to keep 'em here,  expect
And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to
Didn't you have any help
Oh,  had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much
Broke their hearts when we closed up
Broke mine, too
(brightening) But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure
(rises, grabs Luke's arm) 'mon, 'll show you where we live
: - The small apartment above the projection booth is quite a contrast to the rest of the theater
It's neat as a pin, and fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains, allowing the sun to flood the room
beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke
It's a Norman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder
He has one arm around Harry and the other around his mother
(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling
) The day you shipped out
That was a proud day for your mother and me
Last time you saw her
Last time saw you
He smiles
Till today
Luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine looking woman
It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from the 30's
That's Lily
Your mother, rest her soul
(repeating) Mother
(to Harry) She's beautiful
(coming over) Well, yes, that she was
She certainly made this place a home
He takes the picture from Luke, kisses it, and gently replaces it on the table
Luke goes over to the sofa and sits
(brightly) Can  get you anything
can put some coffee on or some
Harry looks at Luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleep on the sofa
He goes to him, gently picks his feet off the floor, lifts them onto the sofa
Removes his shoes, sets them on the floor
: being drawn up Luke's chest
stands, looks down warmly at his son
Then, suddenly, he's seized by a thought
He turns and crosses to the window
- There's a small picture frame in the window
Harry reaches down, gingerly picks it up and turns it around
It's a single, faded gold star
One war casualty
Harry clutches it to his chest, looks over at the sleeping Luke and smiles
(softly) When  woke up this morning, my son was dead
Now,  have my boy again
(closes his eyes) have my boy again
: - It's early morning
Luke is sound asleep, still in his clothes
In the distance, a train sounds its
Luke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly
Slowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed
Something's strange, though
He frowns
The train is Luke's eyes
' As the train  , shaking everything in the room, Luke looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him
Harry, an elderly , and an elderly
(smiling) 'Morning, Son
(smiling) Good morning, Luke
(no expression) 'Mornin'
Sleep well
Luke is speechless
It he dreaming this
They couldn't wait to see you
Who
are they
This is the staff of the Bijou
Oh
What
what time is it
Six-thirty
thought we'd get an early start
Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more awake
He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged
The elderly woman nudges Harry gently
Oh, 'm sorry, they know you, but you don't
you need to be re- introduced
Luke, this is Mrs
Irene Terwilliger
Luke stands and shakes
' hand
She's tiny, seventy if she's a day
She smiles and curtsies slightly
Her eyes sparkle brightly, her manner almost coquettish
Head cashier and refreshments clerk
So glad to have you back, my boy
(to Harry) Much more handsome than  remember him
And this fine fellow is our head usher, resident fix-it man and custodian
Luke, meet Old Tim
(to Old Tim) You remember Luke, don't you
is -- well, old
His clothes are a tad shabby, but well maintained, though they hang loosely on his gangly frame
He wears an old blue knit cap, which he quickly removes as he shakes Luke's hand
He's a man of few words, his manner is painfully shy -- and he never smiles
Is there a young Tim
No
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim
" Pause
'm old
Harry steps forward, takes Luke's arm
Well, lots to do, so we'd better get a move on
: - Luke, Harry and Mrs
Terwilliger walk down the aisle toward the screen
Old Time lags a few steps behind
At the orchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit
The screen is a sea of repair patches
Harry pats it
Dust flies
'Fraid this has seen better days
Well,  was meaning to get a new screen, anyway
n-need me a new uniform
Luke looks at Old Tim, then at Harry
(to Luke) promised him a new uniform when we re-opened
(to Old Tim) And you'll get one, too
You know,  hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which 'm willing to bet none of us has
Silence from the group
thought so
Beat
Harry brightens, clambers down the steps and races up the aisle
Anyone want to see the projector
: are squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fan motor
puff of smoke, then --  -- metal door is closed over the arcs
- Harry dances around to the other side of the projector and adjusts the focus on the beam of light
The others look on as he gazes at the screen through the tiny window
Beautiful
Bright and even from edge to edge
See for yourself
The carbons sputter and die
The light flickers out
Harry is crestfallen, turns off the motor
She's always been a bit tricky
: - Mrs
Terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with a ragged feather duster, a hopeless task
Old Tim is on a rickety ladder, replacing burned-out bulbs in the chandelier
The orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of the ladder
Old Tim climbs down and catches his breath
Mrs
Terwilliger sneezes
Bless
Thank you, Timothy
They both stop their work and glance warily at the door marked "
" (sotto) What do you suppose they're talking about
Dunno
Boy's smart
(brightly) Yes, he seems to be
Bad for us
- Luke is poring over the ledger books, adding up figures on an old manual adding machine
Um
Harry
Did  ever keep the books here
No, your mother did, then  did after she passed
Well, 'm the first one to admit that  don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here
He scans down a page
(reading) "February 10, 1942
Picture 'Ball of Fire
'" (appreciatively) Gary Cooper
And Barbara Stanwyck
Yowsa
(reading) "Eight p
m
showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84
75
plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs
" He closes the book and looks expectantly at Harry
Yes
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs
" Forty-two was a lean year around here
The war had just started
you were gone less than a month
and we were coming off a bit of a drought as  recall
Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me
At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures
Yeah,  know, but poultry
(rhapsodically) know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace
Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you
Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs
you were in a palace
It was like a dream
It was like heaven, like you died and went to a palace in heaven, that's what it was like
And spotless, too
Inspired, Harry stands, takes Luke by the arm
Come with me
He drags him out of the office and into the lobby
- Mrs
Terwilliger and Old Tim watch as Harry leads Luke through the lobby
(smiling) Maybe you had problems and worries out there, but once you came through that door, they didn't matter anymore
In here, you were safe
Maybe it was just an escape from reality, but
oh, god
it was beautiful
Harry leads Luke into the auditorium
The car follows, but Mrs
Terwilliger and Old Tim stay behind
- Harry trots down the aisle and looks up at the screen
(exuberant) Charlie Chaplin
Keaton and Lloyd
Swanson
And later on, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart and Becall and Judy and Mickey
and Fred and Ginger
He turns to Luke
(emphatically) They
were
like
gods
He points to the screen
And that
was the altar
Would you remember if  told you, we felt lucky to be here, to have the privilege of watching them
(sadly) This television thing
Why would you want to sit at home and watch a little box with a little screen
Because it's convenient
Because you don't have to get dressed and put on a coat and a tie and a hat
Because you can just
sit there
How can you call that "entertainment," all alone in your living room
Where are the other people
Where's the audience
Harry comes over to Luke
(emphatically) Where's the magic
He stands behind Luke and whispers in his ear
'll tell you
In a place like this, the magic is all around you
All the time
Everywhere
In every thing
He turns Luke around and looks him in the eye
The trick
is to see it
Pause
But
Son,  think you loved the Bijou even more than  did
You've got to remember that
You've got to
Still looking at Luke, Harry takes a step back, then slowly walks up the aisle, disappearing into the lobby
Luke walks down the aisle
At the edge of the orchestra pit, he stands looking up at the screen
The orange tabby cat , and Luke glances toward it, standing onstage by the edge of the screen
They exchange looks as we : - Doc Lardner is seated in an easy chair, his feet up, reading Life magazine
The radio is on, and Patti Page is singing "The Tennessee Waltz
" There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up
In the entrance hall, the front door opens
"" enters
She's a strikingly beautiful woman in her late 20s
She takes off a felt cap, and her long, auburn hair cascades down
Dad
Delly
In here
Lardner rises as Adele comes into the living room
They embrace warmly
How'd it go
Not as bad as  thought it would
think  passed
(kisses her forehead) That's my girl
(he hugs her again) Did you
No hiccups, which was good
Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous
("serious" lawyer voice) "Your (hic
) honor,  (hic
) object
" They laugh
always told you, baby
(taps her head) it's all up here
Lardner gives her an extra squeeze, continues to hold onto her just a bit too long
Adele detects something amiss
Dad
What is it
Beat
Well, it's
Adele breaks away from him
(extreme concern) Oh my god
who died
: on a kitchen table
Offscreen, we
Then another
Adele's hand reaches into frame
- Lardner stands over Adele, who is seated at the table, holding the glass of water
Drink slowly
She raises the glass to her lips
From the other side of the glass
It's a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water, but Adele accomplishes it with aplomb
She waits for a moment -- then hiccups again
think (hic
) it's worse (hic
) now
That always used to work
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get (hic
) news like this
You're sure he's (hic
) okay
Other than the (hic
) bump on the head
(hedging) Well
(hic
) Dad
(hic
) Lardner sits at the table and takes Adele's hand
He doesn't remember anything, Delly
Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone
including me
Right
(hic
) 'm afraid not
He looked right at your picture without batting an eye
But it's probably temporary
He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head
'm sure it'll all come back to him
It just takes a catalyst
You mean, (hic
) me
It's possible
Off Adele's thoughtful hiccuping, we : - Luke and Harry, walking along, make a turn onto Commerce Street, heading for Mabel's
It's still light out, and a soft breeze skitters some leaves along the sidewalk
take breakfast and supper at Mabel's every day except Sunday
Have for years, since Lily died
If it weren't for Mabel, 'd probably starve to death
, a slight, balding man in his 50s, is locking the door of his pharmacy across the street, when he spots Harry and Luke
Harry
Hold on a second
Ernie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands before Luke, staring
Luke shoots a glance at Harry, who taps Ernie on the shoulder
It's really him, Ernie
(agape) Well, 'll be
He sticks his hand out and Luke takes it
Ernie pumps it enthusiastically
By god, Luke, if it isn't good to see you again
(uncertain) Uh, thanks
Good to see you again, too, uh
Ernie
Ernie
(still at a lose) Well, 'll be
We were just gonna get some supper
Would you like to join us
Would  ever
The three walk toward the diner, but before they get two steps, they hear: ' Is that Luke Trumbo
They turn to see a stout woman,  , 40s, rushing toward them
She rushes right into a very surprised Luke's arms and hugs him tightly
Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you back
Katie, would you like to join us for dinner
The more, the merrier
: '  - The diner is packed
In addition to Ernie and Katie, , and  occupy every seat and table, and many more are standing, even hanging out the door
At the focus of the crowd are Luke and Harry, seated at the counter
Harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner, while Luke is working on a steak
young man seated at the opposite side of the counter is speaking
He's  , 30s
(eagerly) Hey, Luke, remember the time you and me, we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa my head
few people shake their heads, smile and laugh
Uh, no
What happened
(deflated) Well
um, all the hair got singed offa my head
It was pretty funny
couple of  are heard
Oh
Even my eyebrows
But they grew back
Luke leans toward Harry, who never looks up from his chicken
Carl
Friend of yours from high school
Everybody calls him "Cueball
" (sincerely) Oh, hi Cue
Carl
Sorry
(brightening) Oh, heck, that's all right
It's just good to have you back
Isn't that right, Bob
Hey, Luke, you remember my brother Bob
You two joined up the same day
Luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to Carl
is a good-looking fellow, a few years older than Carl
His face is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down on his forehead
He looks up at Luke with hollow eyes
Brings his right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up
Except there's no hand there -- it's a hook
(quietly) Hey, Bob
Good to meet you
Bob doesn't react
He glances away, and for a moment, his eyes meet Mabel's
She smiles warmly
He turns away
Ernie Cole pipes up
Luke,  know there's a question that's on everybody's mind
What's that
Well, now that you're back, what're your plans
All eyes on Luke
He freezes, having just taken a forkful of food in his mouth
Harry jumps in
Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's what
goes through the crowd
Stanton Lawson, standing behind Luke, taps him on the shoulder
That true
(on the spot) Well
we're gonna try
That's a lot of work, son
Place's been closed, what, three, four years now
Gonna be tough
If it's tough, that means it's worth doing
Someone shouts "That's the spirit
," another shouts "Hear, hear
," and a chorus of  join in agreement
Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt
' Uh, back here, Mr
Mayor
Well, come on out here so's we can see you
steps around from the back of the crowd near the door
He's a tall, dark-haired, gangly, bespectacled kid, no more than 19 or 20
Painfully shy, he clutches a clarinet case to his chest
He timidly smiles and waves at Luke, who smiles and nods back
Hey, Luke
Hi, Spencer
Spence, that band of yours -- you think they're ready to play
(to Luke) Spencer and his pals went ahead and got together a good ol' big band
We've been practicing
uh, sure, guess
Well, how about tomorrow night, eight p
m
, in city hall square
What 'm proposin' is a "Welcome Home Luke" celebration
Vociferous general  from the crowd -- which is quickly quieted by a , which starts at the front door
The crowd parts and grow silent, revealing a woman standing in the doorway
She locks eyes with Luke
Her hand goes to her mouth and her eyes well up
Slowly, she moves around the counter, the crowd moving aside for her
She stands in front of Luke, who has stood up to meet her
Her eyes moist, she looks up at him
Do you
remember me
've seen you before
Your picture
Mabel, clutching a napkin, leans over to Katie
(sotto) Look
but  don't think  remember you
Adele leans up and kisses him softly
He looks at her
But 'll sure try
As Mabel and Katie dab at their eyes, we : - Adele and Luke stroll down the street side by side
She looks at him for a long moment
What
No,
just wondering where you've been all this time
Me too
You look
different
do
Yeah, a little
think you grew an inch or so
And you've lost weight
did
Huh
Tentatively, she takes his hand and holds it
From behind them, we
Adele turns
' Keeping a discreet distance,  from the diner is following them
Adele turns and addresses the crowd
(to the group) You can all go home, now
He's not going anywhere
Go on home, folks
And thanks for the welcome
Harry comes over
'll be home in a little while, Harry
Don't wait up
You two have a lot of catching up to do,  guess
You bet
Goodnight, son
(tips his hat) 'Night, Delly
And the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing the pair goodnight
Luke and Adele watch them disperse
There
We're alone
They turn and start walking
Then why do  feel like we're still being shadowed
Well
where can we go
Adele brightens
know a place
Come on
She grabs his hand and they run toward the town square
- Adele and Luke stand by the front steps
City hall
You must not remember anything
Come on
She grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building
- Adele and Luke stand by a basement window, inches off the ground
She looks around
Certain the coast is clear, she pounds on the window in three "special" places, and it pops up and open
She looks at Luke
You first
Why me
Be a gentleman
You have to help me down
, : , -
Slowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing , praying before a soldier's grave
We slowly   from the top of the statue
- (
) When we were kids, my Dad was mayor, and you and me and a bunch of others used to come down here all the time
looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the window
The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here
(looks at the door) How'd they get it inside
Through the door
It comes apart
She moves to the memorial
Squinting, she examines its base
Your name's on here
See
Luke comes over
-- ' Right here
"Albert Lucas Trumbo
" And all the others
knew them all
So did you
We went to school with most of them
It doesn't seem right, this being down here
It ought to be where people can see it
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it
The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall
Everyone finally got tired of the fighting
So they stuck it down here
He looks at her for a long moment
There's an electricity between them, and they both feel it
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer
(suddenly defensive) And why not
Whoa
(smiling) Sorry
You don't know how many times 've heard that
" lady lawyer
Are you crazy
"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man
Or better, in fact
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer
You
don't remember, but yes, ever since  was a little girl
What did
what did  want to be
(gently) Oh, well
guess you
in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman
And we were on the debate team together
But think you were gonna run the Bijou
You were brought up there, and you loved it so much
And  think you knew how much the town needed a place like that
He turns away, rubs his head
just wish  could remember some of this
He turns back to her
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone
you know
like that
Actually,  was married
For four years
But
well, we didn't fit together
'm divorced now
'm sorry
No, it's okay
See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the
the key that unlocks the rest of you
'm not making sense, am
(moving toward her) No, you are
know exactly what you mean
It's not that you're missing something
It's that the other person gives something to you
that you had all the time
You just didn't see it until they came along
(smiling) Yeah
Pause
We were in love
weren't we
(quietly) Yes
(then:) Hic
She instantly covers her mouth, but it's no good
She has the hiccups again
What was that
Nothing
(hic
) Do you have the
'm (hic
) fine
Really
(hic
) Luke smiles and watches Adele as she makes the decision to not struggle against the hiccups
She has them, and that's just the way it is
Were we going to get married
Eventually
We were going to be (hic
) engaged
when you came back from (hic
) overseas
He looks at her
She's strikingly beautiful at this particular moment and in this particular light -- hiccups and all
He moves closer to her
She moves closer to him
(breathless) but you had to go
serve (hic
) your country
They kiss passionately
She reaches up and puts her arms around him
He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping
Hey
it worked
And as she smiles and kisses him again we : - Luke comes down the street and heads for the front door
He has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys and enters
- It's very dark
Luke is about to swing shut the heavy door, when he looks down and sees shoot into the lobby, stopping in the middle of the floor
It looks at Luke, and
Luke closes the door and moves to the cat
He crouches down and pets it, and its back rises to meet his hand
Hey, fella
So you live here, too, huh
How come Harry didn't mention that
The cat moves to the auditorium door, pausing to look back at Luke
Curiosity piqued, Luke follows the cat
- In the dim light, we  an old mop and pail, some dirty film cans, and a large beat-up cardboard standee of "The Tramp" with the legend, "Chaplin Short To-Day
" The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door at the end of a hallway
Luke, following the cat, comes around the same corner and looks at Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as the sound of Old Tim softly humming "It's a Long Way to Tipperary
" Luke moves to the door and knocks
Um, Old Tim
Sorry, it's late
It's Luke
Can  come in
The humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open, revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat, stroking its fur
Found me
Yeah
hope you don't mind didn't know anyone lived here
well, besides Harry
And me
Old Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow him
'  - The room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot, which is perfectly made, military-style
Not used to visitors
(gesturing) Sit
Old Tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to the "kitchen" area -- a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny icebox
Luke sits in the chair, and Old Tim sits on the cot, facing him
Silence
Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau
It's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious and handsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform
The cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke
He rubs against his legs, purring
Luke leans down to pet him
So  guess this fellow belongs to you
What's his name
Cat
Cat
That's simple
like it
(pets Cat) Hi, Cat
(sudden change-of-subject) We thought you was dead, you know
(another new thought) It's okay that  live here
Of course
Pause, then suddenly
Do you think 'll get me a new u-u uniform
Luke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaks more than a couple of words
'll do everything  can
Old Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached
-t-thank you
Thank you always
always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army
They give me a medal, but  lost it in the h-h-hospital
forget things sometimes
Since the w-w-war
Yeah
me too
: '  (
) - It's a pretty typical bachelor's apartment
The " " poster leans up against a chair
Pete's two boxes of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table, the empty bottle of Jack Daniels on top
There's an insistent  at the door
'  (
) Mr
Appleton
Mr
Appleton
You in there
This is the Super, have the master key and 'm coming in
We  the key in the lock and the door swings open, revealing the building , 50s
Behind him is Leo Kubelsky
They enter the room, and the Super sniffs the air
You smell gas
Don't smell nothin'
He must not be dead in here
Jesus
Hey, it's the best way to tell
Leo moves to the boxes and rummages through them
He picks up the empty bottle, examines it
You think he's drunk somewhere
(under his breath) Wouldn't blame him if he was
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency
He lose his job or somethin'
(holding out his folding money) What's his rent
Thirty a month
Leo peels off a hundred-dollar bill
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place
Now, need a moment alone
(examining the bill) Huh
Take a hike
Am-scray
Huh
Oh, sure
Just pull the door shut when you leave
The Super exits and Leo crosses to the phone and dials "
" (into phone) Police department
want to report a missing person
: - It reads: "     -
" and   , both 30s and - men to the core, hustle into the office
'  - is 35, a small, thin-lipped, reptilian man in the Roy Cohn mold
He's on the phone at the moment
(into phone) You say you know nothing about it
You say this, yet you offer no proof
How am  supposed to believe you
Clyde's  knocks on the door, sticks her head in
Mr
Clyde
Agents Saunders and Brett need to see you
(covering the phone) You do see that 'm busy, do you not
It's about Appleton
Clyde's eyes brighten
Tell them to come in
(into phone) 'll have to call you back
love you too, Mother
Saunders and Brett stride into the office
We've got a situation developing
(interrupting) Will you take those goddamn hats off
They stop, shuck off their hats
Saunders starts over again
We've got a situation developing out on the coast
Appleton's just been reported missing
Clyde grins darkly
This is good
This is very good
Los Angeles Police Department investigated
His car's missing
No signs of forced entry or struggle at his apartment
Clyde considers this for a beat, then: You two are on this as of now
Tell the  their investigation has been federalized on my order
You find me this Appleton
(leans back, smiling) want to see what this one has to say
: - Luke is sitting at the desk, making notes and adding up some figures
He puts his pencil down and rubs his eyes, then looks up at who are sitting on the floor, going through piles of lobby cards and folded one-sheets like little boys fascinated with their baseball cards
He shifts his gaze to who is straightening out and dusting the tops of the two or three file cabinets in the corner of the office
As she works, she hums an old song, occasionally breaking into the lyrics: (sings) "The object of my affection, Can change my complexion, From white to rosy red
" Luke takes a breath: Well
Yes
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater
it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up
Oh, my
(taken aback) Nine hundred
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank
Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since 'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make
What are those
(glances at Old Tim) They're
That's my r-r-rent
Oh
It's all my fault
was neglectful and this is the price of that
Don't say that
Well, it's true
Wanting to open this place back up
It's folly, Irene, pure and simple
Might as well just call it what it is
Off everyone's worried looks, we : It's tiny, with rounded corners, black-and-white, and a hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow
- Doc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "Your Show of Shows
"  He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit ears, steps back -- and is successful
And are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch, and Lardner fairly roars with laughter
He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so, the reception goes haywire
He returns to the spot in front of the , and the picture is perfect again
The
He's torn -- if he moves, the picture will break up
The doorbell  again, and we  Adele's voice from upstairs: (
) Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in
'll be right down
Honey,
can't
it's the
There's a  at the door
(giving in) Oh, hell
He moves from his spot
The reception goes bad, and he marches to the door
He opens it, and Luke is standing there, wearing a slightly out-of-date coat and tie
Evening, Luke
Evening, Doctor Lardner
Lardner freezes, staring at Luke
What's wrong
(shaken from his reverie) Uh, no
just seeing you standing there, it reminded me
there's a word for it
Oh, you mean the suit
Harry kept all my old clothes
Fits okay, but it's a little big
Adele comes down the stairs
Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke
Oh
Awkward pause
Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous
shouldn't have worn the suit
Adele comes down the stairs
No
you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before
Oh
and It's just
well, deja vu
That's it
Deja vu
Another awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other
Lardner breaks it
You kids off to the dance
Aren't you coming
No, 'm not much of a dancer
(chidingly) Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working
had it, a minute ago
He glances at the  set
The picture is suddenly crystal clear
ooooh, It's back
(encouraging them toward the door) Well, you kids have fun now
Adele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living room
-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the carefully all the while
The reception is staying perfect
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to
He stifles his urge, and heads for his chair
Gingerly, he sits
Still perfect
Satisfied, he finally  out loud and puts his feet up
The picture goes completely haywire again
Aw, crap
- Adele and Luke walk along, arm-in-arm
This is strange
Do you feel it
What
We've done this before, so many times
The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday
Oh
Pause
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening
(interrupting) It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly
(shocked) Nine hundred
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around
What about a loan
You could go to the bank
loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life
Not likely
Well, there's got to be a way
(suddenly) Have you got a cigarette
Adele stops
When did you start smoking
don't smoke
You tried to once
It was pretty pitiful
Oh
Adele glances curiously at Luke as we : launching into the opening bars of "Don't Be That Way," an old Benny Goodman tune
- Spencer Wyatt's big ban is comprised of a dozen or so about Spencer's age -- except for the drummer, , 40s, Spencer's dad
Though no Gene Krupa, he pounds the skins pretty well, all the while smiling proudly as his son plays clarinet and leads the band
Despite the last minute decorations, the Square looks nice, hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights
dancing to the music, along with several other
(nodding toward the band) They're not bad
No, they're not
'd say your investment was paying dividends
My what
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet
You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him
You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder
So you gave the clarinet to Spencer
Huh
That was nice of me
You had a hidden agenda, though
See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy
Bothered the hell out of you
But as soon as you gave him the clarinet
he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on
Exactly
And he got good
No kidding
They dance a bit
Now, did you remember that, or
Nope
Just filling in the blanks
Oh
Okay
And as they dance away, we : - Luke is pouring two glasses of punch, while Adele is being shyly admired (and having her ear bent) by two twin brothers, and  , mid-20s
You're the luckiest guy in town, Luke
Delly's 'bout the prettiest thing ever come outta Lawson
(to Alex) Thanks, Charlie
'm Alex
He's Charlie
'm Charlie
Yessir, 'bout the prettiest thing we ever seen, ain't that right, Charlie
You bet
(ala Mae West) Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end
The brothers laugh goofily
Hey, she's doin' that movie star, what's her name
(ignoring his brother) Hey, Delly, what was that test you was outta town takin'
It's called the State Bar Exam
Shoot
Imagine that, Charlie
lady bartender
: - Adele and Luke are slow dancing to "Thanks for the Memory
" How do you tell those two apart, anyway
Alex and Charlie
Simple
Alex is the smarter one
That's
pretty frightening
They laugh and dance a bit more
Your dancing's very good
Thanks
It never used to be
You were two left feet on the dance floor
Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step
Guess  must've learned
Luke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on her face
The band finishes the song, and everyone enthusiastically
Spencer bows shyly, blushing slightly
He nods to the band, and they bow before he motions for the crowd's attention
(nervously) Thanks, folks
Gee, can you tell we never played in front of people before
The crowd yells "No
," "You guys sound great
," etc
Well, this is our first time, and it's really all because of Luke mean, it's because of Luke coming back that we're here tonight -- but 'm talking about this
He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees Luke
(to Luke) When you didn't come back, learned how to play this so  could remember you
And now that you're back, well, 'll never forget you
(to the crowd) Luke gave me this clarinet, but he gave this night to all of us
The crowd  warmly
Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole
The crowd  as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser
He turns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums
Pretty proud of your boy, Avery
Avery smiles broadly and beats the   five or six times to register his reaction
-- "' , ,
" Looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store, 'cause  think Spencer's got a big career ahead of him
again, and Ernie waits for it to settle
As soon as he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent
You know folks, here in Lawson, we gave a lot for our country
lot
And we never complained and we never faltered
And we never forgot
Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion
He clears his throat and continues
We never forgot
And so when one of our own came back to us,  gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle
Luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was
well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again
think  speak for everyone here when  say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive
But Luke, having you back among us
well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too
God bless you, son
The crowd
Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles
Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject
All right, enough a'that
This is a celebration, so let's have us a good time -- but not too good a time, 'cause  see just about every member of the city council here tonight, and we have an eight a
m
council meeting tomorrow morning, and  expect y'all to be there
All right, take it away, Spencer
And Spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we : - Luke and Adele come over to Harry and Mrs
Terwilliger, standing at the periphery
Old Tim stands a few feet back
Why don't you two get out there and dance
Oh, no,
Mrs
Terwilliger blushes
haven't danced with another man since Mr
Terwilliger passed
When was that
Nineteen-oh-nine
Harry touches Luke's arm
Son, we're gonna go
You two kids have a lovely time
Goodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves
Alex McKenna comes up to Adele and taps her on the shoulder
Delly, can  have a dance
Sure
Alex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a little "help me
" look
Luke smiles back and watches the dancing crowd
After a moment, a man in a white suit and bow tie,  , 40s, comes over to Luke and extends his hand
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, 'm the grocer here in town
(shakes his hand) Good to meet you
Again
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back
Thanks
And  hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou
We're gonna try
Place needs a lot of work
can only imagine
You know, spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands
don't think he gave it very much thought
Well, he loves the place
It's his home
Luke, 'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation
'll come to the point
want to buy the property, and 'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it
And that's just for the property, mind you
If you want, 'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds
just want the land
(taken aback) That's
well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered
plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket
(it's an alien word) super market
Huh
You think it over
No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building
Fitts takes Luke's hand and shakes it
Good to have you back, Luke
As Luke watches Fitts walk off, we : - Last dance, folks
The crowd  slightly, and Spencer kicks the band into "Moonlight Serenade," slow and easy
As they hold each other close and dance
Adele rests her head on Luke's shoulder, her eyes closed
Luke strokes her hair and sways her gently to the music
Luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor
' Bob Leffert is standing there, staring at the band
Mabel comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder
She's asking him if he would like to dance
Bob looks down at the ground, self-consciously shoves his hook-hand in his pocket and moves away, leaving Mabel standing there
As Luke watches and the   , : : Luke and Adele dancing
walking slowly arm-in-arm down Adele's street, up her walk to her door
kissing passionately on her doorstep
Adele going inside and Luke walking away, each unable to take their eyes off the other
Luke walking the quiet streets of Lawson, smiling beatifically
: - Luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door
He pulls out his keys and enters
- Luke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees at him from the sidewalk
He holds the door open, and Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the auditorium
Luke closes the door
and stops
He something, and so do we
Soft and faraway, it's a
The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby
Luke turns toward the music, which is coming from the auditorium
The piano continues, building slightly in volume
He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively pushes one open
- Luke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering, reflected light of The movie is "The Big Parade
"  The old, decomposing nitrate print is badly scratched and stained
young, beautiful Renee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John Gilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War
Luke stares at the screen
The look on his face is one of bewilderment -- and awe
- The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out- of-tune
But it really doesn't matter
Mrs
Terwilliger is playing passionately
She never takes her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered screen, except to close them when she is overcome with emotion
Even so, she never misses a beat
fairly dance upon the keys
Stiff and wrinkled as they are, they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity that the old piano can muster
Luke is moved by what he's witnessing
This is the magic
- To the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old Tim
Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and nose with a handkerchief
He doesn't notice who looks up towards the projection booth
: , ,  , filling the frame
We're looking directly into the beam of light radiating from the projector
, we get closer to the windows of the booth
We come out of the beam and can just barely make out the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the projector
-- closer and closer -- until Harry's face fills the screen
He is watching the film; his eyes are wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's unfolding on the screen for the very first time
The warning bell on the projector   , signaling the end of the reel
Harry moves away from the window
- Never taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the film comes to an end and flap
falp
falps
out of the projector
He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs apart, and the bright beam dies
It's not the end of the movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have
Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades them up
This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and blows his nose loudly
He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up reel and takes it down
He's about to move away, when he senses that he's not alone
He looks over the projector to see , standing there
Their eyes meet
Someone should say something -- both men search for words
Suddenly, Luke feels very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's interrupted a very private ritual
Harry senses this
Clutching the precious reel of film tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles warmly
Beautiful, wasn't it
(softly) Yes
Well, son,  wish  could've shown you more, but this is all that's left
Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago
Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact
Dad,
(a tiny laugh) Ha
what
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad
" Father and son look at each other for a long moment -- searching each other's eyes
Harry smiles a sort-of half- smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the rewind bench
Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end of the film onto an empty reel
Slowly, he begins to turn the crank, rewinding the film
He stops and looks to where Luke was standing
but he's not there
- Luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the projection booth
As he closes his eyes
: In bed, sound asleep, snoring
reaches into frame and shakes him awake
' Harry
Dad, wake up
Wake up
Harry opens his eyes and looks up
'  - (bleary) Luke
what time is it
Six-thirty
(smiles) thought we'd get an early start
: - meeting of the Lawson City Council is in session, Mayor Cole presiding
Of the dozen council , we also recognize Avery Wyatt and Roscoe Fitts
, the council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading the minutes of the last meeting
Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and Red Curtis seconded, that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure
Motion carried, nine to two, one abstention
As Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry, Old Time and Mrs
Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on the unoccupied benches
Thanks, Vera
Ernie notices Luke and the trio
Well, the chair notes the presence this morning of Luke and Harry Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou staff
Frankly, the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings
'moring, folks
& Good morning
'm just guessing, but  bet it's not a sudden interest in Lawson politics that brings you all here
Luke stands
Well, no
(clears his throat) wanted to thank you all for giving me such a nice welcome, and making me feel at home
But
we're
actually here on business of a sort
, 30s, the council parliamentarian, pipes up
He's waving a copy of "Roberts Rules of Order
" Point of order, Mr
Mayor, this comes under the heading "New Business," and this is not the time
think we can make an exception here, Daley
It'll need to be moved and seconded
Ernie rolls his eyes, then quickly and mechanically, without inflection: All right, motion to hear the speaker out of order
Seconded
Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye
" Aye
Opposed
Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried
Pause
Ernie turns to Luke and smiles
Go ahead, son
Thanks
Well, 'll make this short and sweet
The Bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad and me, Mrs
Terwilliger and Old Tim, we can't possible afford them all
So, 'd like to ask your help to
well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out
What kinds of things are you talking about
Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light bulbs, yardage, and if you can't come up with any of that, we can use some old-fashioned elbow grease
Fitts leans forward
So
you do intend to fix the place up after all
Mr
Fitts, with all due respect, think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market
And  think Lawson deserves the Bijou
There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt
He looks at Harry and smiles
but  think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start
The council members  amongst themselves, then: (eagerly) Motion to encourage the citizenry of Lawson to help out the Bijou in any way they can
(a subtle reminder) short of the allocation of city funds
(agreeing) short of allocation of city funds
(enthusiastically) Seconded
(brightly) Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye
" Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried
Congratulations, Luke, you got yourself a town to help you out
: - As the entire city council and the Bijou trio looks on, Luke moves to the memorial and pulls down the huge piece of muslin covering it
Harry steps forward and gathers some of it in his arms
Ernie and Daley step forward and look up at the monument
Ernie touches the names of his two sones inscribed on the base of the monument
(slowly) You know, this really ought to be out where people can see it
Luke overhears this last, and as he smiles, he turns to Harry, who brightens as he pulls a large section of the muslin taut between his outstretched arms
: -   - -
- Harry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old screen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke and Adele, who are surrounded by a group of  , watching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe
Harry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen drops down on Luke's head
Suddenly
'
He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh
- Old Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the aisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris
The men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to Harry and grabs his end
It's Carl Leffert
second later, someone else grabs Old Tim's end
has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his hook
He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow
Luke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium
- Harry, Stanton and Mrs
Terwilliger, with the help of Avery Wyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls
Then, as Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and Mrs
Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall paint and brushes
Immediately, they all set to work painting
- Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool box nearby
He's just straightened out the "" and he steps back
carefully
to admire his handiwork
For the first time in a long time, the sign actually reads, "
" But not for long
Luke tenses
the building starts shaking
and the train passes by behind the theater
Luke lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall
Once again, the sign reads, "
"  Luke winces
- Ernie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it takes shape in a prominent place in the square
- Harry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to a corner of the muslin
It snaps into place, and voila -- new screen
Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge, standing below, applaud enthusiastically
- As work progresses all around her, Mrs
Terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano
She opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys
She sits, closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op
10 Etude No
3 -- delicate, flowing music
Even though the piano is a bit out of tune, it's still beautiful
As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt
Before long, all eyes are on her
Everyone's listening
Transported
After a moment, she stops
Overcome
Everyone applauds
Surprised, Mrs
Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows
That was beautiful
taught you that
can play the piano
(all fluttery) Oh dear, yes
You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense
You loved Chopin
You used to call it "heaven music
"  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say
She sits at the piano
Sit
Play with me
No,
Some of it might come back to you
Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left
As she begins to play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time
That's good
that's good
But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing
He's just plunking bass notes
But after a moment, the bass figures he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie woogie beat
Mrs
Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed
Really, Luke
That's no way to treat Mr
Chopin
She stands and moves away
Luke keeps playing, grinning madly -- he's loving it
After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs over and takes Mrs
Terwilliger's place, improvising the top half to Luke's bass line
is tapping his foot to the beat
He turns to Adele and says: taught him that
Off Adele cracking up
- Luke and all the letters up again
He steps back, checks his watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train goes by
This time, however, only the "" tips over at a jaunty angle
Luke smiles
'  - Luke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter, devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed potatoes and gravy
Luke's and Adele's hair is practically white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are stained with paint specks
At the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably with Bob Leffert
She smiles at him warmly, then turns to refill Harry's coffee cup
Harry thanks her, then turns back to the newspaper he's reading
-       - Prominent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a policeman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying headline: , 5,   ' Hollywood Writer Feared Dead Were Red Agents Involved
: - Luke's standing near the sign
He yells to Adele, down below on the ground
She, in turn, yells to Harry, standing near a switch panel behind the candy counter
He throws the switch
and the sign lights up beautifully
Then, they all feel the rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle and shake, no letters fall
goes up from Adele, Harry, and the small crowd of  below
Delighted, Luke takes a formal bow
The boogie-woogie ends as we : - Complete and polished, standing proudly in the center of the square
It's a clear, balmy day, and the whole town is turned out
Mayor Ernie Cole is at the podium
He finishes his remarks, then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost lives of his sons
He holds them up, high above his head
One-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly held aloft by their loved ones
Luke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft
Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform
' It's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in his dress greens
He brings his hook-hand up and salutes smartly
Mabel takes his good hand, squeezes it as she blinks back tears
Luke smiles at this scene as Harry wipes his eyes and puts his arm around Luke's shoulder, pulls him close and kisses him on the forehead
: - The Lawson High School Marching Band is set up on the steps of City Hall, playing the "Star Spangled Banner
"  They are being conducted by their director,
Luke and Harry, hands over their hearts, watch and sing along
Then, Luke takes a closer look at the
, a tall young man wearing an ornate brocaded red and white uniform with "" emblazoned across the chest
He has an idea
The anthem ends, and Luke excuses himself and moves forward, buttonholing Mr
Phillips as he comes down the steps
: - Luke and Adele are on ladders, hanging letters on the marquee, which reads: -
Harry comes outside and gets their attention
Grandly, he gestures toward the door, and out strides , wearing his new uniform -- it's the Lawson High School drum major's uniform, modified here and there
"----" is proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters
Luke and Adele applaud
Old Time looks up at them -- - Old Tim stands at attention, clutching the front door handle
Mrs
Terwilliger, wearing a new dress, her hair newly and perfectly coiffed, stands at the ready at her candy counter, ready to sell tickets and refreshments
Harry and Luke nervously pace the lobby
Luke checks his watch
It's time
He shakes Harry's hand, and nods to Old Tim, who swings the door open
Immediately,  come flooding into the theater
Luke exchanges surprised glances with Harry -- then walks outside
Luke comes out and looks down the block
The line of  stretches two deep down the block and around the corner
Luke smiles
Success
: '  -- "  -  " - Luke's selling tickets from behind the candy counter while Mrs
Terwilliger sells refreshments to a line of
Luke sells a ticket to a , who moves away, revealing Luke smiles at Bob, who smiles back, his eyes now fairly dancing with life
He plunks down his admission, and Luke hands him two tickets, which he takes with his hook-hand
Mabel smiles at Luke, takes Bob's good hand, and they move away, revealing     , 50s
The Farmer steps up and holds out a plucked chicken by its neck
Luke, surprised, jumps back -- then smiles, pulls off two tickets, and exchanges them for the chicken
: '  -- "     " - The only light back here is the light of the movie, spilling through the screen
Luke is straightening up the backstage storage area, when Adele taps him on the shoulder
He turns, and she throws her arms around his neck and kisses him
She hands him a paper to read
Luke angles it so he can read it by the light of the screen
It says: California State Bar Association has  the State Bar examination
Luke, thrilled, grabs Adele and picks her up, twirling her around with joy
He sets her down and kisses her passionately
: '  -- "    " - Harry is frantically threading the changeover projector
The bell on the running projector
once, signalling that the reel is coming to an end
Harry looks out the window at the screen, then back to the task at hand
- Luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster
With a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring how handsome the old place looks
Old Tim, snappily attired in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a dustpan
Mrs
Terwilliger is straightening up the candy counter
All is well
Luke goes to the lobby's poster case
He opens it, and unfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for " " -- the same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment
Methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the case
As Luke passes the auditorium doors, a  comes out of the theater and crosses to the candy counter
The door stays open for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch a bit of the picture
- - "    " The second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's programmer
It's nighttime in the desert
huge full moon hangs over a -movie soundstage version of the pyramids
, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is engaged in a fierce swordfight with , the villain
Pete takes a seat on the aisle near the door
() You don't think you can win this, do you
Khalid lunges and draws Gregory's blood
(ala "Khalid") "Ha
'd say  was winning
" () Ha
'd say  was winning
Luke's look is "How did  know he was gonna say that
" Onscreen, an   is sneaking up behind Gregory
"Gregory
Look out
" '  () Gregory
Look out
Pete did it again
Onscreen, Gregory turns and kills the Henchman, then quickly dispatches Khalid
He stands over the body, catches his breath and says: () It's all right, Rebecca
'  () Is he dead
() Yes, Rebecca
He's dead
, a beautiful American woman, comes into view and takes our attention because she's being played by Sandra Sinclair, Pete Appleton's ex-girlfriend
His mouth is gaping open
He stares at the screen
(a whisper) Sandra
Luke stands
Confused, he stumbles backward, moving into the lobby as the Man goes back into the auditorium with his popcorn and the door closes
- Luke is staring at the closed auditorium doors
Old Tim and Mrs
Terwilliger take note of his odd behavior
Luke
Dear, are you all right
Without answering, Luke turns and runs to the poster case
- "    " Forget the cheesy -movie artwork
As Luke looks at the poster, it's clear that he's remembering something
He looks at the picture of Sandra -- then scans down to the credits block at the bottom of the poster
His eyes lock upon My god
my god
no
Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing down on him
because he remembers
- The warning bell
twice, but the changeover projector's carbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying
(pleading) Oh, baby, make your daddy happy
Harry's trying to keep the projector going, as the previous reel is about to end
Given no other choice, he finally gives the changeover projector a good swift kick
It hums to life
perfect changeover
Harry pets the projector
You're a good girl
No matter what say
As he turns away, he feels a sudden, sharp pain in his left arm
Wincing, he grabs his arm, staggers back towards a chair, and sits heavily
He tries to clear his throat, but it dissolves into a hacking, choking
He tries to stand, but drops to his knees, clutching his left arm harder than before
(in pain) Oh, Jesus
Harry falls to the floor, and as he does breaks in the projector gate
flap
flap
flap
- Luke is still staring at the poster, lost in thought
Offscreen, we  the audience    in reaction to the broken film
Mrs
Terwilliger has been calling Luke's name, but he doesn't come out of his stupor until Old Tim comes up behind him and spins him around
Mr
Luke
Luke stares wide-eyed at the old man
Luke
Luke, something's wrong
The film broke, and  can't raise Harry on the house phone
(still dazed) What
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart
Finally, Luke pulls himself together, hears the audience noise, and moves toward the auditorium doors
- Amid the shouting and tossing of popcorn and debris, Luke tries to regain his composure as he strides down the aisle toward the stage
Come on, folks, this happens every once in a while, just settle down
The crowd quiets down a bit
Luke shields his eyes from the light and calls up to the projection booth
Harry
Harry, why don't you cut the projector and bring up the house lights
No reaction
Just the flickering beam of light
Harry
Harry
Luke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into the lobby
The crowd goes silent
- Old Tim and Mrs
Terwilliger watch as Luke tears into the lobby and makes for the balcony stairs
- and charges between the seats and up the stairs to the projection booth
- Luke bursts in the sees Harry on the floor
He rushes over and kneels down next to him
Jesus
(with difficulty) The film broke
know,  know
keep still
pops his head into the projection booth door
(to the man) Get Doc Lardner
: '  - Harry is in bed, eyes closed
Doc Lardner has a stethoscope to his chest
He leans up and pats Harry's hand
He stands and comes over to Luke and Adele, who are near the door
Just outside, angling for a view into the room, are Old Tim and Mrs
Terwilliger
It's a pretty massive heart attack
His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well
it seems as though his body is just
shutting down
Can we get him to the hospital
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here
(puts his hand on Luke's shoulder) 'm sorry
Harry's eyelids flutter
(weakly) Did you
did you
Luke rushes to Harry's side and takes his hand
'm here
Did you
did you
Did  what
(irritated) Did you fix the damn film
It broke in the last reel
know
Everyone went home
We offered them refunds
Anybody take it
few
(closes his eyes) Vultures
Luke smiles
'm not happy about this, mind you, but if  have to go, at least 'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and
knowing that my son is alive
That's not too shabby, is it
You're not going anywhere, Harry
Don't tell me,  know about these things
've seen it before
It's all right
It's
all right
You're here
Oh, God,  love you, son
Harry smiles
Luke kisses his hand and leans up, whispering in Harry's ear: And  love you
Dad
Harry smiles faintly, looks at Luke
He nods, then closes his eyes
(softly) Oh, so
much
lighter
Slowly, Harry exhales
His face relaxes, completely at peace
He doesn't breathe again
Luke looks at Harry's face for a moment
Then as the tears well up, he leans over and ever-so-gently places a kiss on Harry's forehead
: - It's a beautiful, bright, sunny day
Luke and Adele stand at the front of the large group of mourners
, 50s, conducts the service
We commit to the earth the mortal remains of Harry Bernard Trumbo, safe in the knowledge that his immortal soul is at peace and at last reunited with his beloved Lillian in the bosom of the Lord
Let us pray
Everyone bows their heads
"The Lord is my shepherd,  shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures
" Luke looks up at the sky, then steps forward and lays a single rose on Harry's casket
Then, as everyone surreptitiously watches, he turns and walks away from the gravesite, toward the cemetery entrance
Adele watches Luke depart
and she's not alone
Agents Saunders and Brett are watching everything from their car, which is parked nearby
As Luke walks away, Saunders snaps his photo with a long-lens camera
: , and Luke's name inscribed there
- Luke stands in front of the memorial, head bowed
After a moment, he sits, leaning against the memorial
Lost in thought, he buries his face in his hands
'  (
) Mind if  join you
Luke looks up, squinting
Adele stands above him, backlit by the golden light of the sundown
Sure
She sits next to him
Tentatively, she touches his shoulder
He leans into her, and she enfolds her arm in his
Pause
Your father said
that  would start to remember things
Suddenly, Adele feels as though she's walking on eggshells
(slowly) What
do you remember
Well
everything
It started coming back a couple of days ago
remember everything now
see
Delly
'm
'm not
Harry wasn't my father
And 'm not
'm not Luke
She closes her eyes
All her suspicions are suddenly confirmed
(adrift) Oh
Her tears start, and she moves to hug Luke -- but instead, she starts hitting him, flailing, beating on his chest
He hugs her tightly, and she completely lets go
(crying) Oh, god,  knew
knew
knew from the start
wanted you to be Luke
wanted you to be alive
You're so much like him, you have no idea
No wonder everyone else accepted you
You don't know what you -- what Luke meant to this town, suddenly being alive
You don't know what this town lost
You just don't know
She pulls away, stands, and looks him in the eye
Luke rises
(sobbing uncontrollably) knew you weren't Luke
And tried not to fall in love with you
And
don't even know your name
Oh, god
Luke moves toward her
She backs away
fell in love with you, too, Delly
Only now  don't know how feel, about you or about anything
only think  know how Luke would feel
She's still sobbing
He moves to her, takes her in his arms
Delly, shhhhhh
(pulling away) No
can't
have to can't
She runs off, crying
: '  - , making short work of a steak and eggs
As he powers down his meal, Agents Saunders and Brett, distinctly out-of-place in their dark suits and hats, enter the diner
They take note of Eldridge, and come over
Are you the sheriff
And  got the uniform to prove it
'm Special Agent Walter Saunders, this is Special Agent Steven Brett, May we have a word with you
They flash identification, which Eldridge notes
(gesturing) Please, sit
They sit across from Eldridge
As Saunders speaks, Agent Brett pulls a photo from his coat pocket
couple of days ago, a county flood control maintenance crew pulled a car out of the Lawson Wash ocean outlet
They checked its registration, and when the owner was identified, they notified us
Agent Brett slides the photo toward Eldridge
It's Peter Appleton -- Luke
(smiling) Well, that'd be Luke Trumbo
Looks like you boys've solved a little mystery we've had going on for a few months
Sir, that's a photo of man named Peter Appleton
He's been missing from Los Angeles for close to three months now
What
No, there's got to be a
Sheriff -- this man is a suspected communist
: '  - (Oh, and by the way, from here on, he's  again
) Pete sits across from Eldridge, Saunders and Brett
The silence in the room is thick
Am  under arrest
Eldridge glances at Agent Saunders, who stares at Pete impassively
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers
don't know what else to tell you
wasn't hiding out
hit my head and  didn't remember anything until a few days ago
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity
already have
Who
My girlfriend
If she still is
(checking his notebook) Would that be Miss Sinclair
(ironic smile) No
No, not Miss Sinclair
'm talking about Adele Lardner
Agent Saunders glances at Eldridge
The doctor's daughter
She was Luke Trumbo's sweetheart
Pause
Mr
Appleton,  have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way
(pause) Sir, are you a communist
(firmly) No
Absolutely not
All right
All right
We'll see
: '  - Pete comes out into the bright midday sun
It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust, and when they do, he becomes aware of perhaps   lining the sidewalk in front of the station
' We recognize several of the people
Carl Leffert
Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier
Daley Thornhill
Katie Rutherford
Stanton Lawson
Now, there's nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's what's so disturbing about it
They're not an angry mob, they're just standing there, running the gamut of emotions
Shock
Disillusionment
Betrayal
It's an awkward moment
Pete doesn't quite know how to react
He wants to go over and talk to them, but he wouldn't know what to say
He wishes one of them would talk to him, just say something, anything
But no one does
Then, Bob Leffert turns away from Pete
He shoves his hook hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away, followed by Mabel, then his brother, then the others
leaving Pete alone
: - Old Tim, in his doorman's uniform, stands by the open, empty door
Mrs
Terwilliger, behind the candy counter, wipes up an imaginary spill, a full wheel of unsold tickets by her elbow
Pete anxiously paces the lobby
He looks into Every seat is empty
He glances at his watch, then turns to Old Tim and Mrs
Terwilliger: Let's close up
As Mrs
Terwilliger and Old Tim silently shamble off, Pete goes over and flips  several light switches
Most of the theater goes dark
: - Pete sits leaning up against the base of the dark sign gentle breeze tousles his hair as he gazes up at the stars
After a moment, he  footsteps coming up the ladder to the roof
Who's that
' It's me
Adele climbs onto the roof, comes over and sits down next to Pete
Hi
Hi
Pause
'm sure a lot of people down in are worried sick about you
Yeah
'm sure a lot more people down in
want a piece of me
He turns to her
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he
(wistful smile) Oh, yes
Yes, he was
Well
let me tell you, 'm not Luke
know who  am now, and you don't
And
don't like me very much
(changing the subject) You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete
(she takes it for a spin) Pete
Pete
It's a nice name
Thanks,  like it
think
Pause
Delly,  want to do the right thing
Pete can't believe he just said that -- but he did
believe you
The truth is, 'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care
Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist
Come on, Delly, look at the country today
We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb
(bitterly) You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh  don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara
" Forget about all that
You want to do the right thing
Then defend your name
If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so know the law, and the law's on your side
Beat
What about you, Delly
am, too
Pete smiles and puts his arms around her
You'll stand by me
Whatever happens
They kiss, and we : '   - There's a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road, obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away
It's deadly quiet as gas station owner , late 60s, pulls up and parks his Model  truck
He gets out, and an big old German Shepherd, , jumps out of the truck bed
Rory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in the lock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bank and sniffing the air expectantly
Whatsit, girl
He stops -- he hears something, too -- a
Lottie starts
The  is getting
Rory's getting worried
He looks at It's starting to  from within
Lottie's barking gets and angrier
Suddenly, a large black car punches out of the fog bank and tears down the road
It's followed by another, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars and trucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town
Rory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars fly past the station
Shhhhh
know, Lottie
This time,  thought it was the Martians for sure
: - The place is bedlam, overflowing with , , , you name it
is broadcasting in front of Mabel's Diner
The is on-the-air, hugging his microphone, speaking above the din
Mabel stands next to him, his hand on her shoulder
Bob Leffert stands nearby, grim
'm here with Mabel Lanier, the owner of the diner here on Commerce Street where Appleton often took meals
Mrs
Lanier, tell me, what are your thoughts about having such a celebrated suspected communist in your midst all this time
Well, its kinds hard to believe, 'cause Luke --  mean Peter -- is such a
mean, since he's been back, 've never seen the town so happy and all
It's like he gave us some
don't know
some hope,  guess
What she's referring to folks, is yet another bizarre twist in this story
Not only is Appleton alive, but he's been suffering from amnesia and living here in Lawson, where, due to a startling resemblance, everyone in town for the last three months has taken him for one of Lawson's dead war heroes, Albert Trumbo
(a catch in her voice) Luke
We always called him Luke
Mabel glances at Bob, who lowers his head
: - Pete is at the desk, staring into space
Adele leans against the radiator behind him
The silence in the room is thick
Across the desk from Pete sits Leo Kubelsky
The  can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong
Well, that's a relief understand they usually don't let that stop them
However
you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles
Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you
And  won't be a communist anymore
Exactly
So it doesn't make any difference that 'm not one now, and have never been one
Leo stands and walks to the window
Kid, don't get philosophical with me
This is a game, but it's not your game
You play by their rules, or they'll ruin you
And they have the power to do it
Doesn't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy
Leo turns to her and smiles
His tone is charmingly matter- of-factly, not condescending in the least
Darling, don't kid yourself
We don't have a "democracy" in this country
The Declaration of Independence
The Constitution
These are pieces of paper with signatures on 'em
And you know what a piece of paper with a signature is
It's a contract
And you know what a contract is
Something that can be re-negotiated at any time
It just so happens that the House Un-American Activities Committee is re- negotiating the contract this time around
Leo takes out a cigarette, lights it
Next time, it might be the
The time after that, it might be the President
But it'll always be someone
Count on it
That's not the country Luke fought for
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's
It's wrong, Leo
Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden
Leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it to Pete
Here
When you're called, read this to them
Just tell the bastards what they want to hear, and we can all get on with our lives
There's a knock at the door
Leo opens it
Standing there is a small  wearing a serious suit and an even more serious fedora
Peter Appleton
(standing) You found him
The Man reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a blue backed folded document, which he hands to Pete
As he does, a  lights the room
At the door, a pair of  and a are jockeying for position
Pete rolls his eyes
Peter Appleton, you are hereby subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities
You are to appear in Los Angeles, California, at the Biltmore Hotel, at the date and time specified herein
Pete takes the subpoena
There's an awkward moment, as the newsreel camera is still rolling
Pete cradles the subpoena like an Oscar statuette and smiles into the lens
("on") This is a great honor
'll treasure this always
Thank you
: in a partially-packed suitcase
'  - Pete is sitting in a chair, reading the statement Leo gave him
(softly) ", Peter Appleton, do hereby renounce my membership in the American Communist Party, and by way of purging myself of my indiscretion, wish to provide the following names of fellow members to this committee, so that those persons may have the opportunity to do as  have done
" He scans down the page
It's a long list
Jesus
He  a "meow
" And turns to look
is standing in the bedroom doorway
He folds up and pockets the list
Old Tim
After a moment, Old Tim appears in the doorway, wringing his knit cap in his hands
Can
Can  t-t-talk to you
Sure
Come on in
was just packing
Pete stands, gestures Old Tim to the chair, as he sits on the bed
Please, sit
Thanks
He sits
Pause
They'll come back, you know
They'll all c-c-come back
The customers
don't know
They will
They w-w-will
Pete turns to Old Tim, fixes him in the eye
Tim,  have to tell you something
Oh
It's about me
Oh
Pause, as Pete gathers courage and tries to find the words
'm
'm not Luke
Luke is dead
He died in the war
He's not coming back, and 'm not him don't even belong here
This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is
An accident
Oh
My name isn't Luke
It's Peter
Peter Appleton
Old Tim stands and looks askance at Pete
Pause
Did you think  didn't kn-kn-know that
(taken aback) thought you
know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure
Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are
All that matters is what you g-g-gave us
And you can't take that away now
You're wrong, Peter Appleton
You do belong here
He leans down to Pete
You hafta give us back the -- Bijou
Old Tim straightens up, nods at Pete
Then, silently, he picks up Cat and exits
: - Pete and Adele walk slowly down the platform toward the waiting train
You've got everything
Yeah
Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact
You'll be fine
No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side
Don't forget that
wish you were coming with me
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back
Mrs
Terwilliger
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector
You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers
They both smile as the train's  blows
Board
Pete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passenger compartment
Did you bring along something to read
Damn
Adele pulls a pocket-sized leather-bound book out of her purse and hands it to Pete
didn't think so
Here
This is mine, you can borrow it
- Well-worn and scuffed, nevertheless the title is clear: Pete looks at the book, then at Adele
Not exactly light reading,  know
Believe it or not, 've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school
Besides, there's something in there that'll help you
You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning
(clearly touched) Delly
thanks, thank you
'll take good care of this
Just remember two things
First, the law is a living thing
It made us free and it keeps us free
Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes
Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes
But in the end, the law prevails for the just
Sometimes, it takes a while
Okay
What's the second thing
She thinks for a moment
She needs the right words
'll be here
if you come back
The train pulls out
Adele and Pete exchange waves as we : ( ) - The House Committee on Un-American Activities has effectively taken over the Grand Ballroom of this magnificent hotel, and the joint is packed to the rafters
Members of the crane their necks to see out into the hallway, from where the witnesses will be entering
The   are seated at their dais, brightly lit by the dozens of newsreel and  lights
Elvin Clyde is seated at the far right
Dead center of the dais is the Chairman,
of Wisconsin, a husky man in his late 50s
He  his gavel down several times and the room goes quiet -- the talking stops, and the cameras start whirring
- Adele's in a chair, eyes glues to the  set
Mrs
Terwilliger and Old Tim sit on the couch, watching attentively
Doc Lardner's in a straight-backed chair at a jaunty angle to the set, holding the rabbit ears uncomfortably high aloft
That's perfect, Dad
( ) The committee and the chamber will come to order
Lardner forces a smile at Mrs
Terwilliger and Old Tim
(sweating and wincing) This television's a grand little invention, isn't it
- The agenda for this morning's special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities shows a number of witnesses, and 'd like to admonish those that are here to view the testimony of our first witness to keep order at all times, or this chamber will be closed
'm referring especially to the ladies and gentlemen of the press
hope that's clear
Beat
Doyle scans the room
He clearly means business
Call Peter Appleton
All eyes and cameras swing toward the door
As he enters the chamber, dozens of  fire as every eye and every camera follows him silently to his seat
As he sits, he glances behind him
' Leo Kubelsky is sitting in the front row of spectators
He smiles and nods at Pete
Pete doesn't acknowledge him, and turns back
The witness will please stand and raise his right hand
Pete does as instructed
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god
do
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record
Peter Kenneth Appleton
Hollywood, California
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr
Appleton
We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee
(faint smile) 'll do my best, Mr
Chairman
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct
(innocently) statement
Doyle and Clyde exchange glances
Yes
prepared statement
Um
no
don't have a statement at this time
Pete turns in his chair and winks at Leo
Leo rolls his eyes and shakes his head
- Adele breathes a sigh of relief
think he's doing very well, so far
They haven't called out the dogs yet
( ) Very well then, the questions will be asked by the Majority Counsel, Mr
Clyde
The  shot swings to see Elvin Clyde
He puts on his glasses and fixes Pete with an oily grin
spoke too soon
( ) Thank you Mr
Chairman, and thank you Mr
Appleton, for appearing today
- Mr
Appleton, you mention that your home is Hollywood, California
But isn't it true that for the last several months, you've made your home in a town called Lawson, California
Sir, that is true
Mr
Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo
" Luke Trumbo
We never met
But 'd like to think  know him
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson
Mr
Clyde you're twisting things around
wasn't masquerading
Luke Trumbo
Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country
just
happen to look a little bit like him
That's all
(referring to notes) Yes,  see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead
also see that you were posted stateside during the war
Fort Dix
Yes, sir
Well, 'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right
few spectators titter
'  - Mabel and Bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packed diner
( ) Now,  see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true
( ) Yes sir
But  didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was
that was something that just happened
You see,  was involved in an accident in Lawson, and  spent some time recovering there
- Clyde holds up copies of the Los Angeles Examiner and Los Angeles Times with Pete's picture on the front page
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your
"accident," Mr
Appleton
An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures
Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory
Yes
And what is the state of your memory now
Beat
Pete smiles
'm sorry, what was the question
The audience
Clyde nods at Pete, forces a tight smile
We
appreciate
your little note of levity, Mr
Appleton, but this is a very serious matter, and it merits your fullest attention
(back to business) That state of your memory now, Mr
Appleton
'  - Avery Wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio
Spencer comes around the paint aisle, wiping his hands on his apron
He moves to the radio and listens solemnly
( ) Sir, are you referring to the fact that  was suffering from amnesia, and 've since recovered my memory
- (impatient) 'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident
" (smiling) Mr
Clyde,  remember everything
Good
Good
(holds up a piece of paper) Now,  hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935
copy of this paper is before you, Mr
Appleton
Do you recognize it
Pete looks on the table and finds the roster
He's surprised to see it
Yes
yes,  do
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there
Yes it does
Mr
Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club
" Mr
Clyde, do you want to know what knew then, or do you want to know what  know now
They're two different things
Start with what you knew then
Well, 'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there
We see it
For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom
"  What's the point of this
Well, that's what  knew then
Or who  knew,  should say
You see, was trying to court Miss Angstrom
went to the meeting to impress her
(grinning) Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl
(slyly) Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom
The audience
Doyle  his gavel
You asked for the truth
That's the truth
had no idea what the meeting was about
just sat through it so  could be near her
'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl
The audience
Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who his gavel
Chamber will come to order
Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete
All right, Mr
Appleton
That was what you knew then
What do you know now
(takes a deep breath) Well,  know that  lost my job because of one meeting  went to when  was a kid in college know that 've been branded a communist, which 'm not, but even if  was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for
Mr
Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive
few members of the audience
As Pete speaks, their numbers grow
(passionately) know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what  am, but because of what you say  am
know that
Doyle  his gavel several times
Pete stops and the room falls quiet
(emphatically) Mr
Appleton, you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking, or the chair will find you in Contempt Of Congress
You will not be warned again, is that clear
(he lets this sink in, then) Continue, Mr
Clyde
(looking down at his desk) Mr
Appleton
Clyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at Pete
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party
No, sir
(holding up the roster) Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony
'm not refuting anything
Yet you're contradicting yourself
You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party
That's not a contradiction at all, sir
went to the meeting, but didn't go as a member
Well, then, as what did you go
Beat
Pete smiles
'm a little hesitant to say
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth
Pete shifts in his chair, then leans into the microphone
Well,  went as
a horny young man
The chamber erupts in
Even the other are laughing, except Clyde and Doyle, who  his gavel vigorously
'  - Sheriff Eldridge and Daley Thornhill listen to the hearing on the radio
They are both laughing at Pete's last comment
Damn, he don't wanna spar with these boys
They'll eat him alive
- The room settles
Doyle wags his finger accusingly at Pete
(angry) Mr
Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress
Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath
(matter-of-factly) 'm sorry, sir,  have no intention of making light of this committee
And  have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr
Chairman
have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath
They've sent me letters from jail
(interrupting) Mr
Chairman
Mr
Chairman, the witness is making another speech
would ask that Mr
Appleton be admonished
(indifferent) Mr
Appleton, there is no question before you at this time, but 'm sure Mr
Clyde has plenty more prepared, and if you'd like to either answer them or plead the Fifth Amendment, we can at least get on with the business of this committee
- Adele moves to within inches of the  screen
Tell them Pete
Tell them
( ) (wrestling with this) Mr
Chairman, as  understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and  can't incriminate myself because 've done nothing wrong
Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr
Clyde working for you
( ) Mr
Chairman
- Clyde is still protesting, but Doyle waves him off
Well then, Mr
Appleton, just what is your intention
Pete's sweating under the lights
He's bluffed his last bluff, and he's on the ropes
He reaches into his pocket
and takes out the prepared statement
- ( ) Mr
Chairman,  have a prepared statement 'd like to read
Her hand goes to her mouth
Oh, Pete
No
- Go ahead, Mr
Appleton
(slowly reading) ", Peter Appleton, do hereby
" He stops suddenly
Pause
Mr
Appleton
Mr
Appleton
need a drink of water
Go ahead, son
Pete fills a glass from the pitcher
Nervously, he spills a bit, and is splashes onto his coat
As some of the spectators chuckle, Pete brushes the water off
He reaches into his pocket, and pulls out Adele's copy of the constitution
The cover is wet
He wipes it off and sets it down on the table
He takes a sip of water
Looks at the book
Picks it up
Pete's terrified, but in control
He speaks slowly -- he's making this up and thinking it out as he goes
Mr
Chairman
there's
another Amendment
that 'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment
wonder if you're familiar with it
Mr
Appleton, you will
He opens the book and reads, tentatively at first
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances
" Pause
Silence in the room
She's smiling at the
Her eyes are filled with tears
He looks up at Chairman Doyle
Now fully confident
That's the First Amendment, Mr
Chairman
It's the backbone of this nation
It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential
It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear
It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country
And even though this contract
(he holds up the book) the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them -- they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation
Not by you, Mr
Chairman, not by you, Mr
Clyde, not by any member of this committee -- or anyone else -- ever
Pin-drop silence in the room
Pete scans the faces of the panel
All betray anger
He can't help but smile and nod appreciatively
And when you get right down to it, that's really all  have to say to this committee
Good morning
And with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and walks toward the door
The cameras swing with him, and fire like machine guns
Doyle  his gavel insistently
The witness will resume his seat
Did you hear me
You are not excused, Mr
Appleton
And then, slowly,  builds in the chamber, reaching a crescendo as Pete reaches the door and exits
Mr
Chairman
Mr
Chairman
: - As Pete exits the hotel, a have him completely surrounded
pop
He's taken aback, flustered
(seeing Pete) There he is
Pete
Are you going back to writing pictures
don't know
You a commie, Pete
No, of course not
What about the girl, Pete
You gonna marry her
Is she coming to Hollywood, or are you
Look, fellas,  don't have anything to say
Pete is trapped in the crowd, when he feels a hand on his shoulder
spins him around, and pushes him through the crowd toward the curb
Come on, kid
At the curb is a black Cadillac limousine
Leo hauls open the back door and pushes Pete in, before climbing in himself
The limo drives away, as the reporters give chase
() - Leo and Pete sit side-by-side in silence for a moment
Leo breaks it
That was quite a show you gave them today
We shoulda sold tickets
'm not sorry for what  said
No, of course not, why should you be sorry
You're the new Peter Appleton
You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that
Very noble
They sit in silence again for a moment until Leo reaches into his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he opens and offers to Pete
Cigarette
No thanks
Leo takes one for himself and lights up
Pete takes off his hat and nervously scratches his head
When'd you quit smoking
Luke didn't smoke
Oh,  see
But you're not Luke
You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer
(laughs) Not any more
Why not
Leo, you were in there, you saw what  did
You think they're gonna let me write pictures
Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail
(with a smile) Not at all
Besides,  don't even know if want to write anymore
(snickering) What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter
But before Pete can answer
Peter, 'm an agent
buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you
That's what  do
You're a writer
You write pictures
That's what you do
And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning
What do you mean
Kid, you gave them what they wanted
This committee, it feeds on names
The more names, the better
But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do
Leo,  didn't give them the names
wouldn't do that
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name
Pete freezes
He slowly turns to Leo
(warily) Her name was right there in front of them
They gave it to me, didn't give it to them
Well, that's not what they think
Leo, she was
she was a girl knew in college
You should keep track of your old school chums
Turns out she eventually joined the communist party
(takes a puff) On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on
(realization dawning) Oh god, oh, god, no,
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers
That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal
They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself
Thank me publicly
For what
For ruining this woman's life
(dismissive) Climb down off your cross
They already knew about her
(off his look) She was subpoenaed six months ago
Who the hell do you think named you
Pete is dumbstruck
He slumps in his seat, ashen
(he couldn't be happier) All of which means
"Ashes To Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've got your job back
(takes a puff) Congratulations, kid
Pete's breathing shallowly, on the verge of tears or screaming -- or both
'   - The limo pulls up, and Leo opens the door
Pete vacantly grabs his suitcase and gets out
Leo shuts the door and calls after him, waving Pete's hat
Peter
Your hat
Pete comes back and takes his hat
Leo grabs his hand
was lookin' out for you all the time, kid
You did good
'm real proud of you
(to the driver) Okay, let's go
(to Pete) Get some rest, kid
As the limo pulls away, we : '  (
) - The door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullen Pete, carrying his suitcases and hat
He sets them down and goes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from the studio have been gathering dust these last three months
(handing him a key) Here's a new key for ya
That Mr
Kubelsky, he's got you paid up through this month
You got one swell friend there
The Super moves to the door and turns back
Good to have you back, Pete
He exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out the tin-toy fire truck
Distractedly, Pete puts the toy back in the box and replies too late: Thanks
He sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat
As he does, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat pocket and falls open to the floor
Pete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the inscription inside the front cover catches his eye: , , Pete closes the book
He thinks for a moment, then glances over at the phone
He picks it up and dials "0
" Western Union, please
: () - Our view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds up the spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara
Looking into one of the train's windows, we  Pete sitting, staring out at the passing scenery
'  (
) Dear Adele, on my way back to Lawson
That is, if they'll have me
Train arrives four p
m
Hope you can be there Pete
: - The train is just pulling in to Lawson
As it  to a halt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete steps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open
The   has turned out
They're all there, smiling broadly
large, hand-lettered banner reads: ' goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence
Pete descends from the train and moves into the throng
The first two people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier
bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smiling as they shake hands vigorously
Luke
um,  mean, Pete, if it weren't for you,  wouldn't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me
Mabel's mouth drops open
Bob, congratulations
When'd you ask her
Holy moley
Just now
(to Bob) Yes, Bob
Yes
As Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues into the crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back
is at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front
She rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss
Another goes up
see you got the telegram
Pete, 'm so sorry about what they did to you
didn't think you'd come back,  thought you'd want to write again
Dell,  can't write unless 'm happy, and  can't be happy unless 'm here -- and with you
(grabs her shoulders) This is me, Delly
Pete Appleton
And  love you
(tears in her eyes) And (hic
)  love you, Pete
They kiss again
Pete pulls away and looks at his watch
(smiling) 'mon, Dell, we gotta go
Showtime in fifteen minutes
The train whistle  as it slowly pulls out of the station
'  (
) "Happily ever after" is a relative term, folks
My world is much smaller now, and my dreams are very different than they were
But have something now that  never had before:  have the magic
And it's for sale at the Bijou, every day of the year
All you need is the price of a ticket
We   to see Pete and Adele moving into and being enveloped by the crowd
Spencer Wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot office, and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as we move up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over the town, settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijou's marquee
The neon chaser lights  , illuminating the sign, which reads: Then, the letters on the marquee
We , and the "" sign
as the train   behind the theater
