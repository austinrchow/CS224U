The Fifth Element An original script by Luc Besson Revisions by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen August 1995 Draft Gaumont and Les Films du Dauphin : 1
- Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert
:	 1913 and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes
2
- The mule and the boy finally reach a camp
few tents dwarfed by a huge temple door jutting out of the sand
The camp is deserted except for some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light into the temple
Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside the temple
3
- Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of the wall across the room
young man is beside him,  , age 25, an American student
He has a large sketchpad in his hands
Behind them , age 10, whose job is to hold the last mirror which shines light into the expansive room
(deciphering) "
when the three planets are in eclipse
" His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers
"
the black hole like a door is open
Evil comes
sowing terror and chaos
" See
The snake, Billy
The Ultimate Evil make sure you get the snake
The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil, coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly
He is a natural artist
And when is this door opening snake act supposed to occur
The Professor's fingers touch the signs
if this is the five
and this the thousand
He calculates
Every five thousand years
(kidding) So  have some time
He reaches for the pad
:  Omar
Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water bag, entranced by the sight
skeletal hand falls on his shoulder
Omar turns to an ancient  in a rough milled black cannock
will take it to them my son
Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest
Go with God
be safe from Evil
The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing him
As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor
:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching
"
then arrange the elements of life against the Terror just so
" His fingers run on
"
Water
fire
earth
air
four elements around the fifth
" His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by all the others
The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into the skin
:  Aziz falling asleep
The mirror falls, the light fails
Aziz
Light
The boy struggles to stay awake
The mirror comes up
Lord forgive me
they already know too, much
"
in which all the history of the Universe resides all the strength
all the hope
Protect us from Evil
" (
) Amen
The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup from the skin
Father
it in the most extraordinary thing
the greatest find in history
can you imagine the implications
Only too well
here you must be parched
He hands the cup to the Professor
The Professor takes it, has it almost to his lips when
mean look
it is like a battle plan
In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin
Here the Good
Here the Evil
As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the water skin, drinking the leakage
Here
He points to the Five Elements
weapon against evil
Amazing
am going to be famous
Then let us toast to your fame
Here Billy
The Priest hands Billy a cup
Drink
To fame
salud
The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then
We cannot toast with water
Billy
In my sack
the Grappa
The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel
4
- muffled  grows steadily louder
Outside, a monstrous linear shadow disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance
5
- Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag
He comes upon a machine pistol
When the muffled  suddenly grabs his attention
He leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear
Billy is paralyzed
6
- The Professor keeps reading over the inscription
"
this perfect person
this perfect being
"  do not understand this
perfect
Where is that boy
Billy
7
- Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him
He begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion
8
- The Professor reads the wall
And this divine Light they talk about
what is Divine light
At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again
The light fails
(without turning) Aziz light
The room is flooded with light all of the sudden
Better
this is the most unbelievable thing have ever seen
The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself face to face with two
dozen others fill the hall manning the source of the light, large luminous globes
Aziz is fast asleep
(uncomprehending) Uh, yes
The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens
The  stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face to the ground
Master
He was about to discover everything, but  had the situation under control
The two   hold the professor three feet off the ground
(in a panic) Who are you
Are you Germans
Sprechen Sie Deutsch
9 Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand
10 The  holds out his hand to the Priest
What did  do wrong
The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly
Servant, you and the thousand guards before you
You have done your work well, but we have to recover the elements
War will soon engulf your planet
We must keep them safe
The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate than a key to a safe
He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens the wall
Unbelievable
The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger
One of the waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway revealed by the opening
He is followed by his men
The Priest slips in behind them
11
2   - The Kommander steps into a vast room
The ceiling is very high, pyramid- shaped
In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements
In the middle, an opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar
The Kommander stops and contemplates it a moment
(to himself) The Fifth Element
Take them and put them in a safe place
His men carry out his order
12
1   - Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake
13
2   - The Kommander opens a case
His men come and put the four, precious stones in it, one by one
(moved) Will the elements be gone now forever from this place
When mankind comes to its senses
We will return
Knowing mankind as  do, that could take centuries
Time is of no importance, only life is important
The Priest nods and lowers his eyes
Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his eyes to focus
puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the case and looks at the Priest
When  returns so shall we
(head lowered) We will be ready, Lord
Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun
Stop
Billy trips, the gun goes off
He empties the clip
The Mondoshawan carrying the case crumples to the ground
The wall immediately begins to close
Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun
No
Don't
The Priest rushes Billy
The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself out
The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded
So is the Kommander
The  are in a panic
Hurry, Kommander
The wall's closing
The wall continues to close
Sand pours in from everywhere
The vast room fills up like an hourglass
mission is a mission, Savoia
You'll learn that
The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get through it
His armor is too bulky, the opening too small
He manages to get his arm and the case through
My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife
The wall closes, crushing his arm
The  scoops up the case and runs through the huge piles of sand
14
- The  boards the ship carrying the case
Omar hides in a corner, frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings
15
- The room fills with sand
The Priest's body is soon buried
16
- The huge ship's main hatch closes
17
- The ship lifts off and speeds away
Omar emerges from the temple gaping at the ship as it vanishes in the sky
18 gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids
19 The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at unbelievable speed
The background is a star-spattered cosmos
:	500 Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen
warship belonging to the Federal Army
20 of a digital control screen
Three planets projecting three straight lines that crisscross at one point
Identical to the one observed by the professor on the temple wall
looks out through the ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse
Don't you have anything
Not even a temperature
The thermo-analyzers have jammed
One of them reads over a million degrees, the other's at minus 5000
Never seen anything like it
It's taking shape
21 In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened
Evil is back
round, moving mass, continually changing color
(in awe) What the hell can it be
Hook-up with the president in one minute, General
General Staedert remains calm
Send out a probe
22
' , 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office
There's a crisis in the air
The President's  leans down to his ear
On air in 30 seconds
In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of Egypt
younger man , 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old man
23
/ ' President on line sir
General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the room but not the president
(
) Staedert, do you read me
can hear you, Mr
President, but can't see you
The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to face him
His face fills the screen
(exasperated) Is that better
Perfect, Mr
President
have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes
Just the facts, General
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot
we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging
(exasperated) What you are saying is you don't know what this
thing
is
Consternation reigns in the President's office
Not yet Sir
The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger
Options
Wait or act
Recommendations
My philosophy Mr
President is shoot first ask questions later
don't like uninvited guests
Gentlemen
think it would be foolish to shoot at an organism that seems alive, without first taking the time to study it more
Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility
(worried) No
it's just getting bigger
So do people, but that's no reason to shoot them
(exasperated) The security of the Federated Territories is and remains number one priority
(to the military) suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is acceptable to you
All the Generals nod "yes" All right, then
Staedert
(
) Mr
President
The President scans the room
Staedert remote controls the camera toward the room
Yes
The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face
He is in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes
Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple
Cornelius, Vito Cornelius
50th level parish
have a different theory to offer you, Mr
President
'm listening
Imagine for a moment that this
thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are
Because it is evil
(a little sarcastically) One more reason to shoot first eh
All the Generals nod in agreement
Evil begets evil, Mr
President
Shooting would only make it stronger
24 The probe will attain its objective in five seconds
Staedert moves closer to the ship's window
25
Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a furious volcano
26
' Mr
President, we're at crisis point
The President looks puzzled
Your theory is interesting Father but don't think we have time to go into it right now
Time is of no importance, Mr
President
Only life is important
(exasperated) That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens
General
You may fire when ready
27 (cold) (to the ) Up front loading of a 120  missile
Marker lights on the objective
28 All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases
black crust immediately covers it
29
' (consulting new data) Its structure has just solidified on the surface, as if the object felt something
If that's the case, we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence
The most terrible intelligence imaginable, Mr
President
The President hesitates
The ship is in combat formation
The missile is loaded, General
(uneasy) Staedert
Give me a minute
have a doubt
(cold) don't, Mr
President
30 The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target
The explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water
Nothing happens
And then the mass grows larger
31
/ ' Staedert looks worried
Load a series of 740 missiles
Maximum shield protection
Yes, Sir
The President is growing ever more worried
Staedert
What's going on
Did you destroy it
'm about to, Mr
President
32 series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all
And literally doubles in size
The planet's diameter has greatly increased and it's moving toward the ship
Staedert
Get out of there immediately
don't want an incident, do you hear me, Staedert
(worried) What do we have that's bigger than 240
Nothing, General
Staedert, get out of there
That's an order
bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead
He is about to give an order when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows Staedert's spaceship
(eyes wide) Good God
The flame fills the screen with a horrendous  that
33 wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare
rubs his head
Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built, unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359
It in two in the morning
Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a light
He shuts oft the alarm
He hears a cat mewing in the hall
But it still rings
Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone that is ringing
(to the cat) 'm coming
He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light
Behind him, the bed makes itself automatically
(on the phone) Yeah
(
) Hey bud
Finger here
He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for a match
Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection
(to the cat) Hi sweetie
Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas (
) love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training
was talking to the cat
(
) Oh, yeah,  forgot
You still prefer your cat to the real thing
picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day
At least, the cat comes back
(
) (ironical) You still pining for that two timing bitch
Forget her
There are a million women out there
don't want a million -  just want one
perfect one
(
) Don't exist bud
picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter
just found a picture of you
(
) How do  look
Like shit
Korben finds a box of matches with three matches
He strikes one
It does not light
Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of croquettes
On the packet is an ad: 2
(
) Must be an old picture
Listen, you gotta bring me your hack for the 6 month overhaul
Korben heats up some brackish water
(sighs) don't need one
(
) You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions
know how you drive
Finger
'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter
(
) How many points you got left on your license
(lying) Uh
at least fifty
(
) In your dreams
See you tonight
Finger has hang up
Korben sighs and does the same
He gets the heated brackish water and sits down
The cat pounces on the table and meows for its food
Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup
The cat meows
Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer
Cheers

' The office is emptied, only a few army officers remain
An ancient manuscript, Billy's drawings, sits in front of the President
Cornelius turns page after page, illustrating his point
(to the President) We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
(worried) And then
And then it will be too late
The goal of evil is to wipe out life
All forms of life
For all eternity
Life upsets it
The President appears upset himself by this image
Is there anything that can stop it
(knowing) Yes
thank God

' The manuscript is open on the President's desk
: Billy's rendering of the Mondoshawan
(to the President) The Mondoshawans don't belong to the Federated Territories, but they are peaceful
in their possession are the four elements of life
These elements when they are gathered around a fifth: The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect life
The   is standing, as if frozen in armor
All we see is the bottom half of his body
Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones
will produce what the ancients called the light of creation, the light of total goodness which is the only thing that can defeat
The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element
But what happens if instead of this
Ultimate Warrior
it is who stands here
White turns to black
Light to Dark
Life to Death
For all eternity
The President's nerves quiver
Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at the frontier requesting permission to enter our territory
guess  should make a decision
They are the only ones who can help
Sir
the Mondoshawan do not belong to the federation
We do not know their intention
must recommend a full trinuclear assault
(yells) Did you see that
thing
swallow our battleship like a gum drop
You can't even tell me what it is
ask you for options you give me bullshit
Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards

His terrifying features tell us what sort of welcome they can expect
The pilot fires without warning

Panic aboard the  ship

Which Korben's cat watches with interest
Korben is about to exit the apartment
Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your mind
Bye sweetie
In response, the cat meows
Korben opens the door to
huge gun, brandished by a nervous , pointing right in his face
The cash man
Been here long
Don't fuck with me man or 'll blow you into tomorrow
Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon
Isn't that a Z140
Alleviated titanium
Neuro charged assault model
(off balance) Uh
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy
good thing it's not loaded
The mugger is lost
He looks at his weapon
It's not
You gotta push the little yellow button
Korben points to the button on the side of the gun
The mugger takes his advice
Thanks
You're welcome
And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right hand, sending him down for the count
Korben retrieves the gun
you know these things are  illegal
you could get in a shit load of trouble
better hang onto it for you
As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is full of similar guns
The mugger's eyes pop out of his head
He scampers to his feet and runs off
Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door

Actually only one cell survived
Have you identified it
It's not that easy
we've never encountered anything like it before

There is a huge glass turbine in the middle with the metal glove inside
chain scrolls on the computer screen
(rather fascinated) The compositional elements of his chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed
His knowledge is probably limitless
(worried) Is there any danger
Some kind of virus
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector
The cell is for lack of a better word

Munro hesitates a moment
Then he sighs and uses his personal key to open the self-destruct box

But Mr
Perfect better be polite
otherwise  turn him into cat food
Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the sell-destruct button, ready to use it
Thousands of cells form in the heart of the generator, an assemblage of  elements
Then the cells move down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a  body
Step by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems
Whole veins wrap around the muscles
An entire body is reconstructing before our very eyes
Three seconds to ultra-violet protection
shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible
(to Munro) This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment
Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves
That means growing skin
Clever, eh
(disgusted) Wonderful
The meter slows, drops to zero
End of reconstruction, beginning of reanimation

Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin
remote-control camera approaches the girl's face, a flash goes off
Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and screams

Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out
The girl rams her fist right through the window
She grabs the key and yanks it
The chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out
The girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps out
She is still bit wobbly on her legs

Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you go through the main ventilation

She comes to a dead-end, a grill that leads outside
She pushes it out and exits onto the ledge
56
- She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time
The city has become monstrous
Buildings rise 600 stories
Cars fly
Subways run vertically
The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height
The  leans out the vent, looking out into the void
(to his men) Go on follow her
The  stare into the gaping void
No way
The  angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks around the corner of the building
Unfortunately the other side in full of cops as well
flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens blaring
(
) This in the police
Your status is illegal
Please put up your hands and follow our instructions
The girl feels trapped
She looks down into the endless 450 below and all the cars flying underneath her
Then she raises her arms
and dives off

She dove off
In a panic, the  makes a wrong turn
The girl falls for several seconds
She lands on the roof of a flying cab

) You have just had an accident
Seven points have been temporarily removed
Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side
/ You have one point left on your license

Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are
The girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up
There's some blood on her face
Korben is stunned
The girl's still alive and
so beautiful
His heart heads for a meltdown

The police car presses up against the cab
Doors slide open
Huge guns point at her
Korben feels lousy
The girl's helpless, there are tears in her eyes, she looks exhausted
Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror
She's looking all around to find something to help her communicate with him
Her : an ad on the back of the seat
An 800 number to help an orphanage
teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help
She shoots to Korben a look of pure distress
(irresistible) Please
Korben can't resist her plea
Don't put me in this position

- Korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air
The cops have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the fun
Korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him
Except the dead-end he's just come up against
Daya deo dono Dato
Dalutan
It there's one thing  don't need advice on, it's how to drive
Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway, ripping his taxi light from the roof
The police car smashes into the wall
The other one brakes just in time
Shit
Attention all-patrol cars
The car makes a -turn, looking for a wider passageway
60 The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard
The dead-end is empty
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard
Seeing nothing, the police drive away
We'll wait till things quiet down a bit
You mind
The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear
(weak) Priest
You're not that bad
Come on we'll get you to a doctor
The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian suns
(weak) Vito
Cor
Ni-lious
Priest
Vito Cornelius
The girl nods, then faints
Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much mystery
61
'   - The door opens
Korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms
(embarrassed) Excuse me, 'm looking for a priest
(tired) Weddings are one floor down
Congratulations
Cornelius closes the door
The doorbell  again
She's not my bride, she's my fare
She's looking for this Vito Cornelius
According to the phone guide he lives here
(curious) That's me
But  don't know who she is
where did you find her
She dropped in on me
holding this
Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped on it
(staggered) The fifth element
He faints dead away
Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks around helpless
(sighing) Finger's gonna kill me
62
'   - In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face
(with a start) Who are you
brought the girl remember
The girl
Cornalius gets up
He looks at the handle
Yeah
She dropped in on me
mean on my taxi
talking
this
this bizarre language
And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is
(eyes riveted on her) He's a she
(bemused) You noticed
(face shining) There's not a moment to lose
Wake her up, but be gentle about it
This woman is mankind's most precious possession
She is
perfect
So you do know her
Uh yes, we're cousins
distant cousins
Cornelius runs into the next room
Korben looks at the girl, goes to slap her, then changes his mind
Her beauty troubles him
He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile
Perfect
63 David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of breath
It's a miracle
(worried) What is
(babbling crazily) can't wear these clothes
This calls for dignity
have to dress the part
He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in, disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending
64
' Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond
He looks around then kisses her on the lips
The girl's eyes snap open
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his chin
(angry) Eto Akta Gamat
(embarrassed) 'm sorry, it's just that
was told to wake you up gently, so  figured
The girl pauses a moment
She stares at him, looks puzzled
You're right,  was wrong
shouldn't have kissed you
especially since we haven't been introduced and
(he pulls out a business card) Here, it's a bit late, but
my name is Korben, Korben Dallas
Keep it, you never know, maybe
you'll need a cab one day
'll be happy to open the door this time
The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal
65 Cornelius is lost in the closet
Father, will you please explain what's going on
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish
It's a miracle
66 What's your name
(after a moment) Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat
(polite) Hey,  that's
cute
Do you have a nickname, something a little
shorter
Leeloo
Korben is falling in love
That's
really cute
Cornelius bursts into the room
She turns the gun on him
He bows before her
Appipulai Leeloo Minai
Corn-i-Lius
(bowing) At your service
lowers her guard starts to laugh
An irresistible childish laugh
Korben smiles
Father
You sure she's the Supreme Being
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves
David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo
Cornelius begins to lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out
They all like this in your family, father
She's an exception
Thank you so much for your help Mr
Dallas
Korben Dallas
Cornelius takes his arm
Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben leaving
Yes
That's fine
Thank you very much
thousand times over
might call to check up on her, you know
to see if she's better
She's fine, really
don't you worry
just needs some rest
she's had a very long trip
know
was there when she arrived
Cornelius is about to close the door
Korben's hand blocks it
Excuse me
Just one thing
She said something to me a while ago and
don't really get it
Akta Gamat
It means, "Never without my permission"
That's what  thought
Cornelius slams the door in his face
Thanks
66A
'   - Korben beads down the hallway
He passes his
Evening
Fuck you
Thanks
You, too
Korben enters his-apartment
66B
'   - The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in the air
Oh god
forgot your food
'm really sorry
How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize
How does that sound, huh
The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings
Hello
(
) Hey bud
'm waiting all day here
Finger
man
'm sorry
listen
was on the way over but  had a fare fall into my lap
y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist
(
) (suspicious) So, just how big was this fare
5'7", green eyes
long legs
great skin
perfect
Korben takes out a cigarette
(
) Uh huh
and  don't suppose you got the name of this
perfect fare
(dreamy) Leeloo
67
-  - 68
'   - Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a shower
She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken
Data scrolls by on the screen
David watches from the corner, in awe
What's she doing
Learning our history
The last 5000 years that she missed
She's been out of circulation a while, you know
Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter
What're you laughing about
(pronouncing badly) Napoleon
small
She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave
(hesitant) Uh father,  know she's been through a lot
but the sacred stones
we don't have much time
Yes
Of course
Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave
steaming plate heaped with chicken and exotic vegetables
Leeloo
'm sorry to interrupt you but
She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her second chicken
Cornelius sits opposite her
and holds up the case handle
(serious) The case
with the stones
Where is it
San Agamat chay bet
envolet
The case was stolen
Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food in front of her
(shocked) Who in gods name would do such a thing
69
'   - :  pair of feet limping heavily
comes alongside them
Excuse me sir, the council is worried about the economy heating up
They wondered if it would be possible to fire 500
They reach a door at the end of the corridor
Zorg enters a code
Fire 1000
But
500 is all they need, sir
turns slowly
small scar across run across his face, his eye stutters
This is not a man to cross, or contradict
1000
Fine, sir
Sorry to have disturbed you
The door opens
70
'   - and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago
said he was an art dealer
Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones
at the time  didn't think anything of it
What was his name
'm so bad with names
(to Leeloo, timid) didn't know your size
Leeloo is happy
She pulls off the towel and stands there nude
Cornelius and David turn away
They really made her
Perfect
Leeloo finishes dressing
She is delighted
(to David) Domo danko
David smiles, dumb with admiration
Cornelius comes over
Leeloo
The Stones
We must get them back
Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on
Ikset-kiba
Me imanetaba oum dalat
You know exactly where they are
71
- group of handsome  approaches
, their leader has the sacred case in his hands
The metal handle is missing but the second metal glove is still grasping the case
(pretending to be worried) Aknot
Is that you
The  nods
disgusted look stamps Zorg's features
What an ugly face
Doesn't suit you at all
Take it off
's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous
That's better
Never be ashamed of who you are
You're warriors
be proud
says nothing, but if his eyes could talk
So what if the Federal Army crushed your entire race and scattered your people to the wind
Your time for revenge is at hand
Voila
the ZF1
He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch
(very fast) It's light
the handle's adjustable for easy carrying
good for righties and lefties
Meanwhile, two  set up a mannequin rigged with various defense mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse
Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by -rays
It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet interventions
word on fire power: Titanium recharger
3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300
With the replay button, another Zorg innovation, it's even easier
one shot
He fires at the mannequin
and replay sends every following shot to the same location
Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin
(even faster) recharge, but the enemy has launched a cowardly sneak attack from behind, the automirror takes care of that
Gives me the time to turn around and finish the job
300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies
He fires off each item he names
Rocket launcher
The always efficient flame thrower
My favorite
Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher, with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very practical
And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube system
The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid
He tosses the weapon into 's hands
Four full crates, delivered right on time
What about you, my dear Aknot, did you bring me what  asked you for
sets the case on a crate
Zorg gloats while stroking the case
Magnificent
Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case
It's empty 72
'   - Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again
(astonished) What do you mean empty
73
'   - looks into the case
Things grow tense
Alright
've got an open mind here
anyone care to explain
74
'   - Leeloo explains what happened in her language
(translating) She says that the Guardians never really had much faith in humans
They were afraid of being attacked
The stones were given to someone they could trust who took another route
She's supposed to contact this person in a little less than twelve hours from now in a hotel
She's looking for the address
map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points
Dot
The little group comes over to look
Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation Cornelius plops down into his armchair
We're saved
75
'   - 'm fucked
Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare
You asked for a case
We brought you a case
(shouting) case with four stones in it
Not one
Not two or three
But four
Four stones
What the fuck am  supposed to do with an case
's men grow edgy
(tense) We are warriors, not merchants
(humored) But you can still count
Look
my fingers
He holds up four fingers
Four stones, four crates
Zero stones
(yelling) (to his men) Put everything back, we're outta here
's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg
(icily) We risked our lives
believe a little compensation is in order
(smiling) So, you are a merchant, after all
(to his men) Leave them one crate
For the cause
Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three
76
'   - Zorg walks along the street to his limo
carries the empty case
don't like warriors
They're too narrow-minded, no sublety
Worse, they fight for hopeless causes
for honor
Honor has killed millions of people but hasn't saved a single one
(pause) You know what -- do  like though,  like killer
real dyed in the wool killer
Cold-blooded
Clean
Methodical
Thorough
killer, when he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately asked about the little red button on the bottom of the gun
77
'  - The warriors have all taken a weapon
One of them inspects his ZF1
He turns it over and notices the little red button
He presses it
78
'   - Behind Zorg, an ear-shattering explosion levels the warehouse
(impassive) Bring the priest
79

'   - Korben is finishing a Thai meal, cooked by a Thai on his mini restaurant anchored at the window
The cat eats next to Korben, contented
So you forgive me
The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a message in a glass tube
Korben ignores it
Not going to open
've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news
How someone strong like you scared from a message
Is good news  sure
The last two messages  got
The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving
And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too
with my wife
You right that is bad
but mathematically luck must change
Grandfather say: "It never rain every day
" This is good news guarantee
bet you lunch
Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud
You're fired
Oh
Korben smiles at him
At least  won lunch
Good philosophy
see good in bad
like
prepare number one dessert
special for you and pussy
The cat meows
79B
'   - Leeloo is polishing of' an immense pile of dessert as David bangs away at the computer
got it
Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel
and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel
Good work, my son
Now all we need is a way to get there
The doorbell rings
'll get it
Finish your work my son
Cornelius opens to Right Arm with armed escort
Father Cornelius
My son
Mr
Zorg would like a word with you
Mr
Who

' Zorg turns to Cornelius
Zorg
Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg
nice to see you again remember you now
the so called art dealer
'm glad you got your memory back, Father
Because you're going to need it
Where are the stones
Why on earth do the stones interest you
Personally, they are of no interest to me, 'd rather sell weapons
but  have a customer
so tell me
Even it  did know where the stones were would never tell somebody like you
Why
What's wrong with me
'm a priest
'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it
Ah, Father
You are so wrong
Let me explain
Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office
would you like a drink
No thank you
Follow me
Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction
Look at this empty glass
Zorg pushes the glass with his finger
Here it is
peaceful
serene
but if it is
Zorg pushes the glass off the table
It shatters on the floor
Destroyed
Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping out to clean up the mess
Look at all these little things
so busy all of a sudden
Notice how each one is useful
What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color
So full of
life
They are robots
comes in pours water in another glass
Zorg tosses a cherry into it
Yes but
by that simple gesture of destruction
gave work to at least fifty people today
The engineers, the technicians, the mechanics
Fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong
Children who will have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life
Cornelius sits in silence
Father, by creating a little destruction, am, in fact, encouraging life
So, in reality, you and  are in the same business
Destroying a glass is one thing
killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another
Let me reassure you Father
will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years
Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink
Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry
Unable to breathe, Zorg starts to panic
(mocking) Where's the robot to pat your back
Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which trigger a slew of little mechanisms
They pop out all over the desk
True chaos reigns
Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat multicolored beastie, , who seems surprised to be out in daylight
He licks his half-dead master in thanks
Cornelius gets up and walks around the desk
Zorg motions for help
Can  give you a hand
Cornelius whacks him on the back
The cherry comes flying out
Zorg regains control of himself
come running in
You saved my life
So, 'm going to spare yours
(to the ) Throw him out
The  throw Cornelius out
You are a monster, Zorg
(complimented) know
The  drag Cornelius out of the office
Torture whoever you want, the president if you have to but  want those Stones
You have an hour
Right Arm salutes and hurries out of the office

Three warships are positioned in front of it
Communication satellites arrive from all over the place, drawn to it like a magnet
(observing) It's gobbling up all the communication satellites in the galaxy

' President Lindberg appears even more crushed by recent events
Why the hell is it eating up all those satellites like that
(desperate) We're working on it, Mr
President
We're working on it
It should only choke on them

There's a small antenna on its back
107 Zorg's Right Arm wears earphones, monitoring the President's conversation with the cockroach-spy
108
'  / managed to contact the Mondoshawan
They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies
(relieved) And the Stones
Did you find them in the wreckage
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship
(surprised) What do you mean
The President is all ears
So is Zorg's Right Arm
The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race
they felt we're too unpredictable
so they gave up the Stones to somebody they do trust
Her name is Plavalaguna
She's a Diva and she's going to sing at the charity ball on Fhloston Paradise in a few hours
She has the Stones with her
The President breathes easier
Zorg's Right Arm is delighted
(taking off a shoe) Excellent
The President crushes the cockroach with his shoe
Right Arm's earphones fly off his head
Good-bye eardrums

'   - The most disgusting dessert ever made
Korben looks at it shimmying on a plate as the Thai serves it to him proudly
Stewed jellyfish cake
my speciality
Korben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly
The phone rings
Saved by the bell
Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone
Hello
(
) You're the nastiest dirtbag  know in this stinking City
(resigned) Hi Ma
(
) 've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years 've been eating those shitty croquettes
Korben goes to light his cigarette
There are only two matches left in the match box
Korben strikes one and it fizzles
(
) You wouldn't even eat one to help your poor mother, and you win the big prize
Know something
The whole thing makes me sick
The Thai starts to clean up
Just as Korben goes to strike the second match
(
) Are you listening to me, you ingrate
(resigned) Yes ma
Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box
Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding
(to the Thai) Go on
This is gonna take a while
The Thai casts oft
Korben closes the window
Other than that
You all right
(
) And now you're making fun of me
'm warning you
If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, 'll never forgive you
The Thai flies off
In the hall, the cat meows-for more food
(to the cat) 'm coming
Ma, what're you talking about
(
) get it
You want to make me beg, is that it
All  want is an explanation
just got in,  lost my job
smashed my cab
got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking
Now settle down and explain to me calmly
message drops in his tube
The red light goes on
(
) You just won a trip, you dolt
Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two
Ma
If 'd won, 'd know about it
Someone would have notified me
(
) They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead
He eyeballs the message still in the tube
The doorbell rings
- Ma
it's the door
'll call you back
Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the door
Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a Captain and a Major
is a woman
All she needs to become a man is a mustache
Munro opens a file
(clipped) Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance
What mission
To save the world
Where have  heard this song before
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise
Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna
And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible
Any questions'
(a little bewildered) Just one
why me
Three reasons
One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission
Munro pulls out a long list of documents
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated
And the third one
You're the only one left alive
Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at
Don't you open your messages
've had enough good news for today (by rote) You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise
For two
Congratulations
Here are your tickets
He hands Korben the tickets
Korben gets it
You rigged the contest
Munro nods
Major Iceborg will accompany you
as your wife
The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick
(sarcastic) You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet
Old tricks are the best tricks eh
'm not going
Why not
One reason
want to stay the only one left alive

' Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment
Leeloo carries the card Korben gave her
Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the
number off the door
He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell

' The doorbell rings
Scuse me
Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo
Korben panics, overcome with happiness
Shit
(worried) What is it
Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro
It's my wife
thought you were divorced
mean my future
my ex
My future ex
if she sees you here 'm finished
She hates you guys
It's what killed us in the first place
Please
He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's hands
Sorry, General, but we've got no choice
It'll only take a minute
Let me set up another meeting and 'll be back
Three of us will never fit in there
(pushing him) Oh, yes you will
Korben slams the fridge door
The doorbell  again
Coming
He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying about, shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed
He brushes his hair back and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between his eyes held by Cornelius
Apipoulai
suppose that means "Hi"
'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation
We're not going on vacation
we're on a mission
What kind of mission
(sincere) We have to save the world
(skeptical) Good luck
Of course
Father,  was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was  lost a lot of friends
So thanks for the offer
but no thanks
Cornelius is disappointed
Leeloo looks crestfallen
'm sorry
This is a police control action
Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic voice
111
' group of  bursts into the hallway
One of the cops enters a code on the police wall box
device descends from the ceiling, a flashing light-siren, a  fills the air
This is not an exercise
This is a police control
Cornelius starts to panic
Korben takes charge
Oh my god oh my god
Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor
shower takes it's place
Leeloo, hide in here and don't move
Leeloo hops in
Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed
What are you doing
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world
and hits a button on the wall
The bed disappears into the wall
Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt
112
'   - Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues
Spread your legs and place your hands in the yellow circles, please

The Cop looks at his sheet
He's looking for a
He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair and beard

Are you a human
No, 'm a meat popsicle
3 (at the other end of the hall) found him
Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the neighbor's apartment
3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall,  1 arrives with Korben's picture
1 Sir, this is a control
Please put your hands in the yellow circles
The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face
He could pass for Korben
Fuck you

) It was not easy, but we bagged him
Thanks for the tip
(smiling) Glad to help
He hangs up
They just arrested the guy for Uranium smuggling
Everything's going as planned
He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's name
All  have to do now is to go to the airport and take his place
should be in Fhloston in less than four hours
Zorg sits there quietly for a moment
Don't come back without the Stones

' Korben opens the shower door
Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth chattering from the cold
'm really sorry
there wasn't time
His eyes fall on an old blanket
Here let me wrap you up
Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back
Leeloo warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses
It's funny
've met you twice today  and you've ended up in my arms both times
Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far
She recovers, looking embarrassed too

Chacha hamas
Uh
you're welcome
The intimacy makes him nervous
He looks for a diversion
Coffee
That's what you need
nice, hot cup of coffee
He pushes a button on the coffee machine
With some honey
You'll see, honey's great
Korben rummages through the drawer
Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to quite understand everything that is going on
hot cup of coffee
with honey
He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous
Leeloo smiles and begins to look around
She opens a drawer and comes upon
(nervously) 've got this great honey somewhere
You know about honey
There used to be these little animals who made it with antenna

and these other animals who ate it
one were bees the other were bears
She looks back to the man fumbling for honey
forget which ate it and which made it but
And she smiles
Here it is
Korben holds up the jar of honey
Taste this
Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth
It
melts in your mouth, doesn't it
She savors the honey, slowly; sensually
Her lips shine with honey
Her eyes narrow with pleasure
Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth attracted to a flame
He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous
An indistinct sound comes from the wall
But Korben is so entranced with the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until it becomes quite a racket
You hear that
(licking) Cornelius
Oh god
Korben pushes the button on the wall
The bed pops out, fully made, with Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out
'm really sorry
let me help you
Korben begins to pull at the covers when
Achta ge lumitai de matala
Korben turns
What
He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes
His breath is taken away by the sight of her perfect body
Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp
Korben drops to the floor
(displeased) Vano da, mechteba
Soun domo kala chon hammas
No, 'm not proud of myself
But we don't have the luxury of choice

Others are bashed on the head by  warriors
One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it into a small shed

Korben Dallas
We got him
Perfect
Take command, Akanit
Go to Fhloston and get the Stones
If Zorg really wants them
He'll have to negotiate
Revenge is at hand

He daubs at it
Jesus
Some priest
The phone rings, he manages to answer
Yeah
(
) Have you pulled yourself together
Not yet
He hangs up
Korben opens the fridge door
The three officers are frozen solid
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead

She whips around catching David in the face
Leeloo, be careful
He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose
Did you get them
David hands Cornelius two passports
Excellent
Leeloo Dallas
He hands it to her
The name makes her smile
And Korben David Dallas
She frowns
Akta dedero ansila do mektet

David's in great shape
She looks at David holding his bloody nose
He'll protect you
Go on
See the Diva

See you at the temple
God be with you
: Korben comes rushing into the airport
Walking quickly, he scopes the hall looking for Leeloo
bearing down on the jostles him
The cops open fire
The strikers dive into the garbage and disappear
121 David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter
Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt
- Congratulations on winning the contest
David gives her a bleak smile
Leeloo rolls her eyes
Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and
David
He heads right for them
Leeloo's seen him
She is both delighted and panicked
David's seen nothing
Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back
(friendly) Hey
really thought  was going to miss my flight
(to David) Thanks, kid
You put the luggage on the conveyor belt
(freaking) Uh
yeah
(smiling) Great
Now beat it
Paralyzed, David leaves
Korben turns to the attendant
Excuse me
was so afraid 'd miss the flight that  sent the kid here to pick up my boarding card
He looks at David's fake
My cousin David
Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile
- (looking at Leeloo's ) Your wife
Korben grabs the  and reads it
Uh, yes
Newlyweds
(aside) You know how it is
Love at first sight
You meet, something goes tilt,
you get married, you hardly know each other
Right, darling
Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand
(sharply) Dinoine chagantakat
Took the words right out of my mouth
Go on
'll be right with you
(to Check-in Attendant) It's our honeymoon
We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better
He winks at the stewardess
: The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport
The couple in almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound  on a stainless steel leash
The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol isn't for them
The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared
(to pig) Come on, snyffer, go root
The pig piles into the garbage
The Cop cuts it some slack
Cornelius sits at a bar
(to the bartender) feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty work
know she was made to be strong but she's also so fragile
So human
You know what  mean
The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink
: The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in attendant
- (surprised) Dallas
Korben
(in a different voice) Yes, that's me
The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on their faces, revealing two other faces: Mangalores
- (smiling) Just a minute, please
She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong
We'll be right back
we're gonna check out the duty free
They spin around and hurry away
: Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag
The same
Yeah
(
) Make that two
Cornelius turns to David
Where's Leeloo
On the plane
with Mr
Dallas
the real one
It's all my fault
'm the servant
It's my mission
Here
He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck
Here's the key to the Temple
Prepare for our arrival
Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot, and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit
They are very nervous
police patrol is coming
This time, it seems to be for them
(to the tawdry girl) Tell Aknot plan  flopped
Tell him to go to plan
The tawdry girl nods and peels off
The neighbor takes out a gun and blasts away at the cops
The cops fire back
firefight rages in the hall
The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears
(into walkie-talkie) Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7
: On one side of the hall, a trap door opens
Three pigs come running out, grabbed by their police handler
Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs
122 Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything in sight
123 Korben is led down the hall by a
You are so lucky
Loc Rhod is the coolest  in the universe
Listen
don't want to be interviewed
'd prefer to remain anonymous
The stewardess stops in the corridor
Forget anonymous
You'll be doing Loc Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7
(expression changes) You gotta be kidding
The stewardess smiles and shakes her head
The door next to him suddenly swings open and smashes him in the face
In walks   amidst a tornado of music and security guards
He is young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox bundle of energy
He is the 24th century's most popular
(speedy, in rhythm) Korben Dallas
Here he is The most hated man in the universe
The one and only winner of the Gemini Croquette contest
Ladies, start melting 'cause the boy's hot
Hot
Hot
The boy is perfect

Right on
Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out there -man
An  hands a totally lost Korben a mike
(hesitant) Hi
Does it get any better or what
Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as the music
Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7
You'll know everything there is to know about the -man
His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates
And from what 'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name
So tell me my main man
you nervous in the service
Uh
not really
Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess
Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause Korben is on the case with a major face
Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess
Start drooling, ladies
My man here is a sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your every desire
They come to an intersection
The airline company has prepared drinks for them
Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his autograph
Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and one follies, home of luxury and beauty
magic fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and Bootchie Koochie Koo
He tosses away his champagne glass
Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on the prowl
Owwww
Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm
And start licking your stamps little girls, this guy's gonna have you writing home to Momma
Tomorrow from 5 to 7, 'll be your voice, your tongue and 'll be hot on the tail of the sexiest man of the year

The stewardess shivers

(
) End of transmission
The  suddenly stops
Several assistants come and compliment Loc Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense
Korben sweetheart do me a favor  know this is probably the biggest thing that ever happened to you in your inconsequential life
But 've got a show to do here and it's got to pop
So tomorrow, when we're on air, give me a hand
Try to make believe you have more than a one word vocabulary
pal
That does it
Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a corner
Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground
(pissed) didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio
So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal
(petrified) Crystal
124 The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand
- (alter a moment, reading) Mr
Dallas
Korben Dallas
Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile
That's right
The attendant scans the  with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the blue light reveals no other face but his
- The problem is  only have one Korben Dallas on my list
and he's already checked in
Right Arm's smile shatters
That's impossible
He's in j
mean, there must be some mistake

'm the real Korben Dallas
shrill  rings out
- (smiling) 'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished
The attendant hits a button
thick window slowly slides up between them
Right Arm totally loses it
want to see your boss
Get rid of this fucking window
Somebody's made a mistake, goddamnit
He pounds on the counter with both fists
steel curtain comes down
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from the wall, all aimed at him
(
) This is not an exercise
This is a police control
Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles
(slowing down) Sorry, my fault
Just a little overexcited
that's all
'm calm now
125
- Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat
No more seats in modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves
He passes  holding his bloodied nose
He has found what he is looking for
He enters to
Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer screen
Korben slips in beside her
Leeloo in concentrating on the words that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen
He doesn't understand what she is doing
Apipoulai
Not hard to find you
just follow the Chaos
Leeloo smiles, as if complimented
Leeloo, listen to me
these tickets
they're not mine
mean they are, but not for vacation like everyone thinks
'm on an operation
and if  didn't come get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble
'd love to be on vacation with you
but now
now 've got to work
And Leeloo
would love to work in peace
Leeloo types in "" on the keyboard
Love
Yes
But "love" isn't the operative word here,  is
Leeloo types in this new word
(rather pleased) Peace
and love
She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign
Korben sighs and switches off the screen
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen
sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience
(quite happy) What is
Make Love
Korben just stares at her for a few minutes
Know what
On that subject maybe you'd be better off asking the screen
He turns the computer back on
: walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on top of each individual box
(
) to make your flight as short and agreeable as possible, our flight attendants are switching on the timing sleeper which will regulate your sleep during the trip
: (switching off the screen) Finished
Finished what
Learning language
Which one
All 900
Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not
You learned 900 languages in five minutes
(pleased) Yes
Now it's your turn
learned your language, you have to learn mine
know how to say "Hello"
Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all  need
Apipoussan
Apipoussan
Good
Do you know how we say "make love"
(fumbling) Uh
Hoppi-hoppa
Korben literally melts
(to himself) Help
Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window
Sweet dreams, Mr
Dallas
The stewardess sets the timing sleeper
Korben and Leeloo immediately fall asleep
at the other end of the shuttle has a problem
2 Mr
Loc Rhod you have to assume your individual position
(hugging her) don't want an individual position, want all positions

Rhod

- goes over to the truck parked under one of the plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout
Disinfecting
Two  in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck
They go over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam
The flame burns everything it touches
pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing from the landing gear
small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out
128
/ ' Zorg's Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall
Yeah, it's me
Put Zorg on
He is already sweating
(cold) 'm listening
The real Korben Dallas is on the plane
He took my place
This is a joke, right
129 Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake
No
swear to God
've never been this sincere with a human before
130 stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube into the opening
You're fueled and ready to go
Have a nice flight
131 (to copilot) Everything ready for liftoff
132 (weakly, to Loc Rhod) No, no
'm not ready
'd like to talk first
133
'   / cannot hear you
We have a bad connection here
What's your number
Right Arm reads off the phone number
278-500-645-321 'll call you back
134 The runway is now empty
man slips out of the shadows
It's Cornelius
He scurries over to the front landing gear
He pauses for an instant, the climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle
135 The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list
Anti static pressure
Primed
The mechanic presses a series of buttons
136 Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a curtain
He whispers a poem
Impossible to resist him
Outside the curtain the stewardess' legs rise slowly
137 On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine exhaust on liftoff

- The stewardess in close to screaming
Liftoff
- The copilot pushes a button
- So does Zorg
- The engines release their full power
- The stewardess screams in ecstasy
- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and everything else   within 60 feet
140 The stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain
141 In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up
(relaxing) Landing gear secure
Let's light one up
142 Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box
Leeloo has a smile on her face and her hand in Korben's
143
- The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed
Space is now empty and calm
Billions of stars glow in perfect silence
144 The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing like a serpent
Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops and it becomes gray and cold
145 In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device
One of the devices suddenly starts working
All right
We're finally getting something
146
' The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired than ever
The thing is sending out radio wavelengths
What the hell does it want with radio waves
Probably wants to make a call
The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment

' Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap
The phone rings
(
) Mr
Shadow on the line
Zorg shoots to his feet
Picasso tumbles to the floor
Zorg picks up the phone, both excited and uneasy
He stands there, almost coming to attention
Yes
Zorg here
The voice is feeble
It comes from the far reaches of time, from the bowels of the universe
Am  disturbing you
No
not at all
Where are you
' breathing is awesome
Not far, now
Really
Maybe  can get you on my screen and see you at last
Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons
In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human, quiverinq form appears
Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is
Zorg feels sick
Do you have the picture now Mr
Zorg
Got it
How's our deal coming along
(ill at ease) Fine, just fine
'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now
But it wasn't easy
My costs have tripled
Shadow pauses an instant
black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the top of the screen
Zorg is feeling worse all the time
Money is of no importance
want the Stones
The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt
Zorg sweats profusely,  his legs tremble
The Stones will be here
'll see to it personally
can't wait to be among you
Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked
148 The space shuttle fills the screen
It banks left and begins its descent toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet
Crystal blue water, perfect white sand beaches
true paradise
149 The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement
Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our descent toward Fhloston Paradise
Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one
They press a button on the door of each box
In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and straighten their clothes quickly
The stewardess is embarrassed
(timidly) wanted to tell you that
Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips
He disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own
150 The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast turquoise sea
Fhloston Paradise looms into view
An enormous oceanliner floating a dozen yards above the water
On closer inspection it is more modern than a traditional oceanliner
The shuttle draws near, looking ridiculously small next to the monster
Like a sardine next to a whale
151 blinking light goes on
Shit
Parasites in Zone 1
Take a look
The 1st Mate heads off
152 stewardess opens Korben's box door
He is still heavy with sleep
He looks over at Leeloo
She's not there
153 The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner
154 The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it's docking area
Docking activated
You can let the passengers out
155 The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel
Cornelius falls out, hanging in a jumble of wires
156
- The enormous door opens and the passengers exit
Leeloo is among them
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century decoration
157 Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle's aisle
(jostling everybody) Pardon me
Excuse me
'm trying to reach my wife
Sorry
158 dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall
Leeloo stops and presses against the wall
She spots Korben leaving the shuttle gorgeous  comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a kiss on his lips in welcome
(smiling) Welcome to Paradise
Korben's face is covered in lipstick
Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop the girl and she doesn't like it
wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck
Then, obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her
Leeloo bashes him on the forehead
The hefty man straightens up
He's still smiling, but his nose is bleeding
He falls slowly to the floor
Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo
He also tries to wipe the lipstick off
Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked  , but it's locked
looks at her with a grin
(playful) If you don't have the code you can't open it
Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob
The door opens with the sound of a braking lock
Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters as if nothing were amiss
shriek of joy fills the room
Korben turns around
The cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane
Loc Rhod spots Korben and latches onto his arm
It's not going to be easy to remain discrete
(relieved) My main man
Please don't leave me here alone
My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart
Get me outta here
'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own
(hanging on to Korben) Oh, yes
Do that
You treat me right, man
Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams
don't think this is a good time
You got brothers and sisters
What about your dad
Tell me about your dad
What was he like
Physically
Big,  suppose
(evasive) Yeah, very big, a giant
didn't have a dad
never saw him
never even heard him
50 billion people listen to me every day
and he doesn't hear me
159
- Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening
Everything seems normal
She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room for
three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her
Leeloo doesn't know what to do
So she smiles

' The door opens
The  turns on the light and enters
Korben follows her, gaping at all the luxury
The   enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases
Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in that evening
Dress: Formal attire
For the concert it says formal attire
didn't bring
The hostess pulls back the closet door
Twenty tuxedos in a row
(looking him over) Here's some champagne
'll drop by after the concert to open it
She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door
Korben pushes a button
The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular view of the turquoise planet
Stars shoot out into infinity
Breathtaking
Korben stands gaping
The phone rings, snapping him out of his reverie
Hello
(
) You little sleaze bag
Ma
(
) Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands
Korben drops into an armchair and sighs
His eyes go to the ceiling

They hold up a

- Yeah
5 foot 7 inch bomb

Cornelius perks up
And the smile of an angel
They all turn to look at him
(to Chief) May  speak to you alone
167
- Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival
door opens and two  clear the way for  , her , her  and a gaggle of carrying trunks
Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a painting that is obviously upside down
white chiffon veil covers the face of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo
The Diva reaches out and strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her
The Diva removes her hand making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on
Leeloo is groggy
The Diva's  comes up to her
' Please forgive this little incident
She wants you to know that she senses great powers in you
in the service of a noble cause
She will give you what you have come to get, but she wants to sing first
One last time
The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up
' (nodding) Miss
Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better
168
' Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite
Hello, 'm head of security
Everything is in order
You can
The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish
make yourselves at home safely
If you need anything
give it a knock

Cornelius looks both ways
Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet

' Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone
Listen, Ma
've only got a few days vacation and 'll be damned if 'm gonna spend them on the phone
The door
Hang on, it's the door
No
told you  didn't bring anybody
'm all alone
as usual
Korben opens the door
It's not the champagne
Even better
It's Leeloo
(to his mother) 'll call you back
Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress
Korben has to turn away once more
Here we go again
(by rote) You know women normally change five times more than men
You get that off the screen
Yes
you know there's a lot of differences between men women
You noticed
, you can turn around
Korben turns around
Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy to the max
He is smitten
So much so that Leeloo wonders if something isn't quite right
Where you going
'm going to see the Diva sing
What's the matter
Do  look bad
No, not at all
mean, just the opposite, you're
you're beautiful
Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her
She turns, revealing her unzippered back
Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh
Her perfect bottom
Do you know how this works
Korben's blood boils
She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to the zipper
have an idea
But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going from the floor to the ceiling
Stunned, Leeloo is held captive
told you  need to work in peace
Remember
need to concentrate
And you can't concentrate with me around
It's difficult
She tries to breakout
Army issue
'm sorry
Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs
Impossible
Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on
Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head
(seething) You're nothing but a
a
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied

The door flies open
Loc Rhod barges in
Hey Stud we gotta
Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress
His mind goes to the obvious
Korben my man what's happening here
Who's the chick
What's the gig
We free forming here
Getting funky with the monkey
Can  get in on this
Korben grabs him by the collar
No

hostess escorts them to their seats
(broadcasting) We have just walked into what is probably the most beautiful concert hall in the universe
Totally awesome
Magnificent paintings on the ceiling
don't know who painted them, but he must have busted his balls
see a row of former ministers, more sinister than minister
few generals practicing how to sleep
And there's Baby Ray, star of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets
He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's stone-deaf
: Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph
to who
(moving down the aisle) And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king of laserball and the best paid player in the League
(shakes hands as he goes by) And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar
" love to sing, too, but in the shower", she recently confessed to me
She will no doubt prove to be as generous tonight as she always is
waiter gives them two glasses of champagne
Track with the  an he leaves the hall with his empty tray
He enters a small room reserved for staff
177
- The waiter joins some other
They are well armed
He opens a cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon
Suddenly their faces burn off revealing , the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops
It's showtime
178 The lights dim slowly in the concert hall
179
' President Lindbergh and his staff, including Munro, sit at the desk
Speakers appear
180
' Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert
181 Korben is tense
The curtain rises
The Diva, in a stunning gown, stands in the center of the stage, head bowed
Behind her, a star filled window
The  begins
The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien
And then she begins to sing
Her voice is divine, unmatched
Korben is swept up in the
182
' Leeloo has tears in her eyes 183
' The manager couldn't care less about the concert
His main problem is the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open
The doorbell
(ugly mood) Yeah
(
) Flowers for the Diva
She's allergic to flowers
(
) There's champagne as well
The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door
And finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun
dozen Mangalores rush in
One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall
: Cornelius watching from around the corner
My God
184 Commander,  have a ship with a main malfunction
He requests permission to dock for repairs
Did you check out his registration number
Everything's in order
Put him in the docking garage and inform the police
185
ZFX200 - (
) Permission granted
Dock 575
You have an hour
Will that be enough time'
Zorg sits at the controls
(cold) More than enough
186
- The  approaches Fhloston
187
' The ship comes close enough for Leeloo to see it out the window
: The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at the beginning of our story
188
' Leeloo is alarmed
She has to act
She seizes the flourescent bar beam with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough for her to escape
189 Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and gagged in
He quickly unties him
(in a panic) Mangalores
The Diva's suite
They want the Sacred Stones
They must be stopped
We must stop them
'm going to free you but you must promise to help me
The Chief of Police nods his agreement
190
' The Mangalores have trashed the suite
One of the Mangalores finally finds a case engraved with the four elements
have it
The Mangalore is about to open the case when
Leeloo descends quietly and gracefully from the ceiling
Time stands still
(smiling) Apipoulai
191 The Diva switches from classical music to funk, picking up the tempo
': 192
'   /
whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo
She disarms him gracefully
violent fight breaks out
The Diva sings and Leeloo dances
The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show
193 Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets nervous
He runs for reinforcements
194 Cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs
The Chief of Police is behind him holding a gun
195
'   / Leeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song to a burst of applause
The Diva takes a bow
So does Leeloo
196 Akanit and his men listen to the concert
The Mangalore guard runs in
They were waiting for us
It was an ambush
If it's war they want it's war they'll get
Enact the Final Plan
All the Mangalores cock their weapons
197
' Leeloo is about to open the case when the door
Zorg is there holding a ZF1
My compliments, little lady
And thanks for doing all the dirty work
couldn't have done it any better myself
(sharply) Now hand over the Stones
Leeloo smiles and hands him the case
Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready to kill her
Nice knowing you
Leeloo catches on quickly
She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into the gun which throws Zorg's shot off
She jumps to the ceiling and disappears in an air vent
Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling
198 Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can
199 Zorg fires his 3000 round clip
The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss cheese
Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on
The numbers flashing by tell us it's a bomb
The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59 seconds
(with a crafty smile) You can run but you can't hide
200
- Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police
is bandaging the chief's head
The door explodes
The cop outside in riddled with bullets
dozen Mangalores attack the police office
Akanit is at their head
The policemen are caught unaware
Nobody move
We're taking over this ship
The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed
Cornelius leans toward him
(pleased with himself) told you
201 Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off
He sighs in exasperation
202 Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting
1 Everyone down
There is panic all around
(broadcasting, panic stricken) Ladies and gentlemen,  think we're being
attacked
The place is crawling with warriors
203
' President Lindberg and his generals look very worried
204 Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit
The others turn their guns on the cops
People scream, diving for cover
Korben bides his time
More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting
Two cops are killed
The Diva
takes a bullet
She falls from the stage into Korben's arms
He lowers her to the floor
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket, trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds
205
/ Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat
Zorg is at the controls, a devilish smile on his lips
You want something done, do it yourself
206 Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to it
He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor
Loc Rhod is hidden nearby, still on the air
(voice low, panicked) They're hideous
They've got a crest on the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers all over their hands
Totally hideous
207
'
(worried) Mangalores
Send a battalion out immediately
208 (to the Diva) was sent by the government to help you
Don't worry
This is my fate
How was the concert
Korben is a little surprised, but
the Diva is an artist
've never heard anything so beautiful in my life
Mangalore jumps on them from the stage
Korben makes short work of him and grabs his gun
(weak) You're a good man
She was right to have chosen you
Who
The Fifth Element
The Supreme Being
Your wife
Korben is floored
Leeloo
is
she's
Yes, and more than that
You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them
(to himself, suddenly realizing) So Cornelius was telling the truth
209 The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together
(to the Chief of Police) Of course  was telling you the truth
If you had listened to me in the first place, we wouldn't be in this predicament now
210 Korben wastes two more Mangalores
She needs you
She needs your help and your love
She's more fragile than she seems
Korben looks around, ready for another attack
Yeah, so am
The Diva takes his hand
She was taught to love the life of others
but not her own
You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live
(uncomfortable) 'll help her,  promise, but  think you should tell me where the Stones are
Do you love her
don't know
We hardly know each other
it takes time
don't have time
need to know
Listen, the last time  admitted to a woman loved her
never saw her again
would like to have died in peace
The Diva's eyes close
211
' The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes"
212 You tell me to save the world then you go off and leave me in the shit
He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks
Come on
You're not gonna die in peace
You're not going to die at all
You hear me
Where are the Stones
213 Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit
He opens it with a complacent smile:		It's empty
He cannot believe his eyes
He goes berserk, destroying everything in sight
214 Korben slaps the Diva soundly
She comes around somewhat
'm sorry, but
the Stones
(very weak) They are
with me
The Diva dies
Blue blood streams from her mouth
Korben frisks the Diva but doesn't find anything
The shooting slowly stops in the theatre
The Mangalores are now in total control
2 Stay calm and nobody will get hurt
Hands on your head and into the hall
The guests comply (to himself) The Stones are with me
and then it occurs to him
In me
He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard
Girding himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone
Then another
And another
Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue blood
Everyone has left the theater
The Mangalores check the aisles one by one
Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat
Don't you think we'd better be going
Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva
He grabs Korben by the shoulder and pokes him with his gun
Hey, you
With the others
Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm
Just for starters
Another  rushes over
Korben punches him into oblivion and snatches the gun
That's it
've had
all day people have been sticking guns in my face
Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt
Korben man
These dudes are going to waste us if we don't do what they say
Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike
You don't do what  say
'll waste you myself
Got it
Got it
215
' President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel
216 Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens
He barks into a walkie-talkie
What's the situation in the hall
217 Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall
They are surrounded by Mangalores who guard them
(into walkie-talkie) There's no more resistance
Everything's under control
Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to the theater
Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands
Everybody down
Korben takes out two more  coming towards him, rolls behind a column
Laser bullets stinging all around his head
This is amazing
Korben, Korben Dallas, the winner of the Gemini Croquette contest just killed three warriors like he was swatting flies
Panic everywhere
Heavy firing fills the hall
: Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun
: Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using for cover
He dives for cover behind the bar
: Two Mangalores watch awestruck
Roy whistles behind them
The two Mangalores turn around
Roy bonks their heads together
It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center forward joining in the battle
Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder
He jumps with fright
(hot to trot) All this is terribly exciting, hmmm
Loc Rhod covers his mike
Mangalore shoots in their direction
Loc Rhod flattens himself on the floor
vase falls on the Princess knocking her out
Mangalore loads some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to move forward
Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table
Toss me the balls
(terrified, still deaf) What
Another piece of the bar explodes
The balls for Christ's sake
Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf
He wants the balls
You deaf or something
The  rolls the balls over to Korben
The Mangalore loads more missiles and shatters another part of the bar
Korben hides behind the last bit left
How far is he from here
The  glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading
'd say about thirty yards to the left
Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed
The Mangalore catches it right in the head
He drops, firing in the air
The missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him
The emperor gives Korben a thumb's up
And our man Korben has literally knocked out the opposition with an amazing 90 foot pitch
The  on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels
Roy whirls his arm in victory
Thanks for your help
Forget it
Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him
218
' Korben bursts into the room
He stares at the luminous bar still struck to the ground and sees the hole Leeloo escaped through
Leeloo
219
'   - Leeloo in bleeding all over
She can barely move
(feeble) Kor
ban
220 The  200 speeds back toward Fhloston Paradise
221
' The bomb timer now reads 10 minutes
222
- The last of the Mangalores have barricaded themselves in the back of the station and shoot at anything that tries to enter
Korben joins the policemen already there
1 Hey, who are you
The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest
Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner
Loc Rhod arrives
Seven to the left
Five to the right
What's he doing
Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly
Six to the left
One to the right
He's on vacation
(reloading) We got to find the leader
Mangalores don't fight without a leader
223 Akanit gets up, grabs Cornelius by the throat and put a gun to his head
One more shot and we start killing hostages, got that
224 Found him
(tense) Send someone to negotiate
Mind if  go
'm an excellent negotiator
1 Uh
Sure, go ahead
Korben gets ready
1 We're sending someone in who's authorized to negotiate
225 Korben walks quickly into the room, heads straight for Akanit, raises his gun and puts a bullet through his head
Anyone else want to negotiate
2 (to another Cop) Where'd he learn to negotiate like that
226
' From us
The President gives Munro a hard look
227 The police round up the remaining Mangalores
Korben is at the control center screens trying to find Leeloo
Cornelius comes over to him, embarrassed
You're probably very angry with me and quite understand
But  want you to know 'm fighting for a noble cause
Yeah,  know
to save the world
but right now all  want to do is save Leeloo
Leeloo's in trouble
When is she not in trouble
Uh
Have you tried the Diva's suite
Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right
228 The ZFX200 settles in the landing dock garage
approach the ship just as Zorg in getting out holding the ZF1
More trouble
Nothing  can't fix myself
He brings up the ZF1 and wipes out the garage
229
' Korben enters the Diva's suite which is in shambles
He looks everywhere, but finds nothing
230 Leeloo lies in a pool of blood
She hears something below her
231
' Exhausted, Loc Rhod wipes his forehead and finds himself face to face with the bomb stuck on the wall
Korben in busy looking for Leeloo
(loudly) Leeloo
Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him
Korben
Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her
Korben man
what the hell is this
Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance
molecular bomb
Three minutes left on the timer
(increasingly worried) And, uh, what're these numbers clicking by
Probably the time remaining before it explodes
Cornelius smiles and continues his search
(weak smile) You're just saying that to scare me
Right
If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off
There's bomb detectors in all these hotels
general alarm goes off
Loc Rhod is crushed
232 The lights flicker
(
) This is a Type  alert
For security reasons the hotel must be evacuated
Please proceed calmly to the lifeboats located in the main hallways
wave of panic engulfs the hall
The cops are unable to hold back the crowd as it stampedes to the exits
233 Zorg marches down the corridor shooting everyone in his path
234
' Loc Rhod stands paralyzed in front of the flashing timer
Less than two minutes left
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think
Not without Leeloo
Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb
Like -Man,  hate to bother you but uh, like, we're down to 2 minutes here
Korben breathes out, bothered
He turns his attention to the bomb
It's the latest model
've never seen one before
it works off a magnetic coded card
Let's see if  can rig it up
235 Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of her blood drip down
The blood splats on Korben's hand
He snaps his head up and knows immediately who is up there
He forgets about the bomb
Hey
What are you doing
The bomb
Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile
Don't worry, 'm here now
He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out on the desk
Just relax
've got the Stones
Everything's going to be fine
30 seconds left on the timer
(falling to pieces) Like Korben, can  have 30 seconds of your time here
(to Leeloo) 'll be right back
Korben dashes over to the bomb
He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card
(smiling) Allow me
Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down from 5 minutes
Just for the fun of it
Loc Rhod faints
Well, what do we have here
Is this Korben Dallas
The famous winner of the Gemini Croquette contest
Or is this Korben Dallas from Special Section sent by old Lindberg himself
Korben doesn't reply
In any event, whoever you are, was glad to meet you
Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead
Nothing
Zorg tries again
Nada
The clip is empty
Zorg starts to panic
3000 round clip
didn't fire off 3000 rounds
did
Don't you know how to count
It's not all that hard
Watch
Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index
One
That's for trying to kill me
Second Punch
Two
That's for firing me
Three
That's for pushing around a priest
And the rest is for what you did to my wife
Korben pummels him mercilessly
236
' President Lindberg prefers closing his eyes
Munro's shoulders move as if he were beating on Zorg
237
' Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp
The timer clicks over to 3 minutes
We're outta here
He picks Leeloo up in his arms
Cornelius grabs Loc Rhod and gives him a resounding slap
Are you nuts, Father
That hurts can't feel my teeth
Doesn't matter all you need are your legs
238
- The lifeboats launch from the hotel and fly out into space
239 Korben, carrying Leeloo, Cornelius and Loc Rhod are in the garage
(
) Two minutes to complete evacuation
Korben bursts the lock on the first ship he finds and enters followed by Cornelius and Loc Rhod
The ZFX200
240
' Zorg starts to come around
241
ZFX200 Korben sets Leeloo down
242
' Zorg picks up his ZF1, unaware of the bomb and the countdown
didn't fire three thousand rounds
243
ZFX2O0 (
) One minute to total evacuation
You know how to fly this thing
(concentrating) It's like a cab isn't it
30 seconds
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate
244
' Zorg is busy with the ZF1 when the bomb starts to  signaling the last ten seconds
Zorg is terror stricken
He pushes a button and holds the ZF1 over his head
(loudly) Maximum Protection
mauve-colored magnetic shield closes around Zorg like an indestructible sarcophagus
245
ZFX200 Cornelius and Loc Rhod are bent over the buttons looking for a way to release the lines
(
) 6
5
Found it
Loc Rhod searches frantically
don't even know what 'm looking for
Fuck it
Hold tight
Korben slams the throttle into full forward
The ship roars away ripping the lines to shreds
Loc Rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship
: The counter goes 1
0 -The suite disintegrates - The corridor is consumed
-The main hall is no more
246 The ZFX200 jets away as the enormous oceanliner explodes behind it
247
ZFX200 The ship stops shaking
That was a close one
Everyone's relieved
Solid little jobs, aren't they
(broadcasting, exhausted) Dear listeners, your favorite  is alive and kicking
It's seven o'clock and time for the news
Tune in tomorrow for another adventure
(
) Beep
End of transmission
Loc Rhod lets out a huge sigh
(to the others) The best show  ever did
248 magnetic sarcophagus crosses the Fhloston sky and crashes into a glacier
249 Zorg appears in the middle of the ice
He takes a portable phone out of the ZF1
How's that
Can you hear me better now
(
) Yes, Mr
Zorg,  hear you perfectly
So, how was the concert
Who gives a shit
didn't come here to listen to music
Listen up instead of running off at the mouth
The batteries on my phone are almost gone
(
) Yes, Sir
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately
Someone stole mine
(
) Right away, Sir
'll send you a new one to the hotel
'm not at the hotel
Hello
(
) Battery dead
Zorg is all alone, lost, in the middle of the glacier
(to himself) Stay calm
stay calm

' General Munro enters the office with a smile
Major Dallas has the Five Elements on board
The priest is guiding them directly to the temple
President Lindberg closes his eyes in relief
Thank God
We've been saved
rushes in
Mr
President
Yes
Now, what
251 ball of fire, all-powerful Evil, speeds across the screen with three Federal Army warships following along behind it as best they can
252
' What do you mean, "its advancing"
253 It's not only advancing, but it's moving at incredible speed
We're having trouble following it
254
' (to Scientist) And
Do you have any idea where it's heading
The scientist is hard to put to answer, he shakes his head
255
ZFX200   - Korben gently wipes Leeloo's forehead with a cloth
She opens her eyes a little
(gentle, loving) Apipoulai
Leeloo smiles, weakly, feverish
'm so very sad
Why
We did pretty well, wouldn't you say
Five hundred wars
Arms
Drugs
Money
Everything you create is used to destroy
told you not to read all that crap
Protect life
Until death
Her eyes close and she falls back asleep
Korben is worried
She seems so depressed
Cornelius enters
There's a General on the phone
His name's Mambo,  think
256
' Munro here
President Lindberg wants to talk to you
Hold the line
The President clears his throat and takes the phone
Major, first off,  want to thank you, in my name and in the name of the Federation
257
ZFX200 / ' (
) For the praiseworthy courage you have shown us
'd like to congratulate General Munro for his choice
He found the ideal man for such a
(to the point) So now what's the problem
The President drops into his armchair and sighs
There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter heading straight for the earth
And we have no idea how to stop it
That's the problem
Korben thinks fast
The Priest is with him
The Five Elements are on board
How much time before the collision
The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head
If its speed remains constant
in an hour and 57 minutes
(
) 'll call you back in two hours
Korben hangs up
The President looks stunned
258 The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded cosmos
259 David is asleep
He is woken by the sound of
260
- The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert
Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo
Cornelius has the four Stones with him
Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along
David appears at the door of the chapel
You're all safe
Thanks be to God
Later, David
Later
There's not a minute to lose
The small group enters the chapel
261 Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden barrier
Cornelius stands in front of the cross
Excuse me, Father, but
could we pray later
Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down
mechanism is set off lowering the altar like a service elevator
The altar descends amid rocky walls
262
' They just landed in the desert
(sweating) How much time is left
263 Earth is in view
The Dark Planet fills the screen and heads for the blue planet
264
' About nine minutes
President Lindberg has trouble breathing
265 Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact center of the four elements
Cornelius looks over the four Stones every which way
(panic-stricken) Uh, this one
must be water
It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works
Theoretically, yes
The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but
don't have the reference book
've never seen the Stones work
Korben can't believe his ears
He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand and studies the inscriptions
He goes over to one of the four bases the stones rest on and tries to figure it out
The symbol of air is on the Stone, the same as on the base
Match the symbols
Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one
Cornelius has found the symbol for water
Loc Rhod sits down
He is very tired
What is this some kinda game
Like chess
Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands
No
It's much simpler
If we don't figure out where these Stones go in five minutes, we're all dead
Think you got it
Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone
The four Stones are all in place but nothing happens
There's no light
You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light
(lost) Yes, of course, but
The Stones are shut
They have to be open for it to work
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying
That's what 'm saying
266 The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly
267 Korben leans over Leeloo
Leeloo
The Stones
We have to open them
How does it work
(feeble) The wind blows
the fire burns
know all that, Leeloo
'm talking about the Stones
The rain falls
Korben is desperate
Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out of her
He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over
The rain falls
the wind blows
Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben
Try and figure out how this fucking thing opens, instead of staring at me like that
Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around
(afraid) 'm looking, 'm looking
268
' The tension is palpable in the President's office
Three minutes
We've lost contact with them
269 Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way
All to no avai1
Loc Rhod is discouraged
we'll never make it
He sighs
Three hooks pop off the Stone
Loc Rhod can't believe his eyes
It
it moved
Korben
Korben
Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone
Hooks are undone
What did you say
What did you do
Nothing
Swear to God,  didn't do nothing
Look, you did something that set it off
Try to remember
Concentrate
Tell me exactly what you did
Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement
was like this
With my hands here and
said, "We'll never make it
" That's all
Nothing happens
Is that all
Yeah
then  sighed
like this
Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time
The Stone opens even more
Korben's got it
The wind
The wind blows
Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside
yellow beam pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile
Quickly, everyone on a Stone
Water for water
Fire for fire
Earth for earth
The two men move fast
Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth
He grabs a fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone
miniature patch of green appears and immediately forms a green beam
Cornelius wipes his forehead with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone
It opens revealing a patch of miniature raging sea
blue beam appears
Loc Rhod has a problem
(shaking) don't have a light
stopped smoking last week
If we'd come a bit sooner
Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches
There's only one left
Don't breathe
Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath
Korben strikes the match small flame appears on the tip
breeze goes through the room
Korben feels like he's got  in his hands
He approaches the flame to the Stone
The flame twists, dims, flickers
but holds on
The Stone opens
patch of miniature fire appears
Korben sighs, snuffs out the match
The fourth beam, a red one, immediately forms
270 mass of fire fills the screen
The Earth is only a thousand miles away
271
' Two more minutes
The President shuts his eyes
His lids move in prayer
272 Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors crisscross
It's up to you now, Angel
'm so tired
You can sleep tomorrow
come on
want to sleep
forever
Leeloo
Listen to me
'll take you on a vacation afterwards
real vacation, this time, for as long as you want
Come on
You can do it
Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar
Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams
An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise
Come on Leeloo
Come on
The beam loses its intensity
Leeloo crumples to the floor
273 The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth
hundred miles before impact
The African continent is visible
No doubt about it:	The fireball is heading right for Egypt
274
' Seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientist's stopwatch
It'll be entering the atmosphere in one minute
275 The heat in the temple is unbearable
All the walls start to ooze the same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg's
drop of liquid falls to the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid
Loc Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff
Korben quickly straightens Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams
Leeloo
If you don't get on with the program we're all gonna die
And that's not on my agenda for today
Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck
(weak) What's the use of saving lives
when you see what you do with them
You're right but there are lots of good things
beautiful things
Like love
Exactly
But  don't know love
'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own
276
' The Scientist's stopwatch goes from 30 to 29 seconds
277 have thousands of memories but none of them are mine
There is no need for me other than this
'm immortal but  have no life
Yes, you do
need you
More than you can imagine
Stand up straight
Why
Why would you need me
Because
(to himself) Tell her, for God's sake
bit of the black acid falls on Loc Rhod's shirt setting it on fire
He rips if off
: 278 Because
Leeloo has tears in her eyes
The heat is overpowering
Black acid is everywhere
Tell me
love you
Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly
: 278b
' The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2
279 Now you're allowed to kiss me
- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed anybody before
- The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms around Leeloo and Korben
- The stopwatch hits zero
- The Absolute Beam explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down
- Korben and Leeloo kiss like there was no tomorrow
- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet
Inaudible screeches escape from the dying planet
Screeches of terrifying pain as if a million souls were dying
- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like brilliant stalactites
280 The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work
The Dark Planet nothing more than a dead planet
Strangely enough, it looks like the moon
Everything is calm around it
281
' President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead- The planet seems to have stopped at
62 miles from impact
282 In the temple, the beam loses its intensity
But Leeloo and Korben remain stuck together, lost in their kiss
Cornelius has dropped to his knees, clutching his hands
Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh
He gives Cornelius a knowing smile
This guy is a killer with the babes
knew it from the moment  laid eyes on him
Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing
Korben and Leeloo keep on kissing
283 We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the beginning of our story
The President enters the lab followed by a group of officials in ceremonial dress
Mr
President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center
It's an honor to receive you
Mr
President
(beaming) Yes
Well
Where are our two heroes
They were so tired from their ordeal that we put them in the reactor this morning
have 19 more meetings after this one Professor
Of course
Let me see if they're revived
We go live in one minute, Mr
President
Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him to see what is going on under the blue shield
Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and probably engaged in hoppi hoppa
Mactilburgh looks troubled
uh
they need five more minutes, Mr
President
The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling with a phone call
No ma'am
tried
No ma'am
Who is it
Some woman
claims she's Korben's mother
Give it here
The President takes the phone and goes to the window
Mrs
Dallas, this in the President
On behalf of the entire Federation, would like to thank
(
) Don't pull that crap with me, Finger
'd recognize that trash can voice of yours in a dark alley during a rain storm
You tell that worthless no account son of mine he should plotz for the way he's ignored his mother
when  think of all sacrificed for him
284 Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the phone away from his ear
slowly across Manhattan
Credits Roll as  full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky
