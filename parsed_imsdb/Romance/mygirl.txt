Written by Laurice Elehwany Setting: ,  1972 (to camera) was born jaundiced
Once  sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids
And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so  knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction
(to Harry) Dad,  don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right
It can only mean one thing
Cancer
'm dying
(ignoring Vada) Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge
' Vada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group of boys All right, who's in raise your hand
All the boys raise their hands except Thomas Are you coming or not Thomas
don't think so
knew he wouldn't come
can't,  have to go home
#2 Yeah, to play with his
Leave him alone
Come on, let's go
Group of boys enters house lead by Vada Once inside, the group is suddenly stopped (to boy#2) Hey, you didn't pay me
#2 How do  know you were gonna show us one
You're such a baby
#2 All right, here
Boy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it to Vada All right, follow me and don't say a word
They walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns around You ready
They enter the coffin display room, and move over to the coffin in the middle of the room You sure you wanna see it, or is someone gonna go yellow belly
#3 'm not chicken
Okay
Lean forward
tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and the boys gasp as they look inside #1 It's empty
#2 You're so weird
want my money back
was afraid of this
They begin to move into another part of the house #2 Of what
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy
#3 You're full of shit
bet she's roaming around this house somewhere
They open the door into the living room, where Grammoo is in her rocking chair There she is, in the rocking chair
Pause, then Grammoo begins to rock the chair gently
The boys all gasp and then all exit very quickly Hi Grammoo
Vada seats herself upon Grammoo's lap (in distance, from downstairs) Vada would you bring down my cigarettes
Vada gets up and begins to leave Seeya later
(kisses Grammoo on forehead) ,  & Did  tell you, he was my woodshop teacher
You took woodshop
Yeah,  made a tie rack
made a tie rack
Vada comes down the stairs and stops just before the corner that would allow her to see the corpse of Mr
Layton Ahem
Vada, just put 'em on the stool
Vada places the packet on a stool Daddy guess what  beat Thomas  in monopoly yesterday
(completely ignoring Vada's comment) Ya, that rack holds six ties
still have mine
Vada recognizes Arthur's voice Arthur
Vada
beat Thomas  in monopoly yesterday
Good for you baby
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way
like to buy off all the railroads
Harry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them Vada, we're trying to work here
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em
(to Arthur) Hand me the canula
Vada begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-diddy, Arthur joins in (annoyed) Dad
'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing
(beat) All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle
(fades out as Vada climbs stairs) Vada climbs stairs and stops to read patient note, - (to corpse) One nice model -501 bronze stainless eternal journey, yeah, you look like a champion
'  , ,       , Is Mr
Harry Sultenfuss in
Sure, come on in
Vada and strange woman make their way to a desk in the foyer, and sit down So, have you had the unfortunate experience of recently losing a loved one
(puzzled look) Could  see your Dad, just for a second
Vada runs across to call downstairs , '
Vada runs back to the desk He's downstairs working on Mr
Layton
Prostate Cancer
Once it hits your prostate, you're a goner
Oh
Harry enters How may
Help you
'm Shelly devoto
We spoke, the other day regarding the make up artist job
Oh yes
It's still available  hope
think it's still available
'm a licensed cosmetologist,  worked for two years, at the "Dino Raphael" Salon, all my customers cried when  told them  was leaving
Uhh, Miss devoto
have a wonderful disposition,  put people right at ease
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease
This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor
They're dead
Yes they are
Stiffs
(for want of a better word) Deceased
The add just said "Makeup Artist" Doorbell rings Ahh, excuse me a second will you
(opens door) Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, didn't want the burnished handles
(door closes off scene) Vada looks out the window at Shelly's camper Is that your camper
Yes it is
That's really cool
Grammoo walks past in a fixed stare (to Grammoo) Hello
Grammoo keeps walking as if she hadn't heard She's shy
Oh
Harry is standing at the door directing the men with the coffin Just put it back in the display room fellers
Okay Harry
The men move off, Vada walks over to Harry Daddy, how come that coffin's so small
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes
Is it for a child
Harry hesitates Of course not
Then who's it for
Small pause while Harry thinks of a reply Short people, very short people
Shelly walks over to Harry Excuse me, what about the job
Pardon
need the job
Oh, You still want it
Even though uhh
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone
Okay Mr
Sultenfuss, you got a deal
Great, you can start right away
Call me Harry
Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work
Don't get me wrong,  like it, very much, but the
promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks
Harry and Vada exchange weird looks - Vada and Thomas  are riding their bikes through town Hey look at this, no feet
Oh wow, a real evil canieval
Vada and Thomas  ride up through a garage , Vada and Thomas  arrive outside the entrance to the Doctors surgery, Vada enters and climbs stairs, she passes a small boy in a wheelchair in the corridor, Vada enters room ' Hi Vada, what's wrong today
'm very sick
Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor can see you
She picks up phone and whispers something inaudible to the doctor Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in
Vada opens door to doctors surgery and enters ' , Well, what is it
can handle it
You are perfectly healthy
That can't be,  have all the classic symptoms
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr
Layton to your house today
Yes
Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you
Vada gets up in a mood, puts hat on, and walks to the door, stopping and says with condescending intonation
'll just have to get a second opinion
Vada emerges from the building and gets on her bike So, what'd he say was wrong with you
Vada is turning and beginning to ride away The whole medical profession is a crack
Thomas  is trying to catch up Hey wait up for me
& Vada slows down, stops and looks at a person on a ladder painting a house Hey look
Thomas  stops also At what
That's Mr
Bixler, let's go talk to him
don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer
Hi Mr
Bixler
Mr
Bixler turns around and sees Vada and Thomas Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr
How's the summer treating you
It's okay
Mr
Bixler,  finished all the books for summer reading
Really
Already
The summer's just begun
Yes, and now 'm reading War & Peace for fun
No wonder you're my prize pupil
What about you Thomas
haven't started yet
Better get on his case Vada
Mr
Bixler gets down off his ladder Mr
Bixler, how come you're painting this old house
Well  just bought it, now 'm fixing it up
This is one big house for one single person
Well, you never can tell
(Vada gets worried look on her face) might get a pet
(Vada's expression relaxes, she smiles) How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working
Well 'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, 'm doing some work
How much does it cost
Thirty five dollars
What do you get for that
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry
This an interrogation Vada
No
Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War & Peace
It's summer
You're kids
Go play
Vada and Thomas  ride off down street , Wanna go to Gray's orchard and pick some peaches
No, 'm going home
Why
It's not dinner time yet
Dinner time
You're like a dog
You just go home to eat
Vada accelerates leaving Thomas  in her tracks Don't pee on the hydrant
' Vada puts a record on to play
(song is "Wedding Bell Blues") She then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph, with Mr
Bixler enhaloed in a heart shape
Music begins to play and Vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking at the photo longingly '    , , ,       , Excuse me Harry,  finished Mr
Layton's hair
He kinda looked
(she sees Vada lying down sprawled out on the floor) Harry, what's wrong with her
Oh, she's just pretending
Vada, get up here and eat your broccoli
Shelly moves over and crouches down next to Vada (very sick sounding voice) think it's my prostate
All of a sudden, Grammoo begins to sing got rhythm,  got music,  got my man who could ask for anything more
got daisies, in green pastures,  got my man, who could ask for anything more
As this is being sung, Shelly slowly looks up with a weird expression, this is too much for her , Shelly exits house and closes door behind her, and then crouches down beside Vada and Thomas Who's winning
am
As Vada and Thomas  continue to play, three Vada-aged girls come up to the end of the Sultenfuss' driveway #1 Look, there's Vada and her little (very mocking voice) He is not my boyfriend
#2 bet she kissed him on the lips
Do you think  kissed that ugly old thing
Yeah anyway
#2 Come on let's go
#1 & #2 Judy's father owns the movie theater and we get to see all the movies  want for free
Maybe you can come some time
#2 Eeeuww, don't invite , she'll have to bring her boyfriend
The two girls begin to walk off, Judy follows slowly looking guilty and embarrassed by her friends #2 (together) Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, ---- --, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes Thomas  in a baby carriage
Judy wanders off screen, looking sorry for Vada You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you
'm not upset
will never play with those girls
only surround myself with people who find intellectually stimulating
Thomas  looks at Shelly and smiles, he is proud to be the friend of such an intelligent girl (to Vada) Want a piece of chocolate
Vada shakes her head Thomas
'm allergic to it
To chocolate
He's allergic to everything
Chocolate
& Shelly notices a ring that Vada is wearing on her right index finger Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood 'm in
It doesn't work, it always stays black
( ring is ) It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood
Maybe black means you're happy
don't think so
(pause) Shelly, how can  get thirty five dollars
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, wanna be a writer
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher
Vada is annoyed that Shelly now knows her little secret and pushes Thomas Shut your big fat mouth
think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad
He won't give it to me
Well you don't know that
Ask him
'  ,     , Vada passes Grammoo and Harry who are watching a  show, she then seats herself next to Harry Daddy, can  have thirty five dollars
That's a lot of money for a little girl
It's for school, for summer writing class
(engrossed with  show) Any more soda left
Vada pours Harry another soda Shelly thinks 'd be a good writer
Last month you wanted to play the violin
Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist
Harry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the screen Dad
(referring to ) love this guy
(he laughs) Dad
What
The money
Ahh, maybe next summer
' He forgot about the time  wanted to be a magician,  was really great at making myself disappear
' ,   -, Wanna play
No,  gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up
Don't look at the ball, look at me
Arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a demonstration See
You were looking at the ball
All right
Keep your head up
Gimme some skin, They both give each other five i
e
Slap each others hands, Arthur exits
Vada continues bouncing the ball, which accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the basement Vada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the ball
As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut unaware that Vada is down there
Vada runs up the stairs and tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts to yell out for help and bang on the it
Shelly hears the noise and comes to the door
Vada, overcome with fear, sits on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy- diddy
Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on the step Vada
What happened
(extremely frightened and timid) My ball,  lost my ball
(picking Vada up onto her feet) Come on sweetie
The two exit the scene ,   ' Excuse me Harry
Uh huh
Could you take a look at Mrs
Porter
Yeah
Harry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs
Porter and observes Shelly's work, he looks unimpressed Didn't  give you a picture of what she looked like
Yeah, (searches pockets, eventually pulling out a photo) Harry compares photo with Mrs
Porter's face You don't like it
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker
(a little offended) think she looks nice
Her lips are very thin so  used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, 'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972
She did
This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive
just wanted to get past this "old school Marm" image
That wasn't an image
She  an old school Marm
(beat) Fix it
Harry begins to leave Harry
(Harry stops and turns around) was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada
What do you mean
Well the other night at dinner
Oh that, she just likes to play
don't think so,  think she's confused about death
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it
Harry,  really think she
(annoyed) She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay
, ,  & , There's Shelly
Vada and Thomas  stop turning the rope leaving Phil standing there exhausted, and run over to Shelly's camper, Shelly gets out Hi
Can we look around in your camper
Sure
'll give you the royal tour
Vada and Thomas  rush inside the camper (surprised at Vada and Thomas 's eagerness to get inside) Woah
Gosh
Thomas  seats himself at the drivers seat and makes "vroom vroom" noises, Vada sits at the table, selects a book from a small bookshelf on the side, and begins to read it Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here
Uh huh
'm gonna drive us to Liverpool
Liverpool
Big Ringo fan
Ohh, right
Would you like a soda
would
Thomas
Yes please
Thomas uproots himself and sits opposite Vada at the table What are you reading
Vada makes a gesture at Thomas  with her finger up to her lips implying that he should be quiet Shelly notices Vada reading the book Oh
You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a little too old for you
She takes the book away from her Did you read  these books
Uh huh
What are they about
Mostly love, and romance
Eeeeuuuww, gross
They're just fun to read
Shelly hands the soda around Here, cheers
Everybody takes a mouthful of drink Are you married
No, 'm divorced
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other
Mine aren't divorced
Thomas  gets up and reaches for the cookie jar Shelly, can  have a cookie
With bottle of soda in mouth Hmmmph gurgle gurgle
Thomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination Hey, where are all the cookies
Vada sees the money and the expression on her face shows she has an idea Well,  guess you found my secret hiding place
What are you saving for
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day
Cuckoo clock goes "Cuckoo
" Lunch time, 12 o'clock 'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch, thanks Shelly
Thomas  leaves Bye
Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back
Can  use your bathroom first
Sure
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late
Okay
Shelly exits and Vada enters toilet with a  guilty look on her face , The great way, is not difficult for those with no preferences, with the absence of both love and hate, everything becomes clear and undisguised
That was written by a Chinese Philosopher in the year 600
Now why would choose to bring that up in a creative writing class
Because, the absence of judgment helps us to appreciate reality
In other words, want you to listen to your classmates writing, with a clear and open heart, okay
So who's gonna go first
got one
He gets up sang a song for you to hear,  painted a picture for you to see,  picked a rose for you to smell,  planted grass for you to touch, But you did not hear my song, You did not see my picture, You did not smell my rose and  did not touch my grass
Woman Maybe she was outta town
#2 That's not funny, his poem is about futility, we toil in unrewarded obscurity
Now,  hear judgment, let's not forget the part about the open heart
The door at the back of the room opens and Vada enters holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous Vada, is there, something  can do for you
(very nervous) paid the money
For this class
Uh huh,  wanna be a writer
Vada, this is an adult writing class
Hey,  think it's real beautiful
She want's to be a writer
Vada, you sure you wanna do this
Vada nods her head Welcome to the class, go find a seat
The class applauds Okay ahh, who's next
experienced something with my boyfriend the other day, and  wrote a few words down
The floor's yours Ronda
He covers me like a blanket, from the cold, dark night, As  look into his eyes,  know it's right, To touch, To feel,  know he's real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh  a mush, can't fight it, There's no point,  wake up in Lighter joint
Several looks glance around the room
Vada raises her hand Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada
wrote a poem too
Please
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode
That's all  got so far
hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky Road, it's about desire
Vada that's
It's very sweet, and it rhymes and that's also good  but, you're not expressing to me what's in your soul
want you to show me how you see the world, your fears, your desires, your innermost secrets
' My fears and secrets
'm afraid  killed my mother
' ,      , Shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and proceeds to the living room Shelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a tune to Grammoo on his tuba (sung, to Grammoo) Can not do without, Harry's wild about me
Excuse me Harry, 'm sorry,  just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered
And the room's all set up
Thanks, listen  wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada,  was a little harsh
shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business
It's just that  like Vada, very much
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada
They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy
'm sure she'll snap out of it though
'm sure she will
, , Nothing's biting today
Maybe they had a big breakfast
(hanging from tree) 'm gonna be an acrobat when  grow up
Big deal,  can do that too
(Thomas 's reel begins to click) Thomas , you got something
Oh no
(he jumps down from the tree) Hurry
'm trying
Reel it in
(Thomas  reels the fish in) He's only tiny, throw him back
don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it
Thomas  puts his foot on the fish and pulls You're hurting him, don't kill him
The hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier Vada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor error in film} and in the process pricks herself Ouch
Darn hook
Vada puts the fish back 'm bleeding, did he get away
Go look
Thomas  looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of the water Yeah he got away
Come on let's go
Hey, we can become blood brothers
Naah,  don't wanna
You could pick that scab on your arm
It's a mosquito bite
It'll bleed
If  do it, can we go
Uh huh
Okay,
Thomas  picks the scab on his arm which begins to bleed Okay, rub them together
They rub their cuts together Now we're blood brothers for life
, Hi
Oh Hi, what can  do for you
Nothing,  was just wondering what you were doing
Oh, 'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family
Oh right, right, (she picks up the newspaper)
Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette
Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society
wrote that
No kidding
Harry gives Shelly a matter-of-fact look Oh it's good, "In lieu of"  love that word lieu
prefer it to "instead", it has more dignity
In lieu
"instead"
No contest
It's no big deal
You have to learn how to take a complement
(Shelly turns the newspaper over) Movies, movies, ahhhh, "Love Story" at the drive in,  cried my eyes out, did you see it
haven't been to the movies in
love going to movies, especially at the drive in
don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in
(subtle ) 'll let you get back to work
Shelly begins to exit with a look of failure on her face do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to
(considers for a moment) Okay
Harry resumes typing Hi Vada
Are you going out somewhere
No
So how come you're putting lipstick on
girl's always gotta look her best
think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color
Have you ever tried any
No
Come here, sit down
Vada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet seat, Shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of Vada
Vada gets some lipstick put on her Now, first we blot
Vada blots her lips on some tissue Take a look
think it looks real nice on you
Vada looks in Shelly's mirror Shelly, do you think 'm pretty
Yes, Vada  think you're very pretty
You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth
The boys at school don't think  am
They'll come around
Close your eyes,  wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them
The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow
Do you like putting makeup on people
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars,  haven't gotten there yet
(she finishes her work) All right, open your eyes
Vada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror Shelly,  would definitely hold off on that Hollywood thing
, , Your lip bleeding
No
What's wrong with your eyes
girl can never wear enough eye shadow
Where's your bike
Oh, in the garage
Walk me over
The two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is parked It's only a garage, come on
Vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone Hey, one of my streamers is gone
It probably fell off in here
Thomas  walks over to a model of a head Hey look at this
That was Grammoo's
It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not
Come here, i'll diagnose your head
No,  don't wanna
Come on, it's fun
Vada examines Thomas 's head and then compares it with the chart Hmmmm, interesting
What
You have no personality
Hey, where does it say that
Never mind
Thomas  knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo Is that your Dad
Yes
Who's that with your Dad
It's my mother
Do you remember her
No
Grammoo said she's in heaven
What do you think it's like
What
Heaven
think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer
As they leave, Vada turns back and grabs the photo, then returns to Thomas ' , The tune "Moonglow" is playing on the radio Well well well, what's going on in here
Nothing, 'm dressing
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother
Phil then proceeds to give Harry a noogie Phil stops 'm going out with Shelly
Oh yes, oh that's great
'm very nervous
Why
The last date  had was twenty years ago
That's true
Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, "The Sexual Revolution", now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing
Oh come on
Harry, 'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry
Are you sure about all this
Did you not tell Vada 'm a womanizer huh
Oh, 'm running late
Shelly'll be here any minute
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car
How do  look
Like a Sultenfuss
Go get 'em
Harry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way Goodnight Vada
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo
Ahh,  just wanna look nice
You never cared before
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together
Why
She likes to play bingo
Can  go too
Naah,  think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company
Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out the door ' , Vada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the window for Thomas  to come outside, which he does Vada
Vada
Where are you
Vada springs up from her hiding place Here
Don't  that
Sorry
What do you want
My mom will skin me alive if she finds 'm out here
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight
told you i'll get in trouble
Pacifist
am not
Bed wetter
stopped that
, Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo
For instance, on a given night anybody can win, but  play the odds, when choosing bingo cards,  use a range of theories from the laws of probability to avoiding duplicate number systems
This way you get much more activity
(hopeful) Does it make it easier to win
No
Just, more activity
Harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it, cutting Shelly off, who has to pull her own seat out and sit down (as he sits down, to the person next to him) Hi Carl
Vada and Thomas  are walking up to the church They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch
Watch bingo
don't even like to play bingo
Duck
Vada and Thomas  are ducking behind a counter on one side of the church, Harry and Shelly are quite clearly visible on the other side of the room (in the distance, as a number is announced) Oh great
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly
Ssshhhhh,  don't want them to see me
(in the distance again, as another number is announced) Aarrggh
As Shelly looks around the bingo table, she notices that everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big way just had a terrible thought Harry
What's that
'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon
Why d'you think these seats were empty
Can we go yet
Go
You know 'm not allowed outside my myself after dark
Oh, 'm just not lucky Harry
Look, it's not always luck,  mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100
Kinda like men
Oh, how do you mean
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want
Harry and Shelly are about to kiss each other, Vada sees this and doesn't look too happy about it (in semi-deep fake voice) We have a winner
Will the winner please raise their hand
There was no bingo, it came from outside
How could someone outside get a bingo
Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone outside yelled bingo you moron
Who are you calling a mowon
(false teeth) ' Put a lid on it Vernon
Put a lid on it
If you weren't 200 years old, 'd kick your wrinkled
The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break it up Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game
Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing We can go now
Vada and Thomas  run off down the street '  , As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her window and looks out it through the venetian blinds Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, eventually had a good time tonight
haven't had a bingo partner in ages
They walk up to Shelly's camper Would you like to come in and see my house
Just for a minute
Okay, sure
They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room , Home sweet home
It's nice
did it myself
read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems
You can look in the bathroom if you want
People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush
Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the bathroom, and then flushes the toilet Yeah
Are you mad at me
No, why
don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women
Look 'm so out of touch,  haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died
What happened to her
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born
Did she ever see Vada
brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah  think she saw Vada
It was
Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling with to calm his nerves Did  ruin this
Dance with me
Here
This is where we are
Is there enough room
Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more room haven't danced in
In ages,  know, me neither
They begin a slow dance Rock
See, you're not that out of touch
(they dance) You're good
At Widdman High  was considered a pretty hot date,  did a killer frugue
Shelly smells Harry's neck What are you wearing
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic
They continue to dance Do you want to
Want to what
Kiss me
Yes
Good
They then have a long kiss Good at kissing, and dancing, 'm very optimistic
They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock cuckooing ahh, better go
It's only eight o'clock
Goodnight Shelly
Goodnight
Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the door ,       ' Well,  guess it's official we had a date, maybe we can play bingo again sometime
'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours
Goodnight
Harry waves ' Vada finishes watching, and goes to bed Before the class started, Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation
Ooooh that's really cool
Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes out into the group
Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play weird music Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes
Relax your muscles and take deep breaths
Now, try to feel what the other person is feeling, without speaking any words, send out your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at the same time
Can you feel it
Okay, open your eyes
What did everybody feel
felt Mrs
Hunsaker's strength
can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, she's so cosmically in tune
So right on, that's exactly what  sent out, and  felt like, you were full of inner peace and harmony
Vada, what did you feel
felt Justin's hangnail
No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a hangnail is insignificant
What's in my soul, feel my aura
don't think 'm allowed to
tell you what, let's try it again, hold hands
' Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe
It got infected and traveled to her vocal chords, it ruined her singing voice,  don't think Grammoo thought it was insignificant
' , Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual healing , Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get lettuce
Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out Hey,  thought  recognized you two, hi Vada
Hi
'm just picking some things up for the barbecue
Yeah, me too, mind if  tag along
Not at all
Lot of potatoes
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad
'm looking forward to that
Vada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry & Shelly, and she rams her cart into Harry , , damn it
Vada, watch what you're doing
Sorry
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time
Really
(picking up large can of prunes) Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes bad
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all
(to Shelly) don't know what's gotten into her today
Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not giving a stuff what they contain ' used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie dolls, Ken was my favorite
Then one Christmas got them a camper, and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves
So  wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff
,  -  , ,  &   "  " ' , , , Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry,  told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done
You've cremated them
That's what  do
Do you wanna do it
No, no no
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while
Phil exits scene, Shelly comes up behind Harry How's it going chef
Okay
Vada is seen turning her head to look at Harry and Shelly, she doesn't like Harry and Shelly standing so close together, she decides to make her move and pushes in between Harry and Shelly Are they ready yet
No, sweetie, not yet
Shelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off When
Soon honey, soon
Shelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair (which there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with) And Vada shakes her off again When
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out
Vada backs off, followed by Shelly ' , , , ,    - Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God
'll second that
Hey Shelly, like seafood
Uh huh, why
See food
Vada opens her mouth and displays half chewed  cuisine to Shelly (laughing) That's attractive
Shelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing looking around (under her breath) Oh shit
Excuse me
Shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space Hey Shelly, who lives here
(pointing at hearse) The Addams Family
Danny, what are you doing here
What am  doing here
What am  doing here
(to other man in background) Hi Ralph
Oh Danny, how'd you find me here
You told everybody where you were going, 'm here for the motor home
Scene shifts to Vada, Phil and Harry for a moment These two people do not have a good relationship
(in background) No
_I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it
Scene shifts back to close up of Shelly and Danny arguing 've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine
Excuse me,  , that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be " ", not "Shelly's recreational vehicle"
Gimme the keys
Keep your voice down
What
The boss is watching us
(sarcastic) 'm impressed
God  guess i'll have to introduce you now
Yeah, all right
Shelly and Danny walk over to the table where the rest of the family are seated, Ralph follows close behind (Talking to Danny, pointing at the people respectively) This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss
Vada Sultenfuss
Tough break
(matter-of-fact) like my name
(to the Sultenfuss') This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit
(pointing at Danny) We used to be married
(extremely hopeful, to Danny) Are you here to take Shelly back
Danny shakes his head at Vada, then Harry gets up and walks round the table Uhh, it's nice to meet ya
Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us
Can't stay, 'm just here because my wife
Shelly quickly interjects Ex
ex, ex
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper
Shelly
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, promise
don't think so,  got a copy of the property settlement right here
Danny pulls out a piece of paper Ahh Shit, this is my lease
Damn it, keep forgetting things, 'm getting senile
Danny
Okay,  know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but  urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever
(to Shelly) This guy bonking you
(disgusted) Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say
(to Danny) Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper
Oh
Oh
Oh no
Oh
It's her home
It's where she lives
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook, (to Shelly) Gimme the goddam keys
Danny tries to grab the keys from Shelly Stop it
That hurts
Harry is now  annoyed Danny
As Harry says "Danny" for a second time he plants his fist in Danny's stomach with force, winding him and shutting him up ' , ,   , , What'd you do that for
Who are you
'm his brother
Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here quite often
Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's camper again, 'm gonna bury him in my front yard
Ralph looks rather disturbed by this , (quiet voice, to Vada) Your father is a savage
Vada looks up at Phil, Phil looks back and nods ' ,     , Bye Ralph
The car with Danny and Ralph in it pulls away and Shelly waves (to Harry) Well, you were pretty great
Is it really your camper
Shelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting "sort of" Suddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then explodes, Harry and Shelly look up and watch the fireworks Can we see it from the back yard
You can get the general idea
They move off to the back yard
Yep, there they are
They always look the same every year
Pointing upwards Look
Did you ahh, love him
would never marry anybody  didn't love
- He must like Shelly,  never saw him hit anyone in his life
He likes her
Does he love her
Probably
Do you like her
Yes  do, and  think she's very good for your father
Why
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny
Really
Now when  see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry
My Dad was funny
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh
' My Uncle fought in the Korean war, he had a steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he didn't come back the same, one night, he picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his teeth, it was really neat
' , Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh
(with stick in mouth) Carnnk yu sheeee ik
Dr
Welty removes stick from Vada's mouth Can't you see it
No
It's there
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat
Vada looks at the Dr
's certificates up on the wall Dr
Welty, are you sure those are yours
, , So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got
water gun
Cool, can  get one for Vada
Oh yes, yes
She gets another one out of her drawer Thomas, let me ask you a question
Does Vada ever tell you why she comes down here so much
Cause she's dying
Do you think she is
No
Why do you think she says that
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared
You know what  think
think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you
Nurse Randall hands Thomas  another syringe She's my best friend
The door to the doctor's surgery opens and Vada exits Miss Vada, how are you feeling
As good as can be expected
Hey Vada, guess what we got
What
Thomas  begins to run, and as he passes Vada he squirts his syringe at Vada (squirt) (squirt) 'm gonna get you
(squirt) 'll get you
Vada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas  down the stairs , , Suddenly Thomas  stops in his tracks Woah
What
Pointing There's a beehive right there
So
Stand back
Thomas  stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and begins to squirt the beehive Are you crazy, you'll get stung
You're right, let's knock it down
What do you want it for anyway
For their meat
The two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets damaged and eventually falls to the ground Got it
My mood ring
It fell off
gotta find it
They begin to search for Vada's mood ring Suddenly bees begin to swarm, luckily Thomas  notices in time They're alive
Run for your life
Vada just stands there looking, Thomas  comes back and grabs her arm, this wakes her up and they begin to run Run faster they're after us
am running faster
Hurry
They have run to the spot with the weeping willow and the pier, they run out on to the pier Jump in the water
But  have my clothes on
Do it
, ' , (in the distance, from upstairs) Vada is that you
Yes
Hey guess what
We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes
Vada likes this news, she hurries up the stairs Shelly's coming with us
Vada is now not so happy ,    , ,    , So Vada, what's your favorite ride
like the freak show
know,  know, let's go on the "sit on the bench and rest" ride
don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach
You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here,  remember one time  went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis
Nephritis
It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs
Well, 'm no doctor
All  know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat
They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine
Vada and Harry give Shelly a "yeah " look They were
"Popular Mechanics", no "Popular Science"
don't know, popular
, Oh look they're trying to hit that poor thing
Watch you don't knock out a fish
Perfect
don't know which ball's mine
Vada gets a ball in a bowl won,  won
Oh great
Hooray, we have a winner, (picks up fish in plastic bag) There you go little girl
(gives fish to Vada) See how easy it is folks
Shelly inspects fish, holding it along with Vada Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish
Vada notices something on Shelly's hand Where'd you get that ring
All of a sudden Shelly looks up with a guilty look (extremely hopeful) Did you win it
Harry and Shelly exchange looks, Harry smiles, followed by Shelly Vada we have something to tell you
Harry
Harry sits down on table and looks at Vada in a matter-of- fact way Vada we have some good news, Shelly and  are getting married
Vada's expression begins to change from hopeful, to horror, but then she drops her fish Oh my fish
Vada quickly bends over to pick up the fish We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish
Vada
Would you like us to get you another goldfish
(angry) , He's fine
(less angry, talking to fish) Fish are very resilient animals you know
Don't worry,  won't get another fish
Shelly and Harry exchange worried looks, Vada doesn't seem to have understood 50    ,  , 10 ,     ' Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival and not ride the bumper cars
fall asleep at the wheel
(malicious grin) 'll ride on the bumper cars with you
Oh great Vada, come on
They run off leaving Harry to carry the teddy bear and the fish (to the attendant) Uhh, two
(to Vada) got the blue one
Vada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car Yes
Shelly gets in the blue one (pointing at Vada) am gonna get you
Vada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada the thumbs up, Vada looks  intent on brutally murdering something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the song is "Bad Moon Rising" Vada, keep your hands on the wheel
Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment
Then Vada rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't escape Vada Careful Vada, careful
Shelly
Shelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin ,       ' Vada rings the Sennett's doorbell, and Mrs Sennett answers Hi Vada
Hi, can Thomas  come out
Sure, come in
Thomas  is coming down the stairs Hi Vada
Hi, wanna ride bikes
Sure
Ohh, did you make your bed
Yes
You're sure
It's made
Come here, you've got a milk mustache
Mrs
Sennett wipes Thomas 's lip Come on, let's go
Bye Mrs
Sennett
Bye Ma
Have fun kids
The two exit the house ' , 'm running away
Where you running to
They get on their bikes and begin to ride off California, 'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch
wanna live with them too
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family
Really
, Thomas  stops and then does Vada That's it
Thomas  goes and sits down on the river bank, Vada follows with an annoyed look Get up
'm tired of running away
Besides, we past this place two times already
We're not getting nowhere
Vada sits down next to Thomas Why are you running away
My Dad gave Shelly a ring
Wow, was it a decoder ring
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring
They're getting married
Vada nods her head So now you'll have a mother
don't like her
do, she's real funny
He likes her better than me
, 'm hungry,  can't last any longer
Then go home, baby
have to anyway, my mom will be worried
Leave then, some friend you are
You can come to my house for dinner
No, 'm hiding out
Okay, seeya
Thomas  climbs down from tree, and leaves , Vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on the Sultenfuss' front lawn , As soon as Vada has entered, she waits for someone to come running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been, they were so worried etc
, Nothing happens, all she can hear is the noise that the  is making
So she opens the door again and slams it
Still nothing
She decides to give up, and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs Vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed ' In social studies we learned some people stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, think i'll sleep with my window tonight
' , Vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs Daddy daddy
Daddy
Vada runs into a room where Shelly is Daddy
Vada, Vada, what's the matter
Where's Daddy
Well he just left, what's wrong
'm hemorrhaging
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging
(very weak, scared voice) don't want,  don't need your help
Vada tries to run away, but Shelly stops her Vada, did this happen in the bathroom
Vada nods her head How old are you
'm eleven and a half
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk
They exit ' , My Mommy and Daddy did
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada
think it should be outlawed
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently
Door bell is heard ringing Oh, that's probably Thomas ,  don't wanna see him
It's not fair
Nothing happens to boys
' , Hi Vada, can you come out
dunno
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming
Vada is angered by this, she comes storming out Vada pushed Thomas  hard enough to make him fall over, she is angry Get outta here
And don't come back for five to seven days
Vada runs inside and slams the door, leaving poor Thomas sitting on the porch looking startled ' , , ,     , '  , Grammoo, 'm going to the bathroom, i'll be right back
She then gives Grammoo a little kiss, and makes her way out of the living room to the bathroom, closing the door behind her, as she goes to enter the bathroom she hears giggling coming from the next room, so she goes to investigate
Harry and Shelly are kissing and giggling
As she is watching this, Grammoo gets up, enters the funeral room and makes her way to the front, when she gets there, she picks up a rose, takes a look at the dead man, and begins to sing into the rose as if it were a microphone It's quarter to three, there's no-one in the place, just you and me
As this is being sung, Vada hears and turns around with an look on her face, Harry and Shelly also hear it and make off for the funeral room, Vada quickly retreats into the room where Harry and Shelly were, closing the door behind her So santa-macho,  got a little story you oughtta know, we're comin' my friend, to the end of a brief episode, so make it one for my baby and one more for the road
'm so sorry, it's all right ma, 'm very very sorry
' ,   , Grabs Vada by the shoulders Now what were you thinking, huh
It's your responsibility to watch her
Do you have any idea how upset those people are in there
Vada breaks free from Harry's grip, and walks briskly out of the room
Shelly looks back at Harry expectantly , Why do you think people want to get married
Well when you get older, you just have to
'm gonna marry Mr
Bixler
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law
It is not
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all 's and it won't be fair
Not true
(nervously, uncertain) Have you ever kissed anyone
Like they do on
Uh huh
No
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal
But,  don't know how
Here, practice on your arm like this
Vada brings her forearm up to her mouth and starts to kiss it, Thomas  follows Like this
Uh huh
(they kiss their arms for a while) Okay, enough practice
Close your eyes
But then  won't be able to see anything
Vada raises her fist Just do it
Okay, okay
Okay on the count of three
One
Two
Two and a half
Three
Vada leans forward and kisses Thomas  on the lips, they both look surprised, Vada then sits back against the tree, long pause Say something it's too quiet
Umm, Ummmmm (agitated) Just, hurry
Thomas  stands up and begins to say something along the lines of
On political agents to the flag of the United States of America, Vada stands up and joins in & And to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, individual, with liberty and justice for all
When they finish, they both still look a little uncomfortable , You better not tell anyone
You better not either
Well, let's spit on it
Okay
Both of them raise their hands to their mouths and spit on them, they then shake hands and when finished wipe them off on their trousers Seeya tomorrow
Okay, seeya
(Vada starts off down the road) Vada
What
Would you think of me
For what
Well if you don't get to marry Mr
Bixler
Vada smiles, and gets on her bike guess
As Vada rides off, Thomas  smiles Thomas  comes across the beehive, inspects it and then kicks it, he waits and then once he is adamant that there is no danger, he begins to search for Vada's mood ring, he searches, and as he does so, bees begin to swarm, he finds the mood ring, and by the time he notices that there are bees everywhere, it is too late
(as he finds the mood ring) Yes
(reacting to the bees) Ow, ahh,
, Get away
We see Thomas 's glasses fall off onto the ground , ' , , policeman enters, takes his hat off and explains what has happened to Thomas  to Harry, who becomes clearly very distressed ' ,    , Hi Vada
Hi
What are you doing
Feeding my fish
Is that the fish you won at the carnival
Yes
He's getting big
(sad pause) Vada, come here and sit down for a minute
Vada sits down next to her Dad Vada, something happened to Thomas  last night, he stepped on a beehive
(beginning to look worried) told him not to tease those bees
Did he get stung
Harry nods Maybe  should go over and yell at him
No sweetheart, you can't
(looking very worried) Why not
He was allergic to bees
(extremely worried) He's okay isn't he
(shakes head, near tears) There were just too many of 'em
When Vada hears this, her eyes begin to flood with tears and the expression on her face changes movingly, it looks as though she just lost the most special and important part of her life
And she has Dr
Welty
Dr
Welty
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart
can't breathe, 'm suffocating
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look
Dr
Welty lifts Vada up onto bed It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop
What Hurts Vada
The bee stings
can't breathe
' , ,   ' , ,    ' Knocks Vada
View shifts to inside Vada's bedroom, where she is curled up in a little ball on her bed 'm leaving some food for you by the door, in case you get hungry
Vada remains where she is, the doorbell rings , Hi
Hi, is Vada home
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone
Oh, 'm Judy,  go to school with her, wanted to tell her 'm sorry about Thomas
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days
Will you tell her  came by
Sure
Thank you
Bye
Bye
Shelly closes the door Hi Harry
Ahh, Reverand Miles
The Sennetts want to thank you for taking care of things so quickly
, ' , (knocks) Vada
see you took your tray in, Vada is looking out her blinds at all the black cars and people dressed in black entering her house Maybe you should come down for the funeral, sometimes it helps
Vada
' ,        , She won't come out
It's been a whole day
You have to do something Harry
The funeral's starting
Shelly is now very emotional Open your eyes, she's eleven years old
Her only friend in the world is dead
know that, but what do you want from me
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry
When first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when saw a family lived here,  thought, "if 'm living without a family, at least  can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper
" Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive
'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people
But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter
Arthur enters Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about to begin
Thank you Arthur
Shelly exits , We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett
He was born, May 7 1961, in Madison, Pennsylvania, and he was survived by his loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett
(fades as camera changes) , The minister is heard to say this in the background The family has asked me to say a few words before we proceed
No words that  could say, would begin to describe the loss and grieving, one word that keeps ringing in my ear is Why
Why would God choose to take this little boy from us
can't give you an answer to that question, but  can tell you that God has chosen Thomas  for some very special reason, we must find solace in knowing that Thomas  is now in Gods care
In that face, there is no sorrow such as
The ministers words fade into the very moving music ,  , Vada stops and sits on a step where she can look through and see Thomas  lying in his coffin, she begins to cry , disciples began to chastise them, and Jesus said "Let the children come to me, do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these
(the minister notices Vada coming around the front of the room) He laid his hands on their heads before he left that place, let us pray in silence
Vada has made it right up to the coffin, which she leans over and crying, says the following Wanna go tree climbing Thomas
' His face hurts, and where is his glasses
He can't see without his glasses
Put his glasses on
(Harry and Shelly are rapidly approaching Vada, Shelly takes hold of her and tries to pull her away) Put on his glasses
He was gonna be an acrobat
He's gone sweetheart
He's gone
Get away, get away
Vada breaks away from Harry's grip and runs out of the room, followed closely by Harry and Shelly ,      , Vada wait
Vada
Vada
Harry stops running after Vada as she sprints off down the road Vada arrives at Mr
Bixler's house Vada
was just on my way to your house
Are you all right
'm so sorry about Thomas
Vada covers her ears and begins to sing "doo-wah-diddy- diddy" Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay
We won't talk about him all right
(crying) Justin and Ronda say that  should tell people what  feel
(nods) Come here, sit down over here
The two of them sit down on Mr
Bixler's porch Vada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop Mr
Bixler, (emotional pause) love you
Oh, Vada
love you like my Dad loves Shelly
wanna live here
Pause as he takes all this in  think your Dad would miss you
No he wouldn't,  can't go home
woman appears at Mr
Bixler's front door 'll be ready in a second,  just can't seem to find my other earring
Suzanne, this is Vada
(comes over to Vada and crouches) Vada, hi, 'm really sorry
Could you just give us a minute
Yeah
Suzanne goes back inside Who's that
That's Suzanne
(pause) She and  are gonna be married this Fall
As soon as Vada hears this, she reacts, shaking her head and backing off No
was gonna bring her to class next week
wanted to hear your poem
Oh Vada, please honey  cared for him too, Vada please
Vada, Vada sweetheart don't
Get away from me
Vada runs off down the road ,    '  , Vada is climbing around in the tree, clearly trying to get somewhere of significance ' Why do you think people wanna get married
' When you get old, you just have to
Vada pulls out her photo of her mother ' Who's that with your Dad
' It's my mother
' 'm gonna be an acrobat when  grow up
(pause) Vada, would you think of me
Well if you don't get to marry Mr
Bixler
' Now we're blood brothers for life
Vada gets out to the end of a branch, and makes a daring jump to another, had she fallen she would be dead ' , , Shelly 'm sorry but we haven't found her yet
It's dark, she can't be alone in the dark
We'll keep looking
We, no, we've been looking since this morning, her teacher called, and he said that she went there first
know,  know you told us
But
Shelly is cut off as the door opens and in walks a very shaken Vada Vada
Are you okay
(Vada nods) Oh God
Shelly embraces Vada ' ,       ' , ' should have told Thomas  that he was my best friend
'm sure he knew
Shelly puts a nightie on Vada Shelly,  stole some money from your cookie jar, to pay for the writing class
Shelly ponders this for a moment It's okay sweetheart
'll pay it back, besides,  don't think i'll ever go to class again
'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing
will  promise
Okay, get in to bed
Vada gets into bed and extends her arms to Shelly, they hug each other, Vada has finally accepted Shelly Goodnight
Goodnight
Shelly exits and turns off the lights , (sitting on stairs) She's in
' Harry enters, walks over and kisses Vada, then turns around and begins to exit Did  kill my mother
What
The bees killed Thomas , and  killed my mother
No, no
Harry pulls up a chair and sits down next to Vada No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things like that aren't anybody's fault, it just happened
Vada pulls out the photo of Harry and Vada's Mom from under her pillow found this
forgot about that picture, where did you find it
In the garage
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car
What was my mama like
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes
Oh boy did she love to laugh
Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her
Really
Uh huh
You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you
She came home and painted this whole room pink
She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl
Do you miss her
Yes,  did, very much for a long time, and even now,  get a little sad when  think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked
think every time  see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas
That's good, memories are good sweetheart
Vada, 'm sorry;  was trying to keep it from you,  just couldn't
You're a good girl, and want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me
(Vada puts the photo back under her pillow, Harry gets up and kisses her) Seeya in the morning
Harry begins to leave room Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you
,   , Harry makes his way out of the cafe to talk to Mrs
Sennett Mrs
Sennett, how are you doing
Some days  think i'll be okay, others, well have to force myself even to get out of bed, know it's crazy, but sometimes  think he's just away at summer camp
How's Vada
Oh she's doing much better
Ahh she's just inside
(walks over to entrance) Vada, who is inside talking to someone, hears and comes outside Mrs
Sennett
(she runs and gives her a hug) Vada
've been wanting to come over to see you, (she reaches inside her purse and gets out something, it is Vada's mood ring) Thomas  had this on him,  thought you might like to have it
Vada slides the ring onto her finger, the ring is You were such a good friend to him,  hope you'll still come by and visit me
will,  promise
Mrs
Sennett looks at Harry as if to say good-bye, and then walks off slowly Mrs
Sennett
(she stops and turns around to look at Vada) Thomas  will be all right, my mother will take care of him
Thank you Vada
She then turns and walks off , (reading from book) Encased in talent, like a uniform, the rank of every poet, is well known
They can amaze us like a thunderstorm, or die so young, or live for years alone
My advice to you on our last class, be a thunderstorm
What exactly do you mean by that
mean, be dangerous (Vada enters the back of the room) And unpredictable
And make a lot of noise
Mr
Bixler sees Vada Vada
As Vada is noticed, she goes around getting hugged by everyone Hey, we missed you man
Gimme a hug
Vada gives Justin a hug, she then proceeds towards Mr
Bixler was hoping you'd stop by today
Vada and Mr
Bixler hug each other can't stay,  just came to read my poem
We'd love to hear it
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But  know he'll always be in your heart
There is a long pause as it sinks in, everybody remains silent, then just before the scene changes, the Temptations song "My Girl" begins to play , Hi Judy
Hi Vada
' Things are a little better these days; finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and are gonna be in the same home room and the republican party just re-nominated Mr
Nixon
