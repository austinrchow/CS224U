And what was this
'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway
This is "Fly With Us
" It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but  can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too
think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake
So, just to clarify, 'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles -- That's it
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases
don't know
mean:  don't know
,  , Barry hears this, gets distracted, then back to the phone call; Can  call you back if  have any further questions
Can  get your extension
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back
Ok
Thank you
He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse
It's fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc
Products seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc) He lifts a   and   , he's silhouette
follows him out
stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks down towards the street
his business is situated at the end of a common driveway, shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto mechanic
distant  of a car  and
hold, then: a   comes  into , far off at the mouth of the alley, on the street
The  ends up landing
Barry flinches a little, stares
the  sits idle for a moment
then it drives off
then: speeding, small  comes into view at the mouth of the alley, screeching to a halt
The passenger side door opens and a small, wooden  (like a portable organ) is placed on the ground
The  speeds away
a moment or two later another -  flies past very fast
Barry squints, looks at the small  sitting alone in the middle of the street
He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside his warehouse
: '  - Barry on the phone again; 'm not exactly sure what that means
If they break or something
What is it, plastic
It's a plastic, yeah
Right
Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, 'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and 'll give you a call back -- Did you have my home phone number
For what
If you wanted to call me back could
'm fine,  have your work number
Ok
because of the time difference if you needed to call me early
It's fine
can just get you at your office
Ok
Ok, bye, bye
Bye
He hangs up the phone and walks outside,  follows him again, out to the alley, over his shoulder
he looks down the length of the alley at the Harmonium
, : small   pulls into the driveway, around the Harmonium, parks
a young woman named (Emily Watson) exits the car and starts to walk down the length of the alley towards him
stays over his shoulder and turns into a profile 2-shot; Hi
Do you work at the mechanic
No
They're not open yet
They don't get opened until eight
Barry gently steps back and out of the
Is it ok if  leave my car you think
don't know
thought they opened at seven
(beat) If  left my car would it be ok
don't know
Do you know them
Not very well
Can  ask you, can  trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them
Ok
You think it's ok where  left it, right there
think that'll be fine
Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into , : There's a piano in the street
Yeah
Ok
Maybe 'll see you later
Thank you for your help
Thank you
Maybe 'll see you later, when pick up my car
Ok
She walks away
he starts back inside the warehouse, hesitates, watches her go
right before she reaches the end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her shoulder
he dodges inside real quick
then he steps back out
looks off at the Harmonium
and the empty street
he looks around some more
then he makes the long walk down the street
Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around, both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards his business
He brings it into his office and places it on his desk
He tries a few keys
pressing down
there's no sound
He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and a small note is made
he does it again
and holds the note
-  - Barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his office
He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound
Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows
He pumps the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another
then stands up into
and presses the 5 note melody
:
Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: , who enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him; Hey, good morning, Barry
Hey
Lance
can
You ok
Yes 'm fine
Why you wearin' a suit
Um
bought one
thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can  show you something
Yeah

yes
They enter into the office, Lance sees the harmonium; What is this
don't know
think it's a piano
a small piano
That's not a piano
have a piano at home
where'd you get it
Lance walks around behind the harmonium
leaving Barry alone
towards the warehouse
he starts to back up a little
Well
it was dropped on the street
Sal, Ernesto and Rico all start to come into work behind Barry
he sees them:  pushes in on Barry
() Why is it here
Barry
Barry
it just
don't know don't know
Punch-drunk Love Movie (maybe color blooms/overture here) /  - pushes in slow as Barry and Lance talk to about the plungers which are on display in front of them
They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc; You do guaranteed sale
etc
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor
In the b
g
,  over the laud speaker says: Barry, your sister's on line one
Barry doesn't move
Yes
we do ask for
30 to 60 days
think you have a call
Rico turns around, without loudspeaker; Barry, your sister is on line one
They look at him a moment
'm just gonna grab this call real quick
,
Barry turns and heads for the phone nearby at Rico's station; (into phone) This is Barry
Hey it's me, it's Rhonda
Are you coming to the party tonight
Hi, Rhonda, yes  am
Bye
She hangs up
Ok
Yes 'll see you tonight
Barry takes a few steps back to the Customers: Sorry about that: One thing wanted to point out, Dave, is that we've just received a large order from the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas where we're going to be supplying their hotel rooms with the dice and money plunger, so these babies are really moving well right now
(over loudspeaker) Barry, your sister's on line two
Barry, your sister's on line two
Barry tries again to ignore it
With the Aqua Blast Whales and Speed Boats we're gonna ask for a display at eye level for the little kids
Barry -- -- excuse me
Barry walks back to the phone; This is Barry
Hey it's me, what are you doing
Hello, Karen

Yeah but what are you doing

"chat
" 'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight
Yes, 'll be there
Fine
You get back to chatting with your precious customers
Ok, bye-bye
Barry snaps out of this, turns, claps his hands in confidence and walks back to the customers and says: Sorry about that
didn't know you had a sister
Well yes  do
(beat) But one more thing  wanted to tell you guys about the new plungers is that we're making the handles now in a non-breakable material called
He takes one of the plungers and to demonstrate smacks it on the table
it  and rice falls out everywhere
Ok
this is one of the old ones, think
Lance do we have any new plungers around
Lance moves to get a new plunger
That was a little embarrassing and that was one of the old handles so let me get a new one to show you -- (loudspeaker) Barry, your sister is on line one
Barry holds, then; How many sisters do you have
have seven
#2 Holy shit
You have seven sisters
They're calling because we're having a party tonight for my sister and the they're just calling
can you hang on for just two more minutes
Barry walks this time into his office
tracks with Barry to his office, seeing him try and shake this off
He
: -  - Barry enters, takes a quick moment to size up the harmonium
He picks up the phone and through the conversation gently moves the harmonium to a different spot on the desk; This is Barry

It's fine
The mechanic keeps walking

Hello

Yes, indeed, yes  am
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that  think is really cute and really cool and want you to meet her so  was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight

She's my friend and you should meet her
You'd like her
Yeah, but please don't do that
'm not really asking you, 'm telling you
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to

She stares him down
All 'm trying to do is be your friend
She leaves
He air punches/twitch
: - /  - Barry is alone, closing up
He takes a look at the Harmonium and presses it, makes a sound
a little bit more
makes a few notes
as it blends and fades into the notes that Barry plays
He closes its small cover, does something on his desk and then: His face gets bright red, he holds back tears, opens his mouth and has a serious but small burst of overwhelming emotion and then it's over
- Barry's hands reaches in and picks a birthday card
, ,
Barry grabs the card and starts to push his cart
but he pushes it straight into a     who's pushing a cart around
they slam into each other
Barry apologizes
the  just takes off
Barry's cart now has a slightly damaged wheel that wobbles like crazy
,
tracks left to right with Barry as he heads for the Healthy Choice Frozen Dinner
He grabs one
He looks at box
'  - Slow zoom in
The sticker reads: "Fly Away With Us
The More You Buy The More You Earn
" ,
tracks along right to left with Barry as he moves towards some
He grabs one, inspects it
then puts it back
It's put back on the shelf:  down to price: 79 cents
Barry turns his cart around and  right into someone else again, screwing up another wheel on his cart
,
, tracks alongside him, left to right as he comes across:
The price: 4/$1
00
in the middle of the aisle
He reacts
smiles
holds
thinks
looks around, then starts to load up on the pudding
,
He pushes       over to the who's on his knees, stacking milk
Barry kneels down,
as he speaks sotto; Hello
Hello, sir
My name is Barry Egan and 'd like to ask if you have any more Healthy Choice pudding in the back
: '  - The door opens slowly and Barry peers his head around and into the house very cautiously,    and slightly  to reveal:
Barry's   are all there, preparing dinner and talking away
they turn and see him; There he is
Do you remember when we used to call you gay and you'd get all mad
-- we were calling you gay and you got so mad that you threw a hammer through the sliding glass door -- do you remember
don't really remember that
Yes you do
We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad
Yes, yes, right
We're trying to remember why you had the hammer in the first place
um
The hammer that you threw
why did you have it
You don't remember -- you had the hammer and you threw it --

Why did you have it
Another sister, , enters from behind, Barry jumps, says: He was building a ramp for the dog
He was making a ramp for the dog
That's right
That's right
ramp for the dog
And you just threw the hammer
(to Rhonda) Happy Birthday, Rhonda
Thank you
Thank you so much, Barry
She gives him a very quick hug and kiss and sets the cake next to a bigger, cooler looking cake
Mia approaches holding a baby
Barry tries to say hello to the baby, but Mia slowly turns the baby out of Barry's grasp
making herself the center of his attention; / , Barry gets slightly turned around trying to reach the baby
and ends up in a doorway that leads to the dining room, revealing himself to: , , There are also:    ' (, ) Hey

Hello everyone
steps up and greets him; Did you think that we'd all be looking at you

Ok

Business is very food, thanks
What's very food
What
You just said very food

She couldn't come  said

Elizabeth leaves,
everyone is still chatting a bit about "Barry gay boy," and "the girl that was gonna be here that Barry wouldn't allow
" ,
Barry is standing in front of the floor to ceiling sliding glass doors
in an , he , he turns back, they are all staring straight at him in silence
, : In unison they all go ape shit: '
: '  -  - It's later and  and  walk down a small hall and into a kids room
They're  for a few moments as the slowly pushes in and towards the room
Following sotto; What's up

Yeah

Barry, 'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think  can give you

Maybe you know other doctors
Like a psychiatrist

You want a number for a psychiatrist,  can get you one, that's not a problem
but what exactly is wrong
don't know if there's anything wrong with me because  don't know how other people are
Sometimes cry a lot
for no reason
Barry starts to cry
Walter just stares at his
Barry stops, recuperates, then leaves
as he does; Please don't tell my sisters

Barry is somehow dressed in a complete with
He wakes up, looks down and sees this, confused; Whassis

what
was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money
It could be really easy
mean, have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff -- Barry hangs up the phone real fast
He doesn't move
: ' / - / ( ) behind Barry, as he walks through the warehouse, greets the boys, says hello to Lance, etc
Lance, taking his cue from Barry, is a bit more dressed up today
Good morning, Barry
Hi, Lance
What's with all this pudding, what is this
sees that all the pudding Barry bought has been stacked neatly in a corner
Barry stops dead in his tracks to explain; That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous
'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines -- You're goin' on a trip
No
but airline miles are just like a currency these days
You should go on a trip
No thanks
So what should  do with the pudding
Let's just leave it there for now
Barry goes into his office and looks at the Harmonium
He presses some keys, makes a little more noise with it
(a quarter of some sort of melody starts here
) ,
Barry is cutting up his   with some scissors
He throws it away
,
Barry paces around a little bit
stays inside and watches him as he walks outside for a moment, looks around
he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges back inside the warehouse -- -- once inside, he takes a horrendous, hurtful fall over something
He stands up quick; This is not supposed to be here
Seriously
Carlos, Carlos, this is really not supposed to be here don't mean to be a dick; but that's gonna hurt someone
It already did hurt someone: It hurt me, so please let's move that
He backs away, then steps
a moment later (his sister) and  (from the opening) enter the warehouse, walking towards Barry; (to Lena) He's wearing a suit again,  don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that -- It's fine
pushes in towards  and blends to 30fps
she smiles, looks ahead,  slowly pans a 180 around to become her
Barry is standing near the harmonium, fiddling around
He looks up, sees Elizabeth and Lena walking towards him and tenses
they meet in the middle of the warehouse; Hey, what are you doing
Why are you wearing a suit again
don't know
Hi
Hi
Do you remember me,  left my car, yesterday
Yes  do
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work
We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go
We're gonna go and eat, let's go
Yeah  can't
Why
have work,  can't leave
Seriously, though: We're going to eat,  said
'm sorry
It's ok
That's alright
Are you learning how to play the piano
What is that
It's not a piano
() 'll tell you later
You don't wanna come to eat with us
What's all this pudding
don't know
Can you hang on a second
follows Barry as he walks back to his little office, picks up the phone; Hello
We got disconnected before
No
No
We got disconnect -- why
you're calling me at work
how did you get this number --
See the thing is  could make it really easy on you --  already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff
This is so awkward asking like this, 'm sorry -- This makes me very uncomfortable
need help
Should  just ask your girlfriend
(beat) Maybe  should call back and talk to your girlfriend
don't have a girlfriend -- -- you said you did
know  did
But  don't
You lied to me
didn't lie
Why did you tell me you did, then
This is
illegal
'll call the police
No you won't
, 'll go pay for my car
Are you sure
Yeah
He's being weird, 'm sorry
have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit -- It's not bad, it's ok
-- he's so strange  don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, said 'd try, but it's just -- It's ok, it's alright
'll come right back, 'll just go pay for my car
Sorry
She leaves
Elizabeth heads for Barry's office; ,  on the phone Come on,  thought we had fun, rich boy -- This is not cool
It was cool last night
have to go
Are you telling me no
No 'm sorry, now  have to get off the phone
this is your mistake
Elizabeth comes walking into his office, starts whispering to him as he's on the phone; Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right
(into phone) 'm gonna call you back
He starts to hang up the phone, turns to Elizabeth as we hear; (trailing off) ,
She is
think, why did you come here like this
It's not cool
It's fine, but -- -- do you think you'll ask her out
feel really on the spot now
Are you gonna do it
don't do that
don't - things like that
You don't do anything, why are you being scared
'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if  do this -- 'm not gonna rag you
Why would do this just to rag you
don't know
'll leave then, 'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure
Can  ask you a serious question: What
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink
(beat) Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink
What's wrong with you
Are you ok
didn't ask him that
He's lying
You're being weird again, see
Come on

We should be going -- (over her shoulder) Yeah, no,  have to get something from my car,  said
Barry and Lena about to be alone as Lance walks up; Which guy in Toledo are you talking about
'll tell you
the guy

You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn
have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok
He walks away, Lena turns to him; 'm sorry  couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and couldn't make it -- It's fine
It was fun, though
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters
No
Not at all
It's nice
() Telephone, Barry Line One
Barry turns instantly and walks away
he turns back as he walks
- track left with him
(turns back) One second, sorry
, He picks up the phone
Hello
Hang up again and see the trouble it's gonna make
Barry instantly hangs up the phone, turns around and walks back to Lena; Business is good, you're busy
Yeah, not really
saw a picture of you
Yes
Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice
Do you have brothers or sisters
No
'm the exact opposite -- That must be nice
That must be really, really, really great
It's terrible, no
No response from Barry
(cut to reverse 2-shot as they look) What do you do with all this pudding
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here
That pudding's not mine
In the b
g
, two  are dealing with getting a large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using a fork lift
in an instant the large  tumbles to the ground and
Barry attempts to not notice this; Oh My God
It's ok
That's ok
How long have you worked with Elizabeth
The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena; Six months, maybe five, five or six months
do you wanna check that
(to the guys) Are you guys hurt
/ No, no, we're ok
Barry, sorry -- (back to Lena) So you do what she does, the same work, the same job
do, but  do field consultations mainly too which is cool because get to travel
travel
lot of the time
'm going to Hawaii on Friday
That's great -- Hawaii
was thinking about going there
Really
was, yeah,  was thinking about going there for business -- -- well, if you're gonna go -- -- 'm probably not gonna go though
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something -- -- yeah that would be great, if was gonna go but 'm not exactly sure,  have so much goin on here --  lot depends on this thing might do here and if that happens can't go and if it doesn't happen then  probably will, but  doubt it
There's another   as they try to reposition the box that's fallen, giving way to something else that
In other words, to correct the mistake they've already made, they have to sacrifice another  that
She looks, Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight ahead;  ( ) with Elizabeth, comes walking back in
says to Barry: can't find that thing in my car, can't find it so 'll just get it and give it to you later
So
(to Elizabeth) You ready
Are you coming to eat with us
Yeah  can't
(at the crates) Look at that
(to Barry) It was great to meet you again
To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday -- Ok
(to Barry) What's all this pudding
It's not mine
Why's it here

And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something

Ok
Lena gets into her car
Elizabeth keeps walking
She waits until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight back into the warehouse
: - She comes walking in and over to Barry; 'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me
Sure
Do you want to pick me up
Sure
Can  write down my address and phone number for you
Sure
They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this there is even more    in the b

, by the boys -- Barry and Lena settle up and say so long
This is funny
Yeah
didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else
Also: This pudding is not mine
Also: 'm wearing a suit because  had a very important business meeting this morning and  don't have a crying problem
Ok
Alright

Hi
She walks off

whatever
that's not cool
David, Don't
Just
Seriously
It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense
Ok
It's business
Seriously
One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house
'm serious now
Ok
Please
Now
Just stop
He hands him a set of  and goes through the info; keys for the track
You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that
His address
We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe -- Uch
Shut up, Dean
What's the problem
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy
" Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster -- He makes a very     towards her and she Flinchy
That's what  thought
Shut up
(to Greg) Call me when you see this guy -- check him out see what's what
She asked him for seven fifty when she was on the phone with him, so -- just call me when you get there
He hands him another piece of paper and a photo; This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it,  don't know exactly where this is and don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out
It's a '61  Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but  need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it
So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then 'll head down there and check it out
Ok
That's it
Can we maybe ask for more money on this
Why
because it's California
mean it's like a nine or ten hour drive
It's not like going to Salt Lake and getting the Mormon's, it's different

The Security Guard calls up to Lena's place
and we watch Lena answer the phone
The Security Guard gives Barry some very complicated directions
we follow/lead Barry as he makes his way through the maze/up elevators/down corridors looking for Lena's apartment
Finally, he arrives, knocks; Who is it
It's Barry
As she opens the door, standing; Hi
: - Lena and Barry at a table
They talk (see notes
) So  want to tell you something, gotta tell you:  saw a picture of you guys, your sisters and you and saw your picture and  really wanted to meet you
(beat) came to drop my car off there on purpose, to try and meet you
Barry leans a little bit out of
really
That's nice
are you lying
thought  should tell you didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something -- He leans slightly back in
That's very nice
Thank you
Thank you for saying that
(beat) You're friends with my sister
Yeah
How long have you known her
About six months
You like her
Yeah
Yeah we get along well
(beat) You didn't get along with her very well
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that
No, no
did
That's nice
It's nice
(beat) 've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies
Do you remember all that pudding
Yeah
So that pudding was bought, bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines
It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products
They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing
Yeah
'm sorry
lost my thoughts, what  was saying
You were talking about the promotion -- -- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon
So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1
79 - that's a pretty good deal
but then  noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can
and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup
Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label
That's those little bar codes, you know
The universal product codes
Yeah
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles
Add in the coupon: it's one thousand
You see
Yeah
You see
Yeah, no,  see -- You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles
That's insane
That is really, really crazy
That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding
yeah
So that was your pudding
No
'm sorry
thought you said -- No  didn't say that
thought you said you bought all that pudding -- My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me
It's his
It's his pudding, he's doing it
It's not mine
He's crazy
told him not to do it
He's the one who's insane
He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though -- Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window
Is that right
You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door
Barry starts to   , which he hides very quickly, holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his nose, and then he smiles; don't remember that, she might be lying
have to go the bathroom
He gets up and goes
: - Barry walks in and goes a little crazy
He's mad at himself and he  a stall
it seems loose already and falls straight to the floor
This makes him go crazier and he continues to  and the shit out of the bathroom/stall
He collects himself and then he hesitates, looks around, tries to collect the bathroom but it's in ruins, he exits
: - Barry comes back and sits down, seems a little better
Tries to be a little flirtatious for half a moment before: the comes over, leans in carefully; Hello
& Hi
Sir, can  talk to you
Why
Just have you for one second, please
He looks to Lena, excuses himself
,
The Manager and Barry step away, in a quiet section of the restaraunt, 2-shot, profile, in sotto;
Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart
Yeah
Did you do it
No
You didn't just smash up the bathroom
No
Well who did
don't know
You're hand is bleeding
cut myself
How
On my knife
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom
didn't do that
Why
what
Your hand is bleeding
know
'm gonna have to ask you to leave
Why
Sir,  have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom -- didn't do it
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave
You're gonna have to go
Yeah, but  didn't do anything
'm gonna call the police then, sir
Please don't do this to me
The police are on their way
Sorry
He starts to move back
Can  pay you here
Can  pay you for our drinks and salad
That's fine
Barry takes out some money and hands it over
Keep the change, please
,
They walk back to the table and Barry whispers down to her, very close,  (leads them out - continuous) We should go  think,  don't like it here
Ok
They head out of the restaraunt
Is everything ok
Yes
What happened
Nothing
What did he want
Nothing
They walk a bit

Ok

You don't think you'll go -- don't know

violently
Whoa

it's just tremendous when you think about how most people just don't look
they don't
they're not looking at the fine print, Lance
: /  - They're unloading the pudding which comes in packets of three, but Barry and Lance are taking them out of those packets and handing them to the    one by one

What is this, man
'm sorry
Are you serious with this
Yes
Sorry
Well

: '  - pushes in quick, Barry on the phone; No, no, no, no, no

Then: Now are you threatening me, dick
