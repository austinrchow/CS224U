Written by Clean Shooting Draft February 1992 In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing approach of two sets of footsteps
There is the sound of a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies
Two from one gun, one from another
So fast and close, they're barely distinguish- able
The sound of the   against concrete walls and dies away
Silence

His life ebbs as he slides slowly down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face down on the  cement floor

Klingman, a handsome, 50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil
There is no movement
The two men are lying near the right front fender of a black limousine
Blood spreads from the body of the hit man, a few yards away
Klingman starts to raise himself up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still alert for any further threat

-                                    2 Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a  showroom
Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all the  sets are showing the same picture, the glittering image of a woman singing
(We will recognize the woman as Rachel Marron
) We cut tighter and tighter on the image until it is almost broken up into its scanning lines
Through the city noise comes the sound of her song " have Nothing

'  -   -                     2A battered old desk
Scattered across the top -- a pile of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of magazines, a pair of scissors, a  remote control, softly in the b

, a  is playing the same image we saw in the store window, the same song
Hands appear
Male hands
They open a drawer and remove a pair of translucent rubber gloves
Carefully they put the gloves on
The  of the rubber is the only sound
The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars
They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors headline on the cover reads: " ' " The scissors start to cut
Meticulously they excise the name " " from the page
With the care of a surgeon

-                             3 tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies
Arms stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones are thrust forward
deafening cacophony of "Rachel
Rachel
Rachel
Over here
Over here
This way, Rachel
Rachel
Rachel
" We cannot see the object of this frenzy
We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive, well-dressed young woman (), exiting with the other celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside by the mass of surging fans and media
Her face is calm and impassive as she watches from the sidelines

'   -                          5 In a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint- ings that reflect Klingman's success as an arbitrageur, he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with Farmer

Your hands ever shake, Frank
Sometimes
It's just adrenaline
How did you know
saw him washing the car
saw him
They don't wash cars on the parking levels
He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it
You know, 'd like you to stay on
He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank
'm not good in permanent positions, my feet go to sleep
The two men smile at each other
They raise their glasses in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks
Frank doesn't

-   -                       6 The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word "" onto a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom note
Each word has been cut from a different page and is in a different typeface
The note is being assembled with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance and is quite easy to read
It reads: -- 7

Excited fans
Pieces of paper, autograph books, notes are thrust forward  the
Again, a mass chanting "Rachel

" Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered items
In , we see Rachel's hands signing "Best wishes, 4
Rachel Marron" on an out-stretched open palm
In the midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be- ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend ",

Frank gets out of a cab with two suitcases
His house is a modest stucco affair on a small lot
He goes up the walk and puts down his suit- cases
He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass
Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep
He picks up a few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain
As the door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail inside
Frank's feet push the letters aside and go inside
The door shuts

'  -                               10 Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table in a breakfast nook
bottle of red wine is open with a glass beside it
At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and reads a Time magazine
He adds a splash of wine
He lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat
At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently eats another piece of meat
Finally he sets the pot on the plate and eats from it directly while glancing through the magazine
11
-  -        11 Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room
There's a loud buzz of excited chatter
Hands are stack- ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the mirror
Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll with its embroidered ribbon message ",
" Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers resting on the small portable  set
On the screen is an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging applause, bowing

'  -   -                  12 Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun- glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side
Strains of "'   " come from a beat-up transistor An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back and forth over the freshly cut grass
Throwing knives lay scattered nearby
wooden post is  sticking out of the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard
, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well
He's Rachel's personal manager
So, you won't protect Rachel Marron just because she's in show business
don't do celebrities
But the biggest money's in show business people
Frank says nothing
His  eyes are  closed behind the sun- glasses
Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives
He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it
It misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the fence
Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his eyes again
(picking up another knife) Do you really do these things
Isn't she the one who collects dolls
This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing
(exasperated) Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the most famous people in America
She's won every music award invented
She's got the number one song in the country right now and she'll probably be nominated for an Oscar in her very 6
first picture
And you want to know 'Isn't she the one
' Christ, man, where've you been
You mean she doesn't collect dolls
(defeated) Yes
She collects dolls
thought  knew who she was
Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or not
Frank's face betrays nothing
Devaney gestures with a knife
You're probably deadly with these things, aren't you
Deadly
Show me
Frank doesn't move
Why are you resisting this job
$2,000 bucks a week
(no response) $2,500
There are several good men available for that kind of money
Have you talked to Fitzgerald or Racine
Portman
Yeah
Portman was interested
He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what he takes to be the first serious talk
but we're told you're the best
There's no such thing
Farmer, we're talking about a very frightened lady
With a 7
seven-year old son
Believe me, wouldn't be here if  didn't think this was for real
(long pause) Farmer, she begged me to get you
Frank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time
He picks up five throwing knives and stands up
All right
'll come and 'll look the situation over
If  take it, it's three thousand a week
(whistles) Okay
You must be very deadly for three grand a week
Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post
He throws one of the knives
It misses the post and clatters against the fence
Shit
Devaney's face drops
Frank examines the next knife
(mumbling) know it's something like
The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc and disappears into some bushes about three feet from Devaney
Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind Frank
Sorry
Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and motions Devaney off to the side
Better not stand right behind me
Devaney smiles weakly
Frank lets the third knife go with one smooth motion
The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post
Frank's hand arching again
Throwing the remaining knives
Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical line with the first one

-   ( ) -           13 Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron driveway
' as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation and the rising grounds beyond
(: The use of the term ' , is not to be taken simply as a camera direction
Rather, it re- presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in the special way Frank sees
Frank lives by constant vigilance, heightened awareness
It is his genius and his burden
The audience must be put in the position of looking, searching, scanning with him
) He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick- ling on the back of his neck
As he looks around, a black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look
He watches it go
Frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car
He grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls
The whole gate rattles
Frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button on the intercom   box at the side of the gate
' out of the
Transmission is terrible

) Yes

) What

Plenty of potential hiding places
The mansion is at the top of the hill
The grounds behind the mansion fall away

-  /  -           15 The mansion is huge
On and on it goes
Frank drives the garage area where , the chauffeur, is polishing the mascot on the limousine
One of his arms is bandaged
Henry peers at Frank, puts down his cloth and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking
Frank gets out, looks around
painter's truck is parked nearby, two painters unloading equipment from it
Can  help you
Are you the man on the intercom
No
Can  help you
My name is Edison
have an appointment with Miss Marron
Oh
And that was arranged by
(impressed) Mr
Devaney
Go right ahead, Mr
Edison
What happened to your arm
(looking at his arm) doll
He goes back to the limousine
Frank  the , although the door is not shut
, a fiftyish housekeeper, appears
man in cover- alls comes out past her, carrying a length of timber

Henry Ford, to see Mr
Devaney
Come in, please

-                                   16 Frank steps into the foyer with Emma
She is a warm, matronly woman who does a fine job running the house without standing on custom
'll tell you quite honestly, Mr
Ford,  don't know where Mr
Devaney is
Did he say he'd be here
Yes
Then he probably is
Let me look
She leads Frank into a large, unused formal parlor
There are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being repainted
On a number of  screens scattered around, Rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening titles) is continuously playing
The sound of the song itself -- "  " -- comes softly from concealed speakers
Please make yourself at home
Can get you anything
Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer
Frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in the opposite direction
It's obviously undergoing a major redecoration
Painters, decorators and designers come and go, oblivious to Frank's presence
17
-   -                   17 The deeper Frank walks into the house, the warmer and more lived-in rooms appear
18
-   -                        18 Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool area
One wall is all glass
On the opposite wall are shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career: Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records, other statuettes and plaques
Among the framed photo- graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc
, is one of her and 11
her small son, , dressed in a tuxedo
Both are goofing off for the camera with obvious affection
Frank looks down at the pool
' Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven- year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph, dark-haired and fragile
He is crouched at the side of the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long speedboat which is cutting across the water
nanny sits, some way off, embroidering
Frank's attention is distracted
heavier comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy
Frank follows the sound
19
-                                      19 Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is coming from
It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth
It is packed with people, props and video equipment
There is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized chaos
out
group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance number for a music video, directed by their choreographer Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end of the room
video cameraman circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a large-screen  behind them
In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video
Several people are stand- ing around, tending to the video and playback gear
All the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions
As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel chair turns to reveal Devaney
He waves to Frank and makes his way over to him
On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his late thirties rises to look at Frank
He has a twenty inch neck
Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right
The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down
Frank looks around the room
shelf laden with vitamins
Guitars of various makes
flute
gold record being used as a coaster
People smoking and chatting through the rehearsal
12
In one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties (, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting
She glances occasionally at the  dancers
man sits next to a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at the other end of the line
The music climaxes and abruptly stops
The dancers hold their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again
The  from the front sofa is loudest
Then
From elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the (
) Playback, everybody
Rachel's voice comes from the sofa
(
) Come here, Rory
The choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from sight
Sound of kissing, laughter
The video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather round it expectantly
(
) Sugar, that's gonna be great love the ending
Devaney moves to the front of the room
The behind him
There are several overlapping conversations going on
Rachel
(
) Nicki, how'd you like the number
You like the end routine
(
) Rachel
You wanna see it back from the beginning or just the ending
, responds to Rachel's question
It was just great, Rory
But Rachel is already replying to the video director
13
(
) wanna see it all
Tony
'll bet Tony loved it
The brawny man, Tony, shrugs and stands to look at Frank as he speaks
Ehh
(
) Don't worry, Rory
Tony doesn't appreciate great art
The pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachel's approval, elbowing Devaney a little to one side
(showing the costume) What do you think, Rachel
Rachel, Frank Farmer is
(
) Devaney, do you think this is me
(not looking) It's terrific
Devaney is now facing the unseen Rachel
Rachel, Frank Farmer is here
Devaney nods in Frank's direction
Nicki looks at Frank
(
) Who's here
Frank Farmer
(getting no response) The bodyguard
(
) think Rory should be my bodyguard
(to dress designer) Let's see the back again
Rachel, raise your butt out of there and meet this man
finally rises from the sofa
It's a bit of 14
a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old
young woman
Not beautiful, not ugly
Unique only in that she is immediately interesting
Superstar
Well, 'm up
Rachel and Frank look across the room at each other
Frank comes forward
Frank Farmer, Rachel Marron
Rachel offers her hand and they shake
Rachel looks him up and down
You don't look like a bodyguard
What did you expect
don't know
Tough guy maybe
This is my disguise
(smiling) Well, his timing's good
This is Nicki, Rachel's sister and personal secretary
Nice to meet you, Mr
Farmer
(indicating) Tony Scibelli
Tony nods but makes no move to shake hands
Rachel dismisses the Dress Designer
(to designer) The back's still not right
, still on the phone, offers a perfunctory wave
Sy Spector, Rachel's publicist
15
Can we get you a drink
Orange juice
Straight
Nicki
Nicki goes to the bar
Rachel sits and motions for Frank to sit opposite her
Rory, 'll be with you in a second
Rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big screen video
Listen, this whole thing is Bill's idea
This sudden obsession with protecting me
Tony has always handled my security and we've done just fine
(
) (into the phone) Yes, 'll hold but not long
(
) Rachel, you want to run through your steps before we go again
'll be with you in a second
Nicki hands Frank his orange juice
She looks at Frank as she speaks
think Bill's right, Rachel
It's time you took more precautions
Spector enters the conversation
(one hand covers the phone) Nicki, 'm sure Mr
Farmer would tell you the number of nuts writing fan letters jumps every time Rachel is on the cover of a magazine
Not like this
16
An  hands Rachel a small sheaf of phone messages, some papers for signature and a pen
Rachel checks through them and signs as she talks
Relax guys,  said 'd do  it
You see what 'm dealing with  here
'm willing to go along,  as long as we all understand each  other
'm not going to let this  alter my life one little bit
(to assistant) Who was this
(overlapping Devaney) Oh
That was Clive's office
They called three times
Honey, that's not going to be a problem
(') (to Frank) Rachel runs a very informal household, we're all on a first name basis
Spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in
And 'm sure you'll blend in just fine
You can select whatever alarm systems you want for the house
Some kind of improved security for the gate
What else, Rachel
Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and the dancers
Frank looks at Devaney
Devaney doesn't like the tone this is taking
think 'm safe when 'm here at the house so  guess the main thing will be when  go out
Tony will be able to fill you in on all that
You two will have to work something out
don't want both of you falling all over me everywhere go
The most important thing is this --  will not allow Fletcher to be affected by this thing
17
Rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her, starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion
(punching phone) was just going to cover that
We'll have to tell the child you have some other function
don't want him to think   he's in prison
So the house and    grounds must not be altered in any   way
He shouldn't be aware that   you're here
Is that clear
Frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at Devaney once
Miss Marron
Rachel
There's been a mistake misunderstanding
If you'll show me the quickest way out, we'll save each other a lot of trouble
Frank's on his way
Someone brings a silver headpiece on a stand to Rachel
She ignores it, still looking at Frank
You can go past the pool
Shut up, Tony
Nice meeting you
Farmer, will you wait a minute
Bill,  don't think we should be begging this guy for his services
Sy, 'm handling this
Rachel looks on coolly as Frank slides open the glass door
Farmer, will you wait a minute
18
20
-   -                        20 Frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall, down the slope
Devaney is scurrying to keep up
Farmer, will you wait a minute should have told you more
'm sorry but  was afraid she wouldn't go through with it
thought 'd let the two of you work it out
come to an understanding
We did
Frank starts to walk off
Devaney is grasping at straws
She's not a bad person, and whether she knows it or not, she needs you
(a beat) You've come this far
Would you just wait here for one minute want to show you something
Please, Farmer
Devaney runs back to the house
21
-                                         21 Fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to,  walks up to Frank with his remote-control speed boat
Frank would like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his  way
Frank looks at Fletcher's frail little, nut-brown  figure
The watching nanny continues her embroidering,  some way off
Hi
(continuing to walk) Hi
How are you today
(wants to keep walking) All right
How 'bout yourself
Oh, 'm fine
Do you like boats
19
Frank gives up
He's not going to get out of here
He stops
No
don't like boats
You don't
Why not
Oh,  don't know
Sure you do, but you don't want to tell me
Frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat
He crouches down so that he is eye-level with Fletcher
You're a smart kid
Fletcher nods
'll tell you
One time  was stuck on a boat with some people for four months
lifeboat
Nope
big white yacht
Do you know what a yacht is
(thinks about this) Yeah
My mom rented this huge yacht    once, and we took a trip
It was    great
Everyone threw up except    me
love 'em
(standing to leave) Well, nobody's perfect
Fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes
You're the bodyguard, aren't you
Frank is surprised
What do you know about it
20
've got ears
'll remember that
Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath
He is holding a bulging manila file
As he sees Fletcher, he holds the file casually at his side
Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file
How are you, Fletch
(to Frank) 'm glad you waited
Let's go over here
(to Fletcher) Nice meeting you
Fletcher looks after them silently
22
-                                            22 Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank, open- ing it
Inside are letters of every size and condition
Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to Fletcher, who has started his boat again
This is just in the last six months
(looks at the pile) Have you ever tried having these professionally assessed
Devaney shakes his head no
Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by the corner of the page
From many different sources, some are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts
Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate
Occasionally, one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it
Spector enters sucking on a popsicle
He comes to stand over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters
Devaney says you were in the Secret Service
Frank nods
21
Frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye
He sometimes pauses to read one more carefully
few he removes from the stack and places in the center of the table
Ever guard the main man
was two years with Carter and four years with Reagan
Frank sets another letter in the center pile
He stops, smiling at it
This is a little old lady in Akron
She's written to everybody 've ever worked for
He continues to turn until something stops him
Several letters are paper-clipped together
They are the pasted- up type we saw being assembled on the desk top
Reagan got shot
His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank
Not on my shift
Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke
That's good
Frank goes back to his letters
He taps the stack in the center of the table
At first glance, these don't bother me
But keep them
You never know
He separates one letter from the others
This could be something
Devaney searches Frank's face
You think it could be the same guy
The one who rigged the doll
22
don't know
Did you tell Miss Marron about it
Does she know about the doll
Devaney and Spector exchange looks
This is evidently a sore point between them
We said there'd been some electrical problem while she was on stage
Short circuit
Look, she doesn't need that kind of worry right now
It would upset her
What about the police
There was no reason for the police
No one got hurt
What about the chauffeur
It was nothing
It was just our people there
Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool
Devaney's eyes are still on Frank's face
Sy,  think we should show him the room
23
-                                              23 Frank follows Spector and Devaney into the room
He glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from the pages of a tabloid layout
Is this her bedroom
Yes
No
She sleeps in a room next to Fletcher's down the hall
Sy had this done for a magazine layout, 'Superstars in their Boudoirs
' 23
Did you see it
No
Rachel never liked it
She didn't have to like it
Devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed
We found the letter here
Somebody was in here
Somebody broke in and
masturbated on the bed
And she doesn't know about this either
Devaney shakes his head
Are you kidding
This would really freak her out
What do you think
Someone penetrates the house, gets upstairs and jerks off on the bed 'd say that qualifies as a problem
What kind of problem
(agitated) Of fuck, we don't need this now
This house is wide open
Excuse me
said this house is wide open 24
and you people have no clue what real security is or what it takes to achieve it
(does a quick read on Frank) Frank,  totally respect what you're telling me
Tell me how you want to work and 'll accommodate you
Look,  can't protect her
won't be responsible for her safety if she doesn't know what's going on
'll talk to her, 'll make her understand
can do that
No
'll talk to her
Spector exits the room in a huff
24
-                               24 Frank emerges with Devaney and crosses toward his car
She won't give you any static, Frank, you've got my word on that
Frank is still focused on Fletcher
Sure she will
So what job's perfect
You're a bodyguard, aren't you
Slowly, Frank faces him
(quietly) Yeah
As they reach the car, Devaney is relieved
He dares a perfect smile
Devaney, if you ever lie to me again, 'll take you apart
25
25
- '  -                    25 Henry Dupres is leaning against the doorjamb
The room is comfortable, a guest bedroom
Frank flops one battered suitcase onto the bed and opens it
He pulls open some drawers in the dresser and starts putting away his clothes
Why'd you say your name was Edison
wanted to see how hard it was to get in
And it wasn't, was it
Henry unconsciously flexes his fingers, easing the muscles in his hands
Frank notices and pulls out a small tube of ointment from a pouch he's unpacking
He hands it to Henry
Put this on your arm
It'll help the ache
Henry takes it but is noncommittal
'll bet you can fill up a whole day just washing the cars and driving Rachel Marron around town
That's my job
We're adding to your duties
Huh
You're my new assistant
Frank removes three boxes of cartridges from the suitcase and puts them in the back of a dresser drawer as Henry watches
Says who
Henry, 've spent a lot of time guarding people all over the world 26
and 've found one thing to be true
No matter how incompetent the assassins, no matter how much they miss their target by, there's one person who always gets hit
Who
The cocky black chauffeur
Henry considers this for a moment and smiles
scenes 26-28, we hear the  of 's from "Showbiz Today
" (
) It's Oscar time again, folks, and with Academy members marking their ballots today for this year's nominations; some canny tipsters in Vegas have announced their picks for the Awards
(
)(') Echoing the prevailing buzz in Hollywood, the Vegas Hilton is gambling on one sure thing at least
Newcomer Rachel Marron is tipped at 3 to 1 to lead this year's Best Actress runners

The lady may end up eating her words if she takes home that statuette March 20th

-   -            26 The fortification of the estate begins as Frank and Henry walk the grounds
Frank talks and points, Henry takes notes on a pad
Frank gestures at the stonework of the gate, points at the top of the stone wall along Waverly Lane
At the tall hedges which separate the estate from its neighbors, Frank gestures to take in the entire length of the hedged border
Henry stops in amazement
Frank keeps walking

Fletcher stands at the edge of the terrace, staring down across the rear grounds
' Frank and Henry are down there conferring about the fence
appears beside Fletcher, looks down there too, then leads her son purposefully away
Fletcher isn't happy about it
28
-   -                   28 Frank tours the house with Emma and Henry
Frank opens various doors, fidgets with locking mechanisms
Emma finds it all exciting
29
-  /  -         29 small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre plays exercising
Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch- ing exercises
Frank appears outside the window
Nicki waves him in
Unseen by Frank, a huge St
Bernard lays in the front of the door
He muscles his way in, the dog never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank pushes the door open
Frank looks the room over
Unusual tactic for a guard dog, but effective
Nicki smiles, gesturing him in
You can look around if you like
Frank indicates it won't be necessary
Nicki stops working out
'm sorry to disturb you
That's all right
It's an excuse to rest
It's my private place
'm the only one who works out around here
Frank glances at photos on one wall
Most are of Nicki from years ago; some show her performing with a band
28
My own ego wall
No platinum records
Frank spots a picture of two girls
You and Rachel
When  was a kid,  put a little band together
We played high school dances, stuff like that
Then Rachel joined the act
As you can imagine, she was quite a little entertainer
Even then, she had a way of stopping the show
So  kind of quit
Professionally, anyway
You never went back
It was pretty obvious who the star in our family was
Frank looks back at the picture
Nicki smiles
30
-   -                      30 Frank and Henry walk toward the closed garages
That depends on what you call a 'hint
' don't want anyone on the street to be able to look at the cars and know who owns them
Henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch
The three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence
don't think there's anything here you'd call a 'hint
' One at a time the doors go up to reveal: First garage -- the Cadillac limousine we've seen earlier
License:  2 Second garage -- a gray Mercedes
License:    3 29
Third garage -- a Jaguar  in an outrageous pink
No other car in the world is this color
License:  1 Frank looks at Henry, who is laughing and shakes his head
He walks toward the Jag
Frank releases the hood
He looks inside for a moment, then reaches into the guts of the engine
He fiddles for a second, then stands up holding some wires and slams the hood shut again
He gestures toward the other two cars
Get new plates for those two
31
-                                        31 The fortification continues as workmen use a bulldozer to clear away the stonework around the entrance
32
-                        32 Sitting beside Henry, Frank teaches him how to spin the limo in a 180 degree 'skid turn,' sending up clouds of dust
group of roadies watching bursts into spontan- eous applause
33
-                                        33 Fletcher sits on the grass about halfway to the house, watching the activity with delighted interest
He turns as he spots something beyond the hedge
' Workmen put up a seven-foot cyclone fence
Across the road, a black Toyota 4  4 is stopped
It slowly pulls away
We can't see inside it
34
-                                        34 One worker pries a small boulder out of a hole with a crowbar
His partner picks up the rock and tosses it on a small pile of rocks
The boulder bounces down the backside of the pile
35
'  -                                 35 Rachel, looking out her window at Fletcher and the work- men, sees the rock stop a yard from him
Fletcher scrambles away, much as a kid might dance back from a 30
wave on a beach
The sight disturbs Rachel
Fletcher
'mon
Back in here
As she speaks, some workmen test the remote control on a window shutter
It descends in front of Rachel's face
She is not amused
Fletcher passes Frank on his way to join Rachel
He mutters almost under his breath
think he's got a black 4  4
Could be a Chevy
More like a Toyota
Frank stares at Fletcher, then looks back to the street
36
-   -      36 The room is dark
An opaque projector throws an image onto a screen; it is a letter threatening Rachel's life
We hear voices
One is Frank's; the other two belong to special agents   and
The letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being assembled earlier
It reads: -- Reading as fast as possible, we pick up some vicious threats and obscenities, but we don't have time to read it all before we
: ' illuminated by the screen
(
) This    is another of the ones we think    are worth pursuing
Lots of work    went into it
No prints
We're    doing lab work on it
It could    be nothing
' is illuminated above the projector
This is the one you think is tied to the doll
(
) That's what her manager thinks
31
(
) This ' Have Nothing' business is a natural with the record and movie and all
The projector light goes off and the room light goes on
The room is practically bare
Ray Court, a prematurely white-haired, career civil servant, raises the window shade
Sunlight streams in
On Court's lapel is a tiny
Boat pin
Terry Minella, a slight, dark 35-year-old, offers Frank a cigarette; Frank declines, Minella lights up
sort of lost track of you after Washington
Yeah
How's the private stuff
(noncommittal) Fine
Big money,  bet
Huh
Frank shrugs
Court looks at Minella knowingly
37
-                                 37 Minella and Court walk Frank to the lobby
Shit
knew it
It is big money
Fuck
You need an assistant
'm ready to get out
've lost my tolerance for assholic behavior
You should see the jerk we're covering now
'Hellfire Henry' Kent
Shh
Somebody wants to pop him
Which isn't exactly surprising, considering what the shithead's 32
been saying
Yeah
Do everyone a favor
(he coughs, ironically) As you know, we're nonpolitical these days
The three men laugh easily together
They have reached the lobby doors
(to Frank) We'll put this stuff through Washington
Behavioral Sciences should have something in a few days
Thanks
(a pause) Ray
Yeah
Why am  getting all this cooperation
She's a big star
Important people care about her
Politics and show business are practically the same these days
Got any crowd photos we can use
'm trying to keep her away from crowds
Good luck
38
-                                          38 It's busy
Lots of customers arriving, leaving and seated at tables
Waiters criss-cross the terrace
Near the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged Frank stands nearby with Nicki
The Woman says something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank
Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both laugh
They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance
33
(an afterthought; phony) Goodbye, Nicki
So great to see you
Nicki waves and follows Rachel
Frank stays very close without seeming to walk with Rachel
little girl darts into their path and approaches Rachel
Rachel glances at Frank, who has stopped with her, then she signs an autograph for the girl
The girl's mother, close behind her, hands a small camera casually to Nicki to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with Rachel
Frank watches Nicki quietly comply
Rachel, Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance together, and Frank slips out first, glancing around
Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him
'm surprised you didn't plug them
39
-                                         39 Rachel attracts the usual stares from passersby
As they reach the limousine, Frank continues scanning the street
Tony stares at him, uncomprehending
(impatiently) Hey, let's go
Frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat next to Tony
(across Tony) Henry, let's go
Tony looks at Frank, eyes narrowing
From across the street, we see the limo pull away
As the shot clears, the dark shape of another vehicle appears, slowly moving into frame over the top of the camera
40
-                              40 Frank sits beside Tony, next to the door
Tony speaks to him in a near whisper
Let me set you straight on a few things
For starters,  love this lady
What  do for her  do for 34
love
'm not some hired fuckin' gun who is out to make her life miserable
While Tony speaks, Frank's eyes dart to the side mirror; his gaze never leaves it
'  - appears in the rearview mirror
do things the way she likes
Her happiness is everything to me
Frank speaks while concentrating on the mirror
No problem
'd like to know how you handle things, Tony
handle things fine, Frank
You watch me and you'll learn something
(to Henry) Turn left
Is that him
Frank shakes his head, he's not sure
Tony reacts
Hey, what's going on
Shortcut
'  - As the limo turns, the 4  4 follows them into the turn
- whispers to Henry
Slow down, very slow
You want me to do a one-eighty
35
No, just slow down
The car slows
- They look up from some papers
Why are we stopping
Are we here
Behind them,  the rear window, the 4  4 can be seen
Sensing something, it makes a sudden - left turn, disappearing behind them
41
-                                   41 The limo enters the gate where workmen are rigging a large fence
42
-                                            42 Frank speaks to Henry
Stop here
Take them to the house
Frank jumps out and jumps a hedge, racing toward the lawn and work area
- , As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across the property
What's with him
43
-                                   43 As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a glimpse of the 4  4 through the trees
It starts to accelerate
As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end of the property
Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation
through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a steep wooded slope toward the road below
The 4  4 can be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off
36
retaining wall about   14 feet high rises from the road to the slope
Without    a pause, as the car speeds beneath, Frank leaps and drops   the full distance to the road
The 4  4   just   missing him and turns a corner
Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs into a crouched upright position
But the 4  4 speeds around a corner and is gone
44
-                                   44 The fortification  continues as workmen tighten screws, install electrical  wiring, test alarms
As Frank watches over the work, we  see him show Henry how to wear a communications  system
Keep this loose
Fletcher comes to take a look too
He peers up at Frank, expectantly
Tell me about the car
Toyota
Black
Four wheel drive
Late model
Frank nods
Fletcher looks pleased
One snag though
Fletcher's face falls
What
360,000 of them in Los Angeles checked
Nice work, though
(shrugging) Well, nobody's perfect, Frank
Are they
(gesturing to the ) Can  try that
37
45
-                           45 Rachel has been watching Fletcher and Frank down the hill
Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a Walkman
There is the  howl of a  on  from the direction of the house
Rachel jumps up and yells toward the house
Shut up you assholes
46
'  -                                 46 mild-looking   is working on Rachel's window
Rachel walks in from the pool, starting to peel off the swimsuit
She stops, startled, as she sees him
This is the last straw
She blows up
(clutching the swimsuit) You
You
Out
Out
Now
Out of here
Get out
Terrified, the Old Locksmith drops his tools and begins backing out of the room
Yes, ma'am
Thank you
'm a real fan of yours, Miss Marron
Still angry, but disarmed, Rachel makes a face
Then you can take your tools with you
She turns to the window, in what she imagines is Frank's general direction, and, like a little girl, suddenly sticks out her tongue
47
- /  -                 47 In a    a black and white  screen, we see Devaney's immaculate convertible Mercedes 500SL as it roars up the drive
Frank, Henry and Fletcher watch in the newly-erected guard house
The area is greatly changed
There is a uniformed guard with an impressive array of switches, lights and phones at his command
There are several  screens; one of them shows a series of endlessly-panning shots from cameras at the rear of 38
the grounds
On the other, the Mercedes kicks up dust from the last few curves in the drive
Fletcher shakes his head
He's seen it all before
Is that Devaney
(to Frank) She's got him by the short ones, doesn't she, Frank
Frank squelches a smile at Henry
Where did he learn that
Yeah, she makes him nervous
They watch as Devaney  to a , gets out and hurries inside
48
-                                      48 Nicki is cutting fruit at the bar
Rachel, very tense, is taking the fruit and dropping it into a yogurt drink she's making in a blender
Rory, her choreographer, stands behind her, massaging her neck and shoulders
Spector is perched on a bar stool like a vulture
Devaney hurries into the room; Nicki gives him a look
want him gone
What is it now
He told Rachel no Sunday brunch at Charlie's
No Sunday brunch
That's why you called me up here
That is not it
It's my money and my life and  want him out of here
Where is he
Nicki indicates through the glass door
Devaney walks over to it
39
On the patio
He's through messing with my life
Rachel, 'm getting goddamn sick of running up here every time he steps on your toes
(leaning out the glass door) Farmer
Would you come in here a minute
Devaney walks back toward Rachel
Did you know he was nuts
Do you know who couldn't get past the gates yesterday
Who
Robin Leach, that's who
Rory sniggers into the back of Rachel's hair, fighting off a laugh
Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight face, too
Spector glares at them as Frank enters from the sliding door
You think that's funny
The man talks to 20 million people and he can't even get in here
Did he have an appointment
Devaney turns to him
Farmer, what is this about brunch at Charlie's
Rachel's been going there every Sunday for the last five years
don't want her doing anything she's always done
40
(mimicking him) ' don't want her doing anything she's always done
' The guy's a fanatic
So are the guys he's protecting you from
Excuse me if  don't faint
Think of Fletcher -- Rachel turns  the , drowning out Nicki's voice
Frank looks at Rachel coolly
She stares at him petulantly, then turns  the
Do you know he's got the phones bugged
Oh Jesus, Bill
Maybe he gets off listening to my calls
All that heavy breathing
(interrupting) What do you want from my life
want some peace around here
That's right
Devaney looks at Frank imploringly
We're almost done
And  want to be able to eat brunch with my friends
Go on Tuesday this week
Spector looks at him as though he were a Martian
41
(stretching it out) Tuesday -- morning -- brunch
Where did you find this guy
Rachel turns  the  and stares at Frank
48A
-  -                              48A Rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop
It's a decidedly downscale area
little way  off, a   group of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo   with interest
Henry sits  at the wheel
Tony  stands   by the open window, leaning against the car
(looking at the youths) wish Rachel didn't keep coming here
It makes me nervous
Me too
'Cept 'm not nervous 'cos  got you with me
49
-     -             49 as it's slid along a metal rack
Rachel is shopping for bargains, moving along racks of discarded clothing
Louise, you've got too much great stuff
(from the back of the shop, laughing) Take it all, darlin'
Frank leans casually against a wall, not watching Rachel, but watching the shop, watching the street outside
Rachel finds something she likes
Wooo
Let me try this on
She flicks a glance to Frank; he's not looking at her
She pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing booth, then stops dramatically
42
(to Frank, indicating the open booth) Farmer, do you want to come in here with me
Just to be safe
Frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of the shop
Rachel's head bobs up and down above the curtain as she changes
You probably won't believe this, but  have a reputation for being a bitch
Frank says nothing
He gazes outside through the store- front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next to the limo
few small boys stand around the car
One of them is climbing onto the hood
didn't used to be
But you get known for being a certain way -- a way people think you are -- and pretty soon you get like that
Can't help it
Frank smiles knowingly
Rachel notices
You don't think so
You're such an expert on famous people
've seen a few
And you disagree
(very flat) You can be as you choose to be
It's an act of discipline sometimes, but it can be done
Rachel stops in her tracks
then opens the curtains and looks at herself in the mirror
Also reflected in the mirror is Frank
That why you never stay with one of your clients
They too undisciplined for you
Or is it you're afraid you'll start to care about them
43
(without interest) That's right
Rachel turns to Frank
Can't you answer straight just once
Why don't you talk to me
'm not such a bad lady
You're too clever for me
can't keep up
Frank continues to search the shop and street with his gaze
Rachel steps closer to him
Look at me, Farmer
Frank turns and looks at her
You don't approve of me, do you
Disapproval's a luxury  can't afford
Gets in the way
Don't like emotions getting to you, huh
Never mix business with pleasure
That's right
It's a stand-off
After a moment, Rachel motions to an outfit on a rack just behind him
Grab that would you
Frank takes a beat
Looks out the window
'm here to keep you alive
not to help you shop
Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself, whipping the curtain shut behind her
smile plays across Frank's face

-  -                        50 We see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its sleeve
The cover reads "  -  #1
" The  is gently eased into the slot of the video player
Rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly, intensely, passionately into the camera the image, as if a little hypnotized by it
Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the , dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie
He's watching Rachel's videos
Scattered around the video player are a collection of other Rachel Marron 's, tapes and videos
Frank has been noting down lyrics on the yellow legal pad on his lap
Some of the phrases are circled
As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression
It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first time, here, watching her sing
For a second, she seems to be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable
He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian Orthodox-type cross
He fastens the clasp, checking that it holds, then looks back to the screen
51
-                                  51 Rachel's    the moonlit estate

'  -                               52 The room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty apart from Rachel's collection of old and faded dolls on the shelves and on the bed
Rachel is getting dressed for the evening
hairdresser stands behind her, fussing with her hair
Rachel hears the  coming from outside and moves to the window
(The hairdresser moves with her, still busy with the brush
) Gazing across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room and hears her own voice singing out from there too
53
-                                   53 Frank is showing Henry how to check the underside of the limo with an angled mirror on a stick
Both are crouched beside the vehicle
noise makes them look up
Rachel, dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from the house with Spector and Devaney
Spector's carrying a videotape
Tony follows as they head for the car, where 45
Frank and Henry are waiting
Fletcher stands in the doorway, flanked by uniformed security guards
He waves at Frank
(to Henry) thought it was dinner
Henry shrugs
(to Spector) Are we going somewhere else
The Mayan, Frank
What's the Mayan
Spector starts to climb into the limo
It's a club, Frank
Come on, Henry, let's go
Spector, you've got to tell me about these things
just did
He disappears inside the limo
Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down, brushing something off his shoulder
Frank's annoyed
Nice suit, Frank
Rachel is about to get in
Rachel
He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled cross
want you to keep this
Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused
For me
It's beautiful
46
It's fitted with a radio transmitter
When you close the clasp, it sends a signal
If there's ever a problem and we're separated, just press it and 'll know you need me
Rachel doesn't know how to respond
She's stuck for words
Spector pokes his head out impatiently
Okay, she knows how it works, let's get going
Rachel manages a quick smile to Frank as she gets in the back
Frank gets in the front beside Tony
The limo pulls out

But if you don't have a ticket, you can forget going down there
Police are asking us to ask you to stay away
So everybody, please stay cool, stay tuned and we'll try to get you some interviews after the show
Remember, you heard it here on
-- the station that delivers
Frank looks back at Spector who silently mouths -- 47
It wasn't me
The car turns a corner and there it is, The Mayan only fifty yards ahead, a mob of fans spilling out of the club, off the sidewalk and into the street
Fuckin' a
Spector whoops with uncontrolled delight from the back of the limo
Frank stares ahead in disbelief
The of the  can be heard as they pull up front
55
-                                        55 The mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage
Faces of the fans are at the windows leering at Rachel
Many are grotesquely painted
Some go into a wild frenzy as Rachel's limo pulls up
There is a punch-up and a man is beaten back
Someone has a video camera
Its quartz light shines in through the limo windows
Everybody squints at the glare
56
-                               56 As Rachel's car pulls up, the beaten man dances weirdly at the curb with blood streaming from his nose
pair of security guards try to hold them back
As her limo stops, a chant begins
Rachel
Rachel
We want Rachel
Others join in as the mob presses forward
The instant she exits the car, her expression goes public -- a wide, show-biz smile
Sandwiched between Spector and Devaney, with Tony in front and Frank at the rear, Rachel makes her entrance
young man breaks the barrier   moving toward Rachel
Frank grabs him by one of his   belt loops, gracefully guides him all the way across   and slips him under the opposite cordon into the arms   of a security guard
57
'   -                           57 Rachel steps into a room set for a star's arrival
Flowers are on every surface that will hold them
One huge arrangement is so big it has to be placed on the 48
floor
Frank checks them all with a magnometer wand before letting Rachel sit down
He goes out, closing the door, watchful
58
-                                      58 Frank's eyes search the crush of people, milling around outside the dressing room
few feet away, Spector talks to a  who's carrying a tape recorder
and this is my exclusive
swear  thought she'd talk to you
Maybe later
What can say
Frank is checked out by a strange-looking women in Vampyra Drag
59
-                                  59 Rachel sits in front of the mirror putting on the silver headpiece we saw earlier
She notices a small spray of lilies-of-the-valley among the floral arrangements
An envelope marked "Rachel" is attached to it
She reaches forward and opens it
We see the note as she unfolds it

We see the shock in her face

'  -                                   60 Spector, Frank, and Devaney are there
Rachel seems dazed, unfocussed
Devaney hands the note to Frank
He sent another one
Rachel immediately picks up on this
What do you mean 'another one'
Frank quickly shoots a look at Spector
They didn't tell you
49
Tell me what
There were some letters before, Rachel
same kind of thing, threats, oddball stuff
We didn't want to worry you
and somebody got into the house
(starting to panic) Someone was in my house
Okay
Let's not get hysterical
Let's get her out of here
Someone was in my house
It was weeks ago
You were out of town
While Fletcher was there
Listen, Fletcher is okay
The house is like Fort Knox now
Right, Frank
We should get her out of here
Right now
There's no way anyone could
No way anyone could what
No, wait
look everybody calm down
Calm down
Sy
50
Let's just see how she is
(to Rachel) How do you feel, honey
Someone comes through the door with some flowers
Frank eases them out and gently closes the door
can't protect her out there
Do you think he's out there
Devaney can't answer
She turns to Frank
He's here, isn't he
He might be
We don't know that
Frank, we don't know that
Rachel is enraged
But you know he was in my house
oh my God
Let's go home, Sy
We'll have to make an announcement
Fine, you make it, they'll tear the fucking place apart
61
-                                         61 lone mike stands onstage
The crowd's growing im- patient
begins
Devaney walks timidly onstage
He's not happy to be there
He reaches the mike and taps it with a finger
Excuse me
hello
've got an announcement to make
'm sorry but
due to circumstances beyond
Voices shout
"Where's Rachel
"
a groan begins
chorus of boos fills the room
He raises his hands
51
More voices
62
-                                     62 Frank guides Rachel toward the stage exit
roar from the audience begins
"Rachel
Rachel
Rachel
" It grows louder as they near the exit
Rachel's expression is a combination of fear and humiliation
When they have almost reached the exit, she stops
Wait
Rachel
don't do it
It's not worth it
(cutting him off) No fucking freak is gonna chase me off stage
She pulls away from him
Farmer starts after her, closely followed by Spector
63
-                                         63 'm afraid that
great gush of applause from the audience
Devaney's befuddled
He doesn't see Rachel walking up behind him
Rachel won't be able
Rachel stands beside him beaming
She bows
Claps back to her fans
Devaney retreats
Rachel gestures in his direction
Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Bill
Hey, everyone
Hello
Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest
He's asked me to sing a song
hope you don't mind
The crowd roars its approval
Frank nervously scans the room
Rachel smiles and moves along the stage
starts in the b
g
Masking obvious fear, she starts to sing
As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers tremble
She clasps it again to hide her anxiety
52
-  - shows her alone and vulnerable, bathed in light, center- stage
Rachel snatches a quick glance at Frank then looks back to her silent audience
- He scans the audience intensely, face to face
63A
-   -                         63A Rachel's limo stands waiting
to reveal a black Toyota 4  4 parked among the other cars
63B
-                                          63B Rachel approaches the end of her song, her voice coming ever stronger
Spector comes up to Frank in the wings, positioning himself combatively between Frank and his view of Rachel
Are we having a communications problem here
What
Spector's presence is a distraction
Frank steps to one side for a better view of Rachel
Spector moves too
Apparently,  didn't make it clear to you how things go around here
You told me you were going to tell her
And you didn't
didn't think she could handle it
But she handled it fine
Frank continues to peer past Spector's shoulder, his vigilance undiminished
Soothed and nurtured by the obvious admiration of her audience, Rachel's fear is beginning to vanish
The song is taking over
Spector changes tack, becoming confidential, "man-to-man
" 53
Look
Frank,  know what you're saying
know you want to do what's best for her
understand that
You have a job to do here
But you have to understand that Rachel has a job to do too
And that's what she's doing - out there
She's working, Frank
That's what she does and that's where she does it
She's hot right now
This is the time for her
If she doesn't get out there, she's dead
Forget about crazy death threats, if she doesn't sing, she's dead anyway
Look, handled properly, this thing could be good for a million dollars' worth of free publicity
Frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a wall of curtain ropes
One word
It could clinch her the nomination
One word in print about any of this
Spector nods, half-gasping
Frank tightens his grip
Frank's attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the crowd
Trouble with you is you don't understand the sympathy vote
64
-                                          64 Rachel scans the crowd, spread before her like a surreal mural
Camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare
The thundering adoration is like a stimulant
She darts a look to Frank and gives him a fierce "naughty girl" smile
(turning back to crowd) You like that
Would like to hear another
Billy
54
From the wings, Billy Thomas gives her the nod to go for it
It seems to be alright with everyone
The band starts playing a dance beat
(on the prowl) think my feet are trying to tell me something
wanna see a new video
The crowd explodes
They know what song is coming
They start to move with Rachel
(dancing, talking) want to dance
She skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her fans
Her new video explodes across the video wall behind her
The crowd surges forward
Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the crowd
When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls back into the audience
Another man climbs the stage on the other side
One of the guards darts out like a ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance
The crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer, trying to touch Rachel
The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for them to back off
- Frank's task has suddenly become impossible
forest of hands and faces start to engulf Rachel
Anyone could be the killer
Frank's eyes  dart over them all, his gaze intense, as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower
' Looking offstage at Frank
His frustration is almost intoxicating to her
She struts over the lip of the stage
man leaps up from audience to join her
Frank starts forward
Rachel gestures to him to hold back, waving him off
65
-                                          65 Spector stands well out of Frank's reach, staring at Rachel onstage
He catches Frank's attention, yelling back defiantly
55
Look at her, fucking great
66
-                                        66 Rachel dances erotically with the man -- bumping and grinding, sinking to her knees
The crowd roars approval
Frank quickly sizes up the scene
He speaks into a microphone in his sleeve
Across the room we see Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear
Henry quickly scurries to an exit
Frank starts moving toward the stage
At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending to be
One of security guards rushes forward to extri- cate her
The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel
She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans
The audience goes wild
This is the kind of thing Rachel was famous for when she was starting out
The scene resembles a rugby scrum
with Rachel the ball
Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans -- deeper into the audience
Her dress is ripped and torn apart
The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears into the crowd
Fear fills her face
She's gone over the edge, literally and figuratively
She's lost control
Tony and the security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming bodies out of the way
In the b
g
, the video continues on its serene, uninterrupted way
' He spots a fire extinguisher in the wings
Frank grabs it and heads to center stage
He aims the extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the stage
The chemical foam does its job, scattering fans
Frank leaps onto the floor, kicking a wild-eyed young blond man in the chest as he fights his way to Rachel, taking her in his arms
Tony runs ahead of Frank, knocks a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow
56
Tony, not there
'll take care of this
He heads for the door
Just follow me
He turns and heads out to the sidewalk like a bull
67
-                                        67 Tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a swath through the crowd
Rain beats down
Make way here
Outta the way
burly street regular gets a shove from Tony and comes back hard
The  crowd immediately sides with him, yells encouragement
But Tony is the better man and sends him sprawling
The  rest of the way to the curb opens up
At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and turns in bewilderment to Rachel
But she is not there
couple of people laugh
68
-                                            68 Rachel and Frank emerge from the darkness between two garbage bins and get into the limo Henry has waiting there
The car moves out with a  of tires, narrowly missing Spector as he staggers out of the building
Hey
What the fuck
Farmer
Farmer
Come back here
The limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the street, leaving Spector in helpless fury -- apoplectic and speechless
69
-                                             69 Frank turns and looks at Rachel
She is diminutive, doll-like, alone in the center of   the large limousine seat
Her  hands rise to her face   and her body begins to shake with sobs as she sits there   alone in the tattered remains of her dress
Frank turns away to avoid staring at her, but he feels 57
uncomfortable
Henry senses what is going on and speaks softly
Never done that before
It's been a long night
70
-                                      70 The crowd is thinning out
dim worklight is burning somewhere backstage
The auditorium is a mess; the cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the riot
, walking, pausing, as if looking for something
Lying on the floor in big  we see a small  fragment of Rachel's dress
The   by it
hand picks it up gently and lifts it
We   hear the sound of a deep lingering  of breath
The feet move on
71
-                                   71 Fletcher is asleep in his bed
Frank waits as Rachel glances in
Then she moves away
Opening the door to her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter ahead
72
'  -                                  72 Frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window and French door
Rachel waits silently by the door
All is clear
He steps back to the door
As he approaches her she begins to tremble
He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms
Slowly holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows
Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are shaking so badly she cannot undo it
Frank gently does it for her
She willingly allows him to undress her and not a word is spoken between them
As she sits naked still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her gently into bed
As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of his hand
He looks down, stroking her forehead like a child's
Aren't you going to ask me why behave like that
58
know why
73
-                                       73 Frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen, care- fully cutting and eating a peach
The door at the other end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking wet
He has just made his way home  from the  and he is boiling
He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast
Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him
As Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins low out of his seat
Tony's legs are knocked out from under him
He lands hard on his back and finds himself looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed against Tony's throat
Frank looks down at him question- ingly, as if to ask, "Had enough
" Tony scowls and nods
Frank lifts the chair away
Tony stands up and faces him
Frank turns away and Tony throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank ducks and moves in under it
He hits Tony twice and throws him against a cabinet
Tony gets up slowly, looks around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall
He holds it in front of him threateningly
Frank shakes his head
He's getting irritated
He picks up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in his hand so he's holding it by the blade
With the same fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony
It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear
Tony does a slow take and then lowers his blade
Frank picks up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink
He glances at Tony
don't want to talk about this again
74
-  -                       74 Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man- sion
The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty
We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being covertly observed, stalked
twig snaps and he turns sharply
It's Rachel
She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him
59
The suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely
Her manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and very girlish
Hey
Gotcha, didn't
Hey
You're probably wondering what 'm doing
(as Frank nods) You didn't know  jogged, did you
Frank shakes his head
What's the matter
'Fraid 'll get picked off in my snazzy running suit
No
'm afraid 'll have to jog with you
They both smile
Great
guess  can't do it
Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment, rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself
She removes it quickly
Will you walk with me a little
Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds
(hard for her) know this is kinda late, but thank you
'm really glad you're here
(she looks at him) 'm going to try to cooperate
That would be good
They walk in silence for few moments
When Rachel finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself, nervous
It's very appealing
And if it's an act, she's a terrific actress
60
Farmer
have this problem
This minor little problem
You see, 'd like to go out for an evening
Just me and a guy
You know
(makes a funny face) like a 'date
' But  can't go out on a date because you have to be with me every minute
mean, what if he invited me up to his place afterwards
Are you going to come, too
(a beat) So the only thing  can figure is for you to take me out
(pause) So
that's what  was wondering you know
What do you think
But only if you want to
Frank is bemused
Only if you want to
'm not so bad
(looks at him) God, this is embarrassing
'm gonna run up ahead there
You decide
She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above them
He walks up after her
75
-  -                        75 Nicki is yelling from a window on the second floor of the mansion
Fletcher peers out with her
(
) Rachel
Sandy Harris is on the phone
Rachel and Frank look up
Tell her she'll have to wait, babe
'm getting fixed up here
- She watches Frank and Rachel, her expression neutral
She turns away
Fletcher continues to watch his mother with Frank
61
76
-  -- (
) -   -          76 The  is
wet car comes out of the tunnel of machinery
In the distance, glimpsed through the spinning brushes, Henry talks to a couple of workers as he waits for the limo to be cleaned
Hands appear with a large chamois cloth, moving easily and fast over the hood and windshield
black in his early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car
second pair of hands appear
White hands in rubber gloves
They open the  driver's   door and push a vacuum suction hose inside
The hands   switch  the car , loud
Loud enough to  hear over   the din outside the car
The hose works its way over the   front seats
(
) And here's another biggie from a lady very much in the news these days, Miss Rachel Marron
We see the owner of the hands
It is the young blond man Frank kicked aside at the
His name is
His face is impassive
(
) the hit song from the movie
Queen Of The Night
Have Nothing
The song begins and Rachel's voice fights the din
In the back of the car, Dan's hose probes around, nosing into all the crevices of the upholstery
It sucks up a crumpled pre-signed photograph of Rachel from the gap beside the rear seat
The hose is switched off and the gloved hands retrieve the picture
77
- -- -                          77 Tight, shabby facilities
Dan opens the combination padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo inside
As the hands remove the rubber gloves, the inside of the locker is revealed
Pasted over every inch of the locker are pictures of Rachel Marron
One tabloid shot of her dancing with the word "whore" scrawled across it
Taped to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the The hands pin up the newly-acquired photo next to it
62
84
-                                  84 Special Agent Court is seated next to a white-coated technician
The technician is leaning over one of the neatly pasted-up death threats we have seen earlier
With a scalpel, he lifts the word "whore" from out of the message
He sets it on a white sheet, then brings the blade back and scrapes at the residue of the dry glue on the letter
- &       , 85
-                               85 Frank and Rachel exit with a small crowd
Rachel wears a scarf and tinted glasses
The combination    goes a long way toward disguising her
They pause at    one of the dis- play windows
Inside is a poster for the    movie, Yojimbo, a large picture of Toshiro Mifune looking   scruffy and fierce
Well, he didn't look like he wanted to die to me
There's a big difference between wanting to die and having no fear of death
They walk down the sidewalk
And because he had no fear of death, he was invincible
What do you think
Well, he sure creamed 'em all in the end
Yeah, it was a good movie
They walk off down the sidewalk
How many times have you seen it
Sixty-two
63
86
-                                        86 It's a bit of a dive, but the food is good and the atmos- phere is great
Your kinda place
Frank nods
Yeah
Your kinda music
As she smiles: Absolutely
You figure no one can get by you here
If someone is willing to swap his life for a kill, nothing can stop him
Great
What do  need you for
He might get me instead
And you're ready to die for me
That's my job
Rachel looks at him
And you'd do it
Why
can't sing
Maybe there's some glory in saving a president or something, but just anyone
You mean like you
It's a matter 64
of conditioning and discipline
don't trust discipline
At the crucial moment 'd cop out
That happens
But not with you, Fierce Frank
It happens
beat
Have you ever liked anybody
What do you mean
Like me -- a girl
Frank knows what she's driving at
But he's not at all happy to relinquish this information
long time ago
What happened
Do you mind if ask
Do you mind if  don't answer
don't want to pry
Frank smiles at that
(begins to laugh, can't help herself) She didn't die did she
You weren't like
protecting her and she got killed
Frank is silent, grim
Rachel looks stricken
Oh, my god
That's it, isn't it
65
Nobody's perfect
Rachel is taken aback
Oh Frank, 'm sorry
Frank laughs
No
Nice try though
(pause) It was less dramatic than that
She didn't love me anymore
Can you imagine such a thing
Frank puts a smiling spin on this last; it's pretty charming
Rachel looks at him
No, not really
comes on the  -- ' ' Frank smiles as Rachel begins to sing
So, is this a full service date, Frank
Frank's wary
'm just asking you to dance
87
-                                  87 Frank and Rachel navigate a tiny dance floor
Frank is a surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this close to her
Rachel hums softly, picking up the words to the song
As we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head
You like this
Yeah
beat, then Rachel bursts out laughing
(reddening) What
66
(trying to compose herself) 'm sorry
It's just that
It's so depressing
Now they're both laughing
(grinning) It is, isn't it
Suddenly a dish drops to the floor
Frank, still dancing, makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between Rachel and the noise
His head turns to locate the source of the noise
Don't worry, 'll protect you
They drift back into the music, Rachel singing, Frank watching
88
'  -                                   88 Frank's car is parked in the driveway
light goes on in a basement window
89
'  -                                89 Frank hangs back, drink in hand, as Rachel explores the basement
Frank has fitted it out as a combination gym/ target range/weapons workshop
The place has a kind of unfussy order about it, a simplicity
(almost to herself) It's very quiet here
She walks to some shelves -- a random selection of books, football and karate trophies, framed citations and other memorabilia
She glances at a dusty framed photo of a football team
(reading) West Virginia University Football
God, look at you
She looks at Frank, quizzically
What'd you play
67
End
Were you tough
No
Fast
Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall
She looks at it, peering closely
You some kind of a samurai, too
Frank smiles
They said you were in the Secret Service
What made you get out
Frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall
Money
Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home
can see your tastes are extravagant
She looks at Frank and then back at the sword
She reaches out to touch it
May
Frank nods
Rachel takes it off its mount carefully, unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off
Watch yourself
Rachel slides the scabbard off
The naked blade is breathtaking
Rachel holds the sword out before her
She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the blade at him
You're a hard one to figure, Frank Farmer
He stares at her
She steps closer, so the blade is only about a foot from his face
68
It seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace
Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only about an inch from his chest
He reaches out over the blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is wearing there
One hand draws the scarf away
The other hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away
Watch this
He has raised the scarf over his head, in   the space between them
With two hands he spreads    it out and then lets it go
Slowly, billowing, the scarf    floats down over the blade and is cut in two
These    two pieces float slowly to the floor
Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to the side
They are both holding it as Rachel presses her body against Frank's and they begin to kiss
90
'  -  -                         90 Their lovemaking is  with   black and white images of Samurai warriors from the movie, Yojimbo
91
'  -  -                         91 They lie nude under a sheet
've never been this safe before
Frank smiles
No one could get by you
Right now it might not be so hard
Rachel laughs, kisses him and buries her head down into his shoulder
Frank stares across the bed at the samurai sword lying on the floor
Some of Rachel's clothing is draped in a heap across it
The torn pieces of her scarf lie nearby
Frank's look
: 92
'  -                           92 The roller-blind is raised with a sharp, snapping sound
Frank is moving around the room, getting dressed
Rachel 69
is still in the bed behind him, woken by the noise of his activity
What
What is it
What are you doing
Frank keeps moving, looking for his shoes
Frank
Rachel,  don't want to get confused about what 'm doing here
'm not confused
Frank finds his shoes
You pay me to protect you, that's what  do
Rachel sits up
What
Have  done something wrong
No, nothing
Then what is it
She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top of it
Do you want me to beg
No,  want you to do without
She stops
What's going on, Frank
want to keep it straight in my head what job 'm doing
70
And what is that exactly
Making me feel like shit
No, 'm sorry
This is my fault
Don't apologize for godsake
Just tell me what  did
'm a big girl
You didn't do anything
It was me
involved myself with my client
Rachel picks up on the word
Your "client"
made a mistake
What mistake
You don't find me attractive anymore
Christ
've told you why can't protect you like this
And what
That's it for me
Yeah
don't believe it
He automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the holster
You can live with that or you can fire me
But  can't fuck you
Frank turns and looks at her
This is hard for him, too
don't believe this
'm asking you
Let me tell you
71
She stops suddenly and, with a roar of combined frus- tration, humiliation and rage, she lurches from the bed in search of her clothes
Frank shuts his eyes in morti- fication and pain
93
-  -                93 nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering
Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool
He's putting new batteries into Fletcher's boat
Fletcher watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the batteries, much preoccupied
(watching him) She's real mad at you, isn't she
Frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the batteries in his hands
There's a beat of silence
She told me she doesn't understand why you're so shitty to her
Frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible sigh
He gently resumes fitting the batteries, still not looking at Fletcher
In the quiet of early morning, it's almost like a confessional
've spent a lot of time learning not to react to things like other people do
It's my job
But it doesn't always work, Fletcher
it doesn't always work
don't think  understand
(looks at him) 'm an old man compared to you, pal, and  don't understand either
And 'm starting to get the feeling  never will
There's a crunch of footsteps behind him
He looks around
With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down in front of us, front page upwards
(
) Ta Da
72
Frank takes in that it's Nicki then glances at Variety, lying on the concrete beside him
Splashed across the top, the headlines announce the day's news of the Academy Award nominations
Rachel's name is among the Best Actress nominees
The Hollywood Reporter follows
Frank picks up Variety and stares at it
Nicki stands beside him with the morning's mail under her arm
(looking at him) Thought you'd like to know
Everyone said she was a sure thing
Of course, you know all about that
She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look
Frank looks steadily back at her
She drops a small pile of mail beside the magazines
several letters and a small packet
She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze
'm sorry
That was out of line
It's none of my business
Here's today's question marks for you
She turns and walks briskly back to the house
Frank watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile
From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then pushes his boat out into the deep water
94
- '  -      94 Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal detector, sniffing at it
It has been addressed in the normal way, except that Rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted above the address
He begins carefully slicing away the wrapping
Inside is a cardboard box
The contents are still hidden by packing paper
He picks it away with tweezers
Suddenly there is a   from the box and movement in the paper
Frank drops the box into a bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags
The movement slows and stops
Frank extracts the item -- it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted sign hung around its neck: , ,
The beaver's   in Frank's hand
We see Frank's face
This may just have taken years off his life
He holds his hand out straight, palm downwards, 73
and looks at it
No tremor
Just checking
Spector's voice suddenly shouts from the next door office
(
) Farmer
Get in here
95
- '  -    95 The office is filled with congratulatory balloons and flowers heralding the morning's news
Spector's secretary is taking congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the b
g
Two assistants are struggling in through the door with a large basketed floral arrangement
Spector confronts Frank across his desk
Put together a list of   your expenses
Your total    billing
Let me have it in one   hour and 'll see that a check   is cut
Don't you ever say what's on your mind
Spector cannot believe he's being so addressed -- especially in front the staff
The assistants stop in their tracks and look
(almost shouts) What's on my mind is that you're fired, Frank
She missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date
Do you realize she stood up Barbara Walters
First you fuck up her career
Behind Spector, out of his line of sight, Rachel and Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards
They also stop and listen
and now you're fucking with her head
That's between us
You think so
You forget who signs your check
You don't understand the role  play around here
74
No
understand
Spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on
Get your shit together and be out of here by noon
Frank stays
Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have been listening
Rachel is silent
With a curt nod of his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the room
Devaney weighs in
With this high a profile, Rachel needs protection now more than ever
If he goes, you can forget Miami
She's signed the fucking contract, Bill
You want me to read it to you
Rachel is watching them both
Fuck the contract
If he goes, she's not singing a note
It's too dangerous
Oh
'Fuck the contract
' Great
Why don't you let Rachel speak for herself
think she has some say in this
(flatly) Frank stays
Spector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others
The secretary interrupts from the back of the office
(
) Mr
Schiller calling on line one
Spector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney, Rachel and Frank
Well,  guess this is democracy in action
75
Rachel nods
Spector, turning to take the call, flashes her a "little boy" look
gave in
That's not easy for me
Don't  get a hug
Rachel is stone-faced
Spector covers by picking up the phone
(into phone) Yeah
Sure, put him on
Ben how are you
uh huh
Frank and Rachel look at each other in silence
The Ambassador
What the hell are you trying to pull, Ben
Rachel always gets the Presidential
don't care what you thought
Devaney leans to Frank as Spector's conversation continues in the b
g
Do you know the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach
Frank nods
How does the Ambassador Suite compare to the Presidential for us
Frank thinks only for a moment
It's on the twentieth    floor in the south wing
There's a     service elevator right there
Mainly ocean windows
Should     be no problem
(into phone) 'm aware of that, Ben, but let me just remind you people that you invited us
Frank turns toward the door
76
(to Frank) Hang around, Farmer
We might need your vaunted expertise
She reaches forward and hits a button on Spector's desk, throwing the call onto a speaker
(sweetly) Hello, Ben honey
(
) Rachel, congratulations, you must be thrilled at the
(across him) Ben
hear you've got me in the annex next to the kitchen
96
( ) -   96 - We     the ocean  the towering white Fontainebleau
the , we hear  '  filling the viewers in on the latest Hollywood dirt
(
) It's off to Sun City today for Best Actress nominee Rachel Marron
Rachel's giving two  charity concerts this week at Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel
thousand a plate no less
And rumor has it that the lovely lady has unseated the governor of Florida himself
Seems there was a showdown on who'll get to lounge in that big Fontainebleau penthouse tonight
As we  the top floor, we see a tiny figure on the balcony
(
) Well, sleep tight in the Presidential Suite, Rachel
Who says a nomination isn't as good as winning
97
-  -                     97 Frank looks up at the disappearing helicopter then down 77
over the edge and around the corner
He leans slightly against the wrought iron railing
It sways precariously
Frank catches himself
Thuringer
Frank kneels and inspects the fixture that anchors it to the cement balcony: the cement crumbles around it, a weld joint is broken on the side
, the hotel security chief, joins Frank on the balcony
Frank shakes the railing
God damn
'll get someone right on it
98
-                             98 Frank walks quickly across the living  room of the lavish suite
Two uniformed security guards  are making a sweep of the room with
Frank   checks the drawer of a side table and then seals it with a  peel-off security tape
Thuringer is waiting near the  entrance hall
Frank nods to him
Okay
Let's go
99
- 15TH  -                           99 This is a semi-private corridor; several hotel employees are steam-cleaning the carpet
Frank looks at them, then Thuringer
It's okay, they've been cleared
He shows his clipboard to Frank
As the two men walk along the corridor, the guest elevator opens and a twelve-year-old boy in a bathing suit ( ) steps out, accompanied by his nanny
In the background, hotel security men are checking fire-extinguishers and closets
(to Frank) The Katzes of St
Louis
Very prominent
Come every year
An elderly couple and three grandchildren
nurse and a maid
They pass the little boy as he reaches the door of the Katz suite with his nanny
78
Hi, Mark
Hi
Frank smiles and nods to the nanny
(to Frank) Theirs is the only suite on the floor
The two men reach the service elevator and the emergency exit door at the end of the hall
Frank opens the stair- way door and goes inside
Thuringer follows
As you asked, the rooms below have been kept vacant
100
-                                        100 The doorway closes behind the two men
Frank tries it; it's locked
They continue down the stairs
105
-                                         105 Frank and Thuringer walk into and along the edge of the busy kitchen
109
-                                   109 Frank walks ahead of Thuringer
He looks around and pauses at the edge of the stage
Then he steps out on a stage
piano tuner is at work in the corner
110
-                                        110 '  - as he looks out at the mammoth room
Frank stands center stage and looks around
The naked- ess of this spot gets to him
He shakes his head and looks at Thuringer
Thuringer smiles
What a silly job this is
79
111
-   -                  111 Behind the glass doors that lead to the pool, bright quartz lights clock on
camera crew stands waiting
Someone mimes a "we're rolling" sign with his hands
Inside Rachel waits with Spector and  , the tough, fat fellow who owns the place
Frank is at her elbow
Rachel
It's showtime
They're rolling
Let's go
Is this really necessary
Yes
It is
Quit bitching, Farmer
This is the part you do get paid for
Rachel sweeps out the door
The camera crew hurries to keep up with her
112
-                                          112 This place is crowded with hundreds   of guests basking on chaise lounges
sea of sun-baked    faces virtually as far as the eye can see
The sight    of the crowd and the presence of the news crew seems to   push Rachel to a whole new adrenaline level
Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the bodies displayed before her in words and expressions, playing to the camera
Oh my God
Look what they're wearing
Mother, hide your eyes
Heads turn to look
couldn't wear that suit
Honey, you're naked
Of course, if had a body like that
There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests
She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is among them
People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run 80
to get a closer look
Lounges collapse, drink  are , flower tubs are trampled
lot of pushing and shoving starts - too much for the video crew, who abandon the filming attempt
Great, babe
They got what they needed
Let's get back inside
Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently easing a path for her
Schiller scurries behind in Frank's wake
Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard appears in the throng
She eyes him appreciatively
(to lifeguard) You look like a man of good taste to me
Come to my party tonight
(to Schiller) Ben, make sure this boy gets to my party
Schiller nods
Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he gets the point, and then she's off again
The throng gets tighter
Frank's having to work harder, steering her towards the door back into the hotel
The familiar chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel
" It's starting to resemble the frenzy of the opening scene
This time, amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved forward
child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs and Bermuda shorts
distraught mother tries to reach him
Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd surges again
Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause
Rachel drinks it all in
(over her shoulder) Thank you
Thank you
Come tonight and give till it hurts
With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his party
The door closes shut behind them
mass of distorted faces pushes onto the glass
The party walks on briskly
(to Spector) 'm beginning to wonder about your judgement, Sy
Why do  have to keep paying my dues if 've already arrived
81
(very fast) Kick me, beat me
whatever makes you feel good
But let's not pretend you don't like it
We're too close for that
Whipping people into a frenzy is why you got into it in the first place
Rachel's eyes lock with  Spector's -- there's a real connec- tion and understanding  here that she spends a lot of time denying
Frank sees it   as clearly as Spector, whose tone becomes almost soothing  -- And it's nothing to be ashamed of, either, not for a second
It's a gift
and only a handful are given it
Many call but few are answered
(') Don't fool with the blessing, Rachel
The magic is sustained through its use
Now you're going to tell me about magic
Give it a rest will ya
'm done
Not another word
(a crooked smile) know you like to be reminded sometimes
Rachel looks away
It's true
He's good at his job
113
-   -                 113 In the spotlight, all alone, Rachel Marron works her magic
She sings, as it was meant to be sung, " Have Nothing
" One person does not look at Rachel
He stands in a corner in front of the stage easily in the shadows
His eyes continually scanning
Picking up every movement
All alone
Watching
113A
-                           113A Fireworks explode over the water
82
114
-                                   114 In the living room, the first night party is in full swing
Crowded
Smoky
Noisy
Fireworks burst outside the windows
People clap
mixed bag of upscale partygoers: women in party dresses, men in open shirts, etc
black pianist is playing
Two bars at either end of the room
Waiters work the room with platters of canapes
115
'  -    -       115 Tony sits in a chair watching , a drink in his hand, oblivious to all
The lifeguard shuts Rachel's door be- hind him and makes his way down to the party
He pauses at the head of the stairs, checking out the party, and grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter
Frank catches the movement; the two men briefly lock eyes
The lifeguard responds with a knowing smile
116
-                         116 Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all guests are passing
As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk manned by one of Thuringer's uniformed guards
When their names have been checked off a master list, they walk past another guard wielding a metal detector
No one likes it, but they all do it
Most of the local  stations have sent camera crews
The handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright lights flaring
It's a local media event
Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his face
tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is cleared by the metal detector
He is
117
-                                   117 Portman makes his way through the crowd to the bar
His eyes scan the suite
His gaze settles on Frank checking out the people who filter in
Portman appears next to Frank
Hello, Farmer
83
Portman
Buy you a drink
Orange juice
It's been awhile
You on the job
(nods) Technically 'm off duty,   but the Governor may show up here   later, so  thought 'd give it   a light check
(smiles) Someone else is covering   him right now
How old is she
Maybe eighteen
You working
Rachel makes her entrance, and poses self-mocking on the landing above the crowd, accepting applause
She has succeeded in under-dressing everyone in the room
She is a star
Frank nods in her direction
that's his client
(impressed) No kidding
'd call that a step up from the President
Probably sings better too
Thank you
Thank you
You're so right
want everyone to have a good time and drink as much of Ben Schiller's liquor as you like
Rachel descends into the crowd, laughing and blowing kisses
Handful
Frank's look says if you only knew the half of it
84
heard you had to take someone out in New York
Frank remembers
lost track of you after the Reagan thing
Yeah
It wasn't your fault, Farmer
You weren't even there
pause
got a call a couple of months ago
That guy you were covering in New York
He said you'd recommended me
Surprised
little
(smiles) never doubted your skills
(laughs, good- natured) No
Only my qualifications for the priesthood
You were always clear about that
Anyway, appreciate it
had to turn it down but  appreciate it
Portman notices Rachel looking at him, as she makes her way to them
Rachel takes Frank's orange juice and sips
Makes a very funny face
That's orange juice
Rachel gives Portman an approving once-over
Who are you
85
Greg Portman
take it you've met my bodyguard
We used to work together
(suddenly more interested) Ah
Well, well, well
And what do you do now
Same thing as Farmer
(looking between them) Two samurai, eh
Frank and Portman eye each other
(to Portman) Are you working now
Not right now
Good
(she takes his arm) 'cause 'm the only one in the room who needs protection
She gives Frank a look and leads Portman into the crowd
118
-                            118 Rachel's taking a breather on the balcony, drinking cham- pagne, talking to Portman and another couple
Everybody's high and happy
Conversation bubbles
' Rachel leans into Portman; heads together, they whisper intimately
Rachel laughs, then for a brief moment, turns her head to look directly at Frank
Her look is petulant, defiant
Portman does not see this
119
-                                    119 86
Tony helps himself to a handful of canapes, he turns at the sound of a  out on the balcony
Someone's horsing around, spraying champagne from a bottle over everyone
woman screams
Frank   bolts for the balcony
121
-                                            121 Rachel and Portman are poised precariously halfway over the railing
Frank's hand shoots out, grabs Rachel's wrist and tugs at the pair of them
Portman regains his balance first and pulls Rachel back from the edge
What happened
Somebody tripped
It's okay
(looking at Portman) Thank God  had a bodyguard here
She grasps the railing and looks over
' Staring down twenty stories of distance between her and the pool area
Way, way below her, her champagne  hits the tile with a   sound
It's a long way down, Frank
(to Portman) You saved my life
Frank eyes the newly-welded anchor fixture
It has held
Rachel takes Portman by the arm
The front of her dress is stained with champagne
Maybe someone will keep an eye on me while  change
She leads Portman past Frank and up the stairs toward her bedroom
Frank and Portman lock eyes
Portman shrugs; he feels badly for Frank
122
-                                     122 87
Frank walks to the bar taking a drink from his glass
He looks in the mirror behind the bar and sees Rachel and Portman in the hall outside her bedroom
She turns her head to look directly at Frank's reflected face
Assured that Frank is watching, she takes Portman's hand and leads him into her room
Frank sets his glass down and the bartender refills it with orange juice
stunning    glides down the bar and stands very close to Frank
've been watching you all night from across the room
Why don't you go back there and keep watching
Frank looks at Rachel's doorway, sipping his juice
123
'  -                               123 Rachel and Portman are kissing, with some heat
Portman's hands are starting to explore her body
124
-                                    124 Frank still looks at Rachel's doorway, thinking
After a moment, he walks across the room to the sliding doors that lead to the balcony outside
125
-                                        125 Frank steps outside
No one there
The moonlight re- flects off the ocean
The  sounds a
It is peaceful and quiet
relief
On the Katz's balcony, forty feet away, little Mark Katz is leaning against the railing, staring at Rachel's suite
Frank smiles at him
(softly) Go to sleep
Frank looks out at the ocean
After a pause, in the background, Mark slips inside the Katz suite
126
'  -                               126 Rachel and Portman are still locked in the clinch
Realizing what she's doing, Rachel suddenly pulls back, 88
catching herself
'm not doing this
(still holding her) think you are
She steps out of his embrace
said  was grateful
Thank you and good night
She looks to the door that leads back to the party
The of   outside
She starts to cross to the door
(cool) Please go now
Portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching for her arm
Then he sees, through the doorway, Tony standing in the hall talking to a woman
Tony looks up at the sound of the door and sees them both
Rachel slips quickly out of Portman's grip
Mr
Portman was just leaving us, Tony
Portman hesitates, then smiles at Rachel and Tony and, with a quick peck on Rachel's cheek, slips past them back to the party
Rachel briefly scans the party crowd over Tony's shoulder but she doesn't see Frank
The door closes, leaving her alone in the room again
She reaches for a bottle of Scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight from the bottle
127
-                                        127 Frank looks out at the ocean
on the soundtrack, we hear the song ' ' that Rachel and Frank danced to
It sounds slow and sweet and a long way away
Frank stares out at the ocean
Totally divorced from everything in the suite behind him, in the world around him
There is only the moon and the ocean
For this 89
one moment, his guard is down
127A
-   -                 127A chambermaid is Hoovering the floor
Rachel steps out of her bedroom
She looks terrible
Hungover, she is wearing sunglasses and a loose smock
It is noon of the following day
130
-  -                     130 Frank is sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich
Behind him, in the dining room, a Cuban maid has set a place with breakfast
She is pouring orange juice as Rachel walks in
Rachel sits down at the table as though the walk in had been a terrible effort
She looks at the breakfast with distaste and picks up the coffee
Frank continues to eat
Rachel looks at him
(nasty) What the hell are you looking at
(pause) You probably never had a heavy night in your whole, goddamn disciplined life
Frank looks at her, continues to eat
You know, Farmer, you're a self- righteous son-of-a-bitch
Frank has to smile at this, which makes Rachel even angrier
Don't laugh at me, goddamit
And don't you dare judge me
Give me a break, will ya didn't tell you to fuck everybody in the hotel
132
-                        132 Special  Agents Court and Minella are watching the general manager  of the supply house as he pries the top off a huge canister  marked "
" The general manager  lifts the lid to reveal white powder
90
He talks animatedly and gestures around the warehouse
Court listens, nodding
Minella spoons some of the powder into a plastic bag and seals it
this we hear Court's voice, filtered as on a telephone line
(
) It matches the traces in the glue, Frank
We're getting to him
We're gonna nail this fucker
133
-  -                             133 Frank is on the courtesy phone
Yeah, well, don't take too long, Ray
(
) Hey, Frank
It's good money, isn't it
Frank hangs up
134
20TH   -    -      134 The elevator door opens and  Frank steps out
He walks toward the entrance to  the suite and is immediately alarmed by what  he sees: there is no uniformed guard by the front  door
He unlocks the door and goes inside
135
-  -                     135 Frank comes in and looks around quickly
'  - Looking over living room, hallways, balcony
No one in sight
Nothing disturbed
Devaney comes out of Rachel's bedroom, a panicked look on his face
They face each other across the gulf of the living room
Where is she
Where's Tony
91
don't know
thought you were with her
138
-   -                                138 Frank is at the telephone; he punches out three numbers
(into phone) Thuringer, this is Farmer
Where's your man on the door to the suite
(listens) Well get someone up here
Frank hangs up the phone, looks at Devaney
He doesn't know
They look at each other, worried
Frank walks out onto the balcony, looks round and down, comes back in
He heads for the front door
Where are you going
139
-   -                              139 Frank is almost at the door
We hear
key turns in the lock
Rachel and Tony come through the door in high spirits, their arms full of shopping bags and packages
Frank stops dead and    watches
Rachel glances at him and goes into the living    room
Tony looks at him meaning- fully and follows
Frank reflects for a moment, then pulls the front door    closed, oh so gently
140
-   -                                140 Rachel drops packages around and goes to the bar, pours herself a drink
Tony takes some packages to Rachel's bedroom
Hello, Devaney
Rachel, where the hell have you been
92
Tony and  went over to Bal Harbour
Did a little shopping
Tony comes back, a smile playing across his lips
Frank watches near the entrance
We were worried
(looks at Frank, talks to Rachel) You know you're not supposed to do that
Frank and Rachel look at each other
Farmer, you work here
Do you understand that
You work for me
Rachel
Frank turns and heads for the door
Devaney looks at him anxiously
Farmer, where are you going
'm gonna check the route
As usual
He opens the front door
uniformed guard is standing outside
Frank goes out and closes the door
Did Fletcher call
Devaney, staring after Frank, shakes his head "no
" 141
-                                   141 Frank's face shows the tension and the anger
The ele- vator descends
141A
-                                            141A Frank walks along the edge of the kitchen, looks over the workers
kitchen worker is in Frank's path
He looks up, sees Frank's face and scurries out of his way
142
-   -                        142 93
Frank walks along checking the corridor
At each door- way, he stops, looks inside
One room is dark
He flicks on the light
Near the door is a pile of wooden crates, placed unnaturally out from the wall
Frank walks over and looks inside
They are discarded vegetable crates
Frank goes back to the door and yells toward the kitchen
Gomez
Louis Gomez
He waits impatiently
No one comes
Two quick steps and he is back at the , throwing them violently into the corner where they  loudly to the floor
Frank walks on along the corridor
He stops, noticing something around the side
He investigates
An   is sitting on some boxes in the shadows
He doesn't bat an eye when he sees Frank
What are you doing
Is none of you fuckin' business
Move it
The Enormous Cuban gets slowly up from the boxes
He towers over Frank
Shove it up you ass, motherfucker
Frank has had   enough for one      afternoon
He hits the Cuban low and   hard
The man       crumples forward, hurt, but manages to   enfold Frank      in an awesome bear hug
His weight carries   them backward      in Frank's direction
The Cuban continues      moving in that direction, but Frank is no longer in his      grasp
Instead, incredibly, Frank seems to have passed      through the man's body and flicked him into the corner      of the stairwell
The Cuban hits the wall hard
Jarred but not lost, he comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a baseball bat
Frank steps in and      under the man's long arms and hits him four times around      the chest and jaw
Each of Frank's hands lands twice,      their movement is barely visible
The solid       tells the story
Frank strikes both 94
the Cuban's ears simultaneously with cupped hands
The Cuban goes down, stunned
Frank, his expression fierce, is upon him immediately
Frank's arms entwine the Cuban's and he begins to lift him roughly
At the end of the corridor, a woman screams
(
) Stop
Please
Don't hurt him
Please stop
Frank looks up
hotel  , carrying her purse, is running towards them, tears already on her face
Don't hurt my husband, mister
He not up to nothing
Frank lets the Cuban down gently and stands up
Dis- gusted with himself
Breathing hard, he leans back against the wall
The Cleaning Woman falls to her knees and hugs her husband protectively
'm sorry
Frank steps away, rubs a hand through his hair, tries to collect himself
He's standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes
He looks up and sees a marquee

145A
'  -                               145A Rachel is seated at her dressing table applying her makeup for the evening's performance
The telephone as she begins to work on her hair
Fletcher
No response
Baby, is that you
It's mommy, honey
(
) (eerily distorted) Guess again, whore
Fuck you and fuck Miami
'm coming for you
know where you are and 'm coming for you
95
Rachel is paralyzed by fear, unable to hang up the phone
146
-   -               146 Frank comes in the front door
He's had it
Devaney, who has been sitting alone in the living room, stubs out a cigarette and stands to meet him
Frank doesn't pause
'm through
'll get you back to and that's it
The guy with Fletcher can cover you till you get a replacement
She got another call, while you were downstairs and she answered it herself
It was him, Frank
Same guy
(moving toward balcony) don't care
Farmer, it really shook her up
She thought it was going to be Fletcher calling her from think she'll be reasonable now
(across him) Save it, Devaney
The people who hire me don't have to be convinced to save their own lives
Frank reaches the sliding door that leads to the balcony
Call me when she's ready to go down
Farmer -- Frank goes out on the balcony and slides the door closed behind him
147
-                                        147 Frank looks out at the ocean
The breeze washes over his face
huge brightly-lit yacht is sailing by, close to shore
Frank looks at it reflectively
96
He senses another presence and looks to his right
Rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair
The bright  moon- light illuminates her as she looks out to sea
She  is wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied
But tonight it hasn't come together
It doesn't work
She holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing
This is the only time we've seen her smoke
Farmer
Nothing that's happened between us matters
understand now
You're going to have to believe me, because 'm not going to beg
She takes a long drag on her cigarette
It wasn't what he said
it was the way he said it
he was so
Her voice cracks
She stops and tries to compose herself
need you
'm afraid
and hate it
hate my fear
(a beat) Please protect me
Protect Fletcher
If anything happened to him
Frank looks at her
Tears are destroying her elaborate stage makeup
She wipes them away with her hand
can't protect you like this
It's impossible
The odds are on his side
'll do whatever you say
This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say that
He studies her, then looks out at the ocean
want to take you away for a while
Rachel nods
Somewhere people don't know about
She nods again, agreeing
97
No Spector or Devaney or Tony
He looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation
There is none
If you cross me up this time, 'll kill you myself
Rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief
148
'  (, ) -   -      148 large, old, two-story house sits at the top of a slight rise, surrounded on three sides by thick, rolling woods
Sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards away is a broad expanse of lawn
Snow lies on the ground and in the trees
At the edge of  the lake, a dock and boathouse
An entrance road cuts  out of the trees
little  skitters to the edge of the drive van emerges from the trees, tires  through the snow
Frank's father, , steps onto the front porch
He's in his mid-60's, lean, tan and fit
He's wearing a plaid shirt, jeans and cowboy boots
The van stops in front of the house
Frank steps out from the driver's seat and eyes his dad
Lake's a little low
Fill up soon enough when she thaws
(glancing at the van) They all in trouble
Just one
149
-                                      149 Herb squats on the floor with Fletcher
Together, they are happily playing around with the fluffy terrier
Fletcher squeals with delight as the dog licks his face
Henry brings the remaining luggage through
Rachel and Nicki stand with Frank near the archway
All eyes are on 98
Fletcher, Herb and the dog
Rachel eyes the dog skeptically
That's going to protect us
He's a trained noisemaker
Terrific
don't like big dogs
They don't know who they're eating
150
-                                   150 Herb stands beside a butcher block, cutting vegetables for the evening meal with a practiced hand
Rachel watches, drink in hand, looking around the kitchen
It has been neatly organized
Katherine had this place organized just the way she wanted it
(seeing her questioning look) Frank's momma
There's the  and  of an outboard  from outside
Rachel looks from the kitchen window and sees Fletcher and Frank in the small skiff by the dock
Fletcher tugs again on the starter cord
At the third tug he tumbles backwards onto the seat
Fletcher doesn't swim well
guess he'd better stay in the boat then
(his smile puts her at ease) Frank tells me you're a singer
That's right
'm afraid we're a little out of touch here
'm sorry
Rachel waves this off
99
You must be very successful to need Frank
Rachel smiles and looks out of the window
It's so quiet here
Frank came back and stayed six months after the Reagan thing
Rachel's questioning look encourages Herb
Frank wasn't there the day he was shot
He never got over that
(a long pause) We buried Katherine that day
Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat
151
-                                       151 Fletcher, Rachel and Frank are chugging across the golden water in the skiff
Fletcher sits at the back, operating the outboard, controlling the movements of the boat
He wears a life vest
Rachel watches him proudly
Fletcher locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it for a laughing moment with a "Look, Mom, no hands" gesture
Rachel looks to Frank and smiles, the wind blowing her hair
- is  at water level by the lake's edge
In the distance, the small boat skims across the surface light mist is coming up
152
-                                       152 Henry helps Fletcher tie up the boat for the night
It is much foggier now and almost dark
don't want anyone going out in it until you've checked it over first
Okay
Every time
Henry nods
100
Every time
Every time
In the distance, Rachel and Fletcher have just reached the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him round and round in a circle
She hugs him close and kisses his hair
After a few moments, Fletcher squirms free and runs to catch up with Rachel
153
-                                        153 Rachel, munching on a raw carrot, browses a row of family photographs
The sounds of dinner being prepared come from the kitchen
We see the history of the family in the pictures; Frank as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger Herb; Herb as Police Chief of Bend, Oregon, being given a civic award; Frank as a college football wide receiver; Herb and Katherine Farmer, all dressed up and being introduced to Jimmy Carter by Frank; the picture-perfect family home in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers
Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger, talking to some female reporters
There standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are Frank and Portman
Portman's also smiling at the women, flirting
Frank is in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant
Rachel looks at the two of them for a second
Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a drink for Rachel in his hand
He watches her for a moment as she studies the photo
She turns and sees him
They lock eyes for several seconds
She smiles as he hands her the drink
(inclining his head toward the photo) Portman sometimes had trouble remembering what his job was
Supper's ready
We can see from Rachel's face that she feels embarrassed about her behavior in Miami
154
-                           154 The meal has been enthusiastically consumed
Fletcher's manhandling a chicken leg, his face covered with crumbs and drippings
Rachel shakes her head, laughing
101
And  never hit him
Ever
To this day
(to Frank) That's true, isn't it
(to Rachel) That's very unusual for my people
So what happens
When he's ten years old, he complains about it
Can you believe that
Oh, for Chrissake
'm going to tell her about the time you stripped in court
Frank gets up smiling and takes some dishes into the kitchen
(to Frank) don't care
'm proud of that
(to Rachel) Anyway, he's ten years old and he's just started playing tackle football
He comes to me and tells me he's afraid of getting hit, right
And he thinks it's because  never hit him
'Why don't you ever hit me
' he says to me
155
-                                     155 Frank puts down the dishes in the darkened kitchen
(back over his shoulder) If you're lucky, maybe he'll tell you about my first jockstrap
As he speaks, he peers out through the window at the lake
We hear Herb's voice continue from the other room
(
) He got over it: Turned into a helluva wide receiver
He couldn't stand being afraid
When he found something that scared him, he'd just do it 'til the fear went away
156
-                                 156 102
His mother was the same way
Rachel smiles at him, thinking, then looks through at Frank in the kitchen, still peering out of the windows
Nicki watches Rachel
157
-                                    157 Herb delicately lifts  a chessboard from the top of a cabinet and walks it  over to the table:  half-finished game
He leans over   and blows on the pieces -- sending a small cloud of dust  into the air
Come on, son, you can run but you can't hide
Herb pulls up a chair and smiles as Frank appears from the kitchen, a bowl of popcorn in his hand
Frank takes a place across from his dad by the fire
The others gather round
Your move
Frank studies the board
Rachel lowers her head into a cupped hand, fascinated
How long has this game been going on
Frank picks up a knight, thinks, sets it back down
Three years
Nicki takes the bowl of popcorn and squats down with it beside Fletcher
Fletcher peers intently at the board as he chews on a handful
He had me on the run there that first year
Frank picks up his rook, scratches his forehead with it
He turns to Fletcher
What do you think
Fletcher finishes a mouthful of popcorn, wipes his mouth
Knight to king-four
103
Frank, Herbert and Rachel turn in synch and stare at the boy
City kid
Herb pats his leg, gesturing to Fletcher to take a place on his lap
Come over here, Fletcher, sit by me
Fletcher goes over and joins him
Well, that's it for me, 'm going to bed
She rises
Frank follows her up the stairs
Nicki watches them go
158
-                                  158 Frank stops at the end of the hallway, checking the lock on the window, the little terrier is at his heels
Rachel pauses outside the door
Frank gestures for the dog to stay
The dog sits in the middle of the hallway looking from one to the other
For a few seconds neither speaks
Frank smiles
Good night, Rachel
Rachel accepts this
She smiles in return and touches him on the arm, very tenderly
Good night, Frank
Rachel turns, goes to her room and closes the door
159
-                                   159 Details are barely distinguishable in the fog
We hear the gentle  of the  against the dock
160
-                                    160 Fletcher is asleep, snuggled on Herb's lap by the fire
Herb is also asleep
Frank fetches a blanket and gently 104
covers them both
He puts out the light
161
-                               161 Frank steps quietly into the hall
Nicki is standing in the shadows
She watches as Frank goes through the ritual of locking the front door, several ways
(softly) You're very thorough
- Frank makes a circuit through the rooms of the first floor, checking windows and doors
Nicki tags along
What's happening between you and Rachel
Frank glances at her
Come on
One minute she's got magnetic hands, the next she hates you
can't figure out what it is now
You follow all her moves this closely
(smiling) It's a living
No, it isn't
He moves away into the next room
She hesitates a moment, then follows
You think my life is pretty sickly, don't you
No
You must
do
Frank steps into a tight, dark, little window alcove, checks the windows
105
Why don't you change it
Is it that easy
Frank turns from the window to find Nicki blocking his exit
She moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his shoulders
The kiss ends and they look at each other
You're a lovely woman
But you don't want me
Frank's look affirms it
Nicki is embarrassed, angry
'm surprised
Thorough fellow like you
Why stop at one sister when you can fuck them both
make my mistakes
But you didn't say no to the boss
She starts to turn away from him, but his hands are on her now, holding her close, refusing to let her turn away
Their faces are very close
It is tight and near here
(with force) No, don't go away, Nicki
Don't leave me with that
Tell me about it
Tell me how long you've been second
Tell me how she has a child and you don't
Tell me something
But don't turn away and try to stick it on me
Nicki twists in his grip
He holds her tight
don't need this from you
Maybe  need it
'm fed up with people telling me    they have no control over their    lives
If you hate your life so    much, turn it around
106
It's not so simple
Yes it is
You can walk out that fucking door anytime you want
'll unlock it for you
Nicki looks up into his face
Tears start in her eyes
Let me go
He releases her, looks at her
Okay
It's not my business
He moves away,
We   Nicki, a long time
162
-                                              162 Bright sun
Frank and his father walk along the lake shoreline, stooping here and there to finger animal prints in the snow and mud
Raccoon
deer
Herb nods
Their attention is drawn to soft singing up by the house
162A
-                                             162A Nicki absently sings an old gospel tune as she tosses breakfast scraps to a group of hungry ducks gathered by the porch
162B
-                                              162B 've never heard church music in the middle of the week before
162C
-                                             162C Nicki's soft voice is joined by Rachel's strong harmony, and the two men watch as Rachel comes out to join her sister on the porch, startling Nicki
Both sing for a moment, together
Then Nicki stops, embarrassed
Rachel gives her a hug
107
162D
-                                             162D Herb and Frank are about to return to the house
They stop short
There, at their feet, is a line of human foot prints, from heavy snow boots, leading away into the trees
Frank looks at Herb, suddenly alert
Where's Fletcher
Henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a fishing rod as he comes out
At that instant, the sound of the    through the air
Frank's head snaps toward the boathouse
Henry, in the distance, looks quickly at the boathouse, then to Frank
(shouting) Frank
haven't
But Frank is already moving, leaping from the porch and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse and dock
Rachel turns to look
The skiff appears out of the boathouse, Fletcher at the motor, the boat's lone occupant
The boat moves slowly away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock
Frank is running toward the water with everything he's got, his face contorted
The sound of the drowns out his voice as he yells
Fletcher
Fletcher
Fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither hears nor sees Frank running down the lawn behind him
The boat is approaching the end of the dock
Frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to sprint after the boat
His weight rattles the boards as he runs
Fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the throttle a little twist
108
Frank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives directly at the rear of the moving boat
Frank's body flies out over the boat
He knocks Fletcher out of his seat and into the water on the other side of the skiff
(screams) No
He can't swim
Frank holds the terrified, shaking Fletcher in his arms
Fletcher begins to cry
Frank paddles with him toward the dock
The empty boat swerves, then continues out toward the center of the lake
Henry and Rachel are already    at the end of the dock
Nicki and Herb are running toward    it
Rachel is livid, hysterical
Henry peers out at the boat,    which continues to bounce innocently across the water,    defining a broad curve
Fletcher, baby
Are you all right
Baby
Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank
Rachel hugs Fletcher to her
Herb bends down to check he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket
He's all right
Henry helps Frank up out of the water
Frank sits on the end of the dock, breathing hard
What are you doing
You out of your mind
You're crazy
(to Fletcher) You're all right, baby
(back to Frank) You could have drowned him
Frank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come to a stop out in the middle of the lake
'm sorry
got careless
Henry looks at Frank
He feels terrible about not checking the boat
Frank, 'm sorry
should have
109
It's okay, Henry
Herb puts his hand on Fletcher's head
You all right now, son
Fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly
Frank begins to stand up
How do we get the boat back
Out in the center of the lake, the
Every- one on the dock jumps
Nicki screams
Frank sits down again
He shakes his head
On an impulse, he stretches out his hand, palm downward
It's trembling slightly
162E
-                                           162E Rachel and Nicki hurriedly pack their bags
Fletcher hovers nearby
162F
/ - 162F Frank slides out from under the van
The hood is up
Henry stands nearby
Frank goes to the driver's seat
(to Henry) Back off
Henry moves away from the van
Frank inserts the key in the ignition
162G
-                                             162G Herb comes out of the house, fast
His eyes scan the woods as he heads towards the shed
Frank
Henry turns and motions to Herb to stay away
162H
-                                               162H 110
Frank takes a moment, then turns the key
Nothing
The van is dead
162-
-                                                162- Henry and Herb watch
Frank gets out of the van
He walks to Herb
Someone's cut the phone lines
It could be anywhere between here and town
Both the cars are dead
And can't see how it was done
Frank and Herb exchange a look
Who could know we're here
This place has nothing to do with her
Maybe it has to do with you
Frank looks at him
We can't walk out of here at night with them
Frank shakes his head
We'll button down tonight and walk out at first light
162J
-                                      162J There is a light ground-mist
The moon shines down down brightly but the house is totally dark
162K
-  -                                   162K The terrier dog listens in the upstairs hallway
Herb watches from an upstairs window
Rachel lies in bed, clutching Fletcher tightly
164
-                               164 Frank has been sitting in a chair in the center of the living room for two hours
Listening
Now we listen 111
with him
At first it seems silent, but slowly we become aware of a subtle symphony of sounds
An old house sur- rounded by
There are lots of
But they are regular, innocent
Frank is aware of a new noise, a gentle sobbing coming from nearby
He picks up his gun from the table beside him and goes into the kitchen
166
-                                        166 Nicki is sitting with her head in her hands at the kitchen table, sobbing
There's a nearly empty bottle beside her
Frank is instantly on the alert but makes no sign
(crying) was an idiot last night
There is a long pause
What do you think about today
(gently) think this is no maniac
He knows what he's doing
There is a long, long silence
Nicki continues crying
Finally -- You're right
He does
Tell me about it
She doesn't reply
Who is it, Nicki
He almost got Fletcher today
How do we stop him
my darling Fletcher
Who is it
112
don't know
don't know
Frank goes to her, treats her gently, like a doctor
You can call him off
(shaking her head) He doesn't even know who hired him
He doesn't know who  am and don't know who he is
How'd you do it
She seems on the edge of hysteria
Frank takes her face in his hands, strokes her hair, brings her back from the brink
How
went to a bar in East asked around
talked to a man
Name
(vague) Armando
He arranged it
That's all  know
Is it all paid for
(nods) and then some
Till it's done
He keeps going until he kills her
Nicki nods again, lowering her face into her hands
What's the name of the bar
'm not sure
was very stoned
How 'bout the letters
113
(desperately) No, no
You don't understand
The letters came first
don't know who's sending them
but they're reading my mind
Those were my thoughts
hate her
It made me think  could do it
But could never hurt Fletcher
Never
(begging him) You've got to stop it
We will
You and me
Tomorrow we're going back to
We're going to find the bar, we're going to find Armando
He starts to rise
She stops him
Don't you even want to know why
You told me
She has everything
Frank stands up and begins to move across the room
Nicki puts her face in her hands and is silent for one moment
Suddenly, Frank freezes, listening
What if we can't -- Frank motions her into silence
We strain to hear what Frank hears
Silently, Frank goes to the door, crouch ing
He listens
There again is a   from the  upstairs
Frank lifts his gun from the table, turns to Nicki
Stay here
Don't move
Nicki's face shows true terror
Frank is out the door
168
-                                       168 Frank runs up them fast
Two at a time
169
-                            169 114
Frank travels close to the wall, very quickly
He stops, listens
The  looks at Frank but still
Frank throws open Rachel's door
Rachel gasps in surprise and clutches at Fletcher
Frank hears a noise behind him, whirls round him and drops to a knee, weapon ready to fire
It's Herb, stepping out of his room, carrying a police- issue pistol
It's me
Rachel's voice comes from her room
(
) What's happening
The terrier suddenly starts barking loudly
171
-  -   -          171 We're in someone's  moving along the hallway
Nicki steps out of the kitchen a few feet ahead and looks in terror toward the
(
) No, no
stop
'm the one who
172
-                             172 Frank and Herb spin around
Rachel calls from her room
Frank
172A
-                              172A Nicki against the wall, her hand still delicately raised in a classic gesture of restraint
172B
-                             172B Frank's head spins to Rachel's doorway, then immediately back to Herb
He starts to move towards the stairs, fast
(to Herb) Stay with Rachel
Henry's head appears round the doorway of Herb's room
115
173
-                                         173 Frank is rapidly down the stairs, gun in hand
173A
-                            173A Frank finds Nicki's body slumped against the wall
He checks her
She's dead
The door beyond is open
The wind blows in
Outside it's foggy
(yelling) Dad
(
) We're okay
Stay with Rachel
The  continues to  upstairs
Frank sees a slight movement outside and window to his right
split-second moment of decision
He heads off rapidly down the hall, away from the open door
175
-                                   175 The fog is thick
Frank swiftly emerges from the back door and stops, dead still, listening
There is only the of
175A
'  -                               175A Herb is by Rachel's bed
What's happening
Where's Nicki
Be quiet
175B
-                                   175B Frank listens
Suddenly he hears  , a body breaking through the bushes
Frank heads off towards the sound at a run
176
-                                          176 - 116
The move fitfully through the eerie, beautiful scene
In and out of the fog
Stop, listen,  wait, go
Two wary, interchangeable animals
Frank  disappears into the fog
When the figure reappears,  Frank is moving faster, closing the gap
The figure, seen in  for the first time, is wear- ing a dark-colored ski mask
His breath billows out of the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air
He hears Frank  and points his gun in the direction of the
He does not fire
Frank stops and rests on his haunches
Listening, he hears the intruder move
The sounds have stopped up ahead
Close
The figure peers into the fog, gun up
He's ready, confident
He waits
Nothing
Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new
He raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready to fire
He holds it easily
And then he does something really strange: Frank closes his eyes
After a beat, we hear
Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun 15 degrees and
The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered six inches from his shoulder
His eyes are wild behind his ski mask
Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in the opposite direction
We
There is from Frank very close to the man
176A
'  -                               176A Herb is at the window
There is anguish on his face as he hears the
He wants to go to his son's aid but knows he cannot leave Rachel
Rachel and Fletcher are huddled in the bed, terrified
Fletcher clutches at the , which is still
Henry stands by the bed, gun in hand
176B
-                                          176B Frank moves quickly through the woods, passes the splintered tree
We   him and hear the of a   to life and    of the dirt
Frank breaks out of the woods in time to see the red lights at the back of the car as it fishtails around a bend
He  his  at it
We hear , but the car keeps going
176C
-   -              176C 117
Snow is falling
In the b
g
we see the flashing lights of a police car
Frank is on the phone to Minella
(
) But, Frank, this doesn't make sense
What do you mean
(
) We already got him
What
Where
179
( ) -     179 Minella is talking with Frank on the phone
He's looking into an observation room through a one-way window
Here, last night
You should see his locker, Frank
The guy's obsessed with Rachel Marron
You're sure it's him
Forensics say it's 100 percent positive
And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4
Ray's with him now
' Sitting in the observation room at a table talking to Ray Court is Dan
He looks frightened and confused
179A
-   -            179A Well, whoever you got down there wasn't here last night
This was a professional
(
) This is crazy
What do you want to do, Frank
How long can you keep him
118
(
) Well technically all he's done is write some letters
48 hours maximum
You know the deal
181
-  -                        181 Rachel's black limousine moves slowly up the winding drive, followed by a black Mercedes limousine
Behind the cars, the gates close on a large press contingent gathered outside, held back by a large number of police and security guards
light drizzle is falling
The two cars pull up to the entrance, Henry at the wheel of Rachel's
Frank gets out of the front and opens the back door
Devaney and Spector help Rachel and Fletcher out of the car
They are all dressed in black
few other mourners, including Emma, get out of the Mercedes
Rachel, red-eyed and weary, takes Fletcher under her arm and goes inside
She does not look at Frank
182
-                                    182 hand takes a pitcher of orange juice from the refriger- ator and pours some into a large glass
They uncap a bottle of vodka and pour a huge portion into the orange juice
183
-                                    183 It has grown very dark in the family room
Frank is sitting all alone, perfectly still, in one of the over- stuffed chairs, the vodka bottle on a table next to him
He stares off into space
small voice comes out of the darkness
You okay, Frank
Frank acknowledges Fletcher's small presence standing to the side of the big chair
He doesn't look at him directly
Yeah, Fletcher, 'm okay
How 'bout you
couldn't sleep
It was so scary, just thinking about it
He looks at Frank
119
Do you feel scared, Frank
Yeah, Fletcher,  do
Frank puts his hand gently on Fletcher's head, but he does not look at him
Everybody's afraid of something, Flethcer
That's how we know we care about something, when we're afraid we'll lose it
What are you afraid of
think you should try to go back to sleep now, pal
Tell me, Frank, please
Is it the man who killed Nicki
Are you afraid of him
Finally, Frank turns and looks at Fletcher
Frank is pretty far gone
He shakes his head "no
"     He realizes that that kind of fear had never occurred to   him, and recognizing that fact sets him back into his   thoughts
Then what
What are you afraid of
Frank doesn't have the will to resist anymore
He lets his hand drop away from Fletcher
'm afraid
of not being there
Fletcher stares at him, uncomprehending
It's late
Do you want me to take you back to your room
Fletcher shakes his head "no," just barely
Then he disappears
185
-                                         185 Frank, silhouetted, moves toward the stairway to the main level
There is light up there
120
186
-                                     186 Frank begins climbing the stairs
When he has gone a quarter of the way up, Rachel appears at the top and begins walking down
At first she doesn't see Frank; when she does she hesitates a moment, then continues down
They meet and try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the same direction, unable to get around
Rachel, already emotionally ravaged, cracks
She begins slapping Frank hard about the face and torso
One of the first blows knocks the  from his hand; it  loudly against the wall
He raises his arms in a half-hearted attempt to protect himself from the onslaught
She cries as she hits him
(hysterical) You, you, you
You brought this pain into my house
Now you're here
Where were you then
Why didn't you save her
It was your job to protect me and she died doing it
It was me they were after
And you let them kill her
(she gasps for air) She never did anything to anyone
As she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her blows become sloppy, weak
She sinks to the steps, sitting on them, sobbing
She never hurt anyone
She was good
(she looks at him; entreats him) You saw her
She never wished anyone any harm
Did she
Did she
Frank looks at her, shakes his head "no
" Rachel puts her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments; her crying slows
(finally, quietly) She never hurt a soul
(long pause) didn't love her well enough
didn't take care of her
(a beat) She gave me only love
121
She sits quietly on the steps in the gloom
Frank watches for a long moment, then softly continues on his way
186A
-   -                       186A It's bright sunshine
Fletcher is splashing noisily in the pool with a few other kids
His nanny waits patiently at the side, towels at the ready
At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought, mourning her sister
At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful
He, too, is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears some of the responsibility
The  and  of the kids continue
187
-  -              187 The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi- nated in the distance
The guard patrols at his station
Inside, the
screens flicker and glow
Perched on the top of a slight   hill, Frank sits alone and motionless under a big tree
He gazes down at the gate- house, his face lit softly by   the glow from its lamps
All around him the rest of the   estate is quiet and tranquil in the moonlight
After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap- proaches and stands beside him
It's Rachel
guess you've heard what's happening
Frank nods
Mind if  sit down
Frank shakes his head
They sit side by side for awhile, both lost in thought
Rachel seems very calm
It isn't over yet, is it
Frank shakes his head
He knows he still hasn't got you
So he'll come again
122
It's possible
The Oscars
Maybe
Rachel takes this philosophically
She tugs at the grass, thinking
When  was back in Squirrel Hill, started betting my friends fifty bucks each that someday 'd win an Oscar
You can understand how important it is that they see me up there if  win
She looks at him and smiles
If everyone of those pikers comes through, it could add up to a lot of money
think it's very dangerous
know
But  can't stay up here on my hill forever
They are silent for awhile
Rachel lies back on the grass, stares at the sky
didn't get to this place in my life by doing the smart thing every time
(as Frank nods) How 'bout you, Frank Farmer
Out there on the edge
did you ever do something that didn't make too much sense, except maybe inside you
In your stomach somewhere
Something that wasn't smart
(looks at him) 'll bet you have plenty
'll bet you do
Nobody gets really good without it
And you're good
know that
She sits up beside him
123
don't know why all this has happened to me
(a beat) but  do know that none of it's your fault
hope you can hear me, because this is how  say 'm sorry
Frank accepts
(relieved) So
'm going to go see if  win an Oscar
And  won't worry about it at all
Because 've got you to protect me
Frank almost smiles
That's right
He looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms
He kisses her and lays her down
His body moves over hers
Like a bodyguard, protecting her from the night
188
-                            188 The chaos and razamatazz of Oscar night
Crowds, limos, cameras, searchlights
189
'  -     -           189 The limo is waiting in a line of limos to reach the red- carpeted entrance to The Pantages Theatre
Frank and Tony sit in front with Henry
In the back a spectacularly-gowned Rachel sits flanked by Devaney and Spector, both of whom, like Frank, are wearing tuxedos
Up ahead, they can all see the hubbub at the entrance: cameras, lights, photographers, arriving guests, two bleachers full of fans
The glare from the arc lights is almost blinding
We'll go straight back to the Green Room
Right, Frank
Frank nods
Got that, Tony
124
Tony knows what he's doing
Tony looks at Frank, surprised and not a little pleased with the unexpected support
wish you boys would relax a little
Nothing bad's gonna happen out there, alright
(the old Rachel) Unless  lose the fucking award
She looks around at the men, all are tense
Jesus, what a crew
Rachel leans forward and flips down the mirror on the panel in front of her and checks her appearance
The limo moves up
Screw it
'm through worrying
When your number's up, it's up
Right, Farmer
The limo is almost at the red carpet
Frank slips out the front door of the moving limo

-                                          190 More quartz lights click on
The  cameras all focus on the door of the limo as Frank steps out of the way
' as he surveys the busy scene
microphoned
peers into Rachel's limo and walks toward it
Miss Rachel Marron
we see Rachel wave to the crowd
Everyone wishes you the best tonight, Rachel
Frank leads the small procession down the red carpet
Fans reach out asking for his autograph
' 125
as his glance darts around: high into the bleachers, ahead in the distance, to the door, to the side at photographers nodding to the massed security men with their walkie-talkies
Rachel's smile is convincing, lovely, professional
Spector, Devaney and Tony look strained
As they enter, a   from across the street shows their limo pulling ahead as the next car pulls up
The to reveal the rear fender of a Toyota 4X4 parked in the foreground

-                                       191 It is large and has been fitted with a bar and buffet
Formally-dressed presenters and hosts mill about, laugh- ing and talking
Many greet Rachel
monitor hangs from the ceiling in one corner
On it, the Academy Awards continue
An elaborate dance number is just concluding
The audience applauds
Beside the monitor, a large clock with a ticking second hand
harried associate producer  , comes up to Rachel, settled in an armchair
Tony stands nearby, Frank leans against a far wall
Hello, Rachel
need to get you straight on your responsibilities
Sure, Skip
Skip takes a typewritten sheet from a sheaf in his hand and gives it to Rachel
He consults a clipboard as he speaks
There, laid out minute by minute, is the order of the evening's events
Each one has a precise time printed beside it, including those that involve Rachel
Now, it's Best Sound, then another song, then you
At precisely (looks at his clipboard) -- 8:07, you'll be presenting with Clive Healy
Those are your lines
The prompter's straight ahead and -- we pray -- working perfectly
Rachel nods
126
Fine, you'll be a big shot someday, Skip
Skip smiles and walks off, glancing up at the clock
7:43
, a slim British actor appears, bows and kisses Rachel's hand
understand it's my great honor to escort you onstage
That's right, Clive
And  don't like it one bit that you look skinnier than me
- The show is progressing, flashing out across the world
And the award for Best Achievement in Sound goes to Kay Colvin and Mychal Smith for Hot And Cold
Applause
Thank you so much
want to thank our producers, Karen Golden and Ed Gorsuch, as well our sound crew -- Richard Goodman and Blair Forward
'm too excited -- but they're the real winners tonight
Thank you
This is wonderful
This is like, the happiest moment of my life
'd like to thank our wonderful sound crew for all the evenings and weekends they sacrificed, the incredible wizards down at Distant Thunder Sound Studios, Roger and Greg for hiring us and my family for being so patient
We did it
Thank you

Rachel is deep in a giggling, girlish conversation with another actress
Skip Thomas approaches Rachel again
127
Rachel
One more song, then you
Rachel nods, goes back to her conversation
Frank steps up to Tony
'm going to have a look around
'll come back for her
Stay alert
Tony nods, watches Frank go
193
-                                      193 Frank moves down the hall from the Green Room toward the stage
Stagehands, technicians, performers speak in hushed tones
monitors are mounted throughout the area
On screen a distinguished-looking actor named is serving as temporary master of ceremonies
Frank walks along, checking the route, looking up into the flies
He rounds a corner and is face to face with Portman
Portman
What are you doing here
'm on the job
Who
Him
Portman points at a nearby  monitor
On screen, Reardon is introducing the next song
(
) (on  screen) My mother has always thought  was the star of every movie 've been in
You remember 'Night Of The Stranger'
Applause
(
) You probably don't remember me in that
My mother can tell you about it
To this day, she thinks it's about a desk clerk at the hotel where what's-his-name is hiding out from the cops
128
Laughter
(
) Now it's time to hear the final nominated song, from the film 'Queen Of The Night' -- ' Have Nothing
' And here to sing it for us, the multi-talented Miss Sandra Castle
(
) (during the above) Short-term gig
but quite profitable
Listen, Frank, 'm sorry about Miami
You know, nothing really happened
felt bad for you
wanted to say something, but you disappeared
(: " Have Nothing" fanfare
Dancers onto stage
First section of song, commencing with shortened chorus then first verse (Total 1 Minute) Reardon walks off the stage ten feet from where Frank and Portman are standing, glances at them and moves off down the hall
Back to work
'll probably see you at the Governor's Ball
Portman walks off after Reardon
Frank watches him, thoughtful
- Sandra Castle sings " Have Nothing" with great feeling
The lyrics recall the text of the death threat
' suddenly wary
No rational cause
Something in the air

She is at a makeup table

The celebrities in the Green Room are impressed with Sandra's performance
There is spontaneous applause
Rachel turns to the room
want that broad run out of town

195
-                                     195 Frank calls Tony on his -
Tony, you there
(
) Yeah, Frank
Tony, 've got a feeling this is the night
think he's gonna go for her in front of all the cameras
The kind of thing only a lunatic would do
That's how he wants it to look
Except he isn't a lunatic
He's very clever need you to help me
(
) 'm with you, Frank
There's no more competition between them
Three sound technicians appear at Frank's side, very agitated
(to Frank) You can't use that thing back here
The  breakthrough's killing our radio mikes
We'll have to disconnect you
Reluctantly, Frank disconnects his earpiece
195A
- 195A Tony fiddles with his earpiece
Frank
Frank
Technicians approach Tony, too
195B                                                      195B Big finish of song and dance number (total 40 seconds)
Applause and dancers off

196
-                                           196 Frank walks past Tony
Tony holds up the earpiece in frustration
Frank nods
He walks over to Rachel
He seems tense and she senses it
And like a tangible thing, his anxiety is passed over to her
She is frightened
(spooked) What's wrong
Skip Thomas appears at her side
Rachel
Clive
Let's go, okay
Clive Healy comes over
Rachel must tear her eyes away from Frank
Tony floats up behind them
Skip regards him with irritation and turns to Frank
(indicating Tony) Really
Must we have everyone
We have our own men at the door
Tony stays
Skip looks at Rachel for a response
Yes
want him
Skip shrugs
Clive takes Rachel's arm
Come, Rachel, let us brighten the firmament
Rachel forces a smile, but her eyes follow Frank as he starts to lead the way out of the Green Room
On an impulse, she reaches for something from the makeup table and presses it into her hand
It's the Russian Orthodox cross
She clutches it like a talisman and follows Frank
Tony brings up the rear
197
-                                 197 The group moves down the hall from the Green Room, past the stage right wings
Behind the scenery to the back of the stage
'  - 131
in blue, celebrity guests, technicians
His eyes examine each curtain, corner and recess
He looks above him
'  as she looks around nervously
is tense on Clive's arm
Clive pats her arm soothingly
Try to relax, Rachel
know you must be very excited
Skip leads them to a set of temporary stairs behind the scenery; they lead to the center of the top tier
Production aides with clipboards and headphones wait up there
- 8:05 (pointing) Rachel, you'll go in there and Clive, you over there
You'll meet on the landing
They both nod, but Rachel is distracted, tense
Watch your step going down
Someone spilled some water
Clive and Rachel climb the stairs
Rachel turns once more to look anxiously at Frank
She clutches the cross but he doesn't see
Frank watches them ascend
He signals Tony to stay there until Rachel goes on
Frank moves off toward the stage left wings
- we see Reardon, acting as Master of Ceremonies, doing the introductions
(
) (on screen) used to have an outfit just like that
And to present the Best Song award we have our debonair friend from England and the lady who has everything -- Clive Healy and Rachel Marron
red camera light clicks on
, , as we see Clive and Rachel make their entrances on the  monitor
132
198
-                                            198 Frank swiftly adjusts his position so he can still see the stage
As he does, he glances under the scaffolding that supports the set
199
-                                        199 Rachel and Clive reach the podium
Clive is all smiles
Rachel is trying, but is obviously distracted
As the applause dies away, we see  what they see: cameras, an orchestra in the pit,  the huge audience, and the bright glare of the lights
At the front of the podium is the transparent plastic  of the teleprompter; their lines can be clearly seen,  printed out and moving vertically
(reading from the prompter) Well, Rachel,  know that you only came tonight to present this award and you'll want to leave as soon as we're done
Rachel's lines appear on the prompter, but she does not start reading them immediately
They stop moving on the screen
Rachel's face, her eyes darting about
There is an awful silence
'  - on the nearest  camera
The teleprompter, now showing Clive's lines
The light
man in the first row of the audience
as they squeeze the cross
(
) Over the course of the evening we've heard five smashing songs and the names of the artists who created them
200
-                                            200 Frank, watching Rachel, hears the barely audible start from the tiny receiver on his belt
He's puzzled
His eyes dart to Rachel's hand and he sees the cross
He knows what she's going through
Her hand is shaking 133
badly
201
-                                        201 She sways
Clive supports her as discreetly as he can, smiling out at the audience
Clive and Rachel, we watch as Clive picks up Rachel's lines from the prompter,   to make them fit
And  know that no matter what anyone thinks, you have no personal favorites
Thin laughter
The audience is starting to sense that something is wrong with Rachel
The Best Song nominees are: "Clock On The Wall" from 'The Dining Room Table' -- By Dana

The teleprompter operator has been thrown off and now takes a moment to get it moving again

It reads: "  " Music by Rachel gasps, stifles a scream
And the winner is " Have Nothing" 135
from 'Queen Of The Night' music and lyrics by Nancy Garbor
Rachel loses control, backs away from the podium and runs off stage right
The audience applauds the winner
This is so exciting
can't begin to describe what it feels like to stand here -- with this
First,  want to thank Rachel Marron
Without her support, encouragement and determination to help get an unknown songwriter heard,  wouldn't be standing here
lot of people talk about how they're going to help others once they make it themselves, but Rachel really follows through
'd also like to thank Helen Pollak, a wonderful producer, who never got fed up with me
205
-                                     205 Frank sees Rachel run off the opposite side of the stage and heads over there, around the back of the scenery
206
-                                           206 Clive, the professional, stands holding the envelope
He glances off after Rachel, mystified
207
-                                  207 cluster of people   surround Rachel, comforting her
Frank comes up
He    does not try to force his way through to Rachel
People    begin to move away, the cluster thins
Two stars move off   toward the back of the stage
#1 always said she was nuts
've always said that
Clive Healy comes up
Is she all right
He is assured that she is
Clive goes out to his seat 136
in the audience
As the people move off, Rachel becomes clearly visible to Frank
Tony is standing next to her, but another man has his arm around Rachel, comforting her
Rachel's face is tear-stained and she dabs at it with a handkerchief
She is recovering fast
Past her fear, she is now very embarrassed
Her voice is strong
Christ, what an idiot  am
Jesus
What the hell's the matter with me
Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony, who is confused by Rachel's behavior
Rachel turns toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting her around to face Frank
It is Reardon
Farmer, you've made me a raving lunatic
Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he   by Reardon's presence
Frank looks around them quickly    for Portman
Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and   turns back toward the Green Room
production aide    signals Reardon
(to Rachel) have to go back out
Are you okay
Thank you for your help, John
'm fine
Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony
Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage
Frank stops him
Reardon is irritated
Where's Portman
Who
Portman
(breaking away) Never heard of him
Reardon walks out on stage
Frank is left standing alone
All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum
Frank looks around, then moves off toward the Green Room

-                                         208 Rachel sits at a makeup table
Skip Thomas approaches, clipboard in hand
Rachel, 'm sorry, but if you're going to be in your seat for the Best Actress award, you've got to do it now
Skip, 'm moving as fast as  can
For chrissake, go twitch somewhere else
Skip backs off
Spector and Frank join the group
Honey, everything's fine
No one noticed anything
Everybody in this building is ready to jump out of their skin from nerves
Bullshit, you saw me
Farmer's made me a raving lunatic -- Something's going on you should know about -- You're making her crazy
You're making us all crazy
Rachel,  know who it is
He's here tonight
think he's
Shut up
This is the last straw
She throws down the powder and stands up fast, makeup and purse flying
The powder com- pact bursts over the cross lying on the table
Everyone in the Green Room looks at her
(hissing at him) Shut up, you maniac
You never stop
Now you've made an ass of me in front of a billion people
And you won't quit
They stare at each other and everyone else stares at them
138
Rachel walks swiftly out the door of the Green Room
Frank sits for a moment, then stands up
The bodyguard follows his charge to the door
He whispers hurriedly at Tony as they leave
Tony, it's Portman
Remember
The guy from Miami
Spector grabs Tony's sleeve, pulling him back
After tonight, you're back in charge
What
He knows nothing about show business
Tony squares off with Spector
You are an asshole

-                                      209 Reardon is just introducing  , the actor who will announce the Best Actress award

) Reardon intros Winston
Play on Winston to applause

-                              210 Presenting the Best Actress award, we have the man who last year received the top honor an actor can achieve for his performance in "South Of Waco"
Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Winston
Frank watches, his eyes scanning, searching the vast theatre, squinting as he tries to see beyond the glare of the klieg lights and the cameras
Thank you, John, thank you, Academy
139
It brings back some great memories to be standing here again
Last year  figured something out
While it is a great honor to be nominated, actually winning caps the evening very pleasantly
on stage, speaking and then listing the nominees
'  - , in their seats, up the aisle toward the back of the theatre, high into the gloom of the balcony
Tonight we give this award not to the best actress, but to the best performance by one of five exquisitely talented artists
'  - searching
- focused on the audience
Its red light goes on
Rachel's face, expectant, nervous on the screen
'  - Rachel would have to take to the stage, the steps to the stage, the faces of the ushers near the stage, the conductor, ready to play theme music
(
) And the nominees for best performance by an actress in a leading role are -- Constance Simpson for Hot and Cold
Frank slips through the curtained doorway that leads to the backstage
(
) Ellen Pearson for Maybe Soon

-    -                 211 Frank comes up swiftly
He stops behind a curtain, six feet from the path the winner will take
Tony is there
Frank speaks to him and, as he does, he puts a hand on Tony's arm
They both look across the stage, past Winston into the wings on the other side
' In the wings of the opposite side of the stage, half hidden by a curtain, a  cameraman is hoisting his lightweight portable camera onto his shoulder
His back is to us
(
) Rachel Marron for Queen Of The Night
Tony,  want you on the other side
and check out that guy
He's not supposed to be there
Tony trots off quickly
' The cameraman half-turns toward us, peering past the curtain into the audience
For a split second, we glimpse his face
It's Portman
Then someone crosses quickly in front of him and he's gone
(
) Dean for  Dream Of Peace and Evelyn Gardner for The Harper Plan
Frank draws his gun
He glances quickly to Tony, but Tony's already on his way, trotting round the labyrinth behind the set
Frank automatically raises his sleeve to call to Tony, then realizes his communications are useless
He tries to see where Portman has disappeared to, but he daren't lose sight of Rachel

with envelope
And the winner is
Rachel Marron for Queen Of The Night
: ' grim
He looks past the curtain to Rachel
'  - Deafening applause in the main auditorium
stunned Rachel stands
Devaney and Spector kiss her
People nearby reach out to touch her
Rachel walks along her row
The orchestra plays " Have Nothing

-   -                       212 mass of drapes and flats
Behind them, the cameraman is fixing something to the side of his camera
His back is to us
Tony comes up briskly behind him, unable to see his face
Hey
You
What the fuck you think you're doin' back here
With amazing speed, the cameraman - Portman - wheels around, simultaneously jabbing two outstretched fingers from his free hand straight into Tony's eyes
Tony cries out, his hands flying to his face
Portman's hand moves swiftly again, jabbing to a nerve behind Tony's ear, Tony drops like a sack
Glancing rapidly around, Portman sees all other eyes on the auditorium
He pulls the curtain around Tony's body - obscuring it
He then removes his own ""  and fixes a laminated ""  to his lapel
213
-    -                    213 Frank gestures animatedly to the head of security and several guards
The music and the applause drown out his words and we do not hear them
The guards rush off backstage and into the auditorium
214
-                                  214 142
Rachel walks along her row
Hands reach out to her
Some people stand in their seats around her
crane- mounted  camera swoops down between Frank and his view of Rachel, obscuring her for a brief instant
' Desperately scanning, seeking
Suddenly his face freezes
' As Rachel reaches the center aisle and starts to walk toward the steps, there in the far aisle, his face almost hidden, is Portman -- the camera, hand-held on his shoulder, moving level with Rachel, 20 feet behind her
Frank raises his gun
Rachel walks down the aisle toward the side steps
Tears in her eyes
Thunderous applause
Security guards in the side aisles look around in all directions
They can't see anything
' Portman, now almost completely obscured behind the members of the audience, as more and more of them stand to applaud Rachel
' Rachel keeps appearing and disappearing behind the heads of the audience
Desperate to get a clear shot at Portman but unable to fire without hitting a bystander
- ' as she  approaches the podium, steadily, controlling herself  as she mounts the steps
The outline of her body becomes  difficult to see against the glare of the foot- lights  and the lights at the side of the auditorium
' His eyes squint against the dazzle
- Rachel approaches Winston
The applause and music is 143
deafening
' He can't see Portman past the glare
He can't fire into the audience
He knows Rachel is now at her most vulner- able
There is only one thing he can do to protect his charge
Frank runs on stage at terrific speed and leaps through the air at Rachel, twisting his body as he does
- Rachel turns her head, sees Frank leaping at her and gasps out with a mixture of fury and terror
No
The silenced  taped to the side of the camera
Frank and Rachel tumble over on the floor
The podium topples
There are screams from the audience
Pandemonium breaks out
Men run on stage from all directions
Guns are drawn
Everyone is shouting cameras whip-pan in all directions, security men shout into walkie-talkies
: 215
-                            215 Chaos on all screens
What the fuck
(
) Go to commercial
216
-                                  216 144
Totally calm and, as he gambled, invisible in the commo- tion
Camera still on his shoulder, he slowly backs away from the scene
Ushers and uniformed security men rush past him towards the stage
People leap from their seats
woman screams piercingly behind him
Portman doesn't blink
217
-                                          217 Dozens more helpers pour onto the stage around Frank and Rachel
Rachel starts to rise on all fours and sees, as hands reach out to help her, the blood on Frank's shirt
He has taken the hits for her
But he's still on the job, gaze alert
Without taking his eyes from the audi- torium, his left arm stretches out, with some pain, to push Rachel back down
The right arm, gun in hand, sweeps the auditorium
Where is Portman
Frank can't see past the mob
Ushers fall on Frank in a heap, trying to disarm him
Security men try to pull them off
Rachel shouts, trying to make herself heard above the noise
He's my bodyguard
Get off him
He's
'  - of     through legs and faces
One brief glimpse that could be Portman
cameraman turns
It's not
Frank is desperate, pushing away a helping arm
The chaos mounts
outside
218
-                                218 He turns away from the stage as four cops pound past him
He walks away
Suddenly, for one brief second, his face loses its composure as he looks to the side door
' Hysterical audience members jostle for the exit, screaming and shouting
It's like a football scrum
Cops and secur- ity men pushing and pulling
His escape route is blocked
'  - Briefly glimpsed through blurred, frenzied, f
g
Still seeking his target, biting his lip in pain
145
Cool again, he turns back to the stage, seeking an alternative escape route, camera still providing cover
219
-  -                              219 lumbering figure, blood streaming from one eye, his 38 drawn and outstretched
It's Tony staggering to the edge of the stage, straight towards his attacker
(bellowing) Frank
Frank
Over here
Frank and Rachel's heads swivel in unison at the sound, looking towards the far aisle
Against the side wall at the front, Portman's eyes desperately scan for the source of the voice
He sees Tony, his pistol takes aim
' For a split second, two running figures f
g
pass and cross leaving a momentary clear line to Portman
Frank
Frank's bullets hit home
The first slams Portman in the chest, knocking him against the wall
The second hits the  on his shoulder,  it around his face
Blood spatters her white Armani dress and the shirt- front of her escort
Portman's body slumps forward in her lap, pinning her back in her seat
He's dead
His pistol drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps
Frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to look away
He half turns to Rachel, wincing with the effort
She's unhurt
He has fulfilled his promise to her
Rachel throws her arms around Frank and hugs him, tears streaming down her cheeks
146
Frank Farmer's face
Sad and weary
His guard is finally down
Nothing more can happen
He slowly lowers the gun, closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his chest
In the midst of the commotion of medics, security men, police and ushers, Spector bends down and gently retrieves the gold envelope and the card bearing Rachel's name
There are splatters of blood on it
He tries to wipe them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket
220
-                           220 chaos of press and public, ambulance and police lights flashing,
Police and paramedics surrounding a man on a stretcher -- it is Frank -- Rachel walks at his side, clutching his hand as he is rushed to an ambulance
Tony, a dressing over his eyes, is also helped out by paramedics
Among the gathered crowd, we focus in on one face
It is Dan, pushed back to the sidelines and unable to see what is happening
He slowly turns and walks away to a    of the scene
221
-                                  221 buffed-out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as the last pieces of equipment of Rachel's band are loaded aboard from a truck
limousine pulls up and Rachel gets out with Tony and Court, who is clearly acting as her bodyguard
She greets some members of the band and others who will be part of her entourage
roadie has her luggage removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane
Devaney is trying to hurry her on board
Spector is conspicuous by his absence
As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane, Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to something
Frank approaches from the nearby parking area
He is pale
Under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is still taped
He smiles as Tony
Their handshake becomes a quick abrazo
(indicating eyepatch) How's it going
147
Under control
But it won't be the same
ya mutt
Tony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin
Over by the plane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress, till she turns to look
Fletcher runs up to Frank and hugs him around the knees
Rachel approaches and Tony moves back toward the plane
Devaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to indicate they are late
Frank waves and smiles
Rachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy
Fletcher is ecstatic
You shouldn't be here
Frank laughs
There is a pause
So, you're quitting show business
Yeah
Too bad
You had talent
What are you going to do
thought  might hole up with my dad
(pats bandaged torso) Finish that chess game
Rachel nods approvingly
Get him when Fletcher's not around
(ruffling Fletcher's hair) That's the idea
Fletcher grins
Rachel starts to cry
So, how's the new guy
He's got white hair, Frank
148
He's very good
Why'd you have to get me an old man
don't trust you
Yeah
well, give me a kiss and let's get this over with
Frank gives her an awkward hug
They kiss
'Bye Rachel
Rachel turns quickly
She almost runs up the boarding ladder
Frank remains watching her
Fletcher looks back over his shoulder as they disappear into the plane
222
-                                             222 Rachel takes a seat beside Fletcher
Devaney leans over the aisle
That wasn't so bad
(he sees her tears) You okay
Rachel is in her own world
Devaney passes the word to get moving
The
Rachel turns and sees Frank still standing there looking at her
223
-                                           223 The pilot's hand pushes forward on the throttle
224
-                                             224 The nosewheel starts to taxi
The plane moves forward
225
-                                             225 Rachel's face at the window
Wait
226
-                                            226 149
The steps start to fold down out of the plane, but not fast enough for Rachel
She jumps the last six feet, staggering slightly as the plane's jet wash hits her, whipping her clothes and hair
Without pausing, she runs to Frank who takes her in his arms
They embrace and kiss
They kiss again and again
Finally, slowly, Rachel draws back, her eyes are filled with tears
Remember when you said you'd risk your life for me
Frank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt
didn't really believe it then
Nobody means what they say
But you did, Frank
You did it
You laid it all on the line for me
Frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips
Don't wreck this for me
don't want to hear any bullshit about you just doing your job
You did more than save my life, Frank
You showed me a way to be
And love you for it
(a beat) There,  said it
(looks at him) 'll never forget what it felt like to be under your eye
Never
(smiles) won't be forgetting you either
She presses something into Frank's hand
Here
want you to keep this
If you ever need me, you just put this on and no matter where you are  will find you
promise
She gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the plane, her eyes holding Frank's
Frank opens his palm to reveal the little enamel cross
as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out
150
The  of the plane becomes
227
-                                        227 Rachel's face in  , bathed in light and the applause of a huge audience
Thank you
Thank you
Now want to sing you an old song, but it's a new favorite
As the music begins, Rachel stands alone in front of the band, mike in hand
You know, this song used to make me feel sad
But it doesn't anymore
Rachel pauses
The audience is still
Now it just reminds me of someone very special
This is for him
Rachel begins to sing the song ' ' - slow and sweet
It's the song she and Frank danced to

For all we know in our hearts that even though we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are with us

The Reverend's final words segue into Rachel's song
Frank's searching gaze around the room is arrested for a moment as though reacting to Rachel's voice
229
-                                      229 Rachel ends a phrase
She dabs at the corner of her eye as she continues the song that still binds them together
