Written by Jacques Audiard & Thomas Bidegain Based on Craig Davidson's short story collection 16TH August 2011 1 Gradually more and more visible in the darkness, the face of a child, Sam
He is 6 years old, blond, pale and miserably thin
As we move in on his eyes, we see his lids quickly contracting
Under his eyelids: vestiges of the day's lights and shadows, of the day's noise
2
- grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can knock a man off his feet
On the side of the highway, a large, muscular man with spiked blond hair: Ali Van Versh, 25
He has a big bag in one hand and a cell phone in the other
He talks on the phone as he continues walking: It's me
It's Ali
left
took the kid with me
She can't take care of him anymore
got into a fight with the guy she's with
don't know where to go
What do  do with the kid
can't talk
don't have any more credit
Call me back
He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam
Move it
His phone rings
He immediately answers
Yeah
Where is it
Shit
It's so far
How do get there
don't know
Today or tomorrow
Yeah
Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm
Sam is tiny, he looks like a squirrel on his father's back
3 There is a map of the French rail system near the toilets in a regional train
While Sam pees, Ali examines it
He follows the lines to plot out their trip
He arrives where France ends, at the Mediterranean
Sam comes out of the bathroom, straightening his pants
'm thirsty
We don't have any money
'm thirsty
4 different speed, different countryside
Ali notices a half-empty bottle of Evian water left on a tray
He takes it
He searches through the garbage under other empty seats
Ali and Sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit, and finish off abandoned bottles of water
5 Another
Rain evaporates off the windows
Ali has fallen asleep
He's too big for his seat
Sam watches the landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat
Ali opens one eye
Stop it
Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their banging
said to stop it
The sandals freeze
Cut
6 All of a sudden, Sam is asleep, his eyelids blinking quickly
7 Ali's face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon sun
Ali and Sam look at the sea, the beaches and hotels
It's hot and beautiful
They walk by tanned people in shorts, short skirts, sandals
In their shapeless grey track pants, they look like hoboes
Ali drags his sport bag with one hand and Sam with the other
Ali is on the phone: don't know
big street that started at the station
Yeah, by the beach
Behind
We just came from there
Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to the beach
'm tired
So am
He's coming to pick us up
Come on
Sam is extenuated
Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder
8 four-lane avenue near the outskirts of town
Ali is walking on the shoulder of the road, with Sam piggy- back
horn beeps
refrigerated truck, blinking to get to the side of the road
The window rolls down to reveal a moustache and a cap: Richard
9
' While driving
(Southern accent)
couple miles back saw a blond guy
(Imitates screeching brakes)  stop short
"You Ali
"  ask
He says "No, me Kurt"
Another few hundred feet, another big blond guy
(Screech) ask "You Ali
" again
This time  didn't even understand what he answered
Another few hundred feet
Ten of them
Ten
Every Kraut and Flemish guy on the coast
So  go call your sister
Ali is thrown for a loop
(uncertain) You kidding
little
(to Ali) Is he a little crazy
(to Sam) What
You don't like my truck
Yeah  do
(pretending to be shocked) He doesn't like my truck
do too like it
Worked up, Sam shrieks, holding his hands over his ears: (screaming)  like your truck
The road hugs the seashore
Ali watches beaches, homes, a railway line pass by
Voice over, we hear Richard's distant voice
10 kitchen with mismatched furnishings
China and cheesy wallpaper
Sam devours the cookies and Coke that Richard gives him
We all got fired after some Spanish guy bought out the trucking company
Eight truckers
thought it over, discussed it with your sister and figured  could do it on my own
So  bought this truck with my severance pay
Ali has finished his cream cheese sandwiches
He gets up and opens the old fridge
Oops, poor man, not those
She'll kill you
Start with the expired ones, on the top shelf
They're organized by date
First the top shelf, then move down
Anna brings it home from the supermarket where she works
As soon as they reach their expiration date, those idiots throw it all away, even if you can still eat it for a week
(to Sam) You want some more
11 Anna empties Sam's Spiderman bag onto the table, spilling out old, dirty, crumpled clothes
(with a hint of Southern accent) Is this all you have for him
Anna Van Versh, Ali's sister, is in her thirties
She is a huge woman, very tall with a pretty face
She wears leggings that make her ass look like a workhorse's and a pair of flip flops
At the bottom of the bag, Anna finds a passport and opens it
It is Sam's
She remembered his passport
She didn't remember anything
It was already in there
She forgot about it, that's all
When they went to Amsterdam, they'd use the kid to smuggle dope
You got to be kidding
That's what she told me
Anna shakes her head in disbelief
beat
How will you tend to the kid
won't be able to all the time
work, and so does Richard
Was he in school there
don't know
You don't know if your kid's in school
Um, no
(turns to Sam) You in school
No answer
Sam is watching
Back at your mom's place, did you go to school
Yes
can try to enroll him at the school
'll see
We also need to get him some clothes
He can't go like that
'll ask the neighbors
(gives the child her hand) Come with me to the backyard
have to feed my babies
12 Evening is falling
At the back of the garden are a home- made pen and doghouse
Four puppies come running
Sam touches them through the chicken wire
You want to pet them
She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh
Careful
Don't step on their tiny paws
They're just babies
Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up
(to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next month
Brings in some money
Otherwise, Richard and  were thinking 300 a month for you and the kid
That okay
Yeah
"Yeah" what
Is that too much
It's not too much, but  don't have it had to pay for the train
So what are you going to do
don't know
Find a job
Whatever
Yeah, whatever
You think there's any work around here
You think there's any more here than there
Where has that ever been the case
When you told me you were coming down, said we couldn't afford houseguests
What should  have done with the kid
Where should  have gone
have no idea, but if you stay here you have to pay your share, or else go somewhere else
As far as we're concerned, it's easy: we can't
How long were you thinking of staying
don't know
She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house, calling Richard on the way
Ali hears Sam in the kennel, giggling in delight
He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special 50 moped, plastic junk, etc
Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights shining
13 In the cluttered basement, Sam is rolled up in a sleeping bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the antique Special 50 moped by the light of a flashlight
14 Ali wanders through an electronic goods shop, pretending to be interested in cameras
Through the shop window, he can see Sam waiting outside in the sun
15 Suddenly, Sam sees his father run out of the shop, trying to shake a security guard hot on his tail
Sam watches them disappear into a tiny lane
Sam looks around a bit frightened
Farther off, in a busy shopping districta Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists
The security guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a wall
They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath
Unzip your jacket
Empty your pockets
Ali keeps his cool
Unzip it yourself
Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly
The guard tries to punch him
Ali dodges: The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right hook
The guard stumbles
kick in the face sends him flying into a stall
Ali lifts his arms in victory for the benefit of the few, stunned passersby
He kisses his own biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off
16 Sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the terraces and ice-cream stores, looking for his father
Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot where they had left it chained up
He walks toward it voice calls out
Hey
Here  am
Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who is sniffling, tears in his eyes
No need to cry
wouldn't have left you all alone
Ali unlocks the moped
10 17 In a small side street, Sam watches Ali sell a camera for a few 20 Euro notes
18
- On the beach, Ali and Sam eat some McDonald's
Are you happy here
Sam nods
Mm
What do you like the most at Auntie's
The dogs
Is that all
Nothing else besides the dogs
The truck
The dogs and the truck
The house
Auntie
The ocean
The dogs and the truck
Ali nods
Sam watches his Dad's fat fingers assemble the plastic toy from his Happy Meal
We have it good here
Ali's fingers stop
Sam looks up to find his father watching some girls in swimsuits go by
They go for a swim, horsing around and making noise
11 19
- The logo is in the shape of a sheriff's badge and hangs over some filing cabinets on the wall of a modest office: " Securite"
No criminal record
You never fucked up
No
The boss is in his fifties
He sits behind some files
His hair is short and white, it looks like he's wearing a helmet
He is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie
He stares at Ali
Is that the truth
We'll be checking anyway
Ali nods
The owner reaches out
Your papers
Ali hands him his tattered paper
The owner writes down the number
Ali is 13-14 on the picture
What was your last job
worked in a slaughterhouse
Not for long
It closed
Ever work in security
Yeah
was a night watchman in a stadium for 6 months
Working for the city
In a parking lot too
did replacements
12 Ever do any combat sports
Karate, for 6 years
even won Junior Division
And two years of boxing
Thai
You gave it up
It was my trainer who gave up
Why
He died
beat
And how are you physically
You stay in shape
Yeah
You don't smoke
No
Drink
He shakes his head "no"
The boss notes something in a file
20
Anna and Sam are waiting outside the office
The owner kisses Anna on the cheek
He asks how Richard is doing, then shows them to the door
Anna looks proud to know him
13 21 Saturday evening
The door to the Fever Ray night club
Patrons wait, bouncers pick and choose
An imposing Caucasian maneuvers the red rope
Behind him, Ali Van Versch and Foued Latahoui, who looks like a lightweight boxer, guard the door
Ali wears a faded blue " Secu" jacket and stiff, matching pants
Looking well-groomed, Foued is wearing a white shirt and tie
Well-groomed
group of girls passes through the security barrier
Foued acts like he's hesitating: Okay, 'll let you through because 'm outnumbered
Four against one,  don't stand a chance
The girls smile and disappear inside
Ali watches them vanish
You say something nice, anything
That way, when they leave, they remember you and you can hit on them
If they're a little plastered, if things didn't go too well for them, you're there with a nice thing to say
And it works
Sometimes
But you can't be dressed like that
Like a parking lot attendant
They are interrupted by the bouncer
(pointing) Fight
They go running
Three guys are fighting like savages
Ali and Foued clean house
Foued gets rid of gawkers
Ali delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off 14 his feet and grabs another by the collar
While Foued chases the rowdy men toward the parking lot, Ali helps a girl back to her feet
She's a pretty blond, must be about 27 or 28, who has taken a punch in the face
It is Stephanie
Are you okay
Breathe out of your mouth
In and out
Put your head back
Walk a little
Walk and breathe
He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her to walk
She looks groggy
have to go home
You have friends here
No,  came alone
have my car in the lot
'll be fine
You can't drive like that
'm fine
'm fine,  said
Thanks
You can't drive like that
'll call you a cab
How do  get my car afterwards
Seriously, 'll be fine
Trust me
We hear a voice from the parking lot
Bitch
Stephanie looks back
15 Yeah
you, you cunt
Bitch
She ignores him, pretending not to see him
She then notices the blood stains on her -shirt
Shit
Where's your car
22
' Ali drives
His head seems to touch the roof of the little Fiat and his thighs are too thick for the seat
He glances over at Stephanie
Still bleeding
Keep your head back
Wait
He manipulates the knob to push her seat back
He grimaces in pain
Shit
Did you hurt yourself
He shows her his right wrist
It's swelling up
He rests his hand on the wheel
After a beat: You often go to the Fever
No
Why do you go alone
No answer
16 To dance
Yes
To find a guy
She turns and looks down her nose at him: Oh yeah
You're dressed like that just for dancing
How am  dressed
don't know
Look
He points to her skirt, riding up her thighs
Yeah, so what
You look like a hooker
Excuse me
How would you call it
don't believe this
Pull over here
What
Stop this car on the double
17 No reaction
It's  car
If  tell you to stop, you stop
Still no reaction, as if she hadn't said a thing
She is about to scream again, but remains silent, although open- mouthed
She finally settles back down on the back of her seat and looks elsewhere
beat
Dressed like that, it's no surprise that
That's enough now
They ride in silence
23
& ' The Fiat stops in front of a small building in a flowery residential neighborhood
They climb out
How will you get back
don't know
She takes out her wallet
No, stop
For a taxi
Don't worry
Got any ice at your place
He shows her his wrist
Ice cubes
18 Wait, 'll go check
can come up
No
Even she is surprised by the brusqueness of her response
(embarrassed) Someone's up there
So what
Wait here
'll be right back
She takes a few steps, fumbling for her keys
She hesitates, then looks back
Okay, come on up
24
& ' They enter the apartment
The light is on
Simon comes out of the bedroom in his boxer shorts and a -shirt
He's thirty, blond, and there is something commanding about his look that could be thought to resemble Stephanie's
He discovers Ali and the blood stains on Stephanie's - : What the hell
What's going on
Nothing
fight
Are you okay
19 Yeah, 'm fine
(pointing to Ali) Who's he
The bouncer from the Fever
He drove me home
(introducing himself)
Ali
The Fever
What the hell were you doing there
Ali opens the refrigerator
What are you looking for
Ice cubes
He hurt his hand
Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom
Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl
Ali's hand in the bowl
He looks around
There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back of a killer whale, Stephanie posing with a group of young people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo, Stephanie rising out of the water on Niska's rostrum, etc
From the nearby bedroom, he hears snatches of Simon's : () If you decide to go out, call me
That's all
Who were you with there
() Philippe and Christine
20 () thought you went out to dinner
() We decided to go out for a drink after
() You get my text messages
Why didn't you answer me
Stephanie comes back into the kitchen
She has changed her -shirt
She seems tense
Feeling better
Is that you in the picture with the orcas
Not orcas
Just one orca
Her name is Niska
Is that your job
Yep
Ali nods vaguely admiringly
Fuck
didn't think that
That what
whore could train whales
Well, you see
Simon is at the door
He is wearing a jean
(To Ali) Okay, are you done now
Can you leave us alone
Ali stares him down
21 You talking to me
It's as if Ali's calm, peremptory tone suddenly let Simon know who he was dealing with
Yes, but
But what
Nothing, forget it
In one second, Stephanie sees Simon's face undergo a metamorphosis, his nervous authority suddenly disappear
She glances at Ali as if to say a Please go now
' He gets up and wipes his hands on a dish rag
Okay, 'm going
So long
(pointing to a piece of paper on the table)  left you my number if ever you need it
25
& '  -  - She dissolves an aspirin in a toothbrush glass
She checks her lip in the medicine chest mirror
She notices Simon watching her from the bathroom doorway
Are you okay
Are you upset
No, 'm not upset
She drinks the aspirin
saw your face before
Before
22 With that guy who dropped me off
saw your face
saw how you piped down
piped down
Me
Yes, you piped down
(pause) Don't tell me what  should do, how  should live my life
Don't give me any more orders, Simon
What does that mean
Don't give me any more orders, that's all
She turns on the faucet and runs her lips under the water
: 26
' Two rooms adjoining the locker room
Two desks, and on the walls pictures of the trainers with their orcas, laminated posters of various training methods, files for each animal
Stephanie is in her diving suit, sitting in front of Louise, a 23-year-old woman who is reading a document about her internship
trainer leaves the locker room, his backpack slung over his shoulder
Coming
No answer
Tension
He leaves without a word
Louise looks up
She has been crying
Stephanie looks at her, impassive
Louise swallows her tears
Really
this isn't fair
23 No, Louise, there are lots of things you can say but not that
The pools are my responsibility and all  care about are the animals
have to see to their environment and that starts with their trainers
Do you understand
What are you trying to make me believe, that wasn't up to par
No, listen
Lacking in maturity
Skills
You're not consistent
We've already discussed that
The foundation of the relationship with the orcas is stability
During your internship you've had your ups and downs
It's not your competence that
You know this has nothing to do with my internship
You couldn't care less if  was competent or not
It has to do with that fucked Michael
Just say so
Oh, please
And in fact what really bothers you is not that we fucked, but that he told me about you
How you think you're so
How you've become such a bitch
That's why you're firing me
That's what you should write in your report
Okay, are you done
We can stop here
No need to spoil the rest of your internship
Louise stands up
24 27
- The empty stadium above the pool
The trainers walk along the gangplanks busily
In her diving suit, Stephanie leans over the "beach" of pool 3
She taps on the surface of the water
wave forms, whirling around the pool
The whale washes up on the "beach" beside her
She performs what looks like a daily ritual
She examines the whale, caresses it
The whale responds with uncanny gurgles
28 Stock shots of a show at Marineland, or images which we will film to resemble stock shots: wide-angle shots from the stadium
The sound equipment blares "Jump" by Van Halen, orcas shoot out of the water, the audience applaudsa Little kids clutch electric-blue dolphin balloons, getting splashed by the orcasa Images of the show are relayed on giant video screens, orcas shoot by like torpedoes behind the plastic protective wall in front of the main pool, etca : 29 All at once, silence
Then surface noise, but muted by the cubic meters of watera Underwater shots from pool number 3
Overhead, the surface shines like a mirror
In pool number 3, a five-ton black shadow bides its time: it is Niska
Behind the grate in pool number 3, Niska watches her mates diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles
mechanical creak, then the grate slowly begins to lift
It's about to be her turn
25 Niska swims into the big pool, slowly at first, but then picks up speed
She surfaces, disappears for a long beat, then again reappears, churning up a whirlpool of bubbles
On the other side of the mirror, the music blares and the crowd cheers
What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into the pool
We recognize Stephanie
She caresses Niska's rostrum, then kisses it, hanging onto her fins, waltzing with her up to the surface
Her hands look ridiculously tiny on the huge black fins
We see her face mirrored in one of the orca's huge black, gentle eyes
liquid world of greens and blues whirls around them
Now, with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum, Stephanie has Niska swim around the pool, accelerating the water pressure and speed
The plastic wall rushes by, a rush of adrenalinea clouds of sediment are lifted as if by a gust of wind
young male, Tom, joins Niska in pool number 1
Niska immediately rushes him, as if riled by the intrusion, and flattens him against the plastic wall
In the shifting reflections at the water's surface, we can make out Stephanie and two other trainers' faces on the a beach'
Their palms beat on the water, summoning the orcas for their next number
Tom gathers some momentum, then shoots around Niska to jump into first place
He disappears a moment, then is back into the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning
Niska then gets into place and takes a running start, but just as she is about to shoot out of the water, Tom appears out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him
We sense chaos up above
Then we see Niska crash back into the water, with, one after the other, a piece of the huge video screen that towered over the stage, bits of scenery, and all kinds of random objects, as if Niska had carried away half the platform in her wakea It all seems to fall in slow motion, like flecks of snow in a snow globe
Something sinks toward usa a body, floating weightless and disjointed in a cloud of red
26 30
- Stephanie is on the rim of the pool
All around her: the audience panics, a loudspeaker orders evacuation, Louise leans over her
What
What happened
Tom and Niska
They got in each other's way
Then Louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving suit
She tries to find a pressure point
Stephanie sees Louise's face wet with tears: Stop it, calm down
'm fine
Her hand searches for something at thigh level, without finding it
She faints
31 Ali is wearing his MP3 headset
He runs down the road to the beach, sweat dripping into his eyes
32
' Sam's toys are lying scattered in the garden, his half- eaten snack is on the table
Ali takes off his headset
Sam
No answer
There is some noise over at the kennel
He goes and finds Sam in the kennel, talking to the puppies
What are you doing here
27 Sam jumps and scuttles to the back of the kennel, but Ali reaches in and grabs him by the arm
Sam is covered in mud, straw and dog shit
You're gross
You stink
Who's taking care of you
Ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down
The water is freezing cold
Sam hops from one foot to the other and screams
Stop it, Dad
It's cold
Stop
Sam shrieks
An 18 year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee- shirt comes out of a neighboring house: Joelle, the neighbors' daughter
Aren't you supposed to be taking care of him
What the fuck are you up to
was next doing the laundry
Take a look at him
'll put him in the shower
(to Sam, crying) Don't go in there
It's disgusting
You hear
Joelle takes Sam and disappears inside
Ali is drawn to the living room, when through the half-open door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel
Onscreen and behind the anchorwoman, he recognizes an inset photo of Stephanie, the same he saw at her place, riding on the back of a killer whale
iiiiii
iiiiiiSiiiiZiiiiiiiiSiiS Il manque une phrase 28 There was an accident at Marineland
Ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen
know her
Sam pulls off his towel
He watches his father who is riveted to the screen, glued to the looping footage of the accident
33
- ' Silence
The silence of an on-duty nurses' lounge: a table, a microwave on a mini-fridge, and Louise, standing by the window sipping coffee
She is wearing a fleece jacket, her hair messily pulled back
She hasn't had any sleep
She hears a scream
She rushes into the corridor
34 Chaos
Louise rushes into the room
She finds Stephanie crawling on the floor, dragging her IVs
She hesitates, overwhelmed, then calls for help
Help
Help
Please
On the linoleum, two stumps stick out of Stephanie's nightshirt: two thick bandages surround her thighs that look like two wrapped hams
My legs
What did you do with my legs
Two nurses arrive
Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms
Louise rocks her gently
Stephanie's eyes struggle against sleep
She wants to scream again, but doesn't have the strength
She 29 falls asleep in Louise's arms
She feels eight years old
Black
35
/ series of scenes, day and night, fade into one another, always from the same
In the foreground, looking our way, is Stephanie's face and, behind, the visitors who succeed one another
Stephanie's eyes are shut
She opens them: - The other trainers from Marineland, holding bouquets
They are silent and look devastated
They occasionally speak to each other in whispers
Stephanie closes her eyes
Black
Stephanie opens her eyes: - Louise is seated nearby stopped by your place
saw the cleaning woman
She didn't want me to pay her
She was
in shock
She's scared to come here
She sends her regards
She closes her eyes
Black
She opens them
-  blonde, pretty woman in her fifties is sitting behind Stephanie, her face is close to hers
It is her mother
She speaks with a slight accent
spoke to your brothers
They wanted to talk to you but  didn't think it was the right time
We'll all come with Hugo during the next school break
was afraid might lose you
don't know what 'd have 30 done
It may seem selfish
In any case, you've always done whatever you wanted
But this time  was so scared that  don't think 'll ever be scared again
Her eyes close
Black
Her eyes reopen
The surgeon and his assistants
The orthopedist and his assistants
Her eyes close
Black
Her eyes open
- Simon is there, looking stiff and ill at ease
He tries not to make any noise as he puts a bunch of keys on the night stand
He leans over and kisses her hair
Her eyes close
Black
It's her mother again, but this time accompanied by a tall, uncomfortable looking blond teenage boy
She leans over to kiss her
(in German) Hugo wanted to say goodbye to you
We're leaving tomorrow but we'll pray for you, honey
Her eyes remain open
Black
36 The bluish light at the bottom the main pool at Marineland
diver is raking its bottom, wiping away sludge composed of micro algae, paint chips and fish bones
He examines the replacement mud and then, inside the drain, the mud being replaced
He digs his hand into the sediment and feels something there
He surfaces and deposits his find on the rim of the pool: It is one of Stephanie's diving flippers, with her foot cut off at the ankle
31 : 37
'   - Stephanie wakes up with a start in her handicapped bathtub
She tries to grab the bars but can't find them
She rolls over on herself like a floating log
She panics
: 38
-    - There are several rows of parallel bars, with amputees hanging on to them as they relearn to walk with their prosthetics
Most of them are old
Nurses help them along
From her wheelchair, Stephanie watches, looking glum and as if at a great distance
Her hair is greasy and her face swollen by her medication and induced sleep
She looks through the big window that opens onto the exterior
Outside, amputees smoke and chat
She notices one group, livelier than the rest
At its center, a guy is smoking a cigarette he holds in a pincer in the place of his hand
His name is Gilles
39
' Four of them are smoking a joint in Gilles' Megane
Outside, evening is falling over the convalescent center's parking lot
Stephanie is sitting up front
She passes the joint to Gilles, who takes it in his chrome pincer
She notices the scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth
There is a couple in the backseat, making out: Raphael (his arms are missing and his sleeves are pinned up at his shoulders) and Julia
(to Stephanie) Want me to tell you something
32 You haven't finished mourning, that's all
Really
Mourning who
Your legs
Mourning my legs
Yes
He sounds as serious as a civics teacher
She looks at him, incredulous
Raphael sticks his head up front
Pass me the joint
Gilles' pincer and joint go for Raphael's lips
He takes a long hit
They were a part of you
When a man dies, he gets buried
There's a ceremony, a prayer
Now a piece of you ended up in a hospital trashcan without a prayer, without any time for meditation
beat
She is dumbstruck
She cannot believe what she's hearing
In the backseat, Raphael exhales some smoke into Julia's open mouth
(cont'd) You have to think about it symbolically
Yeah, it's really symbolic
33 know where my arm is
We buried it under a nice oak tree behind my house in the scrubland
My wife and kids came and we sang
Stephanie has a fit of the giggles
(a bit vexed) You think 'm kidding
No, it's the grass
'll stop
She laughs so hard she cries
Shit, it's a laugh riot up there
(to Gilles) Can you take us home
She looks back and, between the seats, notices the girl toying with Raphael's fly
'm too beat
'll take a nap, then go
(to Stephanie) How are you getting home
40
/ HyperBrico  store in an industrial zone in Cannes
Its windows shine in the night like an aquarium
41 Ali and Kadhi, a huge guard accompanied by a dog, make their rounds
They open doors with a magnetic key, each time recording their passage on electronic terminals
bit before midnight, someone knocks at the main entrance
Ali goes to look
It's a guy in a leather jacket and baseball cap, with a backpack and a shoulder bag
What do you want
34 To come in
The guy takes out a card and presses it against the glass door: it's the business card of  , the security agency
Hey, Kadhi, come here
Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy
Okay, okay
Are you Martial
Yeah
Give me your keys
Who's he
It's fine
The boss told me he was coming
He works for the company
Ali hands him the bunch of keys
42
- Ali goes down an aisle looking for something and finally finds what he was looking for: a folding ladder
43
- Martial has spread out his material in a stock room at the back of the store at the end of a corridor formed by palettes: precision tools, drills, electronic mini-cameras still in their wrapping, cases equipped with antennae, packs of batteries
small radio is playing a night program on Radio Monte Carlo
Equipped with a small headlamp, Martial carefully cuts a hole in a cardboard box with his Leatherman scissors
He conceals a tiny camera inside
35 Ali arrives with the ladder over his shoulder
Will this do
Perfect
Put it down there
Martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf
Imagine you're the manager of a big store like this and the union reps have been busting your balls
What do you do
Fire them
You think that's how it works
What do you do before you fire them
He checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole, then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket monitor
Well, beforehand you try to see how long they spend in the restroom, if they take extra-long coffee breaks, smoke on the premises, steal from the stockroom, rip customers off with the sales receipts
When you know all that, you put the pressure on them and you fire the ones who don't leave
Can you give me a stroll down the aisle
stroll
Walk down the aisle
No, further down, like you came out of that door there
Good, perfect
Ali twice passes within the camera's field of vision
Martial climbs down his ladder
36 That's it
Okay, then 'll be getting back
Hold on
Martial pulls a 10 Euro bill from a jacket pocket
It's fine
Take it
Angle on the bill in Ali's hand
44
- Ali is in the security room reading a kickboxing magazine
small radio is playing a late evening program
Outside in the parking lot, Kadhi smokes while walking his dog
The dog takes its time
Ali watches Kadhi pull on the leash
Ali's cell phone rings
The screen reads a unknown'
Hello
() It's Stephanie
Remember me
We met at the Fever
Ali is taken by surprise
Yeah
How are you doing
She sniggers
Her speech sounds slow and thick
() You know what happened to me
37 Yeah
saw the papersa the news on TVa How are you
(sniggering) How do you think  am
beat
Ali is at a loss to answer
How are you
Okay

Still a bouncer
No, not really
You want to get together
Yeah, but nights are tough
'm a security guard now
Three nights a week
'm
crazy busy too
Every day and every night
don't know how to manage
beat
Now
Huh
Come now
45
-     - The Speciale 50 putt-putts in the early morning light
Ali drives through a neighborhood of chain stores, Conforama, 38 Courtepaille, Leroy-Merlin
46
'  - gated community made up of four story buildings, lawns, bougainvillea and lavender
It looks pretty as a picture and squeaky clean
47
' The door opens automatically
He is surprised
He hears a tired voice from inside
() Come in
She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote control
She activates it and the door closes behind Ali
Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there are bags under her eyes
She is wearing a baggy Nike - shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom whose legs hang limp
Have you been waiting long
No
just got here
Was that you who rang before
She looks exhausted but feverish
No
Come in
Sit down
He sits down on a small couch
Want something to drink
coffee
39 Yes
only have instant
That's fine
It takes two tries to activate the wheels on her wheelchair
Need any help
She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen
He sees her pajama legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap
Have you been living here long
don't know
Three or four months
(looking around)
It's nice
She comes back
Are you alone
You got no one to help you
Help me what
Walk
No, for the cleaning and everything
Yeah there are people
They come and go
Hold on
She manages to navigate from the living room into her bedroom
He stays in the living room
He hears a kettle whistle in the kitchen
He goes into the kitchen and pours water into the glass/mug
He finds her hunched over in her 40 wheelchair
She is nodding off, high on her medication
Hey, are you okay
'm fine
He opens the window
Does it stink here
Yeah, a little
It's me
He opens the curtains and looks outside
It is getting hot out
The automatic sprinklers have gone on
Let's go out
(No answer) Hey, you hear me
Yes
Let's go out
No
Get dressed
Leave me alone
Where are your clothes
He opens the closet
41 48
'  - When they come out of the building's lobby, the sun hits him on the head like a bad hangover
Here
Ali hands her a pair of sunglasses
Where should we go
don't know
You're the one who wanted to go out
Should we go to the ocean
don't care
He tries to push the wheelchair, but she stops him: Stop it
want to puke
He notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a sprinkler area
He goes to free it and gets splashed
Heavy chain, padlock
he comes back with soiled hands
When he comes back, she's gone
He sees the wheelchair moving toward the seafront avenue
He goes to join her
49
- They are sitting at a table on a terrace facing the beach
They remain silent
She looks at his huge fists, black with axle grease
want to go in
a
42 feel like swimming
Go ahead
You don't want to
Huh
You don't feel like swimming
She looks daggers at him
You don't have a bathing suit
Do you realize what you're saying
Who the fuck cares
There's no one here
Forget it
He wavers a moment, then finally crosses the seafront avenue
50 Stephanie is at the top of the steps in her wheelchair
Ali is talking with the beach boy when he notices her
Ali and the beach boy carry her to the deck chair area
Ali rents the whole shebang: parasol, beach towel, deck chair and a small tube of sunscreen 50
Sheltered under a parasol, she pancakes her face with cream and watches him dive in, wearing his boxers, and noisily and clumsily crawl some laps
His body is pink and white
Huge and buff
Then she looks out to sea, the listless waves washing in and out
The fresh feel of it all makes 43 her want to drink it all in
He comes back, enthusiastic and dripping wet
She looks around
The beach is deserted, other than for a far off, elderly couple broiling in the sun
Actually  think  will go in
He looks at her
She covers herself with a towel and wiggles out of her pants, revealing what remains of her legs
Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their extremities
You have to carry me
Help me
(makes a gesture)
How, like this
Yes
He lifts her up and carries her to the water
He takes her far enough in until she begins to float
You okay
Don't let me go
Not right away
Do it gently
She feels unsure of herself
He lets go of her gradually
She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and grace
She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread water
He joins her
She grabs onto him
So
can't stop
If  do,  sink
Wait
She gesticulates
44 This is bothering me
She takes off her -shirt and hands it to him
Her breasts press against Ali's chest
Okay, you can let go
She lets herself go and crawls like a pro
He stays put, holding her t-shirt
Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges
He hears a burst of laughter
Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time to see how she's doing
She calls out to him
She is sitting in the water
She motions for him to come and get her
He helps her out and takes her into his arms
She hangs on to him, still out of breath
You swim like a real pro
She shuts her eyes
Fuck that's good
The beach is crowded now
Ali carries her back to the deck chairs
Some bathers watch them go by, others look away
They are stretched out in their chairs
She has wrapped her lower body in a beach towel
They sunbathe
Thanks
Huh
Thanks
45 She rolls onto her back
He sees her breasts pointed heavenward
51 decrepit, simple, functional, but reasonably clean workout room
Guys of every color work the punching bags, lift weights, do chin-ups
From the gym next door, we hear the booming music of an aerobics class
In a small ring at floor level, Ali and Foued, loaded down with protective gear, pound each other
Each of their blows lands right on target
They repeat the same series of moves several times at varying speeds
52
- Ali and Foued are dripping wet
They have towels around their necks
They fill their small plastic bottles at a faucet in the workout room
Through a large window in the corridor, Ali watches the aerobic class going on in the gym: legs and feet moving in rhythm, red faces, sweaty underarms, butts, boobs and the braid of the instructor, who uses it to beat the measure, as she swings it from one shoulder to the other
have to get back
need to train
Ali nods, without actually looking at him
53
- Outside, Ali has unwrapped the sandwich his sister had prepared for him
bit farther off, the aerobics instructor is smoking in the sun
She has a short, buff body
She smokes her cigarette like someone who counts them out sparingly
They remain like that a while, he chewing ands she smoking
46 54
- cell phone vibrates
Through a narrow transom, a ray of sun slices through the dark equipment room
They haven't bothered undressing
Ali and the aerobics instructor are making love on a pile of workout mats
Ali's cell phone continues to vibrate, goes silent, vibrates again
He answers
We hear a crackling voice
'm still at the gym
'm leaving
said 'm leaving
He hangs up
They continue
55
- Sam is playing alone, perched up on monkey bars in the schoolyard
Through a wide window, he sees his father racing down a corridor that runs alongside the schoolyard
The principal is waiting for him at the door
Ali spurts out some quick apologies
Sam slowly slides off the structure
We hear the noise of his hands skidding on metal
56 The moped wheezes and sputters
Ali and Sam are heading back home along the beach
Ali is so big, the moped looks like a kid's bike
Behind him on the luggage rack, he can feel Sam leaning into him
Sam's hand rummages in his coat pocket for a box of Choco- cookies
Ali takes one too
To their left, a train noisily speeds by
57
' Louise has a set of keys
She enters Stephanie's apartment with the mail
47 Steph
Made up and well-groomed, she looks older than she actually is
Stephanie answers from the bathroom
() 'm in here
Louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters the bedroom
Stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom, her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel
Shit, you're not ready
The appointment is in a half hour
It's fine
What do you mean
You're a freaking pain have to get back to work
Come on, let me help you
She grabs the arms of the wheelchair and pushes Stephanie toward the closet
Let go of me
Stop,  can manage alone
Oh yeah
Okay, so manage then
She lets go of the wheelchair and leaves the bedroom
58
' Louise briskly pushes Stephanie's wheelchair across the residence garden
The warning lights on her 205 are blinking in front of the gate
Stephanie hangs onto Louise's neck
Louise lifts her out of her wheelchair as best she can and into the passenger seat
48 Louise bends down to buckle Stephanie's seat belt
(annoyed)  can do the seat belt
In front of the open trunk, Louise struggles to fold the wheelchair
Can't you call them to tell them we're going to be late
59
' In : the brochures of prosthetic manufacturersa we see pictures of the various models go by
Stephanie is in the doctor's office with Doctor Vitias
He is in his fifties and is wearing a white jacket
We'll order two pairs of prosthetic devices, one for everyday life and one for the sport you do
Stephanie pages through the various brochures
Don't you have something simpler, classier
What do you mean by classier
don't know
like a wooden leg with a piece of rubber at the end
(smiling) No, sorry
We don't make those models anymore
Louise shuts her eyes, visibly exasperated
Or just a plank
plank with wheels and straps
And irons to move forward with
49 (furious) Can you cut it out
What
If  want
've had enough of your schtick, you hear me
Come on
Shut up
Stephanie shuts up
Vitias still looks patient as Job
60
' Sitting on an examination table, Stephanie waits for the resin bands wrapped around her stumps to dry
Louise is sitting on a stool across from Stephanie
Their eyes meet
Go if you wanta 'll take a taxi
told them  was with you
And that works
If you tell them you're with me, do they let you do what you want
Well
Cool
If ever you want a day off, just tell me
'll write you a note
Louise looks at her
She's not going to let her get on her nerves
There is a knock at the door
nurse enters
She checks the resin bands, looks at her watch
50 10 more minutes, just to make sure
Then Doctor Vitias will come for you
She smiles and closes the door
The two young women are again left alone
Stephanie stretches out her hand
Louise takes it
And they remain like that

-   - In close up on the screen of a small  player: amateur images of two bare-chested guys fighting in the garden of a suburban house
It looks like a wild boxing match, free- for-all vale tudo in which anything goes
In the Bricorama security room, Ali, Kadhi and Martial, excited, are bent over the screen
few blows to the face have one of the combatants  on the lawn
Look at the next one
Watch how he whacks him
change of scene on the small screen: a courtyard between two tower blocks, with new combatants, but with the same amateur images and the same violence
(pointing to the screen)
know him fought him twice in Nationals
He's not bad
He was at the boxing club in Marseille
Martial watches Ali, fascinated by the images, as if he were sizing him up
62 An apartment in a Golfe Juan housing project
After-dinner time
Kids are playing, women doing the dishes
On the living room couch, under a tapestry of a lion hunt in Technicolor, Martial blows on his glass of tea
His 51 cousin is sitting across from him
Ali is on a stool at the end of the table
He says he's done Thai boxing
He can fight
He's enormous
He's not afraid of taking punches, and he's white
see
The cousin turns to Ali
He takes his time sizing him up
Is that true
You like to fight
Yeah
Okay, so  organize the fights
pick the fighters
see if the money's there
ref
collect the dough
take a third of the bets
The rest goes to the winner
third of how much
We don't fight for less than 800
Ali does the division in his head
So
Ali hesitates
(to Martial) There's something  don't get: how much do you take
don't know
You tell me
How much do you need
'll take 20% of what you win
How's that
52 And how much does your cousin give you
Oh,  introduced you to him, didn't
How's that
Okay
The cousin stands up
They all shake on it
63 Ali is in a corner of the living room, sitting in front of Anna's old  and watching some fight videos he's found
Anna rushes into the room
Keep Sam with you for 5 minutes
She hurries to find some papers in the drawer of a commode
Ali hasn't budged
Oh
Hear me
don't want your son in the garden
Yeah,  heard
He gets up and goes to get Sam who is playing behind the house
Anna finds her papers and leaves in another direction
Sam
Come here
want to show you some stuff
He lifts Sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer
Look how they fight
He clicks on an image and the fight continues
the audience's noise as well
Sam watches, intrigued
Ali 53 commentates, pointing to guys onscreen
Look at him, in red
See how strong he is
Is he the good guy
No, he's the bad guy
Look how he tries to grab his legs
Wait
His phone vibrates
He takes it from his pocket
It's Martial
He answers
Hello
Yeah
Why is the red one the bad guy
Daddy
don't know
Look and tell me who wins
He turns down the sound, settles Sam on the stool and gets up to go speak
(into the phone) So
What did he say
Which others
How many
Sam watches the fight in silence
Dogs bark in the garden
Sam feels something coming
He looks out the window, then goes running
Ali hasn't noticed a thing and continues his phone conversation
What is this bullshit
What do you mean, a tournament
64 Martial is leaning on the bar of a noisy Arab cafe/betting office, talking into his phone
54 Last one standing gets the money
know, but he says it's better that way
Do you think you're in a position to negotiate a percentage
Where did you get that idea from
He gave me a website if you want to see the others
He takes out a small spiral notebook
65 From the living room, Ali hears Sam screaming in the garden
Tell him to give the website to his mother
All  see is me doing more fights and him making more dough
Ali goes to the window
Outside, near the kennel, Sam has lunged at a guy in a jumpsuit who is helping Anna get the puppies into a metal cage
Sam is screaming
Anna tries to take him into her arms
Sam clutches the bars of the cage
The puppies bark
Anna finally manages to rip Sam free and drag him back into the house
(into the phone) He's changing the rules and so am
couldn't care less
Anna storms into the living room
Sam is shrieking, having a tantrum
He kicks and bites
'm on the phone
What the hell
asked you to watch him for 5 minutes
(into the phone) 'll call you back
Ali hangs up
55 Outside, the kennel keeper rolls the cage across the garden
Anna hugs Sam in her arms
(to Sam) He's taking them to the country
They'll be so happy there
Leave me alone
They're my babies
Sam refuses to calm down
Anna looks at her brother
What are you doing
Are you his father or not
You're such a pain in the ass
Don't talk to me like that
Ali rips the child from his sister's grip
Sam struggles
Stop it now
said stop
Calm the fuck down
Let go of me
Let go
Sam kicks out
Ali shakes him
Cut it out, dammit
You're such a pain
He flings the child away
Sam's head hits the coffee table
Silence
Anna rushes over and picks up Sam, who has stopped crying
He's been knocked out
Anna is frightened
She examines his scalp, she strokes his head
She trembles
cut on his head begins to bleed
She kisses the wound
Ali comes over, upset
56 Don't touch him
Don't touch him  said
You know what
You're
you're a bad person
Huddled against Anna's breasts, Sam opens his eyes
66 The day is over
The beach boy has already packed away most of his paraphernalia
In the water, Ali and Stephanie are out with some of the last swimmers
Faithful to what by now seems to have become a habit, he carries her piggyback to their lounge chairs
They come out of the water in the middle of a discussion
What kind of boxing
Thai
Do you use your feet
No, just fists  think
We bash each other's faces and whoever's still standing at the end wins
Hey, you're strangling me
He puts her down on her chair
Is it the first time you're doing this
Yeah
And you're not scared
Of what
How much do they pay you for this
don't know
About 500, 1000 maybe
57 You're doing that for 500 euros
Um, yeah
You're going to get whacked on the face and risk your health for 500 euros
Risk my health
What are you talking about
Why are you getting so worked up
'll give you the 500
Cancel it and 'll give it to you tomorrow
You can give it to me if you have too much money, but  said  was doing it and  am
That's all
If it's not for money, why then
didn't say it's not for the money
Why are you doing it
Oh, stop driving me crazy
'm doing it to fight
For fun
Why did you clown around on your fish
For the fun of it, right
She grins
Yeah and look how  ended up
Spare me
You turn on the waterworks when you feel like it
58 She dries her eyes
He begins to pack things up
Your fight, if you do it
Mm
You think  can come along

' narrow road
Down below, a town
The Mercedes Vito with the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust
Stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the overhead strap to avoid hurting herself
At the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge homies
They signal Martial to over
He rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside
They see Ali and Stephanie in the back
1 Who's she
His girlfriend
Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his reaction
He looks elsewhere
The gate opens
Martial drives in
68

' Ali and Stephanie are alone in the car
Through the tinted windows, they can see a concrete yard with boats dry-docked around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding every balcony
Some men are over in one corner, discussing: Martial, his cousin and some other mean looking guys
In the shade, a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans, is a bare-chested, muscle-bound North African
He warms up, 59 wagging his head from left to right
(under his breath) Motherfucker's acting like he's on Canal Plus
Who are the other guys
don't know
Guys with money
Dealers
beat
You okay
Great
Martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into the passenger seat
It's okay
Let's go
Fall against the big one in black shorts
told you
They're big guys
Okay
And the bets
How much is there
little over 2000 for the time being
But it'll go up during the final match
What do  do
No girls
Stay in the car
(To Ali) You ready
Ali nods
60 69 The blazing sun is melting the asphalt
coin bounces between pairs of basketball shoes
The cousin picks it up
He points to Ali and the guy in the black shorts
You and you
Ali pulls off his -shirt, staring down his adversary
Martial takes the  shirt and leans over to Ali
If you get into trouble, don't insist, just fall
Ali doesn't flinch
The cousin, the bettors and the other fighters move away
70
' Stephanie watches the faces leaning over the balconies overhead
She hears the spectators' hostility and cheers
circle has formed around the fighters
She sees the shadow, and only the shadow, of his opponent's fist barely miss Ali's face
Then things speed up
Ali uses his feet, knees and fists
When his opponent begins to totter to one side, Ali hangs onto him like a pit bull
When he falls, Ali pounds on his face with his fists and elbows
The a ref' has to enlist Cousin's help to pull Ali away
Ali returns to his place in the car
Stephanie looks at him: he can't sit still
have to go
Another combat begins, while Ali jogs around the hangar
Stephanie watches other combats, whether featuring Ali or not
61 She sees feet dancing on the concrete
She sees the banknotes in people's hands
She sees heads leaning over balconies
She sees an opponent's fist hit Ali behind the ear
She sees another of Ali's opponents get back to his feet, and Ali's fist split open his nose like a ripe fig
She sees another opponent's head bounce off the concrete
She sees a tooth roll across the concrete, like dice in a crap game
She sees Ali perform three steps of a moonwalk and kiss his own biceps
71 cloud of dust, a narrow, bumpy road
Martial's car is headed for the town below
72
' on a long cut behind Ali's ear
Stephanie's fingers use a Kleenex instead of cotton
Bare-chested with a towel around his neck, Ali leans forward to make his wound more easily accessible
It's nothing, just a cut
(to Martial) Got anything to disinfect it with
(driving) No
(to Ali) Keep this on it
It's the only one have
Ali looks up at her
You liked it
62 Yes
Me too
He again lowers his head
Put this on it
It's the only one  have
Ali straightens up, covers himself with the towel and remains like that: invisible, out of breath, clearing his throat and spitting out the window
Stephanie observes the welts on his body
big service station appears a bit farther down the road
Ali sits back up
Pull over here
'll go rinse off my face
(puts out his hand) Give me 50
Martial uses his turn signal
73
' Behind the wheel of his stopped car, Martial counts the bills spread out on his lap
Have you known him for long
No, not very
Alone in the back seat, Stephanie looks out at the service station
What do you want to know
If  knew him before the accident
Martial looks back
63 What
You find it weird that we're together
You wonder what he's doing with me
No, since you know him,  just wanted to know if you've seen him like that before
No
Martial finishes counting the bills
He freaks me out
He takes his share and hands Stephanie the envelope
1200 for him
She looks at the envelope without taking it
Why are you giving me that
It's for Ali
Exactly
So why give it to me
He looks at her, suddenly surprised
Hey, you make it complicated
Either you take it or you don't
And either  talk or keep my mouth shut
He tosses the envelope at her
She looks away
Ali finally gets back into the car with a big box
It's a toy: a green John Deere tractor with all the accessories
64 For my kid
You have a kid
Yep
74
- The afternoon sun has the entire coast sparkling
Ali is on his moped, with the box between his knees, driving up the coastal road
He looks splendid, wearing new clothes
He finally sees what he was looking for: a group on the beach, Anna, Richard and their neighbors, having a picnic
: 75 Ali and Anna are off to one side, talking
You see what you're like with him
You're not around and when you are, you scream at him
Damn, you hit him
Why did you take him along if you act like that
You should have left him
Cut the shit
He's not dead
didn't do it on purpose
'm sorry about it
Anna avoids his glance
He rummages in his pocket, pulls out the envelope of money and hands it to her
Here
What's that
Money
What  owe you plus the next few 65 months
You can count it
She looks at the bills
Where did you get this
(pointing to his new clothes) Same place
won a fight
fight
What kind of fight
Is that the only job you could find
Is that why you have marks on your face
Hey, will you take the money or not
Why are you looking at me that way
Nothing
He leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest of the group
They are packing away ice chests and folding things up
Sam and his little friends are playing in the sand with the John Deere tractor
Sam has a bandage on his forehead
Ali sits down in the sand next to him
(pointing to the tractor) You like it
Sam continues to play, ignoring him
Behind them, Richard is folding up parasols with the help of Che, a bearded neighbor who is also there with all his family
Have you eaten
Yeah, yeah, 'm fine
You don't want to drink something before 66 pack up
Ali shakes his head a no'
He looks at Joelle, Che's daughter: a tomboy with boobs
(to Sam) You want to go for a swim
76 Ali and JoAlle take turns tossing Sam into the waves
The child laughs so hard, he swallows water
Ali takes Sam into his arms

Finally, room 431 opens behind him
Martial looks out
Hey
'm here
They told me 429
Martial motions him in
Normal
This one is for the equipment
Boxes of equipment are piled up under the window and the small table has been converted into a work surface camera is plugged into the  set
It shows a still picture: an empty location, one sector of an industrial site filmed from above
have to watch this
Have a seat
You wanted to see me
Ali sits on the edge of the bed
Martial watches the screen out of the corner of his eye
68 need to find a coach
real one
Someone who has me work on my takedowns
Foued
Foued doesn't know jackshit
Just jiu-jitsu and rap stuff
You need to ask Cousin
His guys must train somewhere
Think so
Yeah
And 'll need some time to train
'll talk with Alta Secu
We'll be able to work something out
Work it out how
'll have my company pay you and 'll bill them what you cost me
They'll keep paying you but now you'll work directly for me
You won't have to spend your nights there
There is some movement on the screen
He interrupts himself
Gray silhouettes cross the screen, open a door and disappear before coming back to cross the screen once again
Where's that
At the Mousquetaires
Martial rewinds and zooms in on some faces
'll make a copy and you'll take it to the 69 owner
Ask for Steve at Security
He'll tell you what to do
80
' Sam is on Richard's lap, a driving' the truck
He is in seventh heaven
In front of them, a man is running down the shoulder of the road
Look who it is
Go on, honk
81 The horn beeps
Out of breath, in a sweat, Ali looks back and sees Richard and Sam in the truck
They slow down and pull up to him
Richard lowers his window
We're going to school
Want to come along
Ali shakes his head and continues jogging
The truck disappears
82 This new gym is large, clean and light
In one corner there is a genuine ring, and on the other side, a piece of tatami
Ali is working out with Joao, a Brazilian in a kimono
They try out some foot-fist series
On the mat, Ali shadows and deconstructs Joao's gestures
83 street near the beach
The weekend is beginning
The streets are crowded
Ali is on the phone
Where are you
can't see you
Where
He looks every which way until he sees her, a few feet away
She is standing upright, in a light pair of pants, with her canes hidden behind her back
It takes some time to register
She smiles at him
70 That's fucking amazing
was looking for a wheelchair
Stop looking
No more wheelchairs
Since when
Two days
You could have told me
Why
Is it a problem
No,  don't know
You're like before
Well, not exactly
Go on, let's see
She takes a few steps forward, leaning on her canes
He whistles in admiration
need to get my balance but supposedly that doesn't take long
It must be like walking on stilts
don't know
've never walked on stilts before
You look taller
Does it hurt
71 little, but it feels good too
Want to go for a swim
She stops
The beach
pff,  don't know
It's different today
don't think  want to get undressed
84
'  - They are at the kitchen table, eating salad
Stephanie is in her wheelchair
Ali has finished his plate
Is this all you have
Look in the fridge
There must be some cheese left
You don't have any pate
No,  don't have any pate
He gets up and opens the fridge
He takes the cheese, sniffs it, then takes some yoghurt too
He notices a box of cereal on a shelf and takes it
He returns to the fridge for some milk
She watches, her mouth open in suspense
You're a good eater, aren't you
'm hungry
He begins with the cheese
No bread
72 She shakes her head "no" and points to a box of biscuits on the shelf
There are crackers up there
Do you have a girlfriend
He shakes his head
You don't have anyone
Yes, but they're not girlfriends
What are they
Quick fucks
Yeah
She hesitates
lot
He looks at her
You mind talking about this
No,  don't care
(pause) How about you
Did you have a lot of boyfriends
When, before
Yeah
was with Simon
That's all
73 No, there were others
But not a lot either
wasn't very
In fact,  liked it when guys looked at me
liked to feel that  turned them on
Afterwards,  don't know
they bored me
Ali looks at her, strangely attentive, as if he didn't understand, or didn't believe her
And now
Um, nothing
don't even know what it looks like anymore
don't even know if it still works
You don't want to
Did  say  didn't want to anymore
Of course  still want to
How do you go about it
How do you think  go about it
If  were a guy 'd say  jerk off to a porn video
'm a girl
Ali is dumbstruck
Okay, let's change the subject
She begins piling up plates and silverware
You want to fuck
She is thrown for a loop
Huh
74 You want to know if it still works, so let's fuck and that way you'll know
He looks at her, simply, naturally
She has a nervous laugh
Just like that
Um, yeah
Give me that
He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the dishwasher
don't know if  can like that
Whatever you want
You tell me
She hesitates
Wait
She wheels herself away from the table and into the bedroom
He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table
What do  do
() Wait
He waits
Then: () Come here
85
'  - He enters the room
The shutters are closed
She is in bed, under the covers
She watches him sit down on the bed, undo 75 his pants and turn toward her
Okay
Ready
Unsure of herself, she pulls a face
Let's try
He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away gently
(a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't kiss
No
Your breasts
can
Yes
He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering her
She tries to wriggle herself free
You're crushing me
Maybe you should stop talking now
Okay, 'll stop
His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her thighs
He enters her
She is about to scream, but lets herself go
She grabs hold of him
Gently
76 86
'  - Ali opens the fridge
He is dressed again
Stephanie appears in a robe, sitting in her wheelchair
We can tell she feels too shy to look at him
Are you okay
How was it
She blushes
Is it still working
Um, yes
no
don't really know
It's different
It's hard to tell after just one try
Yeah but  don't have time right now
have to go
(blushing) No, no
That's not what meant
just meant that it's too soon to tell
like too many things are happening at once
Ali doesn't understand
But did you enjoy it or not
did
beat
When you're up for it and you can't find anyone, ask me
If 'm oper, we'll do it
What's "oper"
77 Operational
If 'm available
If  can, mean
If you're "oper" we
Yeah
She sketches a vague gesture
What
Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer
Nothing
Great
87
- Stephanie uses one of her canes to push open the door to the staff room
The room is apparently empty
Louise
Louise, are you here
Is anyone here
No answer
She looks over the office she once knew so well and that hasn't seen again since her accident: the photos on the wall, the diagrams, the case histories, the animals' names, etc
88
- Up in the bleachers, Stephanie looks over all the pools, the big one as well as the others
suddenly, in nA 3, a huge but limp black dorsal fin appears
89
N3 Weighed down by her prostheses, Stephanie has to lie down on the rim of pool nA 3 to reach the water
She reaches out and slaps the water with the palm of her hand
Nothing 78 really happens, a black mass just keeps circling at the bottom of the pool
She slaps again and the black mass swims faster and faster
a wave is formed around the sides of the pool, a wave that swells higher and higher
Stephanie's hand again slaps the water and, suddenly, Niska emerges
: 90
N3 - Niska washes up
Stephanie caresses her and weeps softly, like someone caught unawares
() (gently) Stephanie
Stephanie looks back to discover Louise and three other ex- colleagues
They have been there a moment, surprised, unsettled and ill at ease
stopped by the office but there wasn't anyone
Stephanie stands up with the help of her canes
The guys rush over to help her
They hug and kiss
All four remain like that for a moment
91
- Sun and music
The public is beginning to invade the lanes and paths
Stephanie, Louise and the other keepers are on the terrace of the employees' cafeteria
They are thrilled and reassured to see her again
At times a hand touches her arm or shoulder
Sometimes an acquaintance comes over and kisses her
Under the table, Stephanie types a oper
' into her cell phone, then looks up and returns to her surroundings
We can imagine the "How are you
" "And you
" "Great"
The "Let me get a look at you
You look wonderful
"
all a 79 bit strained, but friendly
Louise, who is sitting next to her, leans over to her: (softly) See
It wasn't hard
They smile at each other and return to the conversation in progress
Stephanie's cell phone vibrates on the table
She discreetly checks the answer, and when she looks up, exchanges a glance with Louise
From that glance, we cut to: 92 Stephanie and Louise are out shopping
Stephanie holds herself up thanks to the shopping cart she is pushing
We join their conversation already in progress
When  feel like it,  send him a text message and ask if he's oper
If he is, we hook up
Louise reacts
What's oper
If he's up for it
If he's free
If he is, we fuck
Is that all
Yes, that's all
What else do you want
don't know
Is that enough
For me it is
80 What does he do
Stephanie hesitates a moment, as if worried about how Louise will react
He fights
What kind
No
Illicit fights in the projects
Louise reacts
Whatever  say, you make a face
Just give me a second to react
Are you in love
She hesitates
He does me good
93 The group of trainers has accompanied Stephanie to a taxi
94
/  - Stephanie waves good-bye
They return her wave
The taxi drives away
The group scatters
: 95 dark cellar
We hear Ali and Stephanie labor and sigh door suddenly opens above and we hear voices
81 Shit
Who is it
He looks for his clothes
96 then goes to the garden where he startles Anna: didn't know you were here
You scared me
What were you up to
was talking
You're not alone
'm with a friend
You bring girls back to my place now
She's a friend,  said
Just then, the basement door opens and Stephanie appears on her crutches
Anna is dismayed
Ali motions to Stephanie: (to Stephanie) Let me introduce you to my sister
(to Anna) This is Stephanie
You know the girl from Marineland
Stephanie offers her hand to Anna who takes it, then realizing what she's doing, puts the other to her mouth: Oh, my God
Poor thing
82 Sam arrives with his snack
Stephanie looks at him
So that's him
They are sitting around the garden table
Anna comes carrying a tray
They were out of grapefruit
took tropical fruit
She puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on the table
Through a hole in the oilcloth, Stephanie can watch Sam playing under the table
'll make tea
have some cookies
You drink tea, don't you
Don't bother
This is perfect,  swear
Thanks
Before Stephanie can even finish, Anna is already on the way back to the kitchen
You don't want to get going
Wait, your sister
You freak her out
Can't you see
She feels like a cashier with you
Pathetic with her tea and cookies
It's a pain
Stephanie leans on a cane to stand up
What are you doing
'm going to help her
83 No need to overdo it
97
' Later, Sam guides Stephanie up the narrow stairs of the house
She has a hard time with her a legs' and canes
98
' child's room with cheap wall paper depicting dolphins
Stephanie is sitting on the edge of the bed
So this is where you sleep
It's a nice room
Sam nods in agreement
He gives her a strange look
Why are you looking at me like that
Does it scare you
You want to see them, is that it
He nods
She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis underneath
Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand, touches it carefully
Does it hurt
Stephanie smiles at him
No
Want to touch it
Sam reaches out his hand
99
' In  through the tinted windows of Martial's Mercedes Vito: the face of a boxer who is lying on the ground and being pummeled
Ali is sitting bare-chested in the back seat, a towel around his neck and a bottle of water between his knees
84 Ali watches the fight
Sitting next to him, Stephanie fills a plastic bag with ice cubes
She hands it to him
Here
He applies it to his eyebrow
She displaces a bloody strand of hair and replaces it with another
We see Martial return to the car and open the front door
You okay
He puts a wad of money in the glove compartment
You ready
Ali nods a yes'
He opens his door, gets half out and empties the bottle of water over his head
Stephanie is left alone in the car
She hears the spectators' cheers
She closes the window and turns on the air conditioning full blast
100
- His opponent's guard is up, closed tighter than a safe
Behind his fists, Ali can see the guy's frozen stare
And then suddenly he breaks loose: a series of feints and a kick behind the ear
He hears himself growl, the light becomes electrifying
He is on the ground, protecting himself as best he can
He tries to block his opponent's arm
He hears himself wheezing and panting like a pair of bellows
He sees his blood splatter his opponent
() All of a sudden, in your mouth, it's like it tasted like bone
taste of rust and bone
() Because you think bone has a taste
85 () Yeah, there  did
Then, through the spectators' legs, he sees something: sunlight reflected off the Mercedes door that has just opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses, a pair of shortsa He also sees the heads of the tough guys who turn back to look
He breaks free, struggles to his feet, spits up a clot of blood and returns to the task at hand
His opponent tries to get up
Ali jumps on him to finish 101
' The car is driving back into town
Martial is driving
The windows are open
Ali holds a bag of ice against his cheek bone, while Stephanie applies her Band-Aids to a cut over his eyebrows
They are talking, but we can not hear what they say
All we hear is the noise of the wind against the open windows
Ali suddenly breaks out laughing
Martial does too in the rear view mirror
Stephanie follows suita 102 Muzak
Ali and Martial follow the head of security into the store
Some of the personnel are near the cash registers, silent, hostile and immobile
The morning customers wonder what's happening
The head of security elbows his way through
Let them through, please
The personnel reluctantly make way
103
- Red graffiti on the wall: " " 86 Ali recognizes the place with the palettes up to the ceiling
In the back, he also recognizes the manager, protected by two guards and being harangued by union representatives
(to Ali, pointing to the manager) Go get the equipment
need to see him
Ali obeys
Don't bother
We're the ones who will call the police
The police and the press
That way they'll know you spy on your workers
The manager looks away, accompanied by his two guards
At least have the courage to look at me when talk to you
: The cameras, the ripped out cables, the phony boxes have been piled up on the floor
It looks more like the crime squad has been at work
Ali opens a garbage bag and bends over to retrieve the equipment
() What are you doing there
She's a young employee in the store uniform
(suspicious) Packing up
Is it your stuff
No
He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a picture
87 Don't you take a picture
You work for them
She continues to manipulate her phone
said no picture
Why shouldn't
You film us
He straightens up menacingly
'm going to slap you
hand grabs his arm
It's Martial
Forget it
Let's get out of here
And the equipment
Forget about it
We're fucked here
The cops are going to question the managers and the managers will turn us in
They leave
104
'  1 Martial's fingers slowly play with the hair on his chest
He is lying nude on the bed of his Formule 1 hotel room
He smokes and stares at the ceiling
His suitcases and bags are packed, all he has to do is close them
He hears knocks next door
He gets up with a sigh, pulls on his pants and opens the door
Stephanie is waiting in front of room 429
88 In here
Stephanie looks back, surprised
Martial motions her in
have to go away for work
3 or 4 months, don't know yet
Since Ali wants to keep fighting,  thought maybe you tend to that while 'm not here
She is thunderstruck
Is he okay with that
He's the one who asked me to call you
Why me
guess he trusts you
(laughs, thrown for a loop) Yes, sure but
don't know anything about that scene
don't know those guys
He hands her an old spiral notebook
wrote it all down here
As for the rest, ask me your questions and 'll answer them
How do  do the bets
You can count on your fingers, can't you
Honestly, can you see me dealing with those beasts
89 Yeah
beat
And you need money to cover the bets, and you have money
She looks at him
What
You're not rich
What did the insurance company give you for your legs
200,000
300,000
Those jobs must have good health plans
Am  wrong
No
shadow crosses Stephanie's mind
She looks at the open bags and suitcases, without really seeing them
The place looks like it's expecting a police raid
Where are you going
Grenoble, then Vienne
Austria
No, in the IsA re
Was the insurance money your idea
Yes
beat
He gives her time to wrap her head around that one
Then, since she still looks troubled, he taps her on the hand
90 It's me,  said
Don't worry
'm the bad guy
105 Through the door of the club, we hear snatches of the introduction to Thunderstruck
People are sweating and trying to get into the Fever
Foued lets Martial, Ali, Stephanie and Khadi through
Virile bear hugs and handshakes
The Cousin's waiting for you inside
Table to the left of the bar
Ali knows and greets everyone
Stephanie is in the middle of the group
She holds herself up on the shoulders of these big, caring guys and lets herself be carried along
She feels good 106 The club is hot as a steam bath
Loud music blares out of loudspeakers
Bodies dance and eyes shine bright
At the table "left of the bar": Cousin and three friends who are with him
Another round of bear hugs and handshakes
Martial, Stephanie and Cousin regroup face to face
Martial speaks, Cousin listens and at times looks over at Stephanie, who looks at him too
She notices one of the tattoos on his arm: a green and red snake that seems to be slithering out his sleeve
The barman brings two bottles of champagne
Ali leans toward her: Want to boogie
She doesn't understand
(loud) You want to dance
91 She looks frightened, but then smiles when she sees what he's up to
Come on
No, no
Whatever you say
He goes to the dance floor and begins to rock
He dances badly, clumsily
Martial pours champagne
107 The smoking area is located outside, and a bit farther off, the dope smoking area
Behind the smokers, we hear noise from the club
Cousin is puffing on a spliff
Stephanie watches, holding her champagne goblet
He offers it to her
She accepts and takes a drag
Can  talk to you
She nods "yes"
There's something 'd like to know
The fish that ate your legs
She wasn't expecting that
Yes
Is it true it's still there
Yeah
where else would it be
They didn't shoot it
Or put it down, whatever
92 Why would they do that
don't know
when a dog attacks you, they kill it
And the fish gets off
Don't you mind that the thing that ate your legs is living it up in its shitty fucking aquarium
No
And  don't want anything to happen to it
Now more than ever
He looks at her, incredulous, but with admiration
(imitating her) "Now more than ever"
Listen to you
He takes another drag
(imitating her) Tututu-tu-tutu
They laugh
Do  sound like that
Tututu
108 We are back inside
Ali is working on a girl a bit farther off on the dance floor
Stephanie follows Cousin through the noise and sticky heat
When she next looks at the dance floor, Ali is no longer there
Ali and the girl are on their way to the exit
Ali looks for a friendly face, meets Stephanie's glance and motions that he's leaving
She waves: "Yeah, ok,  get it
" Ali disappears with the girl
Stephanie is at the bar, drinking
She types an  into her cell phone: "operational
" She hesitates, then puts 93 away her cell phone
She hadn't noticed a guy sitting next to her
She also failed to notice that he's been speaking to her for a while now
(loud) Huh
can't hear you
(loud) No problem
What are you drinking
(loud) Champagne
The guy orders
He is blond, lean and athletic-looking
He might be thought to resemble Simon
What's your name
'm Pierre
Hey there
'm Marie
Come here often
Stephanie is on automatic pilot
When she turns to the room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her
She can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts under her -shirt
She answers his questions, she returns his smiles
When she finishes her glass and puts it down on the counter, he kisses her
She doesn't push him away immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time to put a good face on it
No
No, please
don't feel like it
Not tonight
can't
The guy looks disappointed, then manages a a good loser's' smile
Okay, no problem
It's best  go
Good night and thanks
94 He sees her lean over to retrieve her canes and then hobble away
Sorry
couldn't know
Stephanie freezes
You couldn't know what
Huh
You couldn't know what, asshole
Foued runs to warn Martial, Khadi and Cousin that something is wrong
When Martial arrives, he sees Stephanie collared by a bouncer three times her size
She lashes out with one of her canes, while under the bar, another bouncer tries to help the blond guy back to his feet
There's a deep gash on his skull
Cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand
109
-  - Early morning
The shrill screech of the sea gulls and the milky light of a day that looks like it's going to be sunless
Stephanie drinks her coffee at the only table on the terrace
Behind her, chairs are still piled up and the waiter is slowly getting to work
silhouette appears on the sidewalk
It's Ali, in the same clothes as last night
He joins her and takes a seat
You okay
Fine
95 Did you stay late
can't remember
Afterwards the cousin took us to a club at la Colle sur Loup
It sucked and it was 5 a
m
And you
Normal
(to the waiter)  large coffee with milk and bread with butter
beat
You think it's good that we're having this conversation
What conversation
That  ask how it was with the girl last night and you answer normal
What do you want me to say
Nothing
He grimaces at her mood
Oh la
"Oh la" what
You think it's normal leaving with that bimbo in front of me
What would you say if  did the same thing
Nothing
Oh yeah
You wouldn't care
96 You're pissing me off
What's your problem
Wait, let me put it differently
What  am for you
friend
pal
Sort of a buddy, like Foued and the others
Tell me something: do you and your buddies fuck every now and then
He snickers
No
Really
Never
That's the difference
Her looks at her
Dammit, stop looking at me that way
How am  looking at you
The waiter arrives with Ali's order
She tones her voice down a notch
You wanted us to continue
Isn't that what you told Martial
What are you talking about, fucking or fighting
Well, we have to go about it well
We have to show each other manners, and consideration
Manners
97 Hey
Stop acting like an idiot
Do the words bother you
You know what  mean
Tact
You've never stopped being tactful with me
beat
He looks away
So
is that a plan
She waits for his mind to come back before continuing
We'll continue
but not like animals
He smirks, with a flick of the chin
Cat got your tongue
Ali stirs his cup without answering
He feels her eyes on him
He smiles
'm oper now
What
You made me oper
It's you
It's because it's all you're talking about
(softly) You are really a dog
He stands up
What are you doing
'm getting out of here
Why
98 'm fed up
You're bored
Yeah
What 'm saying bores you
Yeah
Are you acting like a jackass on purpose
Aren't you being an ass by putting words everywhere
He sits back down
She watches him eat his sandwiches
'm the one who's leaving
She gets up
Ali finishes his coffee
110 The buzz of a small electric compressor
In extreme close up: the needle of a tattoo machine pricking skin
Ink flows, a cotton swab wipes
a tattoo slowly appears
Lying on a table, Stephanie is having what remains of her legs tattooed
: 99 111
/ Stephanie is at a teller's window, withdrawing a rather large amount of cash
machine counts out the bills, while the employee stuffs wads of them into an envelope
112
/ Pennants flap in the wind, the pennants of a used car dealership
: car doors opening, automatic gearboxes, Stephanie's "feet" testing pedals, bucket seats, backseats, tinted windows opening and closing, etc
113
- painting of a lion hunt and, under it, Stephanie and Cousin on a couch, talking shop
Leaning over a computer and a cell phone, they go over potential adversaries
Some kids stick their heads in to see what Stephanie looks like
114 Foued, wearing protective gear, spars with a black cruiserweight
The fight is close, the sound of flesh on flesh resounds
Outside the ring, Ali cheers Foued on
He notices on the other side of the ring a young thin, bearded guy in a Lacoste polo shirt buttoned up to his neck - Leonardini - who is following the fight with the eye of a pro
When Ali and Joao are later working out on their bit of tatami, Ali sees Foued sitting on a bench, with a towel around his neck and talking with Leonardini
He saw me at la Ciotat
We spoke a few times on the phone
When he has it in for you, he never lets up
Leonardini is well-known
100 He was a club in Strasbourg with a training center
He's taking me on a trial basis for three months
If it works out, he'll make challenger in the nationals
115
- Ali and Foued are off to one side in the locker room
So are you going to Strasbourg
What do you think
'd be an idiot
And when are you leaving
Leonardini enters the locker room
Mr
Leonardini, this is my buddy Ali
Ali Van Versh
Leonardini shakes his hand
Pleased to meet you
116
- Through the tinted windshield of a Nissan Pathfinder , Ali watches Stephanie, wearing a tight  shirt and leaning on her cane, talking with Cousin and some bettors
The discussion looks intense
Stephanie returns to the car
Below her pedal pushers, her prostheses sparkle in the sunlight
We hear salacious jibes from the surrounding buildings
She opens the car door
How much is there
101 3400
Are you ready
Walking with a slow, deliberate sway - aware of the effect she's having - she ceremonially opens the passenger door
The remarks cease
117
'
/ : a black and red arrow with, in industrial characters: ""
It's the tattoo on Stephanie's right thigh
Ali's hand grips and squeezes the thigh
They are making love
The room is half-lit
Ali growls and grinds his teeth in his sleep
Stephanie slowly and noiselessly rolls over to her side of the bed
She gets up and, using her hands, drags herself toward the bathroom
Suddenly, feeling like he's suffocating, Ali awakens
It takes a few seconds for him to realize where he is
His hand sweeps across the bed
Where are you
() Here
He sits up
She is embarrassed
No, don't look
What are you doing
'm going to pee
Is it early
Five
102 Shit,  collapsed
Ali slips out of bed, naked, yawning and groggy
He comes and leans over her
don't like it when you see me like this
Hold on
She hangs onto his neck
He lifts her up and, both naked, he carries her into the bathroom
118
'  - Stephanie is sitting on the toilet, while Ali pees in the shower
called the numbers they gave me at the gym
spoke to an organizer, GA14nther Bower
She yawns
There's a gala in Turin next week
He told me that we'd have time to meet there
'm going to go
Yeah
And when do  see him
Later, in his gym in Dortmund
He wants to organize a test match, to see what you're worth
To see if you've got the "GAttlicher Zorn""
Ali comes out of the shower
Turn on the water
103 Huh
Turn on the water when you pee
It's disgusting
He runs some water

' He carries her back into the bedroom
She looks at his face, the scar on his forehead, the scar over his nose
How's your nose
Mm
It doesn't seem broken
No
They look at each other
He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her
Stephanie slides over to him
He lifts her up and places her on her stomach
They remain like that, without moving
She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock
She leans over and kisses him on the mouth
He pulls away, surprised
Now we're allowed
No answer
They make love

104 The road speeds by
Sun
Road signs with the names of Italian cities
The landscape has changed
Wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses, Stephanie drives with her elbow out the window
On the radio, we hear the voice of an Italian
121 Ali jogs along the sea shore
He sweats, huffing and puffing
He stops, takes a few steps, then continues, but soon stops again
It looks as if his feet are weighing him down
Traffic speeds by
He stands still and stares into the near distance
Nothing
122
- standard hotel lobby
Curious, Stephanie looks at the crowd of fighters the day before the a Ultimate' tournament: muscle-bound giants squeezed into tight jackets, with bashed in eyebrows, collapsed nostrils, cauliflower ears
Every language can be heard, some greet each other, some hug, they all size each other up
: Propped up on her cane, she heads for a table in a corner of the bar where a man is consulting his cell phone
(in German) Mr
Bower
(in German) Yes
(in German) 'm Stephanie Granget
GA14nther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of those years in the ring
: 105 Settled in a corner in front of their open PCs, Stephanie and GA14nther talk shop
: They are about to separate
(in German) Can you get me a ticket for tonight
(in German)  don't know
'll see what can do
(pointing to her legs) What happened to your legs
An accident
In another life
was an animal trainer
worked with orcas
The show took a turn for the worse
(it dawns on him) Oh, of course
In France
The accident
It was you
'm talking to a star
Stephanie makes a face
Yes,  am
Amazing
What courage
Bravo
'm very honored, really
was an idiot before
Why
acted like an arrogant business man
'm so ashamed
Will you forgive me
Of course, Mr
Bower
Call me GA14nther
Of course you can come tonight
As my guest
106 123
- Bleachers have been set up in a gym, surrounding a cage- like, fenced-in ring
Inside, combatants fight, no rules, no holds barred
On the floor, two wrestlers clasp and elbow each other
One is bleeding from the forehead
Below the ring, Stephanie is mesmerized by this carnival of violence
GA14nther leans toward her: (in German) Funny, huh
(in German) What
That
That
and you
124 Stephanie walks down a corridor
She stops in front of a door and knocks
GA14nther opens
He looks surprised
He is barefoot, in a pair of trousers and an unbuttoned shirt
He looks at her inquisitively, and when she still doesn't : (in German) Are you okay
Do you need anything
She hesitates
(in German) came to see if  got it wrong, or not
He knits his brow
(in German) Got what wrong
(in German) You don't understand
107 (in German) Excuse me
(in German) got the impression, the way you were looking at me before
Try to understand because this is getting hard for me
(in German) No, you didn't get it wrong
He smiles and opens the door
(in German) have someone in my life, you know
So do
He draws her inside
The door closes
125 Anna is about to open her cash register, when a West Indian in a security uniform whispers into her ear, apparently asking her to follow him
Another cashier is already waiting to take her place
Anna joins three other employees waiting in a corridor
They exchange a few words under their breath
126
-  - Anna comes out of an office, looking distraught
She has to lean against the wall to hold herself up
colleague comes to help
So
got fired
Come on
There's something we want to show you
108 In the locker room, we recognize the girl who had photographed Ali while he was trying to reclaim Martial's camera equipment
The girl says something to Anna
When it seems that Anna can not believe her ears, the girl takes out her cell phone and confronts her with the evidence
Anna needs to sit down
127 Out of breath, Ali pushes open the gate and climbs the stairs
128 In the kitchen, Anna and Richard are sitting at the table in front of a meal they haven't had the appetite to start
You okay
No answer
You don't seem it
He goes to open the fridge
What are you doing
'm hungry
Close it
Don't eat here
Ali stares at her, stunned
Don't eat here
What the hell is going on
was fired this morning
'm unemployed
109 Shit
But what's the problem if  eat here
Anna stands up
They had cameras in the storeroom
They filmed us when we took the expired food
They fired us
Ali's head spins
You had your sister fired
How does it feel
How much did you get for that
You get paid per person or a flat rate
Nothing to say take you in,  take care of your son and you have nothing to say
couldn't know
You couldn't know
You couldn't know what
That you were screwing us out of jobs
That you were hurting people
Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand delivers a resounding slap
He takes it like a man
moment passes
Ali is red from the slap, red with shamea until he suddenly straightens up and knocks over the table
Calm down
Calm down,  said
Ali looks back
He sees Richard's grim face at the other end of a hunting rifle
Take your stuff and get out of here
We don't want to see you around here anymore
110 sudden noise draws their attention: Sam is watching from the top of the stairs
Go to your room
Go upstairs immediately
129
'  - An  arrives from Stephanie: aAlmost there
miss you
a Ali is lying on his mattress
He puts down the phone
He hears Anna and Richard's voices upstairs
He sits up and begins to stuff things into a bag
new message arrives: aI'm home
Oper
a Ali hesitates, then turns off his phone and clicks his bag closed
130
'  - ' Night has fallen
Sam's nose is stuck to his bedroom window
He sees his aunt sitting at the plastic table in the garden downstairs with her face in her hands
door slams
Sam rushes to the bathroom window
He sees his father stomp down the street, never once looking back
Sam remains glued to the window pane
Ali's silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight before again disappearing into the dark
Sam watches him for as far as he can
Fade to black
131
/ In the half-light of the basement, a rectangle of light has formed where the door opens onto the street
Stephanie looks over Ali's mess: his magazines, body building equipment, dirty -shirts, track suits hanging over a trestle
Anna is standing against the light at the door and, a bit farther off, Sam is sitting on the stairs watching them
In his message he said he was in Strasbourg
No news since
don't know what he's doing 111 there, or even if he's still there
Has he called you
She shakes her head "no"
Did you try the gym
Yeah
They don't know
If  had an address or a number, 'd give it to you
Even if  think it's dumb
Do you believe me
Yes
After what he did to me
Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door
She's about to leave
He abandoned his kid
He doesn't give a fuck about anything
All he ever cared about was himself
He's totally selfish
Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light
() You don't know him
() Me
What did you expect with him
() don't know
Not this
Fade to black
Black
112 132 frosty landscape with trees that look like they've been engraved in ink
group of twelve joggers in blue track suits run across a landscape of gray sky and snow
Some shadowbox while running
Ali is wearing a wool cap pulled down around his ears
He runs alongside Foued
133 ring has been set up in the middle of the gym
few guys have gathered round to watch Ali rhythmically pound on his trainer's bear-like paws
Leonardini sets the pace
1,2
1,2,3,4
Faster
1,2,3
Yes
Faster
Move
You're stepping back
Ali pounds harder and harder
He times his respiration to match the movement of his fists
134 Young athletes, some tall, some short, some heavyset, some not, are sitting on refectory chairs to watch
Ali does too
His hair is cut short and his face is closely shaven
He looks younger
He could be a student
135
'
/ truck rushes headlong through the countryside
First it is day, then night
136 Through the window, Ali sees a twelve-ton Scania pull to a stop at the entrance to the parking lot and beep its horn
Ali runs out to meet it
137
- Richard lowers his window
113 can't come in any further or  won't be able to get back out
Ali checks out the huge semi
Looks like you changed trucks
Bosses, in fact
'm back to being exploited
Ali doesn't insist
Richard opens his door to let out Sam who is already trampling him, trying to get out
(to Sam) Got everything
Your bag, your coat, your hat, your mittens
You haven't forgotten anything
Now give me a kiss
Sam gives him a kiss
Richard slips him out and into Ali's arms
How are things there
They're okay
My sister
She found a job at a school cafeteria
She seems to enjoy it
Does she know about today
Yes
She says it's good for the kid
Tell her  can't help out for the time being but that as soon as  have a little money
114 Don't worry
When's your fight
Next month
On the 9th
Richard smiles admiringly
Keep us posted if you win
Sure  will
Yeah, right
Okay, 'm off
'll deliver my load in Colmar and pick up the kid at around 7, okay
Okay
No later, because  have to be back tomorrow at 11
The two men say good-bye
Sam waves good-bye
138 path runs through fields and into a clump of fir trees
Ali pulls a plastic sled with Sam on top
Whenever there is a slope, he lets Sam glide down it and runs after him
Snow falls from the trees
He looks up and sees a couple of squirrels jump from branch to branch
Sam has never seen any before
Ali neither
Sunlight filters through the branches
group of cross- country skiers trudges by
want to skate too
115 They're not skating
They're skiing
No, they're skating
They're skiing,  said
Skating
few steps on: Skiing
You're annoying me
They take a break at a picnic area, where they eat some sandwiches and drink orange soda
(his mouth full) Does Auntie still have dogs
No, now it's chickens
In the garden
Yeah, in the cage
They lay eggs
That's good
But Auntie doesn't want me to take the chicks in my room
She's right
They're disgusting
(pointing to his sandwich) Finished
You want some 116 applesauce
Afternoon
On the way back, they find a frozen pond
Ali carefully advances on the ice
He tests it
Jumps on it
Then he lets himself go and glides across the ice
You can go
But not too far
Sam starts slipping and sliding
He falls down
He lies on the sled and lets it glide
Ali pees behind a tree
Sam is far away
Come on, we have to head back
5 minutes
Now
(showing his fingers) 5 minutes
5 minutes
And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks
He tries to climb out and sinks again
thin layer of ice is forming over him
Daddy
Daddy
Shit
Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over
He kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole
Sam has disappeared
Ali shoves aside snow
He looks everywhere, but sees nothing
And then he hears a noise, blows like signals coming from under the ice
Ali crawls 117 over and clears away snow as best he can
Under the ice, he sees Sam's face, staring wide-eyed
Ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice, like pistons or pestles
As if pounding on his punching bag
139 Underwater, we hear the sound of dull thuds
Sam sees his father's fists pound on the ice
He sees bloodstains
The ice cracks, a bloody fist searches the water for him
Sam closes his eyes
140 Evening is falling
Ali has stretched Sam out on the rim of the pond
The child has turned blue
He tries mouth-to- mouth resuscitation, he massages his heart and rubs him down
141 Ali's respiration has become a grunt, then a groan
He runs
He has stowed Sam behind the front of his parka and runs as fast as he can
He slips, gets back up and runs again
he again breathes into Sam's mouth
while still running
142
-  - Leaning against the window of the Intensive Care Unit, Ali sees Sam's nude, tiny body being worked on by doctors
his skin is blue from the cold
there is a tube in his mouth
his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a respirator
his mouth spits out brackish water brutally
door opens and a nurse appears
Ali straightens up
We'll take care of you
Come with me
He doesn't understand
Then he notices the blood prints his hands have left on the  window
He looks at his scarred fingers, his broken, bloodied hands
118 143
' Sam is lying in a hospital bed
His eyes are closed and coils of tubes attach him to control apparatus
Ali is at his side
His hands are now wrapped in thick bandages
The disinfectant makes him look like he is wearing yellow gloves halfway up his arms
Richard is standing behind him, near the window
Ali takes Sam's fingers, places them in the palm of his bandaged hand and looks at them
Sam's eyes begin to dart wildly under his eyelids
his fingers quiver
his eyes open
144
- There are not many people in the corridor at this late hour
Richard is bent over a coffee machine
cup slowly fills up
Farther off, Ali is , leaning against a wall
Richard brings him a coffee
Ali takes it clumsily into his damaged hands
Richard's cell phone rings
He moves away to answer and speaks into it softly
few moments later, he returns to Ali and hands him the phone
Here
She wants to talk to you
Anna
Richard shakes his head
Hello
() It's me
(pause) Do you mind
No
119 How is he
Okay
He woke up an hour ago
Is he injured
No,  don't think so
And how are you
fucked up my hands on the ice
Is it serious
They're broken
beat
How are you
'm okay
What are you up to
You mean in general
In my life
wanted to say that
'm not asking for anything
'll be going
'll call you back to see how Sam's doing
Give him a kiss him from me
120 Don't hang up
Don't hang up
won't hang up
He was in a coma for 3 hours
Three hours
For three hours he was dead was scared to lose him
His eyes well with tears
Don't leave me
won't leave you
Black
love you
145 child sleeps
His eyes are darting under his eyelids: vestiges of light and shadow, of noise
Sam opens his eyes: he is in a hotel room
At the foot of the bed, a  with the sound turned down low is broadcasting a cartoon of mice fighting in Polish
Stephanie comes and goes, picking up things littering the floor and packing their bags
Over these images, we hear Ali's voice: The human hand contains 27 bones
Some monkeys have more: gorillas have 32, five in 121 each thumb
For humans, it's 27
If you break an arm or a leg, after a while calcium gathers around the bone and joins it together
In the end, it's stronger than before
But if you break a bone in your hand, you know it'll never fully heal
You'll think about it before every fight
You'll pay attention
And even if you pay attention, the pain will come back
like needles, like broken glass
Ali is wearing a -shirt
He still bears the marks of yesterday's fight
His eyebrows and hands are bandaged
Wake up, kiddo
It's over
We're going home
Did you win
He smiles and kisses his biceps
146
- The lobby of a Holiday Inn, the day after an Ultimate tournament
(much the same ambience as in Turin) The fighters, winners and losers, are about to leave
They greet each other, pose for photographers, answer interviewers, sign autographs
Ali's hands are still bandaged
He is being interviewed along with a kind of Viking with a closed eye and broken arm
Ali goes to join Stephanie and Sam outside the hotel, where a taxi driver is loading their luggage
young Polish fan calls out: "Ali
Ali
" He wants a photo
Ali lifts Sam into his arms and pulls Stephanie closer
They pose
