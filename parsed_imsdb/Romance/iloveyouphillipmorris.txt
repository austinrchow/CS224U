He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard- the sound of a sternum  can be heard

(
) So here we are, where you first met me
: 185
- 1998 -          185 sheet is pulled over the cardio victim's corpse and Steven watches as it is wheeled out of the ward
He returns his bleary gaze to the ceiling
(
) 've been in this bed for months now
Waiting to die
The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that  might get a chance to see Phillip one more time
(beat) But  don't know how much longer  can do this
Steven's eyes roll back into his head as he slips into unconsciousness
186
, 1998 -  -                    186 slightly built, effeminate inmate () raps on Phillip's open cell door as he enters
Got a minute
Samuel
You want some crackers
No
thanks
Look-  just talked to my friend- he's a nurse at the infirmary don't know if you know this or not but uh
Phillip looks to him with curiosity
: 187
, 1998 -   -      187 Phillip flails as  hold him back from a
Just let me in
" Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages      5-23-08    103
He's not here
need to see him
told you he's not here
You need to calm down
Phillip calms himself
Just tell me where he is
What happened
He slipped into a coma for a few days
He's conscious now, but he's very sick
We had him transferred to a private care facility
There was nothing we could do for him here
It's just a matter of time now
Phillip listens in devastated silence
188
- 1998 -                  188 Steven looks worse than ever in his semi-private bed, looking out the window at the clouds with a catatonic gaze
He's at peace
It is the moment of his death
(
) Steven
Death will have to wait another few moments
nurse leans over him as he tries to focus
(') Steven
Someone wants to talk to you
He keeps calling
He's driving us crazy
Steven can't respond
The nurse picks up the phone
(') (into phone) Okay you can put him through
She puts the phone to Steven's ear
He can muster only a few words
" Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   104
(wisp) didn't want you to find out
189
- 1998-           189 Phillip is  with the helpless Steven
Steven
Oh God
Why didn't you write me
don't know how this happened, they say 'm fine
Oh God, who did this
(then) It doesn't matter
had to talk to you Steven
(tearing up) am still angry with you, but  need you to know something
Even if sometimes don't know who you are,  love you never stopped loving you
(smiles) You and me are just fools for love guess- written in the stars or some crap like that
(tears) But it was never better, never more real than with you Steven
realize now that all that crazy shit you did- in your fucked up way- it was always for me
Always for us
You are the most amazing man Steven
It takes my breath away
And even though  can't be with you now, will always be yours
Forever
He steels himself as best he can
(') Now if you have to go, go
It's okay
'm right there
Okay
'm right there
Tears surface again
He chokes back a sob
190
- 1998 -          190 As a single tear runs down Steven's face, the nurse puts the phone on the hook and leaves
Steven lies motionless
He gazes out the window to the passing clouds in the sky
It's time

191
, 1998 -  -                   191 Samuel walks past cell after cell with a grave look in his eyes
Eventually he arrives at Phillip's cell to find him sitting on his bunk
Phillip
Phillip looks up
(') Uh- my friend in the infirmary
Uh, they got a call from that long term care place and uh, well a few days ago Steven- (then) 'm so sorry Phillip
Phillip nods as it washes over him
He sends Samuel on his way with a look
Once he's alone, Phillip lets go and
He buries his face in his pillow
After a long while- sound gets his attention
stands at the door of his cell
Morris
Come with me
Phillip composes himself and follows the guard out
192
- 1998 -         192 The guard leads Phillip down the corridor
Still coming out of his mournful haze, he becomes curious
They arrive at a door marked, "  2"
Where are we going
Your lawyer's here
He swings open the door to reveal , alive and well and wearing a thrift store suit
Phillip is aghast, frozen
" Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08   106
(
) Did  forget to mention  didn't die
Yeah, didn't die
Faked the whole thing
: 193
, 1997 -    -     193 Steven is curled up in a ball, sobbing as he stares at a picture of Phillip pasted to the wall
(
) Shut the fuck up, 'm trying to sleep
Fuck you
got a broken heart here
We see now his Bunkmate is Cleavon
Well then do something about it mother fucker- `stead of crying like Whitney Houston looking for her crack pipe
Steven takes his kind words to heart
Yeah  know
Damn right
Love creates miracles motherfucker
Ain't you ever read the Bible
So get off your ass and go forth unto the Canaanites you faggot bitch
Steven returns his gaze to Phillip's photo
When you're right you're right Cleavon
Long pause
Wanna suck me off
No thanks
Well sweet dreams then
" Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   107
(
) Lying there in all my misery,  had a moment of clarity
It became clear to me- had to get to Phillip
No matter what
Even if it meant dying
194
, 1997 -  -                194 Steven sits over an untouched tray of food, staring at it detached
(
) Faking your death from  is no easy task, believe me
But after watching Jimmy die,  thought  could make it convincing
First, you have to starve yourself-  ate half as much every day for ten months
After that, you have to fake all sorts of symptoms
195
, 1997 -   -       195 Steven kneels over the toilet in his cell, sticking his finger down his throat until he pukes
(
) You gotta keep this up for months until you lose about, say, 80 pounds
196
, 1998 -    -  196 Months later, Steven sits up in his bed
He now has a grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he has lost an unhealthy amount of weight
(
) But the hardest part is falsifying your records
197
, 1998 -   () 197 Steven enters an inmate's cell () with a Hey Lawrence- you still work in the infirmary
Mmm hmm
" Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages      5-23-08   108
Steven holds up a three pound
You like coffee
198
, 1998 -   -         198 Lawrence sweeps up in an empty office
He looks to see if the coast is clear and bolts for some file cabinets
After some searching, Lawrence pulls out a file entitled "Russell, Steven "
Reading from a scrap of paper, he scrawls something with a pen
Lawrence then reaches into his pants and pulls out some forged forms- stuffing them into the folder
199
, 1998 -  -                199 on the gaunt and grey-skinned Steven
places a thermometer in his mouth and looks at Phillip's medical history
- a doctor's entry reads "+ since 91" few flips of the pages reveal Buzzwords like -  and other terms catch the Nurse's eye
He looks concerned
'll be right back
200
, 1998 -    -      200 Steven sits before a    who looks through his records

Steven sits expressionless
How long do  have
And off the Doctor's grave face-- " Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08    109
201
- 1998 -  201 Steven lays in his hospital bed
puts a pill in his mouth and follows it with some water
She exits
Once she's clear, Steven reaches into his mouth and pulls out the pill
He secretly places it into a small  in his mattress for safe keeping
202
- 1998 -  202 Again, we are at the first hospital scene of the movie
The cardio  blares
Steven watches as a appears and pushes the nurses aside
Where's the crash cart
He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard- the sound of a sternum  can be heard
With the staff distracted, Steven reaches into his mattress hole and pulls out scores of pills
He stuffs them into his mouth as fast as he can
(
) But the hardest part by far is getting transferred to a private care facility
It's standard procedure for late stage patients, but convincing them  was about to die would involve taking a few risks
He chases the pills down with a glass of water
203
, 1998 -                  203 Steven is helped from a corrections van into a wheelchair outside the Restful Acres facility
(
) After a four day coma, they were convinced
204
, 1998 -                  204 In his bed at the care facility, Steven looks around and picks up the phone
He talks with a
This is Doctor Rios from the Hamblin Center, Houston
'm looking for patients for a study we're
" Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08   110
And as he talks-- (
) (') And once  got settled in,  just called the Department of Corrections and convinced them  was a state-sponsored doctor looking for late stage patients for an experimental treatment
(then) As luck would have it, they had one patient that was eligible
Steven continues his Dr
Rios imitation on the phone
Oh you do
Steven Russell
Could you spell that
on a nearby
It reads: ", 5" : 205
, 1998 -                    205 The calendar reads ",  13"    An  enters with a
Mister Russell, the clinic sent a taxi here to pick you up
206    /
, 1998 -                    206 Later that day, Steven is helped out of his wheelchair into a waiting taxi
(
) And for all that time- all those doctors, all those nurses and all those facilities
not one of them ever thought to give me an  test
The door  and off he drives
(
) Fucking Texas
207
, 1998 -                                         207 Once clear, Steven speaks to the driver
" Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages      5-23-08   111
had a special request when  ordered the cab
Did they tell you
Yeah- right here
He lifts a    into view
Thank God
Steven grabs it and begins to gorge himself on
(
) (') week later, the hospice was to get a call from Doctor Rios, telling them Steven Russell had died undergoing treatment
And after all that hard work dying
Where's the first place  go
208
, 1998 -               208 Phillip stands frozen before Steven (
) Funny, huh
The guard pushes Phillip past the threshold
The door behind him
He staggers toward Steven as a kaleidoscope of emotions plays across his face
Bewilderment, relief, sorrow, joy and finally, anger- He slaps Steven across the face
You're such a fucker
know- 'm sorry- You weren't supposed to find out
Well  did
couldn't take a chance telling you
You know that
couldn't
But Phillip, only did it so  could get here to you
(then) Just to talk to you
And here  am
" Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages        5-23-08   112
Phillip tries to take this to heart
After a moment
You're so skinny
'm fine
Just hungry
Steven  don't- Wait
Listen
just came here to tell you one thing and that's it
You don't have to take me back,  just want to say one thing
Phillip is listening
(') know you thought we were nothing but a lie- but underneath all those lies there was always something that was real thought about what you said to me
You said you don't know who  am
But  have to tell you-  know now
know who am
mean- 'm not a lawyer, 'm not a , 'm not a cop
Hell 'm not even an escape artist
Those Steven Russells are dead
And now, all that's left is the man that loves you
That's all
Nothing else
'm just the man that loves you
(then) And if you can see that
believe it
then  promise 'll never be anything else ever again
,
Phillip looks to him
How do  know you're not bullshitting me again
Steven pauses
He looks Phillip square in the eye
You don't
And as Phillip stares at him- : " Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08   113

Then finally

Steven exits the line and ducks into a nearby bathroom

'  - 1998 -               210 At the urinal, Steven whistles to himself
: "Steven Russell was arrested two weeks later trying to secure Phillip's release

It's a very surprised Birkheim with a badge affixed to his jacket reading, ""

: "Steven sits in 23 hour-a-day lockdown, with only one hour a day for supervised showers and exercise
" Steven stares at his Key West  with a small photo of Phillip attached to it
The cell brightens, everything around Steven blooms with white light
He looks to see
