Written by Steph Lady & Frank Darabont From the novel by Mary
Shelley 2ND February 8, 1993 as we are lulled by the distant flute-like sounds of a recorder
Overall the effect is mournful and haunting, elegant and serene
and we  : -   - a storm of inconceivable force and violence
Merciless arctic winds whip the sea in a frenzy of thirty-foot swells
This is the last place in God's creation that any human being should be
And yet
the prow of a three-masted ship rises massively before us, looming from the darkness and chaos
it crashes upward through a swell and slams back down again, plunging nose- first into the trough
The sails on the forward mast are still deployed
It's insane; in this weather they should be stowed (as is already the case with masts 2 and 3)
Hurtling toward us
Rising and falling
Thundering through the swells
And as she sweeps past  within a seeming hairbreadth, we  with the ship and find ourselves
-  - aboard the "Alexander Nevsky," along for the ride whether we like it or not
There are men all around us, dark screaming glimpsed and half-glimpsed, heavy oilskin clothes flapping in the gale
are in a life-or-death tug of war ,
Riiiiippp
All eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears loose, the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing tatters
The jib-arm wrenches free and plummets toward us, trailing rope and fabric
The men dive aside as the jib smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb
Splintered shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel
Walton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face- down on the pitching deck
, the first mate, scrambles to Walton's aid
Walton shoves him off, pushes painfully to his knees throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury: blood is streaming from his hairline, freezing in his eyes, staining his teeth
He gazes up at the mainsail, still intact and straining against the wind
We hear a huge
The base of the mast is starting to give
Cut the damn rigging free before we lose the mast
Long-handled axes are grabbed from their mounts
Frantic men begin hacking at the ropes
Walton snatches an axe from a passing crewman and elbows his way to the front
He attacks a guy-rope with primal fury,  rising and falling with the motion of his axe
Suddenly, a chilling cry from high above: (
) '  ( #2) The  is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope knotted at the chest
He points ahead
and the others spin to look as reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury
The ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting the ocean like boulders in a quarry, The Nevsky is plying these waters like a man running pell-mell through a mine field
An iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us into darkness
-  - and we wipe from darkness as a flapping piece of canvas billows away to reveal 'Walton and the crew, gazing in breathless horror as an iceberg looms from the gale before them like a ghostly white mountain
Walton finds his voice: fights to turn the wheel
Men rush to his aid, throw their backs into it, straining to the limit
The wheel is grudging, fighting them every inch of the way
on Walton and the crew: It's going to ram us
It wouldn't dare
'  ( #2) The lookout fumbles under his coat, grabs the rosary around his neck, clutches the crucifix tightly in both hands
Face white with terror
Breath coming in ragged gasps
' Crashing through the swells
Rising and falling
Tilting the world and the audience on its ear
iceberg looming
For a brief moment we seem to be veering past
But then we swing back in a final, churning, vertiginous plunge
and smack the ice
- God just hit the ship with an anvil
Mast #1 snaps at the base with a thunderous  and begins to topple in a symphony of shattering wood and tangled rigging
The lookout on mast #2 is vaulted through the railing of the crow's nest, screaming through the air, arms and legs windmilling as he plummets head-first toward the deck below
And is jerked to an abrupt stop by the safety line around his chest, We hear another horrible
the sound of his back breaking
Men are sliding, tumbling, screaming
Mast #1 completes its fall, slamming massively to the deck, shattering a section of the gunwale to splinters
Utter panic
Total chaos
Sheer mortal terror
And as the sequence builds to a final brain-splitting crescendo of sound and fury, we : - Total, stunning silence
glittering wasteland of ice
Breathlessly cold
Even the sun seems frozen, barely hanging on the horizon
Pellets of snow scour the permafrost like broken glass, driven by a desolate arctic wind
It's as if Hell had erupted through the floor of the Earth in the form of ice
Nothing could survive here
Nothing
reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice, tilted at a permanent list
Silent
We see no signs of life
: "The Arctic, 1839
" provide ominous detail-shots of the Nevsky flap of frozen canvas creaks in the wind
The pilot's wheel is now a crystalline sculpture of ice
The forward mast lies across the deck like a broken limb, extending out over the ice on a tangle of rigging
The ship's prow is smashed open above the water line
familiar rosary lies broken on the deck
Beads scattered
| tiny Christ figure lies with arms thrown wide, painted eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice
, From the top of mast #2
breathtaking perspective of the entire ship below, guaranteed to induce vertigo
The corpse of the lookout is suspended below us at the end of the frozen rope, His posture mimics the Christ figure: His arms thrown wide, dead eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice
ghastly still-life, the corpse twisting ever-so- slightly on the wind, rope creaking
thrusts into frame swaying precariously in the rigging,  to reveal    as they reach out with long gaffing poles to snag the corpse
-  -     - Walton watches them reel the body in
as he turns, revealing the rest of the crew working desperately to free the ship
Axes and picks rise and fall in waves, slamming into the ice, throwing up frozen chips
The men are near collapse, exhaustion carved in their faces
The dogs are nearby, huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow
Walton rejoins the men, rams his axe fiercely into the ice
Put your backs into it
#1 What's the use
This godless ice stretches for miles
Would you have us chow our way back to England
No
But we'll chop our way to the North Pole if we have to
Inch by bloody inch
You can't mean to go on
Our journey is ended
The best we can hope for now is to get out of this alive
#2 Aye, if the ice ever lets us
The ice will break
And when it does, we proceed north
as planned
Cries of dismay from the men
Grigori thrusts his arm toward the sky, pointing at the corpse on the mast
At the cost of how many more lives
He's interrupted by a long, chilling
The lead husky rises to its feet, hackles up,  at some unseen thing in the distance
The other dogs start rising around him, joining in, staring off across the ice
There's something out there
The dogs are going berserk
The lead husky breaks free and launches himself across the ice
The men scramble to restrain the animals, but three more break away and take off after their leader
Walton snatches up his rifle
You five come with me
The rest stay with the ship
-   - The Nevsky in the distance
The dogs come howling across the ice toward us
The men trail substantially behind
to the icy boulders f
g
massive hand comes briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal surgical scars marring the wrist
wipes frame, fleeing into the rocks
The dogs come bounding past in pursuit, snarling and slavering
hear an   rise amidst those of the dogs
vicious free-for-all echoes from the rocks
Barking gives way to shrill squeals
An object is launched from the crags, catapulted through the air in a high arc
Some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground with tremendous impact before them
and they find themselves staring in horror At the sight of the lead dog
Silence now
Those who have fallen, rise
Walton cocks his rifle
The group proceeds, picks and axes held ready, slowly skirting the rocks
and the massacre is revealed
Blood-stained ice
Dead, mangled animals strewn about
One twitching survivor crawls toward them on broken limbs, whining piteously, dragging its entrails in a red smear
Look
They follow his gaze
Bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, ascending the rocks
Most are smeared and vague
but one is clearly a bare human footprint
Several men cross themselves
Walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the surviving dog
single bullet to the brain ends its misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice
The shot echoes for miles
Back to the ship
-  -  - Silhouetted against the aurora borealis
The horizon swirls mysteriously with color and light
Distant slivers of lightning kiss the earth
Men keep watch in furtive groups, huddled against the cold, breath punching the air with billows of vapor
massive  is heard
spins, jumpy
Only the ice to starboard, boy
Is it breaking up
Just dancing on the current
It'll freeze even tighter come next wind
past to another group: #4 It was a polar bear
That's what say
#5 Say all you want, but you weren't there
It left human tracks
#6 No man could tear those dogs apart
#5 No human
We've roused a demon from the ice
-
The men spin
on starboard has rung the signal bell
The men race over, crowding the gunwale
Something
In the mist
Walton appears from his cabin and crowds his way to the front, rifle aimed at the sky
The men wait
Holding their breath
Scanning the darkness
looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe of ice, silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis
The figure's pose is uncanny and weird: neither standing nor kneeling, but something in between, arm dangling at its side and lolling slowly with the motion of the current
It's the demon
Shoot while you've a chance
The Pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box spotlight and swings it around
The beam seeks out the specter and pins it in a dim circle of light
revealing a man collapsed on a dog sled, lashed to tiller upright stanchions with frozen leather straps, Dead dogs lie in icy heaps around him
-  - The men venture onto the shifting ice with lanterns raised
Grappling lines are unslung and thrown, the ice floe snagged
Gaffs reach out, drawing it closer
Men clasp arms, forming a human chain
Grigori is the first to reach the motionless figure on the dog sled
Dead
Grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the furred hood to search the neck for a pulse
and the figure scares the shit out of him
With a convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath, the hood rises up, revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost, beard frozen solid, eyes blazingly intelligent and aware
Walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with -  -   - has kicked up, pelting the huddled sentries with sleet
past, moving steadily toward the dimly-glowing window of Walton's cabin
- '  - where we find Walton and Grigori in tense discussion: Captain,  implore you
The men are frightened and angry
They want your assurance
They knew the risks when they signed on
've come too far to turn back now
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny
Walton pulls a pistol from his drawer and slams it flat on the table before him
(low, tight) Let them try
Grigori is taken aback
He hears a shifting of blankets and glances to the captain's bed
Walton follows his look
Frankenstein has awakened and is watching them
Grigori exits, uneasy under Frankenstein's gaze
Walton rises, retrieves a pot from the stove
You're awake
've prepared some broth
It'll help restore you
(hoarse, faltering) 'm
dying
Victor draws a hand from under the blanket and holds it before his face
Fingers skeletal and black
Frostbite
Gangrene
simple diagnosis
Are you a physician
(faint smile) How is it you come to be here
There's a startling question, coming from you
(beat) 'm captain of this ship
We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole
Ah
An explorer
Would-be
'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment
heard
can't say  blame them
We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of
creature
Creature
human like creature
(stunned) You know of it
Your men are right to be afraid
Then explain it, whatever it is
It could save the voyage
've spent years planning this
My entire fortune
You'd persist at the cost of your own life
The lives of your crew
Lives are ephemeral
The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind
those live on
Victor reaches out with his blackened claw of a hand, pulls him closer
Impassioned, intense: Do you share my madness
Madness
on Victor's face
We are kindred, you and
Men of ambition
Let me tell you all that have lost in such pursuits
pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man
(angry, frightened) Who are you
(beat) My name is Frankenstein
And  proceeds into the bottomless depths of Victor's staring eye, plunging us into: Tick-tock
Tick-tock
fades up before us
'  (
) Failure has no pride, Victor
You must try again
(
) Yes, Ma'am
-   -   - We hear a  begin playing as a   reveals a huge, magnificent room with vaulted ceilings thirty feet high
Floor-to-ceiling windows
Hanging tapestries
sits at the harpsichord, a very serious 7 year-old in his little gentleman's suit and stiff starched collar
, head of the housekeeping staff, conducts the lesson
Her daughter , age 4, sits with her doll in a huge wingback chair, making it dance to the music as she listens
but her eyes are on Victor
She adores him
An enormous door swings open
Victor stops playing
His enter, ushering a somber and beautiful , age 6, across the vast expanse of floor
Victor slides off the bench and faces them
Mrs
Moritz, would you and your daughter excuse us
Of course, Doctor
Madam
Come along, Justine
Bring your dolly
Mrs
Moritz takes Justine's hand
Justine gazes back at Victor and Elizabeth as her mother whisks her off
Victor
This is Elizabeth
She's coming to live with us
She has lost her parents to scarlet fever
She is an orphan
You must think of her as your own sister
You must look after her
And be kind to her
Victor stares at Elizabeth
She returns the gaze evenly, self-possessed and dignified even at this young age
(
) loved her from the moment that first saw her
-   - hammers from the sky, reducing a centuries-old oak tree to smoldering ruin
-   - while Victor gazes at the storm, face pressed against a window, astonished at the sight
Lightning throws seething shadows of the rain on his face
Victor
Elizabeth is frightened by the storm
Go comfort her
-   - We hear a
Victor comes racing up the grand staircase from below as  sends wild banister shadows skittering
He caroms down the hall toward: - '  - Victor enters
Elizabeth is a tiny figure huddled in an adult- size bed, gazing up with tear-streaked face at the huge skylights in the vaulted ceiling, dreading the next scary boom and flash
Victor approaches and whispers: Don't cry, Elizabeth
(frightened) Aren't you
-
rips overhead, rattling the panes of glass
Victor does find it scary
but exhilarating
We'll build a fort
So the lightning can't get us
He races about the room, grabbing every pillow he can find and hurling them to her
Big decorative pillows from the chaise, bed pillows from the armoire
they all come flying
She giggles as a big one knocks her flat
Victor scampers onto the bed with her
They pile the pillows around and above, concealing themselves in a bulging heap of cushions
- Victor pokes his hand up, widening a space so they can still see
Lightning glistens in their upturned eyes
Are you sure it can't hurt us
Nothing can
Not ever
She seeks his hand
Fingers clasp
Comfort and strength
to the skylight
Rain drumming the glass
-  -   - Victor and Elizabeth are learning to waltz, their movements stiff and awkward, childlike
is at the harpsichord
Justine sits with her dolly, watching
You must lead, Victor
The lady will always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong
Mrs
Moritz
aaand, one-two-three, one-two- three, twirl-two-three
Mama, can  dance with Victor
Nonsense, Justine
Hush
And now a sweeping arc about the room
one- two-three, twirl-two-three
Victor and Elizabeth gamely work their way across the vast room, tripping on each other's toes
They pass within inches of , bodies
-   -  (  ) and they sweep from before our eyes, waltzing away from camera to reveal Victor now 17, intense and handsome as he approaches manhood
Elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful beauty at 16
Mrs
Moritz is still conducting the lessons
one-two-three, twirl-two-three
Excellent
You'll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen
They're certainly the envy of Justine, who gazes at Victor as he sweeps Elizabeth around the room in his arms
She isn't concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard
Her mother throws her a look of reproval: Justine
Surely you can maintain better time than that
Yes, Mama
Flustered, she puts her attention back on the keyboard as Victor and Elizabeth keep dancing, swirling fluidly about the room, their attention only on each other
-   - skylight above us
storm is raging, rain drumming the glass
We hear  in the house
to Victor perched at the edge of a settee, seething with tension
Waiting
Elizabeth is with him
She squeezes his arm, trying to reassure him
She'll be all right
Another  rips down the hallway
Justine comes scurrying up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh load of sheets
Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably blocked by Mrs
Moritz
You can do nothing here
Wait downstairs
He can see his mother in the dim kerosene light, writhing and screaming on the bed, belly swollen and distended
His father, sleeves rolled up, works feverishly to save her
Mother
Victor, do as you're told
Justine glances at Victor, longing to comfort him
She squeezes past into the room
The door slams in his face
He turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror
- '  - as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth
-  - while her  mingle with the howling of the wind, the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain
-   - stares out the window at the raging storm
Elizabeth appears at his side
He doesn't look at her
As a boy,  stood at this window and watched God destroy our tree
b
g
screaming stops, Victor and Elizabeth turn, gazing up the grand staircase
The sudden silence is even more frightening
The   of a newborn infant drifts down door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light
Victor's father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward them
He pauses halfway down, unable to continue
Father
floods the room, revealing Victor's father on the staircase
Face haggard
Eyes hollow
Clothes spattered with blood
Hands glistening wetly red
Oh God
The blood
Father sits down shakily on a step
Victor and Elizabeth race up the stairs and pause before him
did everything  could
Victor lets out a sob of anguish
Elizabeth begins to cry
Father gathers them into his arms
-   -  - stands amidst leaning gravestones, gothic and ornate, a chill breeze billowing the lace
recites a Latin burial mass
are gathered before the Frankenstein family mausoleum
an imposing edifice of stone and spidery wrought-iron, its steepled roof crowned by a massive granite crucifix
sleek black casket lies atop the bier, ringed with flowers and sorrow
The trees are windswept and bare, branches stark against a steely gray sky
Victor and Elizabeth stand apart from the others, staring at the casket
Softly: How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her
It's not ours to decide
All that live must die
It's God's will
Victor raises a grim look at the huge crucifix atop the mausoleum
Christ returns his gaze with blank stone eyes What kind of God is He to will this
She was mother to me as well
But ours is the job of the living
It's up to us now to hold this family together
We must think of Father and be strong for him
(beat) cannot do that alone
God took her from us
He left a beautiful gift in her place
baby boy
To cherish and love as our very own
Your brother Victor glances at the baby carriage
He seeks her hand
Their fingers clasp
Comfort and strength
Our brother
The baby starts  as the casket is lowered, its thin voice carried on the wind
-  - gorgeous, sun-dappled day
Tall grass waving on the breeze
Butterflies skittering
, 11 months-old, toddles into view
He doesn't get far
Down he goes, right on his ass
His face scrunches up in surprise and he bursts into tears
Elizabeth hurries over and scoops him up, cradling and comforting him
Victor rises from a picnic blanket to join them
Nanny Justine looks up from her task of laying out the silverware and food
Poor William
What indignant tears
There, there
shhh
Victor takes the baby and swoops him high in the air
The child shrieks and wails, held aloft
Victor, have a care
You'll make him dizzy
The world is a dizzying place
She tries to reclaim the baby
Victor feints, keeping Willie out of reach
Elizabeth grows crosser: Oh, do give him here
He needs to be comforted and held
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies
Make yourself heard, Willie
Learning to walk is not an easy thing
Why should it be so
Elizabeth is exasperated to realize that the baby has begun to laugh
She glares at both of them
Men
That's the nature of all progress, William
Don't let your brother sway you otherwise
Quite right
Victor cradles Willie as if to shield his delicate ears
He peers at Elizabeth with mock-grave suspicion and speaks to the baby sotto-voce, in deepest confidence, man-to-man: Don't listen, Willie
Progress is a feast to be consumed
Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run
Or run before you can waltz
(laughing) Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel
Victor waltzes the baby in circles
Elizabeth stalks them
Devil take walking, ladies
My brother shall learn to waltz
He grabs her by the waist, pulls her into it
There's no use resisting
She succumbs and they dance with the baby between them
Justine is gasping with laughter
Elizabeth, really
He's quite mad
Scandalous
What would your dear mother say
(thinks a beat) One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three
Laughing, Victor and Elizabeth waltz little William around in a sweeping arc
They pass within inches of the , bodies wiping frame
-   -  (6  ) To reveal the grand ballroom ablaze with candlelight and spectacle as a   swirl about the floor in a breathtaking waltz to the music of a full string ensemble (: The music here should be our movie's distinctive / , which will reoccur later
) Victor and Elizabeth dance magnificently, room spinning about them in a blur
Now 24, he's in the prime of manhood
Elizabeth, 23, is a drop-dead beauty radiating poise and intelligence
They're so right for each other, so beautiful together, your heart could break just looking at them
Justine, now 21, has blossomed into a beauty herself
She's at the sidelines, wearing a lovely gown, wishing someone would ask her to dance
William, now 7, scampers to her side
She stoops to straighten his collar and smooth back his hair
Waltzing couples swirl past them
Auntie Justine, Papa said  could have a sweet
You can
But not before dinner
The music ends amidst applause
The men bow to the ladies, the ladies curtsy in return
Victor escorts Elizabeth off the dance floor
Elizabeth fans herself, flushed and happy
You dance so beautifully together
And you look so lovely
They share a sisterly hug and a radiant smile
The orchestra recommences
The music is lush
Justine looks hopefully to Victor, keeping her tone light: Victor
Spare me one dance
Elizabeth catches Victor's eye
Go on, ask her
Please
'm quite out of breath
Victor gallantly offers his arm
Justine takes it, lighting up as he escorts her onto the dance floor
and they begin to dance
She's glowing
This is a big moment for her
But they've hardly begun, when
ting-ting-ting, Victor's father is tapping a champagne glass with a knife
The dancers stop
The orchestra falls silent
Justine hides her disappointment as servants pass among the guests with glasses of champagne
My friends, fatherly pride won't allow this occasion to pass without my raising a toast
Shouts of assent
Victor is grabbed by his friends and dragged forward, a glass of champagne shoved in his hands
To Victor
My son
Who read every medical book in my library by age thirteen
and then re-read them, which seemed excessive even to me
(the guests  with laughter) Drape yourself in glory, my boy
Study well
When you return, you return a man of medicine
will then be honored to call you "colleague
" But never your equal
No
You'll surpass me
Applause and roars of approval
The drinks are tossed back
Victor is jostled with backslaps and handshakes
-  - Music and warm light spill from the windows
eases through a French door and come racing across the lawn, giggling and hushing each other
They take refuge under a tree, revealing their faces to the moonlight: Victor and Elizabeth
She leans against the trunk to catch her breath
Smell the air
Wonderful
Quite a send-off, isn't it
Father's so proud
And you
Prouder still
You'll be the handsomest student there
'll have to do better than that
You will
(searches his eyes) What do you want, Victor
To be the best there ever was
To push our knowledge beyond our dreams
to eradicate disease and pestilence
to purge mankind of ignorance and fear
He's so serious, she can't help laugh
'm not mad
She smiles, smoothes a lock of hair gently off his forehead
No
Just very earnest
And very dear
An extended moment
Unspoken words flowing between them
Victor leans forward and kisses her
Her eyes widen slightly
So do his
Shared excitement, gentle and sexy beyond belief
They pause, draw back, searching each other's eyes
He whispers: 've loved you all my life All my life 've known
They kiss again
breath
shiver
This feels
incestuous
Is that what makes it so delicious
She brushes her lips against his
Gentle as a sigh
Brother and sister still
wish to be your husband
wish to be your wife
Then come with me to Ingolstadt
Marry me now
If only  could
But one of us must stay
Father's not strong
Willie's just a child
Who can look after them in your absence
Who can run the estate
Only you
will be here when you return
Another kiss
Turning lustful and steamy
They melt into each other, sinking down, bodies pressing and minds afire
These people are hot for each other
They stop, stunned at the intensity
He lays his head to her breast
Their fingers clasp
She whispers her secret: My head is spinning
want to give myself to you
He raises his head
She meets his gaze evenly If we're to be married, must we wait
He touches her face
Fingertips tracing downward, gentle and reverent, brushing the contours of her bosom at the edge of her bodice
She shivers
Closes her eyes
Lays her hand over his
Guiding his touch
You make me weak
Not as weak as
She raises his hand to her mouth
Brushing his fingertips with her lips
Wrestling with desire
Their eyes meet
Our decision
Together
Your decision
For us
(hesitates) give you my soul
(nods) until our wedding night
When our bodies will join
Victor
love you, Elizabeth
My more than sister
They kiss again
Gently
-   -  - misty gray dawn
Victor is kneeling at a gravestone, observing a moment of silence
His saddled horse is tethered nearby
Softly: 'll make you so proud, Mother
He lays a small sprig of flowers on the grave, rises and walks toward his horse
-  - Overcast and chill
An open carriage stands loaded
The family and household staff have turned out
Victor stands ready to go
Father pulls him into a back-slapping embrace
Write to us often
Victor moves on to Justine, takes her hand
We never finished our dance
(she smiles) Someday we shall
Next is William
The little boy stands stiffly, tears on his face, trying to be brave
Victor kneels and whispers: The others will look to you while 'm gone, Willie
Be strong
The boy nods miserably, throws his arms around Victor's neck
Last comes Elizabeth
She and Victor regard each other, sharing the secret of last night
faint smile plays at the corners of her mouth
He kisses her cheek
Elizabeth
He mounts the carriage
snaps the reins and lurches away, speeding Victor off to his future
Victor turns back for a final look at the home and family he loves so much
William runs after him until he's gone from sight
: -   - High white clouds in a blazing blue sky
Church steeples rising among the rooftops
Beautiful
- trudges heavily up a long, steep, narrow flight of stairs with Victor teetering uneasily behind
No real rooms left
All we've got is attic space
No one ever wants the attic space
/ - She leads him into an immensely long space running a twisted path the entire length of the building; various levels and areas unhindered by wall separation, massive vaulted beams crisscrossing as understructure to the roof
Daylight filters dimly through dozens of dormer windows and skylights coated with grime
Nooks and crannies abound
This will do nicely
- monumental structure of brick
Dead leaves scurry across the lawn
- , a squat little man, paces before the packed galleries of eager young
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law
Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept
Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect
Someday you may be priests
but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse
(off their laughter) Any questions
(hand shoots up) But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more
philosophical works
Philosophical
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect
Paracelsus, for one
This reference is lost on all but a few
At the faculty table: peers up at Victor, adjusting the glasses on his nose
Up among the students:   leans out and shoots an amused look in Victor's direction
catches Henry's look and rolls his eyes
Paracelsus
Or Albertus Magnus
Cornelius Agrippa
What is your name
Victor Frankenstein, sir
(no response) Of geneva
Of Geneva
(beat) Tell me, Mr
Frankenstein of Geneva
Do you wish to study medicine
Or mysticism
Titters sweep the room
Krempe remains staunchly unamused: Those of you unfamiliar with Mr
Frankenstein's suggested reading list
thankfully, that would be most of you
would be well advised to avoid it
Here at Ingolstadt, we concern ourselves with immutable reality
(specific to Victor) not the ravings of lunatics and alchemists hundreds of years in their graves
Understood
Victor is flushed and humiliated
Held like to say more, but wisely swallows his anger and nods
am relieved
Are there any relevant questions
(there are none) Lecture hall dismissed
-  - Victor exits wearing a distinctive black greatcoat, fuming over the exchange with Krempe
He strides across the lawn, eyes fixed straight ahead
Henry Clerval races up behind him and falls casually in step
Victor glances over
Henry nods pleasantly, as if held been there all along
Victor responds with a curt nod and resumes his straight-ahead demeanor
They walk in silence, just two guys heading in the same direction
Henry can't help it; he snickers loudly to himself
Victor shoots him a sharp look
Henry's smirk vanishes, replaced with blank innocence
Did somebody snicker
was just clearing my throat
Very well then
They continue walking
Silence thick
Finally: You know, you're quite mad
Victor stops
Turns
(low, measured) am not mad
(matching Victor's tone) As a march hare
Henry's expression betrays nothing
but perhaps there's a trace of amusement in his eyes
Are you having me on
Of course  am
It pays to humor the insane
Beat
Victor smiles
Henry grins, offers his hand
Takes it
Henry Clerval
Victor, Victor Frankenstein
know
You have a way of making an impression
-  - The tavern is packed with students and noise
Beer and food served at a frantic pace
We find Victor and Henry at a small table, tearing into sausages and cheese
Do you really think 'm mad
Come now
Magnus
Agrippa
Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak
Schiller enters with
They pause at Victor's table If it isn't the sorcerer
Found yourself an apprentice
'm afraid  rejected his application
He merely dabbles
Dilettantes need not apply
What about you
Schiller, isn't it
Von Schiller
'm interested in real medicine
Treating the sick
Really
myself find sick people rather revolting
(off their looks) 'm here to secure my degree with a minimum of fuss and hard work that might settle into a life of privilege treating rich old ladies with gout and dallying with their daughters
You two disgust me
Schiller and his friends stalk off
-  - magnificently compresses buildings and steeples, distant hills and drizzly sky
Victor wears his greatcoat as he and Henry walk along a twisty cobblestone street
Rich old ladies and their daughters
Can you think of a better reason
Quite a few
Do me a favor then
(claps his shoulder) keep them to yourself
Victor takes a shocked beat and bursts into laughter
-   - Waldman, in sinock, addresses a    from across morgue slab
He throws a sheet back to reveal a corpse dissected to reveal the inner workings
The others crowd for a closer look
Victor glances to Henry, who leans back and rolls his eyes in utter disgust
- '  - on Victor sitting at a tall dormer window, writing a letter with quill and ink
It's raining outside
The garret is tidied
-   -   - are harvesting for miles around
to Elizabeth and Claude examining the sheaves on a wagon
She cracks the grain and tastes it, glances to Claude
He smiles and nods
It's turning out to be a good year
Let's return a tenth of the crop to the tenants
(off his look) They had a hard winter
Not even your father would be that generous
Then there's no need to tell him, is there
Claude grins and motions to his
They resume loading the sheaves as a  rides up: Miss
The mail arrived
There's one from Master Victor
-   - We find the family gathered around the fire as Elizabeth reads Victor's letter aloud: and not a day goes by that  do not cherish your faces in my mind's eye or ache to see you all again
Be assured that  am with you in spirit, and you are never far from my thoughts
remain, as always, your loving and devoted Victor
She pauses, reading ahead
The
reads: "Elizabeth
am holding our vow precious in my heart
" glances up at their expectant faces
What does it say
It says, give Willie an extra big hug for me
(beaming) Read it again
She smiles, rearranges the pages as we : -   - classroom door
from within: (
) That's no excuse for being a pompous ass
Victor storms out with Krempe at his heels
Krempe pauses in the doorway, red-faced, bellowing after him: 'll see you thrown out of this university
'll go to the dean himself
Take me at my word, Frankenstein
The dean himself
Classroom doors are opening, faces peering out
Waldman among them
Victor keeps going, doesn't look back
-  - Victor and Henry slouched at their regular table writes in his thick, well-worn leather journal
The entire school heard it
It wasn't something one could miss
You're a comfort to me, Henry
What now
Writing about it in your journal won't help
(quietly) It's a letter to my father
Henry falls silent
Victor closes the journal, winds it secure with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of his greatcoat
Brooding
The bell above the door gust of wind sweeps in
They glance up
Professor Waldman enters, dapper and soft-spoken, impeccably courteous
He murmurs a pleasantry to the  and drifts over to Victor's table
Professor Waldman
(takes a seat) Victor, explain yourself
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper
You have a way of provoking his
(beat) 've been watching you
You seem impatient with your studies
To say the least
came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn
All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new
You disdain accepted wisdom
No,  embrace it
as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known
(mutters to Waldman) Now you've got him started
These are exciting times, Henry
We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs
Look at Edward Jenner
He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated
've heard this speech before
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible
We're on the verge of answers undreamt of
but only if we have the courage to ask the questions
understand your frustration
was young once myself
(beat) Walk me home
Something 'd like to show you
- '  -  - The gaslights come up with a
The first thing Victor and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to big windows where the light would be best during the day
Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, all quite excellent
The rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter with arcane equipment
Taking off his coat and rolling up his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of tables crammed with experiments and clutter
You know for thousands of years the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief that the human body is a chemical engine run by electricity
They say we all contain streams of energy which flow through us like currents in the ocean, or rivers in the earth
They arrive at a table
Waldman roots through a tray of knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle
Their doctors treat patients by inserting needles like these into the flesh at various key points to manipulate these electric streams
He directs their attention to an ancient Chinese silk on the wall
It depicts the human body from front and side angles
Acupuncture points are clearly marked
Preposterous
once saw it done, as a boy in Canton
My parents were missionaries
The cure was nothing short of miraculous
(off their looks) 've never forgotten it
Been fascinated ever since
It smacks of magic
Waldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal an enormous dead toad in dissection
Copper mounting pins trail wires to a small panel of switches
The switches, in turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries
Waldman starts throwing switches
Victor and Henry jump as the toad convulses with motion
They watch, stunned, as Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe
Magic
Seems alive, doesn't it
Waldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm at the array of wires and batteries
Electricity
It's utterly fantastic
This is the sort of thing 'm talking about
We should be learning this
Why
God alone knows what it means
Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick
Hardly fit for the classroom
But the possibilities
Combining ancient knowledge with new
Something like this could change our fundamental views
It is a thrilling direction to explore
Thrilling and dangerous
(off his look) Nature can be wonderful and terrible
Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience
We must proceed cautiously
Assess as we go
(drapes the toad) What  do on my own time is my own business
The same holds true for you
You wish to expand your mind
Fine, do so
You can even join me here, if you like
But not at the expense of your normal studies
doubt that decision is still mine to make
(waves) Nonsense
Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe
Victor starts to object, but Waldman overrides him with a stern gesture for silence
Listen
"
a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty
Why
(draws close) Our profession needs talent like yours
Destroy your career over an issue of pride
What a waste
Waldman hands him the acupuncture needle
gift
Victor studies it, fascinated
Go home, Victor
Write the letter, -   - 360: He stands before the students and faculty, reading his apology
and  further wish to extend my sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe for my display
My behavior toward him was both rash and inexcusable
Up in the gallery, Krempe nods grudgingly to himself
-   - Exquisite silverware goes   onto polished wood as: (
) (laughing) knew held get himself in trouble
to reveal the expansive dinner table being set for guests
are to-ing and fro-ing
Elizabeth splits her attention between supervising and reading Victor's letter, while Justine busies herself with a flower arrangement
Willie gets underfoot
Father just sits
Must've been a terrible row
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous
(glances to Willie) Fellow
" He always was opinionated
(reads on, laughs) He set things right with a proper apology
and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab
What's that
That's where they cut things open and peer about inside
Things
What sort of things
Father is about to press on with the gory details, but Elizabeth freezes him with a glance
It's far too ghoulish for your young ears
The old man throws Willie a look
We'll talk later
The point is, your brother is a brilliant student well on his way to becoming the finest-and most compassionate doctor ever
- '  - convulses through its electronically-induced paces
Kicking
Twitching
Tasting the air with its dead tongue
to reveal Victor at the switch
Waldman leans close to observe
Softly: Re-configure the leads
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system
Waldman nods
Worth a try
-   - With Waldman at his side and Henry providing the tools as needed, Victor instructs a freshman class in the internal workings of a dissected corpse
Professor Krempe observes from a distance
and the medulla oblongata is the transition between the spinal cord and the two parts 've already named
cerebrum and cerebellum
Any freshmen feeling queasy yet
(glances around, smiles) All of you, from the look of it
We'll resume your torture tomorrow
He waves them dismissed
They laugh and exit, relieved
Waldman squeezes Victor's elbow
Well done
Victor stiffens at Krempe's approach
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum
Despite the lack of challenge
Krempe reddens, but says nothing
He gives Waldman a curt nod and walks off
Victor
He was trying to be gracious
The strain was evident
Come now, you must take some satisfaction
You've risen to the top of your class
position of prominence and regard
Victor weighs this, glances at both of them, smiles
What keeps me going are my friends
He throws his arm around Henry's neck, pulls him into an affectionate headlock
Henry struggles and laughs: Leave off
'  - Victor is gazing with reverence at a gorgeous oval locket dangled before him by a smiling
He glances to Henry for an opinion
Your Elizabeth must be quite a treasure, Victor (pointedly to jeweler) to justify these prices
The jeweler's smile goes frosty
'  - the locket lying open against canvas, dangling from an easel frame
to reveal a magnificent miniature oil portrait of Victor in progress, no more than three inches high within its penciled oval
Waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally large behind the magnifying lenses
Victor sits patiently for the portrait, suffused with daylight
Henry leans in over Waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait
Waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence
He clearly hates people looking over his shoulder
(deadpan) Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth
Waldman heaves a long-suffering sigh
He abruptly jabs his brush at Henry's nose, daubing it with paint
Dignity upheld he resumes his careful work as Victor laughs
- '  -   - Victor, Waldman, and Henry are gathered around the remains of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's company
Cigars are lit, wine is flowing
Conversation is fast and loose, intense and passionate: 'm quite serious
Look at all the charity and clinic work we do
Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated
'm convinced
Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets
(turning serious) Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes
No
But someday
Thank goodness
We'd be out of work
Victor flings his napkin in Henry's face
Only you would think of that
(laughing) Somebody has to
Victor raises his wine glass
The others join
toast
tell you what we need, my friends
Forget the symptoms and diseases
What we need is a vaccine for death itself
(laughter) Oh, now you have gone too far
There's only one God, Victor
(raises his glass) And here's to Him
Everything in moderation, Frankenstein
(grins) Nothing in moderation, Clerval
-   - ,  the gritty reality of a big-city poor house, crammed with society's dregs: the poor, the uneducated, wailing babies, stampeding children
Absolutely jangling with noise and confusion
loud and stifling
people getting eye-ear-nose-throat exams
being vaccinated
The "doctors" in attendance are all Ingolstadt performing community service, none of whom look like they're enjoying it
Schiller looks particularly harried
We find Victor and Henry giving out vaccinations
They keep glancing over their shoulders at Waldman as he gets further embroiled in a no-win argument with a wiry, ferret-faced  terrified about getting his vaccination: Yer not stickin' it in me
Got pox in it,  hear tell
Pox
They givin' us pox
Ripples of panic spread
Waldman is as tense and clipped as we've ever seen him, valiantly trying to control his temper amidst the surrounding cacophony and ad-lib dialogue: No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine
Vaca-what
vaccine, from the Latin vacca, meaning cow (glances at her girth) or vaccinia, meaning cowpox
told you there was pox in it
no, no, cowpox in a minute quantity, perfectly harmless, gives you a natural immunity to small ox, which is the point of this whole bloody exercise
Victor and Henry are pausing work
Concerned
Drifting closer
The ferret-faced man is cornered
You doctors kill people
don' care what you say, you ain't stickin' it in me
most assuredly am
It prevents disease and it's the law
Why am explaining myself
Somebody restrain this damn fool
It happens this fast: There's an innocuous blur of motion as the man seems to tap Waldman lightly in the stomach, then he darts away, slamming past Victor and Henry
Victor looks after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor
He glances down
thin knife
Victor looks to Waldman
Puzzled
It still hasn't really dawned
Waldman turns to them, face drained of color, hand pressed to his sternum, lips tight
He looks more annoyed than anything else
He exhales slowly
Professor
(softly) Oh God
That's when the blood starts pumping through his fingers
They catch him as he collapses, cradling him as he sprawls to the floor
People are pushing and crowding to see
-   - cobblestoned street-scene
Carriage
delivery wagon
Vendors
Pedestrians
The doors of the poor house burst open, releasing a frenzy into the street: Victor and Henry carrying Waldman by his arms and legs, all the students running alongside, some of them weeping with panic, the crowd at their heels still trying to catch a glimpse, pedestrians scattering, the students dwindling up the long winding street, bearing their professor toward the school, shouting for help
-   - Krempe delivers the eulogy before the open casket
The chapel is full
Victor is seated near the back
Dazed
Henry comes up the aisle and slides in next to him
Victor doesn't even glance over
Henry whispers: They just caught the man who did it
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance
They'll hang him all the same
Good
'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap
People glance back
Henry lays his hand on Victor's elbow
Keep your voice down
You don't know what you're saying
It was wrong, Henry
It shouldn't have happened
The bastard deserves to die
Victor is causing ripples of attention throughout the chapel
Even Krempe falters briefly in his eulogy
Henry pulls Victor from the pew, drags him up the aisle
-   - and into the confessional where they launch at each other in harsh whispers
Dialogue here is overlapping and intense: You're making a scene
Why Waldman
He of all people should have cheated death
You can't
Death is God's will
resent God's monopoly
That's blasphemy
Blasphemy be damned
Waldman spent his life trying to help people
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor
(beat, low) No
He had more important work
There are sick people who need our help
Here and now
Not in some future time
Consider that
Henry exits
Victor tries to compose himself, clasping his hands together as if in prayer
or quiet rage
He gazes up
There on the wall hangs a crucifix
Life and death
(beat) Why should You alone have the final say
'     on the Christ figure before him, bleeding from a crown of thorns, arms thrown wide
: '    rises from the image of Christ, striking an eerily similar pose, arms thrown wide within the perfect circle
We hear a    as
- '  - a   reveals the deserted workshop
The door swings open as Victor lets himself in
He sees the finished locket lying open on a table, picks it up, studies the beautiful miniature portrait it contains
Snaps it shut
He looks up, eyes falling upon the Da Vinci print hanging on the wall
He stares
Intense
- '  - : Things are in the process of being sorted and boxed
We find Victor poring over Waldman's notes: To understand the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death
and examine the process in minutest detail
-   - gray day
Waldman's ferret-faced  stands weeping helplessly on the scaffold as sentence is read: his body to be left on public display for a twenty-four hour period, thereafter to be consigned to an unmarked pauper's grave
So the court has spoken
The  draws the hood over the murderer's head, cinches the noose tight
The condemned man is blubbering, pleading for his life
Victor stands in the crowd
Watching
Waiting
We hear the of the body dropping, the  of a snapping neck
-   - Dark as Hades
Pissing down rain
and a The dead man still hangs from the scaffold, lashed by the wind
Victor looms from the storm, hands jammed in the pocket of his greatcoat
He pulls out a thin, glittering blade
The very weapon which took Waldman's life
He gazes up at the dead man
at the rope from which he dangles
- '  - The dead murderer lies pale and naked on a slab
Victor leans close, still dripping, studying the face closely throws wild, skittering shadows through the dormer windows and skylights
Softly: No longer pathetic and useless - '  - The dead man, dissected and wired, jerks bolt upright, flopping and convulsing, eyes opening and closing, mouth gaping open and shut
He falls back limply as Victor shuts the power off, making careful notations in his journal
- '  - the dissection table
up the length of the murderer's body
now in an advanced stage of decay
we hear the   of flies
We find Victor standing over the corpse
Gaunt and hollow- eyed
Exhausted and obsessed
Wearing a butcher's apron
Staring down at one of the dead man's forearms
Maggots are swarming in the flesh
He abruptly raises a cleaver and it off at the elbow
- '  - past the forearm lying in a steel pan, we find Victor performing an intense chemical analysis
Dead tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a slow-burning flame
Victor smears a glass slide, places it under a microscope
-  - Victor is hunched over his notebook, pale and unhealthy, scribbling notations next to a rendering of the human form
Henry is across from him: Victor
This has got to stop
(Victor glances up) Nobody's seen you in months
You haven't attended a single class
've been preoccupied
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death
Even Krempe is sympathetic
But it is time to move on
It is time to concern yourself with life
That is my concern
(faint smile) 'm involved in something just now
want to finish it in Waldman's memory
How much longer
Few months perhaps
'm gathering the raw materials even now
-  - The wrought-iron doors of a crypt have been forced open
through to find Victor standing inside over a stone sarcophagus with a pry bar in his hands
He's nervous, working up his courage: Materials
That's all they are Tissue to be re-used
He pries off the stone lid
It  heavily to the floor, cracking in half
He opens the casket, reaches in, raises the pale arm of the deceased to inspect it
-  - Stone monuments
Bare trees
Ivy-covered ground
Victor shoulder-deep in a grave
Shoveling
lamp burns low
- Pitch black
The lid swings open, cascading dust and soil
Victor peers down, holding the kerosene lamp high
'  - the shelves, crammed now with formaldehyde jars of feet and hands, brains and kidneys, the occasional head staring through the glass, dead cats
and we find Victor working into the wee hours
Hunched over his specimens
Candle flame flickering low
Referring back to Waldman's notes
Making notations in arcane books such as "De Occulta Philosophia," by Agrippa, and "Le Sciences et les arts 'alchimiste," by Paracelsus
- magnificent backdrop of mountains against a cloudless blue sky
to Elizabeth and Justine with the mansion distant
steady breeze ripples the fields as Elizabeth regards a stack of mail
Nothing
Still nothing
It's been months
It's not like him
Something's wrong
know it
(off her look) 've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg
So have should go
should leave today
Elizabeth
If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned
You'd never get near Ingolstadt
(beat) Besides, they're only rumors
(beat, nods) And not a word of them to Father
He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it
We'll say it came today
It'll set his mind at ease
Elizabeth gives her a hug
They walk toward the mansion -   - Murky and dark
Bellows are pumping
Showers of sparks cascade
The  and his  are pounding a metallic sledgehammer litany, beating a huge copper sheet into shape
Victor enters
The blacksmith directs his attention to a finished copper piece leaning against the wall
Victor runs his hand over the surface
Nice
-   -   - lies on a table, screaming as she goes into labor
Her water breaks, cascading into a steel bucket
One of the snatches it up, scurries around the corner
Victor is waiting in the shadows
Money changes hands
- '  - Victor is examining the amniotic fluid
Boiling it off
Working to synthesize it
- '  - Victor pours the final drum of fluid into what appears to be a large copper vat
He dips his hand in, examines the consistency and smell
, spinning slowly up to reveal that the vat is human in shape
sarcophagus
-  - We find Victor examining three corpses on the back of a wagon, checking nostrils and teeth with gloved hands lurk in the shadows, waiting
That one
The corpse is lifted off
Money changes hands
With this cholera come to town, we'll have plenty more for you
- '  - Victor wearing elbow-length gloves, hacking furiously away with a bone saw
Tossing aside the scraps
'  - Victor has an arm wired, testing reactions
He scrapes off a small shred of tissue, drops it in solution, watches it break apart
It doesn't look good
He glances feverishly at the clock, makes a fast decision, scribbles in his journal: Not optimal
Must use
No time to replace
Body can't wait
'  - Victor stitches a torso with one of those big, awful curved needles, yanking up hard to draw the catgut tight
(
) stitched it together with my own hands
'  - Victor pulls on a chain, hoisting the body off the slab via block-and-tackle mounted on a ceiling track
The body rises limply into the air, spinning slowly, arms and legs dangling, long black hair covering its face
(
) patchwork man of my own devising
Victor reaches up with one hand to stop the body spinning
He pushes it down the length of the lab, rolling it along its ceiling track like a side of beef in a meat locker
- '  - The Creature lies on an improvised bier of crates, surrounded by shadows and clutter, draped/sprawled like Christ taken from the cross in Michelangelo's "Pieta
" Beakers bubbling and dripping
Intravenous lines seeping and secreting
misty chemical haze in the air
Victor is watching his patchwork man
Glowering
Waiting
(
) It took nutrients like a child receiving milk
blushed like a young girl with the blood  forced through its veins
rips through the skylights, bathing the scene purple/white
Eerier and eerier
(
) all in preparation
'  - We find Victor passed out in a chair
His creation is still taking fluids
Gray daylight streams through the windows
There's commotion in the street outside: shouting, horses' hooves clattering on cobblestone, an occasional scream or wail
Victor doesn't stir
Dead to the world
Somebody starts on the door
Victor rouses, takes a moment to remember where he is
He lurches from his chair, grabs a canvas tarp, throws it over his "patchwork man
" - Henry is pounding
Finally the latch is drawn
The door swings open a crack
Victor peers out
Gaunt and furtive
Suspicious
Henry is stunned at his dissipated appearance
God's sake, what is that stench
Henry peers past him
Victor shifts, blocking his view This is a bad time, Henry
'm busy just now
What do you want
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak
Thousand new cases a day now
Classes have been suspended
University's shut down
Yes
And
Listen to what 'm saying
The militia's arriving to quarantine the city
Most of us are getting out while we still can
You'll be leaving then
(beat) Just as well
You never were cut out for this, Henry
Goodbye
And the door slams shut
The bolt is thrown
Henry pounds
Nothing
Stunned and hurt, Henry turns from the door and heads back down the stairs
- '  -  - Henry exits into a nightmare
are streaming from the city, horses and wagons, people on foot, carrying their possessions
Henry steps into the street and is nearly run down by a carriage
(
) Henry glances up to see Schiller at the reins, struggling to control the animals as the carriage eases past
Schiller
You're leaving
Where's all that high talk about treating the sick
(icy) To hell with them
And you
He snaps the reins, not caring who he runs down
The carriage lurches away, scattering refugees before it
Henry keeps walking
Jostled by the hostile crowd
Looking around
Dazed
Dead bodies are stacked along the street like cordwood, waiting for the death carts
as Henry stumbles along through utter despair and devastation, stunned at the human suffering around him as we : - '  - Victor glances at the clock
Scribbles in his journal: Time running out
Rate of decay accelerating
Must strike now
or start again from scratch
He gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab before him
but now the Creature lies on a full body-length steel grate
Steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling above
along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped with glittering needles big enough to knit with
Victor glances up at the Da Vinci
The Study of Man has been daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points
Victor dips a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing identical marks on the body before him
Now he's ramming the huge wire-fed needles deep into these spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good contact
The forearms, the neck, the rib cage
Now he's attaching the steel chain-hooks to the four corners of the steel grate
Now he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig into the air
It lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, wires and all
and we get our first spectacular look at Frankenstein's gloriously low-tech and stupendously arcane lab
The Creature dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and neck, armpits and groin
The copper cables trail upward, coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators
Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all unlike the Da Vinci
And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding in motion,      as he rolls it along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, through the windows to mark his way with wild and sinister shadows
and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper sarcophagus
Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within
He positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape
Faster now, moving furiously
Reaching into the murk, unhooking the chains
Arraying the copper wire through air- tight guide holes
Spinning on his heels and reaching up, grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with reflections and secrets
on Victor as he swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place with a -
Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the sarcophagus air-tight
Faster now
Faster
The frenzy builds and the   , rocketing, zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear: Frankenstein
Turning up the heat on the burners
Cooking the copper from below
Double double, toil and trouble
Frankenstein
Gazing through the thick glass portholes checking on his creation drifting in the murk
Frankenstein
Whipping up the galvanic batteries, supercharging them with steam generators
Watching as they send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables along the ceiling beams
Building up a charge
Frankenstein
Gazing at his gleaming handiwork painting his features into a twisted mask
Hand on the switch
Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle
Over it goes
Overdrive
The body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first jolt of electricity hits
--
Blazing with energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking
Frankenstein races to the sarcophagus
long glass tube, two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam wrenched out like a Polaroid plate
He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going knuckle-white on the wooden handle
One hard yank
dump- tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube
And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm
(  ) rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the creation in the murky womb-fluid, lashing at the hapless gray flesh, zapping it again with high-intensity voltage
The Creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges
Frankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child
(muffled through the glass) Live, you bastard
huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing and spasming against the glass
jerks his head back, stunned
The fingers are scratching
He turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting the whole thing down
It cycles off, whining into silence and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off
stares at the sarcophagus
Realizing his creation has stopped moving
Nothing now
He sags to his knees, utterly devastated at the loss of his dream
Nothing
It was all for nothing
And The Creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware
Its mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid
is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his hands
He glances over his fingers
Thinking he imagined it
No
There's another tap
And another
We see it in his eyes
Sheer joy and stunned exultation
Triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime
bare whisper: It's alive
It's alive
And then hell breaks loose: Massive convulsions wrack the sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle
- -
Pounding from within
Head ramming against the inner lid
He races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the wing-nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning man within
He unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope to hoist the lid away
and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled from below with rocket-booster force
The massive copper shell goes hurtling/spinning/cartwheeling across the lab, demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry and splintering coat rack
Victor's greatcoat goes flying
Silence
Frankenstein is frozen
Staring at the roiling surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles
An eternity passes in the space of a heartbeat
The Creature erupts from the vat like a vision from Hell, thrashing and gagging
Murky fluid cascading in all directions
The Creature seizes Victor by the shirtfront, trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging Victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with electricity
Victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying to break the Creature's grip
and the whole thing tips over
Victor reels back, falling as the vat  to the ground, cascading its murky contents, washing the Creature limply across the floor like a body tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping electrical discharges into the air
Victor scrambles back, slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking his legs away
He finds his traction and scrambles to his feet
The Creature is grasping and crawling toward him
Flopping and jerking
Gripped by seizures and convulsions
Vomiting murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the fluid
Swiping the air with palsied hands
Malfunctional
stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring down at the Creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife to this ghastly birth
Softly: What have  done
The Creature lunges to its knees, grasping him, clutching his clothes, pawing him
Victor can't break free
Panicking
He snatches a hammer from a nearby table and brings it down on the Creature's head
Again and again
Beating the thing down, pounding it into submission
The Creature finally collapses, sliding down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and jerking in its own afterbirth
Silence now
ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a dying heap
silently bathes the room, jerking wild shadows across the walls
Victor steps over the Creature
Dazed
He drops the hammer
It clatters to the floor
He stops to jot a final entry: Massive birth defects
Result is malfunctional and vile
(beat) Have chosen to abort
He walks stiffly away, disappears into the bedroom
-  - where he staggers to the canopied bed, beyond exhausted, and collapses face-down into oblivion
Weeping
: - '  - The wee hours
Rain pattering desolately on the roof
Victor sleeping
Wrestling with troubled dreams
Through a crack in the bed curtains, we see the bedroom door slowly creak open, throwing a twisted spill of light
shadow appears
Entering
Shambling and gliding across the floor
Silent and furtive
Creeping toward the bed
on Victor
Moving into close-up
Sleeping
Unaware
The shadow falls across his face
Beat
His eyes fly open
An intake of breath
Paralyzed
Sensing the presence
Feeling the shadow
Working himself up to something
Perhaps a scream
He can stand it no longer, thrusts out his arm, jerks the curtain aside
and the Creature is there, Looming like a specter of death
Naked
Beseeching
Dull yellow eyes trying to understand
Victor lurches from bed, sends a nightstand and vase to the floor
The Creature circles, seeking him, threatening to cut off his path to the door
Stay away
He darts past the thing, careening out into the lab
The Creature whips around, unsteady for a moment, then follows him with surprising speed
-  - Victor races through the lab with the Creature hobbling behind, trying to catch up
Victor hurling lab equipment, tipping shelves in its path, anything to slow it down
Victor rips the door open, lunges through, slams it in the Creature's face
The Creature presses against the wood with pathetic little moans, begging not to be left alone
He sinks to the floor
Abandoned
Shivering with cold
Sees Victor's greatcoat where it fell
Grabs it
Drags it over
Shrouding himself
-  - Victor races into the downpour, soaked to the skin in seconds, mind racing
He needs a plan
He presses on
-  - Victor appears at the window
to reveal an array of gleaming swords lying in their velvet display
Victor hurls a brick through the glass
Snatches up a sword
- '  - Victor careens in from the storm, drenched, racing up the stairs, sword glittering in his grasp
He gets to the top of the stairs
- '  - only to discover the door torn off it's hinges
He enters, stunned
The thing is gone
-  - Victor races back into the storm
Searching
Slogging grimly on
Lashed by the wind and rain
Mocked by the lightning
He'll never give up
Not until he finds the thing and takes back the life he gave it
He dwindles from view, vanishing into the gale as we : -  - Gray and drizzly
Heaps of wet garbage
Crawling rats
There's a shifting, heaving motion
The vermin scatter as the waking Creature peers at the world from beneath the greatcoat like a frightened child peering from under a blanket
Lost and confused
He scrabbles through the garbage for something to eat
He finds a rotted scrap, chews it anxiously
Ravenous
appear, grizzled denizens of the city's gutters and back-alleys, peering with insolent eyes
Watching him eat
Assessing his potential as a threat
The Creature stares ingenuously back
Not knowing to be afraid
The lead dog curls his lips back with a guttural
The Creature draws back sharply with a fearful
That's all it takes
The dogs are on him, snarling and snapping, the food torn from his hands
The dogs dart away, growling and fighting over the scrap
The Creature is left whimpering and shaken
He pushes to his feet and hurries in the opposite direction, legs bare and pale beneath the swirling greatcoat, clutching his collar against the cold
He hears a distant
(
) Bring out your deeeaaad
Bring out your deeeaaad
death cart clatters slowly past the mouth of the alley, ringing his bell
It makes no sense to the Creature, but it's a sign of human life
He presses on
-   - and emerges into the square as
There's a fair amount of activity
People are still leaving the city, though the earlier flood has thinned
Some citizens are still trying to go about their normal lives
are calling out, selling food
The Creature moves through the square, unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow
People trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little attention
The Creature pauses, sniffing the air
An aroma draws him to a vendor's stand
Loaves of bread are laid out
He hunches down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk
Chewing
It's good
bigger bite
Snatching up more
(
) Here
What do you think you're doing
The Creature glances up
The '  is within arm's reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him
Mouth gaping
Too stunned to scream
The Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's going to take them away
He remembers his recent experience with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: he curls his lips back and snarls
He's rewarded with a
The Creature jumps back, startled
This wasn't the desired effect
The woman like she'll never stop
He turns to run away
and plows right into the stream of refugees
He goes sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his loaves
Confusion all around
People converge angrily grabs his hair, jerking him upright
Stupid bastard
and the Creature staggers to his feet before them, whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all
Screams and panic
The Creature whips around, seeing horrified faces on all sides
He's the cholera
He's the one been spreadin' the plague
faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred
Somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering
They surround him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones
He tries to crawl, whimpering for them to stop
' The Creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice
He gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him
He's wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear
Men start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him torch is lit, swung toward him
Feel the heat
The Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, bowling people over, scattering them in all directions
He breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat billowing
The mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, hurling rocks and sticks
- / - The Creature is weeping as he runs, bleeding from his many cuts and bruises
He turns a corner, collapses against a wall to catch his breath
He can hear them coming, shouting
They'll be here any second
He sees a death cart heaped with bodies
He hurls himself up on the cart to conceal himself among the putrefying corpses
The crowd streams past the mouth of the alley
The death cart  appear, heaving another corpse onto the cart, gaping fearfully at the confusion
They scramble into their seats, snap the reins
The cart rattles off as we : -  - Elsewhere in Ingolstadt
Death carts and devastation
This part of town was hit hard
Bodies are heaped in gutters, stacked along the walls
People are huddled in doorways, quaking with sickness and pestilence
move among them, faces shrouded with kerchiefs and burlap masks
#1 moves down a row of the sick and dead, shaking them to see which is which, his face hidden behind heavy burlap
He pauses, seeing Victor unconscious against the wall, pale and covered with filth, shaking with fever
The worker's eyes widen
Stunned
He calls over his shoulder: #1 Over here
#2 hurries over
Stares down
Eyes also widening
#2 Oh my God
Worker #1 rips his mask away
It's Henry
He leans down and grabs Victor, trying to rouse him
Victor
Worker #2 also sweeps his mask aside
Professor Krempe
Don't dawdle, lad
The sick cart
Lift on three
One, two, three
They hoist Victor off the ground by his arms and legs and carry him into the street
Victor rouses, feels himself being carried
He sees a death cart looming ahead, stacked with heaps of reeking dead
Staring
Waiting
(delirious, struggling) No
no
'm not dead
please
Don't put me on the cart
'm not dead
'm not dead
'
as they carry him kicking and screaming past the death cart and on across the square
: -   - death cart rattles past, bearing its load
to reveal a scene utterly Dante-esque
Here's where the dead are brought to be burned en masse
Fires are burning
Smoke is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky
Soot is drifting like black snow
are dumped into a slit- trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps
Barrels are kicked over
Streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking
One of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside
The Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of oil
He knows what that means
He pushes free, clambering over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, loose soil crumbling under his fingertips
as  prepare to light the blaze
turns toward the trench with a burning torch
And then the Creature erupts from the trench of dead bodies right before big eyes, The man
The Creature  even louder, cowering back
The man hurls the torch
The Creature ducks as it goes spinning over his head into the trench
-
massive wall of flame punches sky-ward
The Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up in horror
He flees, scattering the workers as he goes, running from this ghastly place of flames and death
: -  - The Creature comes blundering into view
On the move
He knows not where
Just away, He arrives at a pond
Water
He's thirsty
He scrambles to water's edge, starts lapping it up with his hands
He pauses, noticing his broken reflection
The water settles and his face comes clearly into view
He throws his hands up and , terrified at his own reflection
and then he realizes it's him down there
He stirs the water with his fingertips to make sure
He reaches up, touching his face, utterly horrified at the sight of it
and utterly heartbroken
He drops his face into his hand and weeps helplessly
in the distance
He looks up, thinking they're after him
moan of grief
He pushes to his feet
faster and faster through the trees, running from this world he's been born into
Gasping for breath
Crashing through branches
The  draws closer
He hurls himself into a thicket, scrambling to hide himself, covering himself with dead leaves
Panic
Exhaustion
Mortal terror
He flinches as something comes  through the brush nearby
The legs of a come into view
Staggering
Falling
Thrashing down into a cushion of dead leaves
Two arrows protrude from her heaving side
tiny  stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, frothing with exhaustion and terror
Waiting for his mother to rise
Her thrashing grows weaker
Dying
The Creature moans at the sight
The fawn turns, meets his gaze
An extended beat
rush of empathy
The Creature reaches out
The fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him
The  draws closer
shouting
The Creature's fingertips make contact with the fawn
pack of the biggest, nastiest Staffordshire terriers you've ever seen throw themselves    onto the doe, savaging her like whirling dervishes, The Creature lets out a , snatches up the fawn as he lunges to his feet, crashes off through the foliage with the fawn cradled to his chest
The dogs take off after him
Running full-tilt,  in terror all the way
Trying to save the fawn
Trying to save himself
The dogs are snapping at his heels, trying to sever his hamstrings and bring him down
He hears   ahead, crashes headlong through a thicket
-  - and sails  into empty , twisting and spinning as he falls, plummeting head-first into the rapids
The dogs are left behind
The Creature gets swept along, gasping and choking, caroming off huge boulders, fawn still clutched protectively to his chest
Finally the water starts to settle
He manages to lash out and secure a handhold
He pulls himself up, clambering over the rocks and staggering onto firm soil
He collapses to his knees, dripping water and heaving for breath
He lowers the fawn away from his chest, joyous at their escape
only to realize the small animal is limp and lifeless in his hands
He crushed it to death trying to save it
He lays it down, moaning, trying to understand
into the trees as we : - to reveal a solitary figure in a greatcoat trudging across the sodden countryside under a dismal, darkening sky
Cold
Hungry
Wet
Tired
The Creature pauses, hearing   drifting on the breeze: the lovely flute-like sounds of a recorder
He slogs to the crest of a ridge
There's a small house in the valley below
peasant dwelling
Smoke drifts from the chimney
That's where the music comes from (a simple and plaintive rendition of our movie's / )
The Creature proceeds down the ridge
drawn by the music and the promise of warmth
- The Creature approaches cautiously
Furtive
He eases to a window, catches a glimpse inside, draws back
Listening
The tune ends
We hear the pleasant murmur of come clumping across the floor
The Creature reels back and dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and swings open
exits, a poor man trying to scratch an honest living from the soil
He heads in the same direction as the Creature
and walks around the corner of the house just as the Creature scrambles from view behind the chicken coops
The Creature watches through the wire and wood as Felix approaches and stops, only his legs visible
Feed is scattered through the wire
The chickens begins to eat
The Creature backs up - and finds himself in the company of
The animals and  in alarm
(
) Yes, yes, 'm coming
The Creature scurries further back into the shadows as Felix's feet stop just outside
pail is upended
Slop pours into the trough
Felix walks away
The pigs scurry to eat
The Creature leans forward intently
Food
He crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs
They jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share
He laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his chin
Not much on taste, but it's edible
He stops, hearing the recorder  again, turning toward the sound
He follows it, crawling back into the darkest recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house
He places his eye to a chink between the logs
and sees  playing the instrument near a fireplace of glowing embers
The Creature shifts for another view, sees the family preparing the table for dinner
Felix and his wife  are helped by their children, , ages 6 and 8 Bring Grandfather to the table
The old man stops playing as the children scurry over
As Maggie helps him to his feet, Thomas tosses another log on the fire
It
Fire and sparks
In the pigsty, the Creature draws back with a fearful moan
that nobody but  hears, He pauses to gaze blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering what it might have been
Probably nothing
He lets the children lead him toward the table
The meal is brought from the stove and ladled out
The Creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling it from here
string of drool spills from his mouth
It's humble fare, not very appetizing, but it looks like a feast compared to pig slop
: - '  - Victor lies sleeping
Wrestling with troubled dreams
In an eerie echo of before: the door creaks open in a spill of light
shadow enters, creeps to the bed, falls across his face
Victor's eyes fly open
He tries to erupt from bed, choking on a scream
and Henry wrestles him back to the pillow to feel his clammy forehead
Thank God your fever broke
(offers him water) Slowly, now
Just a sip
(Victor sips, falls back) 've been worried we might lose you
It's been touch-and-go for a week
week
We feared cholera
Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm
Is that your diagnosis
Mine and Professor Krempe's
(off his look) We've been trading off nursing you in shifts
The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims
It's his turn for that just now
You've been going round-the-clock
We catch a few hours sleep where we can
Usually here at your bedside
(deeply moved) Everything in moderation, Clerval
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein
Victor takes Henry's hand
Squeezes it
It's the down-and-outs  pity most
Those who can't fend for themselves
They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done
They don't stand a chance out there
(thinking of his creation) No
They don't
Victor
This place looked like a charnel house
What went on here
Victor pauses, too emotional to respond
Softly: want to go home
Beat
Henry accepts this, though he doesn't like it
It'll be months before you're well enough
Meantime, your family must be frantic not hearing from you
Henry grabs a stack of letters from the nightstand
found these
Some of the postmarks go back nine months
(slaps them on the bed) Why don't you open them
And when you've the strength, have the decency to ease their minds with a reply
Soon as the city ends quarantine, 'll even mail it for you
Along with this
(raises the locket) It's a beautiful gift
Does her no good lying here
Henry leaves him alone to wrestle with his guilt
Victor is swept with emotion and remorse
He closes his eyes
Softly: It can't survive
-  - The Creature and the pigs are sleeping in a heap
He rouses, scattering them, crawls to the slats of the sty
Felix is returning wearily from the fields with a large basket on his back
The Creature moves to his chink in the wall to see Felix enter the house and dump the basket out for Marie pathetic array of potatoes and turnips
Not much to look at
Even less to eat
don't how we're going to get through the winter with this yield
We'll sell another pig at market
One less for us
We'll make do
We always have
He sinks into a chair, weighed by worry
She moves to comfort him, cradling his head to her breast
He returns her embrace, drawing strength
tender, gentle moment
The Creature watches, puzzled and empathetic, deeply moved by her sympathy
Felix gathers himself, wipes his eyes
'll see if  can scratch a few more out of the ground
He hoists the basket and exits
The Creature turns to watch Felix trudging back toward the fields
-  - Felix digs for potatoes, tilling as he goes
Back-breaking work
Thomas provides what help he can
Some distance away, Maggie and Grandfather are tending the cow
to reveal the Creature watching from the brambles
-  - The Creature watches the family eat their dinner
Potatoes and turnips
glimmer of understanding in his eyes
-  - long shadow looms toward the dwelling
circling the house
approaching the shed
Baskets and tools
-  - We find the Creature working by the light of a refulgent moon, hacking away at the soil, tilling the earth
-  - The Creature stirs, hearing movement within the house
He scurries to the slats of the sty and peers out
All the baskets from the tool shed are stacked to overflow before the door
The door opens
Felix steps out and trips on a basket, sprawling to the ground in a torrent of potatoes and turnips
He sits up, gazing in wonder
-  - sliver of warm light spills through the chink in the wall
The Creature looms into frame, busily munching a raw potato
pig comes snuffling at his elbow
He shoves him away
Go find your own
Inside, the family is enjoying a much more generous meal than the last one: wish we could thank our benefactor
Nothing in this life comes free of cost
'd like to know who and why
It's the Good Spirit of the forest
Who's been filling your head
It does no harm
(peers at him) Oh,  see
Is it, Papa
Is it the Good Spirit
Felix and Marie exchange a look
He's not as amused as she is, but lets it go
She smiles at the children
Of course it is
Now finish your food before it gets cold
-  - Grandfather sits playing his recorder
The cow is grazing at a distance
The Creature creeps into view, listening to the music
Grandfather senses his presence
Turns
Who's there
Felix
Children
No response
He turns back
Unsettled
Continues playing
-  - The Creature watches Marie instructing the children in their letters
half dozen words are written in chalk on a slate board
Maggie is trying to puzzle one out: ff
reh
nn
nd
Friend
Friend
Good
And now the next (mimicking the effort) freh
nnn
nd
Freehhnnnd
He's delighted to have uttered his first word
-  - Felix is chopping lengths of wood, dulled by the task
The children are stacking the wood on a litter
-  - Felix and the children walk home
The litter of wood is being dragged by their cow
-  - Felix stacks the last pile of wood under the eaves
Marie meets him at the door, takes his hands
Your hands are bleeding again
Come in
'll rub liniment
They go inside
The door closes
to the pigsty
Eyes peering out
-  - The Creature walks along, munching a turnip, axe slung over his shoulder, muttering: brread
motherrr
frriend
(stops, gazes up) Treeeeee
-  - The walls around the house are stacked impossibly high with cords of wood
Felix and Marie gaze out the door
Stunned
What is going on here
- '  - Snow is drifting outside the tall dormer window
We find Victor at his desk, reading a letter: "
but it's been so long since 've heard from you
Remember the vow we took the night you left
You must be honest with me if your feelings have changed
Answer for the sake of our friendship, and both our future happiness
" (pause) She wrote that four months ago
to include Henry
He's been listening
woman like that is far too rare to be taken lightly
Victor ponders the letter
He lays it next to the locket, pulls out a sheet of paper and quill, begins to write
-  - The Creature observes another lesson
Six more words are chalked on the board
Thomas is struggling with the first: Ch
uur-ch
Church
Ch
uuu
ch
Good
And the next
Fl
oww
Floww
And then, amazingly, the Creature finishes the word before Thomas does: wwer
Flower
wer
Flower
Very good
Maggie
Try the next
Now the Creature beats Maggie to the punch: Garrr
denn
Garden
Maria
Look
It's snowing
The children crowd to the window
The Creature turns, peering through the slats
White flakes drift magically down
The door flies open, the children pour out
The adults appear in the doorway: Maggie
Thomas
You'll catch your death
Let them play
There's plenty of wood for the fire
(shoots her a look) He's right about that
Before she can react, he grabs her by the waist and drags her shrieking out into the snow
Before you know it, a wild snowball fight ensues
Screams and laughter
watches his family cavorting in the snow, having the time of their lives
His face lights up with a smile
Softly: It's snnowwinng
-  - Bright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow
Felix and the children are heading out, spirits high
Felix has his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder
-  - Felix and the children
They're laughing and joking, the kids playful and giggling
The Creature shadows them, looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion
Happy as a kid himself
Maggie and Thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing their arms and legs in the snow
They jump to their feet and hurry to catch up with Felix
The Creature peers out, amazed to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet
Up ahead, Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree
That one
It's the most beautiful tree 've ever seen
Felix shrugs off his coil of rope and starts chopping
-  - The Creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit up with wonder
Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of ornaments and light
The house is filled with joy and laughter
Grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire Most beautiful
tree
The kids go dashing across the room
The Creature shifts to the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light
The children set something out in the snow
Maggie calls out into the darkness: Merry Christmas
The door closes
The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries closer to investigate
He finds a covered plate topped with a glittering red silk flower as decoration
The slate board is jammed in the snow
On it is chalked a child's rendering of a glowing angel and a message: For the
Goood Spirr-rit
of the
Forr-rest
He snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize
He plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it gingerly into an inner coat pocket
He uncovers the plate to reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies
He's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad
He picks one up and bites into it
He pauses, stunned, eyes going wide as saucers
whine builds in his throat
He starts huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown
Screw potatoes and turnips
-  - The children race out the door to find the plate empty
And a big snow-angel waiting for them in the yard, -  - The Creature watches the family clustered around the fire
Marie reads a book aloud: with particles of heavenly fire, the God of Nature did his soul inspire
and pliant still the ethereal energy which wise Prometheus tempered into paste
The Creature leans back into the shadows, grappling with the concept of book
He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, and pulls out what's been there all along: Victor's Journal
So that's what this is
book
He unwinds the thong, riffles the pages
Letters fall, scattering from the pages
He picks one up by the corner, turns his head this way and that
Slowly: Myyy Darrllnng Vic

Willee haaad hisss burrth-dayyy

- '  - Grandfather sits playing his recorder
Again, the Creature approaches to listen
Grandfather stops
Turns
know you're there
(waits for a response) Won't you speak to me
The Creature studies Grandfather for a time
The old man waits
Finally starts to play again
The Creature finds a spot to listen
He opens Victor's journal
as he puzzles over it
-  - and we     as the Creature reads: of sscience
and to c-create
a beinng
in the image of man
assembled ffrrom
the
dead bodieess  have
gatherrred
He turns the page and discovers his own rough likeness: it's Victor's sketch of his patchwork man
The rendering includes suture marks where the pieces were joined
The Creature gazes for a long time
His finger traces the penciled suture-line where an arm joins the torso
Eyes going wider
Revelation slowly dawning
No
It can't be
it's too horrible to conceive
and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm
And the massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an exact match to the drawing
He throws his head back in an animalistic  , face twisted in a mask of utter horror, Munch's painting made flesh
and his scream echoes across the countryside, Felix turns from chopping wood
His family gathers, eyes wide, listening to the sound trail off
Softly: God in heaven
massive hand rips the page from the journal, raises it in a clenched fist
to reveal the Creature huddled in a corner, dropping his head into his arms to hide his face
Sunlight throws streaks of light and shadow through the slats
He sobs, wracked with despair as we : -  - The house is distant below
Felix and his family are heading out across the fields now sparse with snow, herding the cow before them
Only Grandfather is missing
The gentle  of the recorder drifts up from the house
to reveal the Creature hunkered on a hill
Watching
Waiting
The family dwindles in the distance
-  - For the first time, we actually see the inside of the house from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall
Grandfather is by the fire, playing his recorder
The Creature's face appears at a window
Peering in
He ducks from view, appearing at another window
Making sure the house is otherwise empty
He vanishes again
The door swings silently open
His figure fills the doorway
Grandfather stops playing
Silence
Would you like to sit by the fire
The Creature enters
Sits
Holds his hands toward the embers, feeling the warmth
Nice
The music
Or the fire
Grandfather offers him the recorder
The Creature hesitates, takes it, inept where such delicacy is required
He puts it to his misshapen lips and blows a few hollow tones
He gives it back, huffing air, delighted
'm glad you finally came to the door
man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows
Better that way
for me
Why
'm
very, very ugly
People are afraid
Except you
(smiles) It can't be as bad as that
(soft) Worse
The old man-reaches for his face
The Creature draws back
can see you with my hands
If you'll trust me
The Creature decides to trust
He eases forward
Grandfather runs his fingers over his features
Gently: You're an outcast
Yes
have been seeking my friends
Friends
Do they live around here
Yes
Very close Why do you not go to them
The Creature pauses
Emotions swirling
Afraid to continue
have been
afraid
Afraid
they will hate me
because  am so very ugly
and they are so very beautiful (softly) People can be kinder than you think
am afraid
Grandfather reaches out and takes the Creature's hands
Perhaps  can help
Tell me who
The Creature is huffing air, breath hitching in his chest like a panicking child
His monstrous eyes well up with tears
Trying to get the words out: love them
so very much
want
want
them to be my ff-family -Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm- mmuch
The Creature pauses
Trying to get the words out
And the door swings open
The Creature whips his head
There stands Maggie
Eyes going wide
Breath catching in her throat
She lets out an ear-splitting
The Creature throws himself on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading: Don't let them hate me
Felix bursts in, shoving Maggie aside, hell breaking loose in screaming, hollering chaos: Marie trying to get the children out of the way, Felix throwing himself on the Creature to rip him off the old man, the Creature sprawling to the floor, the old man shouting, the children , Felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, again and again, trying to kill the thing
Leave him alone
the   and taking the blows, writhing across the floor in agony, the children scattering from his pleading hands
The  rolls from under the brutal beating and sails out the door
-  - The Creature runs bleeding and sobbing, a specter sailing among the trees with greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings
Running from the horrified screams of rejection still echoing in his mind
-  - snowscape
Stark trees
figure in a greatcoat
Head bowed with misery
Leaning against a tree
Trying to catch his breath
Can't
Crying too hard
He sinks to his knees, hands clutched bitterly to his heaving chest
Wondering why the anguish doesn't stop his heart in mid-beat
realization
He pulls the little red silk flower from the inside pocket
It lies glittering in his huge, misshapen palm like gentle magic
Or hope
Yes
- The sky is brewing
The Creature runs across the courtyard toward the house, breathless, holding his palm out
See
Here's the flower you gave me
Don't you understand
It's me
It's mmmmeeeeee
Nothing
He glances around
The pigs are gone
Chickens too
The Creature's eyes go wide
He dashes to the house - and bursts in to find it empty
Items have been scattered and left behind
Books, clothes, even the old man's recorder
They left in a hurry
no
- We hear furniture , glass , shelves being ripped from walls
faint glow kicks up
Flames rise within
The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch
He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's recorder jammed in his belt
whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning the flames even higher
He raises his torch,  along with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting as the house is consumed
: - Massive pale gray feet walking through the snow to reveal a lone, windswept figure traversing the glacier with a walking staff
Struggling toward the crest of a ridge
Greatcoat billowing in a freezing wind
rises from below the crest and gazes down
Glowering with triumph at achieving his goal
Softly: Geneva
sweeps up the slope of the glacier like the wind itself, rising magnificently past the tiny figure standing on the ridge, sailing up over the crest
to reveal the valley and lake of Geneva below
: - '  -  () Sunlight streams through the dormer window
Birds twitter on the ledge outside
The trees are in bloom
Victor stands dressed and ready to go, taking one last pensive look around at the now-empty garret
Henry appears: Our carriage is here
-    - Bustling with activity
Hopeful
traffic snarl is jammed up in both directions, waiting to get in and out of the city
People, carriages, wagons, goods
We find Professor and
saying goodbye to Victor and Henry: (watching the gates) Such a terrible winter
'll praise God to see those gates open again
'll have all your things sent on
They should arrive soon after
(Victor nods) It's been a rough time, lad
For us all
But if you'd like to come back and finish out your final term once university re-opens
goes up from the crowd
The gates are finally opening as  swing them aside
The traffic starts to flow
Victor turns back to Krempe, nods gratefully
Thank you, Professor
For everything
Krempe is flustered as Victor gives him an awkward hug
Write and let us know you've arrived safely
Victor breaks the embrace
He and Henry clamber into the carriage
Softly: Take me home, my friend
Henry signals the
The reins snap
The carriage lurches away, easing into the flow of traffic as we : -   - William, now 10, comes charging up the steps with a small package under his arm, nearly bowling over Mrs
Moritz as he sails past her hollering his head off: '
-  - Willie careens into the parlor, where Elizabeth and Justine are entertaining
Elizabeth
Justine
Father enters, trailed by
What's all the fuss
Why are you shouting
He's coming home
Tonight
Who
Victor
That's what 'm telling you
(swept with relief) Thank God
Willie thrusts the package into her hands
She hesitates Open it
Willie scrambles to bring her the letter opener
Elizabeth lays the package down, slits it open
Willie peers in
Elizabeth pulls the locket out to the admiration of all
She presses the catch
The locket pops open to reveal Waldman's miniature oil painting
It's Victor
It's beautiful
May
(takes the locket) He looks so handsome
Elizabeth pulls out the letter
Apprehension and hope
She begins to read
The others watch her
Waiting
Her face lights up, blinking back tears
She remembers to breathe
What does it say
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night  left
(beat) He's coming home to marry me
Instant pandemonium and joy
except from Justine, whose heart quietly breaks
Father and the others  with approval while Willie jumps and shouts: Married
The two of you
Brilliant
knew it
Ever since you were children
(softly) That's wonderful
She hands the locket back
She slips quietly from the room, unnoticed by the others
-  - and hurries down the hall, fighting back tears
as Elizabeth is swept up in congratulatory conversation
Willie grabs the locket, admiring it: Elizabeth
Can  take this to show Peter
Willie, it's not a toy for your friends
'll take extra special care, promise
Pete's never seen what Victor looks like
He'll admire it enormously
Willie's so solemn and earnest that Elizabeth has to smile
Don't dawdle
It'll be dark in a few hours
The boy takes off like a shot
Father throws his arm around Elizabeth, announcing to all: Join us for champagne
My son is coming home
-   - Geese scatter as Willie comes racing across the grounds
He clambers over a low fence, heading into the miles of wooded acreage behind the house
His favorite shortcut
-  - Willie hurries/dawdles along as kids do, the precious locket clutched in his hands, admiring it
He can't get over the fact that his brother's finally coming home
He pauses, hearing   carried on the breeze, eerie and flute-like
recorder
Curious, he follows the sounds further and further into the woods
-  - and comes into view of the pond
There's a  sitting half-concealed among the tall reeds, gazing off across the water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly- pleasing dissonance (again, a simple variation of our familiar /
) Willie draws closer
Curious
Not wanting to intrude, but listening to the music
The figure in the reeds still hasn't noticed him
And then his head abruptly whips around, An ogre right out of a storybook
Willie's eyes go wide
The locket drops from his fingers into the dust
The boy turns and runs as the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet: Wait
Don't be afraid
The boy keeps running
The Creature comes shambling up from the pond, still calling after him
He picks up the dropped object
As he rises, he finds himself staring at the locket
At the small painting it contains
Victor Frankenstein
He raises his gaze after the fleeing boy
Maybe Willie does have reason to be afraid
The Creature starts after him, locket clenched in his fist, teeth grinding in greater and greater rage
Eyes wild
go pounding through the brambles and brush
The terrified boy
The pursuing monster
Faster and faster
-   - Whirling with activity
Mrs
Moritz supervises the staff
Elizabeth and Justine are helping with the preparations
Justine turns with a platter, collides with one of the kitchen staff
Carrots go flying
Justine
Pay attention
(tight) Yes, Mother
(pulls her aside) Are you all right
(even tighter) Fine
Justine sees genuine concern
She softens: 'll be all right
Really
Father enters with Claude
Both men worried
Have you seen Willie
Is he not back yet
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time
They say he never arrived
It's far too late for him to still be out
-  - Elizabeth exits with the others Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find him
He rushes to gather the men
Elizabeth gazes off
Wind kicking up
Night approaching
Almost too dark to see
- / - massive search in progress
People are scouring the fields on horse and on foot, shouting Willie's name
Elizabeth enters frame, calling out: dances on the horizon
storm approaching
-   - The stark black silhouettes of tree trunks bisect the frame in foreground as Justine approaches from the fields, lantern held high
and one of the "tree trunks" turns out not to be
It darts abruptly across frame with a billow of flapping greatcoat, Justine enters the woods
sends shadows skittering among the trees
-    - And the storm is now a raging downpour,   to reveal a coach clattering through the rain
-  - Victor is peering out the window flap
There
Look
Henry cranes to look
stutters the mansion briefly to life a few hundred yards down the road, Quite a place
Thank you, Henry
For what
This
My home
My family
(softly) If not for you, 'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere
Henry smiles, squeezes his shoulder
The carriage lurches violently, tossing them forward
-  - Victor jumps from the coach as the  wrestles his rearing horses under control and points
Victor turns
Elizabeth stands in the downpour like a ghost
Drenched to the bone
Weeping from the depths of her soul
Holding Willie in her arms
The boy's arms hang limp, his head dangles back
Victor starts forward, stunned, unable to comprehend, running faster and faster
Elizabeth
and now others are converging on the scene, dark screaming figures in the storm
Victor reaches her first as the others crowd around in a panic of confusion, crushing and jostling as she collapses into Victor's arms, all of them cradling Willie, and then Father is there, shoving his way through, -- seeing his dead boy and collapsing in the muck with a , and suddenly Henry is there shouting for the men to lift him and everybody is scrambling and screaming as we : -  - '  - Silence
All we hear now is the   of a clock
Henry tenderly ministers to Father, who lies gravely ill
-  - Elizabeth is sitting
Elbows crossed
Holding herself together
Face ashen
Dazed
Still in shock
Mrs
Moritz is nearby, looking much the same
Eyes swimming with tears
Sir
'm terrified for my girl
(softly) We'll organize another search now that it's light enough
We'll find her, Mrs
Moritz,  promise
Henry comes downstairs
He and Victor confer in whispers then approach Elizabeth
Victor crouches before her
What is Father's outlook
am cautiously hopeful
With quiet and proper care he may eventually regain some or most of his strength
Victor squeezes her hand
Comfort and strength
Thank you, Henry
There's a  at the front door
-  - Victor opens the door
hover outside
Faces grim
#1 Mr
Frankenstein
We've apprehended the murderer
Not five miles from here, hiding in a barn
Who is it
The policemen trade uneasy glances
#2 It's very unsettling, sir
And quite strange
Perhaps you'd better come with us
-   - Victor is led in by policemen
The  unlocks the cell
Victor enters as the men depart
Victor is alone, staring at a  huddled in the corner, pooled in shadow
We get the impression of long, dangling hair
The figure stirs
Victor
and leans into the light
Justine
Pale
Dazed
Scared Victor
It's you
Thank God
She rushes to him, throws herself into his arms
He reacts stiffly, not at all sure he wants her touching him
Is it true
What they say about Willie
Is it true
Yes
She dissolves into tears
Barely able to breathe
Willie
My poor little angel
(looks up) Victor
They think  did it
Did you
Justine pauses
Stunned
Her eyes on his
Here's the deepest betrayal ever experienced
Her heart turns to ash
(low) don't believe
am in need of your comfort
anymore
(a whisper) Did you, Justine
Beat
She hauls off and slaps him hard enough to rock his head around
Then she slaps him again
Harder
Get out
-  - The courtroom is packed
Justine sits accused
An older is on the stand
found her sobbing her eyes out
Poor thing,  said, what's all this
And she spilled her heart to me about Master Victor
How she'd always loved him, and now he was coming home to marry mistress Elizabeth
sweeps the courtroom
Victor and Elizabeth share a stunned glance
She cried and cried about the beautiful locket he'd sent
How she wished it was hers
She swore me never to tell a soul
(peers at Justine) That was before the boy went missing, a'course
-  - Victor is on the stand: always viewed her with brotherly affection
had no idea of her feelings for me
Rejection can be a powerful wound
People have been known to do uncanny things
But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved
Victor pauses, gnawed by some vague intuition
He looks to Justine
She gazes back, her feelings hidden
Softly: It's hard to believe
-  - Elizabeth is on the stand: Justine and  grew up as sisters know her better than anybody
Do you think it possible she committed this crime
William was as much her child as mine
We were both mother to him
(beat) believe she would sooner have strangled the life from her own body
Then you consider the charge without merit
consider the charge imbecilic
-   - Justine is now on the stand: Yes
took refuge in the barn
Wouldn't you
Lost in the storm
Freezing and wet
was exhausted and could search no longer
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein
That your heart was broken
(off her silence) Answer the question
Do you love Victor Frankenstein
Her gaze wanders to Victor, eyes locking on his
Stares back, trapped
have always loved him
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion
Murder Willie
In my heart, he was our child
Victor's and mine
Such a thing could never have entered my mind
So you have claimed
Yet you have no explanation for this
(holds up the locket) The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder
The locket you so coveted
(leans close) How did it come to be in your possession
have no knowledge of that
-  - drop heavily in frame
-
shoe flies off
The  gasps
Mrs
Moritz collapses  to the ground
Elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her
Victor just stands staring
to reveal Justine dangling from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still twitching
-   - Another eerie echo of before: a storm is raging
The body dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain
Victor looms from the darkness, staring
And then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs his shoulder
Victor whirls and finds himself staring up into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous necrotic features bathed in a purple/white
He  as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to- eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin
Softly: Frankenstein
Victor is speechless with horror
The Creature raises his arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger
Look there
Victor does
dances in the sky, illuminating Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity
and then the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness
Victor falls gasping
The awful truth dawning
He rises, gazing at the scaffold, horrified
Oh God
Oh God
No
Screaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking to his knees, weeping helplessly: Oh God
Justine
Forgive me
-  -  - Victor pulls a carved box from a shelf
Opens it
Lying inside in their velvet cradle are a gorgeous pair of Model 1820 Collier flintlock revolvers
- Victor is bundled in a rough coat, packing final supplies on a horse held by Claude
Elizabeth is at his heels
My mind was not playing tricks
He was there in the storm
gloating over his crimes
challenging me to come
But why risk yourself
Hasn't this family suffered enough
've no choice If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police
They've done a fine job
Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend
He rams the rifle into its scabbard, turns to her
(softly) Do you know this man
Is there something between you
know only that he is a killer
And  shall bring back his carcass
Victor heaves himself into the saddle and rides off to the mountain
Shrouded in snow
Waiting
- lone horse and rider appear, on his mission of revenge
Victor ascends the mountain
The mountain is brutal and unforgiving
Victor dismounts, leading his horse onto the glacier
bitter wind blows
They plod on
Searching
Magnificent rugged vistas unfolding before our eyes
Primeval and vast
The horse suddenly spooks
Victor calms him
Staring
Is that a figure down there
He shades his eyes against the cutting sleet
Somebody in the distance
Down there on the snow field
tiny speck
Watching him
The figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great bounds
Right toward Victor
Victor wrenches the carved box from the saddle bag
The horse bolts
Victor drops to the snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair of revolvers
He glances up
The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of white
Victor rises with a revolver in each hand, cocks the flintlocks of both, turning slowly around
Gazing at the rocks and crags
Searching
He hears nothing but his own voice echoing back
and then through the snow
He turns
The Creature is running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed, greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings
Victor raises the first pistol
Hesitates
As frightened and angry as he is, a small part of him pauses to admire the achievement of actually having created life
He pulls the trigger
huge flash of powder, an eruption of smoke
The Creature dodges the shot, still coming
Victor raises the other gun
Another flash of smoke
Still the Creature comes
Victor
Frantic
Manually spinning the cylinders, cocking, firing
miss
Another miss
Spinning
cocking
Firing
Spinning
Cocking
And the Creature is on him, slapping the pistols clean out of his hands
The guns sail through the air, spinning off across the ice
Victor panics, turns to run
And slips over the edge of the precipice
Victor falls , arms and legs windmilling through a 30-foot drop
and slams bodily into a snowdrift
He looks up
The Creature is peering down
and leaps over the edge to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a cat-like crouch
He pulls Victor from the snow and sends him sliding across the ice with a mighty heave
-   - right into the mouth of an ice-cave, Victor comes tumbling and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to sprawl heavily to the cave floor
Winded
Battered
Barely able to move
He glances up to see the cave filled with possessions
Books
Provisions
Extra clothing
The embers of a fire burn low
There is even a rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates
huge shadow fills the cave entrance
The storybook ogre is coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine
Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as the Creature enters
but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers down
He tosses a few more sticks on the flames
Pause
Come warm yourself if you like
You speak
Yes,  speak
And read
And think
and know the ways of Man
(pause) 've been waiting for you
Two months now
How did you find me
The Creature grabs Victor's journal off the "shelf
" He unwinds the thong, the letters spill out
The letters in your journal
That and a geography book
(picks up a letter) Your Elizabeth sounds lovely
Kill me and have done with it
Kill you
Hardly that
Then why am  here
What did you want with me
More to the point, why am  here
What did you want with me
(off Victor's look) What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face
Milton gave it voice
(grabs a book, thumbs to a certain page) Did  request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man
Did  solicit thee from Darkness to promote me
Fine words from a child killer
You who murdered my brother
Your crime
as well as mine
How dare you
You're disgusting and evil
Evil
(scurries closer) Do you believe in evil
see it before me
'm not sure  believe
But then had no one to instruct me
had no mother
and my father abandoned me at birth
He draws closer still
Intimate
Turning his head this way and that
Puzzling at Victor's face
Softly: Were the dying cries of your brother music in my ears
He raises his hand before Victor's eyes, bony fingers curling to clutch an invisible throat
Victor is petrified took him by the throat with one hand
lifted him off the ground
And slowly crushed his neck
(emotion growing) That poor, innocent child died in my grip
because all  could see was your face
and all  could feel was my rage
And when  let him go, he fluttered to the grass like a sparrow
: The Creature gazes down at Willie's body
He stares at the hand that committed the crime as if waking from a dream
Tears welling
Overcome with shame and horror
He falls to knees in the middle of the vast field, his wail echoing across the countryside as he weeps over the boy
Victor stares in horror as the Creature relates his story with tears shining in his monstrous eyes
Later, when they were searching, followed the pretty lady who got lost in the woods
: - Justine is asleep in the hay
Haggard, wet, exhausted
The Creature looms over her, a monstrous shape backlit by the lightning, gazing on her beauty
His hand reaches down, hovering reverently, wishing to caress the swell of her breasts at the neckline of her bodice
(
) She was so lovely
longed to touch her
and seek her sympathy
The locket drops from his hand to dangle in his fingers
He lowers it, tucking it gently away in her pocket (
) but  simply returned the object which had triggered my crime, hoping in some small way to atone
Now tears are shining in victor's eyes as well
You gave me these emotions, but you didn't tell me how to use them
Now two people are dead
Because of us
Victor is crushed by remorse
sob escapes him
Why, Victor
Why
What were you thinking
There was something at work in my soul which  do not understand
What of my soul
Do  have one
Or was that a part you left out
(spreads his hands) Who were these people of which  am comprised
Good people
Bad people
Materials
Nothing more
You're wrong
Do you know  knew how to play this
He grabs up the recorder, plays a brief snatch of melody
In which part of me did this knowledge reside
In these hands
In this mind
In this heart
(beat) And reading and speaking
Not things learned
so much as things remembered
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps
Stolen memories
Stolen and hazy
They taunt me in my dreams
've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her
Whose woman was this
've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream
Whose childhood friends were these
(soft, intense) Who am
(hollow) don't know
Then perhaps  believe in evil after all
The Creature moves off
Victor is emotionally exhausted What can  do
There is something  want
(pause) friend
Friend
companion
female
Like me, so she won't hate me
Like you
Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking
do know that for the sympathy of one living being,  would make peace with all
(beat) have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine
And rage the likes of which you would not believe
If  cannot satisfy the one,  will demonically indulge the other
That choice is yours
(off his look) You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein
And if  consent
We'd travel north, my bride and
To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot
There we would live out our lives
Together
(beat) No human eye would ever see us again
This  vow
on Victor
Considering it
Beaten
-    - Victor is calming his skittish horse as the Creature looms into view
Victor turns
The Creature tosses Victor his journal
Victor hesitates, jams it into his saddlebag
Soon
Yes
want this over and done with
'll be waiting
And watching
And with that, the Creature turns and scrambles back down the nearly-vertical cliff face, leaping from crags and boulders with superhuman agility
Victor watches him vanish from sight
-   - Victor descends the mountain, heading back to civilization
-   - Victor walks his horse toward the house
Elizabeth rushes out to meet him with Henry and Claude
Victor hands off the reins to the  and embraces Elizabeth tightly
thought 'd never see you again
'm all right
'm safe, What happened up there
didn't find what  was looking for
What did you find
Victor glances over
Claude has pulled the Collier pistols from the saddlebags and caught a strong whiff of powder
These have been fired
At shadows
My nerves got the better of me
Victor walks on toward the house with Elizabeth -  - and we find them in discussion by the fountain: What sort of task
It's not something  can explain now
Perhaps someday
What of our marriage
Victor, we've had so much tragedy
want this family to live again
So do
We need each other now,  need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude
month at most, that's all  ask
(draws close) Elizabeth, please
Things have not yet resolved
must take steps to see that they do
For our family's sake
For our sake
(caresses her face) You are life itself
We shall seal our vow
The moment  am done
He leans forward to kiss her
and pauses, hearing the distant  of a recorder echoing from the hills
-  - Victor sits at bedside, holding Father's hand
The old man is a weak and frail shadow of his former self
You must regain your strength to preside at our wedding
and spoil your grandchildren later on
These are duties you cannot shirk
Father smiles faintly
Victor squeezes his hand, whispers: We're all safe now
promise -   - Murky and dark
Victor enters, yanks a dusty curtain off a window to let in some daylight
He picks up a pry bar, approaches a stack of crates as if facing an old adversary
One in particular is quite large
He rams the bar into the wood, prying it open
and    to reveal a dull gleam of copper lurking within the packing straw
God forgive me
: Victor assembles his equipment, recreating the lab; bolting together the sarcophagus, now resting in its cradle
Hanging the huge glass tube, adjusting the boom
Installing the ceiling tracks and hoist mechanism
Playing out the copper wire along the ceiling beams
Hooking up the galvanic batteries and generators
Testing the electrical circuit with goggles and thick gloves, getting a huge cascade of sparks
(
) prayed never to see these again
Victor turns
Henry stands in the doorway
Whatever they are
Henry enters, runs his hand over the gleaming surface of the sarcophagus, circles toward Victor
won't bother asking what or why
You wouldn't tell me anyway
just hope you know what you're doing
(draws close) because if this is a repeat of Ingolstadt,  won't be around to pick up the pieces
to the Da Vinci print on the wall, contact points still daubed with red
-  - among the tombstones to reveal an eerie sight: hunched in a grave, digging madly, dirt flying
We hear the  of a shovel hitting wood -  - and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the Creature
He peers down at us, almost close enough to kiss
-   -    - The Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder
He pauses as a    pass far below
He pulls himself onto the roof, crosses the gables, and pushes open a dormer window
We see Victor inside as it swings open
The Creature enters with his prize
-  - and the mottled corpse of Justine Moritz flops onto the table before us
: want her
Victor stares down in utter horror
Her cold, dead face
Blue lips already beginning to shrivel
Purple, sunken eyes
Knowing that she loved him
Knowing it's his fault she's dead
He can barely get the words out: Why
her
Her body pleases me
That's it for Victor
He turns away, stomach heaving
It's all he can do to keep from throwing up
Materials, remember
Nothing more
Your words
Victor hesitates, pulling himself together
Softly: My words
He turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying not to view it as someone he knows
He cradles the head, probing the back of the neck with his fingers
The brain stem was destroyed by the hanging
We'll need another
The body looks like it will do, but some extremities are too decayed
They'll have to be replaced
The fresher the better
-  -    - Outside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a servicing a  in the alley: he's got her pressed against the wall, skirt hiked up
It's not long before he's finished
Off he goes, staggering back into the bar
She arranges her skirt, tucking the money away
and pauses, noticing a in the shadows
Staring
She approaches with her best saucy smile: Want some yourself
Or just like to watch
(draws close) What do you say, lover
can make it good for you
The Creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to her mouth
His other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her off the ground
She gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in his palm
Softly: know you can
And he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine
-  - The dead prostitute lies staring up, dried blood staining her mouth
to Victor gazing down in horror
What is this
brain
Extremities
This was not taken from a grave
What does it matter
She'll live again
You'll make her
No
draw the line
The Creature lashes out and drags Victor across the table
You will honor your promise to me
(through gritted teeth) will not
Kill me now
That is mild compared to what will come
If you deny me my wedding night
'll be with you on yours
The Creature vanishes out the attic window into the night
Victor is left gasping for air, staring at the dead prostitute
The full horror sinking in
-   - Victor slams the attic door, securing it with a massive padlock
He hurries down the steps
-   - Victor and Elizabeth, intensity flying: No
Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today
Why the change
What about your work
It was misguided and pointless
Is your answer yes
It is We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony
Pack only what you need
Does this have something to do with that man you saw
(hesitates) Yes
We're in danger here
Every moment we stay
Victor, tell me why
Trust me
do
But you must trust me for now
-  - small ceremony has been hurriedly organized at Father's bedside
The old man holds Elizabeth's hand
Softly: This is not
the grand wedding
had hoped to give you
He releases her hand, giving the bride away
She takes her place at Victor's side
Henry stands as best man
The faces them: We gather now in the sight of God to witness this man and woman bond their lives in matrimonial vow
-  - Elizabeth gets in the coach
Claude clambers up to the driver's seat armed with a rifle, ready to pull out on horseback provide armed escort
Victor addresses the men staying behind, all of whom are also armed: Be especially on your guard
Stay cautious to a fault
Who is this man, sir
How shall we know him
He is huge and deformed
and quite insane
He killed Master William and sent Justine Moritz to the noose
No hesitation, lads
Shoot the bastard on sight
of assent
Victor pulls Henry aside: Are you sure you'll be all right
Yes, don't worry
'll look after your father
You look after her
'll be back as soon as 've got her far away and safe
We'll hunt this fiend down together
Only if you'll tell me who he is
(hesitates) owe you that
Done
quick embrace
Victor leaps into the coach
' The coach clatters up the road, trailed by the eight horsemen
Those left behind scatter across the courtyard
Henry turns and walks back toward the house
to reveal the Creature at the window
In the bed behind him, The old man stirs, opening his eyes Victor
and sees the Creature turn toward him
Father's eyes go wide as his final stroke is triggered
His life ends with a prolonged death-rattle
and a soft exhale
The Creature reaches down, closes his eyes
tender gesture
The Creature whirls
There stands the priest, dropping his tea to the floor
The Creature sweeps across the room, presses him against the wall
(breathless with horror) You're the Devil himself
Yes, and 've come to snatch your soul
(leans close) unless you tell me where they've gone
-   - magnificent sunset bathes the mountains as storm clouds roll in
ferry is crossing the lake, moving away from us, rippling the water
to reveal
-   - Claude trotting to the window of the coach
That was the last ferry
There's nothing else till morning
Damn it We'll ride on ahead and secure you lodging for the night
-  - big chalet nestled in the woods by the lake
The storm is raging
Claude and his men are positioned at the entrances
Make sure you keep your pistols dry #2 They're dry enough
And if they fail, we've others
And if those fail
(draws his saber halfway) we can always gut the bastard
Don't worry, sir
You're well guarded
Now why don't you go upstairs to your wife
It's not often a man has his wedding night
-   - Victor enters to find the room aglow with dozens of candles
Elizabeth turns from the fireplace, her body silhouetted through the sheer white nightgown
You're soaking
She approaches, peels off his coat
Victor stares at her, awe-struck
She sees the look in his eyes, crosses her arms demurely
then laughs at her own modesty
Brother and sister no more
Now husband and wife
He strokes her bare shoulders with his fingertips
remember the first time  ever saw you
Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side
So beautiful even then
(a whisper) have been waiting for this ever since
She leans up and gives him a kiss that would melt glass, triggering the sexiest seduction imaginable
kissing, caressing, Victor stripping off his wet shirt, around them in slow circles, candles spinning like a fever that's been building for a lifetime
and now onto the bed
Magnificent and canopied
Kneeling together, bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining
Elizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her
Victor sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up the nightgown, making her shudder with desire
and a
Victor jerks up
He can hear
He rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed and ready on the nightstand
Victor
Open this door for no-one
-  - Victor sails past the  at the entrance, brandishing his pistols
The men converge, shouting in the rain: #2 saw him in a flash of lightning
He vanished toward the lake
Get after him
Several men race off in pursuit
from Victor and Claude
as a    reveals the Creature clinging in the branches above their heads with a malevolent smile
He scurries  silently up, further and further into the tree
closer and closer to the balcony
-   - Elizabeth
Tense and waiting
shadow looms across the balcony
spilling through the French doors
onto the floor
a bony hand reaches for the latch
The doors burst open on a crust of wind and rain, Elizabeth spins as candles blow out all over the room
The Creature enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow
Softly: Don't bother to scream
-  - The men come running back from the lake
They stop before Victor and Claude
#3 We lost him
And  #4's eyes drift up: #4 Why are those open
Victor spins, gazing up
Breath catching in his throat
The French doors are swaying in the wind
Elizabeth
-   - Elizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves inexorably toward her
Her eyes dart toward the door
She makes a break for it
He catches her halfway across the room, spinning her around by the arm
Her face is lit by the light of the fireplace
The Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty
moment passes between them
She senses the softening in his heart
She peers at him, trying to understand
Realizing: You don't want to hurt me
He averts his gaze, shamed by her beauty
You're more lovely than  could ever have imagined
come pounding up the stairs
of men throwing their shoulders at the door
and it changes back in an instant, The Creature snarls
She tries to wrench away
He spins her around so he won't have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow
He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest with pile-driver force
-  ( ) - and her  is cut short
The men give one last mighty rush at the door
-   - and they burst in just in time to see Elizabeth cascade back onto the bed, her chest a massive red stain
The Creature whips toward them, fist glistening with blood
keep my promises
and he races across the room as the men  , shredding the walls to splinters with an explosive fusillade of shots
But the Creature is too fast
He hits the leaded window head-on with the force of an anvil
-  - and goes sailing out into empty space in a hurricane of shattering glass
He drops 40 feet to the grass below and vanishes like the breeze, greatcoat whipping into darkness
-   - Victor rushes to the bad and lets loose the most He sweeps his limp, murdered bride into his arms, cradling her to his breast, screams trailing off into wracking moans and sobs of despair: (softly) Oh God
he took her heart
he took her heart from me
-  - The men make way as Victor carries his dead wife through the downpour
He puts her in the coach
Dazed
-  - The coach comes racing through the storm, the horses in a frenzy, faster and faster
-  - Victor whipping the coach veers to a wild stop
Victor jumps down, gathers up the body, and mounts the steps
Henry appears, rushing out into the rain
Victor goes right past him
- and carries Elizabeth through the silent halls
- The door swings in
Victor stands dripping
Holding Elizabeth
Gazing at the gleam of copper
: And we launch into the final throbbing madness
Victor hacking and chopping
Discarding pieces
Sewing the creation, yanking the catgut tight
Ramming the needles deep
Hoisting the body in the air
Slamming the sarcophagus lid, tightening the bolts
Powering up the galvanic circuit, throwing the switch
Screaming at God as the   and the body convulses
Wind and rain sweeping through the lab, battering a window open and shut, open and shut
Lowering the glass tube, ramming phallus into womb
Releasing the eels, huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the spasming egg The body
Convulsing
Lashing
Screaming in the copper womb
Hair whipping in the fluid
Victor shuts down the machinery
He opens the tank and reaches into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves
He pulls out his creation, cradling the head and neck as one would cradle a newborn infant's
And wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal Elizabeth's face, Massive suture marks bisect her neck and collarbone where pieces were joined
whisper: Live
Her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to draw air but finding fluid in the lungs
She erupts, thrashing in the vat
He clutches her tight, pounding her back to start her breathing, calming the convulsing Creaturess with soft murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave violently to dispel the fluid
He lifts her gently out
Wipes off the muck as she shivers and shakes, spasms easing off
Cleansing her face
Clasping her hand in his
Comfort and strength
Helping her to her feet
Jerky and unsure
Lean on me
Replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, draping it
and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up with his fingers to gaze into her eyes
whisper: Say my name
Blank
Dazed
Stunned
Not a flicker of recognition
Elizabeth
Say my name
Say you remember
Say my name
Nothing
He leans forward
and kisses her dead lips
Gentle as a sigh
flicker in her eyes
You must
You must
Maybe his imagination
Still whispering: Say my name
Say you remember
And slowly
ever so slowly
she raises her bony white hand before her eyes
staring at it
trying to puzzle it out
its meaning
perhaps the vaguest shred of recognition
and the hand continues to rise
creeping slowly toward his shoulder
and coming to rest there
He smiles, blinking back tears
Yes
'll help you remember
And he takes her other hand in his
At first it's imperceptible
just the slightest motion, perhaps nothing, perhaps just a shift of balance
and then it grows into the vaguest sway
and tears are glistening in Victor's eyes as she begins to move
Lurching
Faltering
Unsure
You must lead, Victor
The lady will always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong
Trace memories
waltz
And here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and hair-raisingly demented image of the film: Frankenstein dances with his dead bride, showing her the way, begging her to remember, please remember, and now our /  really comes back to haunt us as the  , incredibly lush and deranged, dissonant and echoing through Victor's head, music only he can hear
one-two-three, twirl-two-three
and the worst part
The very worst thing of all
There on the shelf
large formaldehyde jar
Justine's severed head
Watching them through the glass with dead, sightless eyes
Watching them dance
Still a wallflower
No
She's finally finishing her dance with Victor
most of her, anyway
Under the circumstances, it'll have to do
and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in glorious circles as a dazzling array of  bathes them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening across the walls,   swelling louder and louder, climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo with jagged glass claws
and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in
Music echoes abruptly away into silence
Nothing now but rain and distant thunder
In the doorway: She's beautiful
She's not for you
'm sure the lady knows her own mind
Doesn't she
Let her decide the proper suitor
The Creature raises his hand
Beckoning
She takes a faltering step
Drawn to him
Elizabeth, no
(she turns, puzzled) Say my name
Her face reflects horror and shame, like a brain-damaged child who's wet the bed
She knows she's supposed to remember
but can't remember what remembering means
They both motion to her
Murmuring
Begging
She's caught between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war
Please
come with me
Please
remember
She finally tilts toward the Creature
Gazing into his eyes
Studying his face
Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh
beat frown
puzzlement
This isn't right
People don't look like this
They're not stitched together out of pieces of flesh like a patchwork
She looks at her own hands
Dead and white
Not even hers
One belongs to Justine
Another to a prostitute, suture scars marring the wrist
She looks down at herself
The dead, sagging breasts
The body that isn't hers either
Realization creeping into her eyes
Realization and horror
Turning to Victor
Why do  look like this
What's happened to me
Oh God, what's happened to me
Vic
tor
no
and she lets out a , a banshee wail from the deepest pits of hell
Screaming at them both
Screaming at herself
She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to peel it away, clawing at her face
Trying to claw out her own eyes
Victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin
The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside
'
' Yes
She remembers
Not much, but enough
She breaks away from them as they grapple, still  as she sails across the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying
over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before they can stop her
She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other
But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing in her eyes
Loathing for them for what they've done to her
loathing for herself for what she's become
It turns out the lady does know her own mind
She wants no part of it
or them
Decision made
She crushes the lamp in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene
She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts past them, still , still trying to claw the dead flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the Creature racing after her
-   - and she sails down the hallway, setting  to everything she passes,  for the final torment to end
She hurls herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she plummets to the floor far below
pillar of flame leaps up on impact
face each other as flames sweep the walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in Hell
You killed her
You killed her
He hurls himself at the Creature, who backhands him spinning down the hallway, sprawling to the floor
The Creature gazes down at his Maker one last time
We killed her
And then vanishes through the smoke and flames
-   - The once-magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath a merciless gray sky
Charred beams and drifting smoke are all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family
Victor stands gazing at the house
windswept, hollow man Bundled in a rough coat
Flintlock rifle dangling at his side
Henry moves into frame some distance behind
Softly: Victor
No reaction
For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard
He rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack horse
The animal stands saddled and ready
He starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a restraining hand
Victor snaps a look as if seeing a stranger
and then his features soften
All that  once loved lies in a shallow grave
By my hand
Let it go
Victor pauses, emotions swirling
Wishing he could grab the dangling thread of sanity Henry has offered
but knowing the thread is a bittersweet illusion
bare whisper: You should have been my father's son
He would have been so proud
Victor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his horse
Henry runs after him, shouting: But Victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance
The past is dead
Henry watches Victor until he's gone from sight, as Willie did so long ago
-    - The solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept glacier
-  '  - Victor slides down the entrance, rifle cradled
The cave is now deserted, all possessions gone, a scorched black spot where the campfire had been
-  - panorama of snow
Pristine
save for the long trail of footprints stretching off before us
Victor's face thrusts into frame, gazing at the craggy horizon, breath punching the air with billows of vapor
He slogs onward, following the tracks, leading his horse by the reins
Dwindling across the frozen landscape
(
) followed his trail north
always north
and always one step behind
never stopping
driven by my fires of rage
and revenge
: - '  - Victor lies in Walton's bed, sallow as a corpse, barely able to speak, drained now of everything
year now 've followed him
Perhaps more
Only to arrive at this place
Tired
So very tired
never did find
whatever it was
was looking for
and neither will you, my friend
(off Walton's look) Value life above ambition
or those glittering prizes you seek will crumble to dust in your fingers
as they have in mine
(reaches out feverishly) See your loved ones again
cannot
Walton takes Victor's hand, lays it gently back to his chest
Softly: Rest now
Victor is silent
His breathing shallow
Walton just sits And waits
marks the passage of Walton's long vigil
Victor's eyes flutter open as if staring at something unseen
Perhaps, the faces of those he loved
The eyes glaze peaceful death
Walton rises
Puts on his heavy coat to ward off the chill
Exits the cabin
-  -   - Grigori is leaning on the gunwale, staring off across the ice
His coat is open
Walton joins him
Surprised at how warm it is
He holds up his hand, testing the breeze
warming wind
This ice will break yet
(glances over) How's our guest
He died
Raving about phantoms
He was mad, poor devil
(beat) Gather a detail
Have the body removed from my cabin
Aye, Captain
Grigori moves off to gather help
Walton turns and heads back to his cabin
- '  - Walton enters
and freezes at the sound of
He can't see the bad from here
Could it be the dead man
He glances down
Wet footprints lead across the floor
He eases forward
The tiny bed chamber comes slowly into view
is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding the corpse's hand
Walton is stunned
Who are you
The figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim yellow light: He never gave me a name
Walton hisses a terrified intake of breath
He lunges to the desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there
frozen beat
Wondering if he should snatch it up
Eyes dancing with fear and speculation
The Creature makes no move
Unconcerned
You were with him at the end
(finds his voice) Yes
was watching
Walton glances to the porthole, ajar and creaking in the breeze, chilled at the thought
The Creature returns his gaze to Victor
longed to be with him
But  wanted his final moments to have peace could see you were a friend to him
What is that to you
Evil as you are
(swivels his gaze) am as he made me
In his own image
You drove him to his torment
And he drove me to mine
Then why weep for him
Would you not
He was father
And mother
We fell from grace together
He from his God
from mine
The Creature gently strokes Victor's cheek
He reaches up with two fingers, closes the staring eyes
whisper: Could we ever have forgiven
The question goes unanswered
The Creature rises, gliding in shadow to the door
Pauses
've never been shown a kindness
Show me one now
What kindness
Build for him a pyre
Light up the sky with his passing
And then the Creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the night
-  - The crew of the Nevsky are on the ice, chopping up the fallen mast, axes rising and falling in waves
-  - The body of Victor Frankenstein lies on an impressive bier of wood, stacked and lashed
His body is wrapped in rough canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice
Walton and crew stand facing the bier
Walton silently reads a passage from the Bible
Oily black smoke from a small campfire drifts past
Walton closes the book
Amens are muttered
Walton glances to Grigori and nods
Grigori moves forward with two other men
They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it
Walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch
He dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns
The men back away, preparing for the coming blaze
and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in
The men pause
Gazing across the ice
Dread seeping into their bones
There's a figure out there
Huge and humanlike in frame
Loping slowly over the ice
Approaching
(softly) Christ
Grigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks the flintlock
Walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, denying his aim
It has a right to bear witness
Grigori hesitates, nods
If you say so
The men grow more unsettled as the Creature draws nearer
Frightened muttering
Men start backing toward the ship
Stand fast
All of you
The men stand fast
The Creature stops some thirty yards out
silent tableau on the ice
The men facing the Creature
Walton holding the torch
The pyre waiting for the kiss of flame
Walton moves forward
and a   is heard, The men whip their heads as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again
It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and force:
Another eruption
And another
Ice cascading skyward
'
(whips toward Walton) Walton rushes forward
The ice erupts before him
The torch goes flying
Walton sprawls flat on his back
The men don't have to be told twice
They're already in full retreat, scrambling for their lives
Ice is detonating for miles around as if pounded by artillery
Grigori helps Walton to his feet
The torch lies burning not ten feet away heartbeat of hesitation
Walton wondering if he should go for it
Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve
and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course across the ice, separating them from the torch
They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels
watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice
He starts forward
Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of cascading water and spinning fragments
The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side
stumble along, closing distance to the ship
Walton glances back, amazed to see: racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a wide grimace of effort
Detonations threaten to swallow him from all sides
Suddenly, things go from bad to worse
breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, triggering massive eruptions in all directions
The crew hang onto the drop-net for dear life
Several men plummet into the icy water
is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice crashing down after him
Gone
are knocked flat as a fissure appears between them
Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him
Walton grabs the back of Grigori's coat and tries to drag him off
but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the ice see-saws forward in a complete flip and slams Grigori thunderously into the drink
finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as she finds honest ocean beneath her hull
Some men are reaching the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to the deck
Those lower on the drop-net are helping their fellows from the water, hauling them to safety
'  is now corkscrewing in slow circles on its own ice floe
is drifting on a chunk of ice
Still burning
Walton is on hands and knees, scrambling on shifting pieces of ice, thrusting his arms into the water, screaming: The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight of his own clothing
Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water himself
Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping
Dying
He's dying right in front of Walton's eyes
Too late
Grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing for good beneath the frigid water
Gone
Walton throws his head back with a bellow of anguish
and Grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly And impossibly from the water
arms and legs windmill against the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength
He gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest
and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and up
and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath him
The face of a nightmare
The Creature lunges hugely, hurling Grigori through the air right into Walton's arms
Both men go sprawling
Walton scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the Creature
The monster is exhausted
Near his limit
Walton thrusts out his arm, fingers grasping to help
Swim
The Creature swivels his gaze
The burning torch is drifting away
He looks grimly back to Walton
Walton beckoning to him
Come
Grab my hand
The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the torch
Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice
struggles through the water, crushed and battered by ice floes on all sides
Going under
slog grimly on across the disintegrated ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water
They sink, finding nothing beneath their feet
Lines are thrown down and caught
Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water and hoisted up the side of the ship
The last ones aboard
is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice
Bony fingers break the surface of the water
straining hand
The Creature's eyes rise from the murk
Bleary with exhaustion and cold
He seizes the torch
Raises it high
Swims grimly on
The crew bundle Walton and Grigori in blankets, both men shivering with exposure
Walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing off
The men crowd to his-side
swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch held high to keep it burning
Relentlessly determined
This is the most grueling effort we've ever seen
Gasping and sinking beneath the surface
and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe upon which lies Frankenstein's funeral pyre
He hauls himself from the water
Moving now in a slow-motion litany of exhaustion
Climbing the pyre
Scaling the wood
Seeking the top
Never giving up
The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across the River Styx
Frankenstein himself lies serenely at his creation's knees, content to be shown the way
The Creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading his arms wide in sublime triumph
Feeling the wind on his skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart
Cold
So very cold
He glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke
He looks down
At Frankenstein
The oil-soaked canvas
The saturated wood
There's that smell
Yes
He scoops Victor up with his free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother comforting a baby
gaze in horror
Realization dawning: () Don't do it
(screaming) '
'
turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven
Eyelids fluttering in near-religious ecstasy
Finding in these last moments the sympathy held so long sought
whisper: For God's sake
will
And he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him
White-hot ignition
Ultimate redemption
massive engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky
Blossoming
Roiling
gaze on in wonder and horror as: rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames
Hair going up at a sizzling flashpoint
Cheeks billowing out, peeling back in the blast-furnace heat
Flesh cleansing from bone
Teeth charring and turning black
Still cradling Victor
Still screaming
waiting for the final torment to end
Perhaps it never will
'  drifts off into the arctic twilight trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams echoing endlessly
Lost in the darkness and distance
stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side
The borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon
Distant slivers of lightning kiss the world
Softly: Home -  - An ocean of broken ice beneath us
The Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through a slow turn toward the open sea as we
