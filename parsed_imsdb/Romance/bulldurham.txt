The huge bat in an elegant follow-through

Too late

Walking down the runway, Joe in uniform
Number five
: behind a small table covered with objects and lit candles
baseball, an old baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar -- also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora Duncan
Clearly, the arrangement is --   -- And it glows with the candles like some religious altar
We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent

) believe in the Church of Baseball
(beat) 've tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones -- 've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and Isadora Duncan

Late afternoon light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a small dressing table

, mid 30's, touches up her face
Very pretty, knowing, outwardly confident
Words flow from her Southern lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern, National and International borders
She's cosmic

For instance -- (beat) There are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary
And -- (beat) There are 108 stitches in a baseball
(beat) When  learned that,  gave Jesus a chance
(beat) But it just didn't work out between us
The Lord laid too much guilt on me
prefer metaphysics to theology
(beat) You see, there's no guilt in baseball
and it's never boring
-- Dozens of shoes hang from the door
She chooses a pair of   , with thin straps
She sits on a bench and Which makes it like sex
(beat) There's never been a ballplayer slept with me who didn't have the best year of his career
(beat) Making love is like hitting a baseball -- you just got to relax and concentrate
-- Smoothing her hands up her calves as she does
Besides, 'd never sleep with a player hitting under
250 unless he had a lot of
's or was a great glove man up the middle
(beat) woman's got to have standards
, side by side
Like a little girl showing off her new shoes
The young players start off full of enthusiasm and energy but they don't realize that come July and August when the weather is hot it's hard to perform at your peak level
(beat) The veterans pace themselves better
They finish stronger
They're great in September
(beat) While  don't believe a woman needs a man to be fulfilled,  do confess an interest in finding the ultimate guy -- he'd have that youthful exuberance but the veteran's sense of timing
-- With fruit, an official scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick
'see there's a certain amount of "life-wisdom"  give these boys
(beat) can expand their minds
Sometimes when 've got a ballplayer alone 'll just read Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman to him
The guys are so sweet -- they always stay and listen
(beat) Of course a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay
and, ever so slightly, in her cleavage
make then feel confident
They make me feel safe
And pretty
-- She smoothes her dress along her hips
And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses
Stylish and slightly mad
What  give them lasts a life-time
What they give me lasts 142 games
Sometimes it seems like a bad trade
(quickly rebounding) But bad trades are part of baseball -- who can forget Frank Robinson or Milt Pappas, for Godsakes

: --    -- Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium carved into the center of an old Tobacco town
People are arriving on foot from all around
"Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air
--  , 60, at home plate doing his famous Bill Haley routine
comic pitcher's windup full of twists and goofy choreography
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, rock
Four o'clock, five o'clock, six o'clock rock
-- Her chair is wiped off by a young black boy, , 11, who then sits next to her
He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and friend

Friendly, eager, innocent --

Seven o'clock, eight o'clock, nine o'clock rock
we're gonna rock around the clock tonight : /
-- As Max Patkin continues his routine, players warm up, and -- ,  , 45, known merely as , short for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with his pitching coach,   late 30's, an ex-big leaguer whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges
into a slab of pink bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly together
Larry examines it as they talk -- And shoves the giant chaw into his mouth
Where's Ebby
Ain't he warning up
(cynically) No
The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it
Better find our bonus baby, eh
, , 25, stuffs a hot dog into his mouth
Seen Ebby
(mouthful of food) Nope
into the: : -- enters, shouting -- Ebby
-- Baseball uniform around the ankles, short t-shirt on top, and on top of that the head of , baseball cap on backwards
is a great looking energetic man-child with the endless confidence, naivete and horniness of youth
Life is a party
, , 20, half nude, is dressing quickly
as Skip enters
Jesus
Game starts in four minutes
(beat) Why ain't you warm
am warm
'm fining you a hundred dollars
Jesus, Ebby, this is your professional debut tonight -- you know how many guys out there'd give blood to be in your shoes an' you're leavin' your fastball in the locker room for some piece of ass
-- Outraged
Skip, It's me
'm not some quote piece of ass unquote
Oh, Millie, jeez, sorry --  didn't recognize ya
Don't take it personal but if  catch you in here again you're banned from the ballpark
You can't ban me from the ballpark 'cause Daddy donated the scoreboard and if you banned me he might take the scoreboard away
Whatta we need a scoreboard for
We haven't scored any runs all year (tough, to Ebby) Get your ass out there
As Skip starts to leave
Hey Boss,  got a question
(stops, exasperated) What
You think  need a nickname
think need a nickname
The great ones have nicknames -- somethin' like Oil Can or Catfish
Skip stares at him
He can't believe this guy
Ya got three minutes
-- And Ebby unperturbed, turns his attention back to Millie
Got time for another quickie
Jesus, you got a game to pitch
But we got three minutes
--   -- : to "Rock Around the Clock"
When the clock strikes two, three, and four and the band slows down we'll yell for more, gonna rock around the clock tonight
-- Studying the players warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his act
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great
Who's he
(reading the program) Jose Galindo
He hit
314 at Lynchburg last year
Three-fourteen
Hmmm
Look't those thighs, Jackson
-- He finishes his routine
Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight
-- : , , 30, speaks into the
mike
Let's hear it for Max Patkin -- Applause as Patkin takes his bows, leaves the field, shakes hands with a the
"The Greatest Show on Dirt" -- your own Durham Bulls
: --  , 23, black
Smoking a cigarette -- always smoking a cigarette
He snuffs out his cigarette and  onto the field with the rest of the team, as -- from the runway
Larry and Skip encourage their players running onto the field
Ebby is trying to get the zipper on his fly unstuck
He smiles broadly at Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove
'm there, Skip, 'm ready
: ,  , 50, leans into the radio mike of a very small local station
Next to him is the local ,  , 40
Between them they've seen a million minor league players come and go
Is this guy LaLoosh worth a hundred grand
hear he's a quart low
(covering the mike) He's left handed
Whattya expect
(on the air) The Bulls are off to a slow start having dropped their first three games, but hope to turn it around tonight with the professional debut of the heralded young left hander, Ebby Calvin LaLoosh
(beat) Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox is leadoff hitter Willie Foster : -- '   -- Millie has joined Annie and Jackson
Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for wisdom and insight
-- Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse
It'll just get everybody in trouble
got lured
You didn't get "lured"
Women never get lured
They're too strong and powerful for that
Now say it -- " didn't get lured and  will take responsibility for my actions"
" didn't get lured and  will take responsibility for my actions"
That's better
(to Jackson) Got the radar ready
Ready
at the plate
steps in
(
) The word on LaLoosh is that the good looking young lefty has a major league fastball but sometimes has problems with his control
and fires
The pitch sails over the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the backstop, and
: to the floor as the ball smashes into their booth
: , mumbles flatly to Larry
Little high
(shouts to ) 'mon big 'un, you're okay
'   -- She turns to Jackson
Ninety-five miles an hour
He looks great, just great
: ' , trying to calm him down
What the hell was that
Lighten up a little
Awright
(to catcher) Hey -- what's your name again -- 'm bad with names -- Ed
You want me to write it on my chest
Jesus
Sorry
Hey, Ed,  got a question
What
Who's the beef sitting behind the third base dugout
(slowly) That's Annie Savoy
Nice eh
But that's more woman than you ever dreamed of, Rook
She could kick your ass and have you for breakfast
to the plate
: back to their seats
One ball and no strikes to Willie Foster
: '     in the ribs
He crumples
: '   -- She's writing a note
She hands it to Jackson
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings
What's it say
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through
with the note
Annie turns to Millie
Well let's get down to it, honey -- how was he
Well, he fucks like he pitches
Sorta all over the place -- Hit "Rock Around the Clock" -- : '   -- Strikeouts and wild pitches
young, gifted, uncontrollable thrower
When the chimes ring five, six and seven -- We'll be right in Seventh Heaven, Gonna rock around the clock tonight
-- And decks the Bull Mascot
from Annie
a Peninsula batter
and a batter hits the dirt
End "Rock Around the Clock" and -- : -- -- Players are up, joking irreverently
Hey Lefty, hold 'em to 12 runs every night, you'll win 20 -- (he might be serious) Had 'em all the way
in front of his locker
hangs amidst his gear
The player, , 25, has a Bible and prays softly to himself
Dear Lord, thank you for being with us tonight, thank you for protecting us from injury and -- , shaking Jimmy irreverently as he prays
Wake up, wake up -- ( )    as they undress
This league is racist, man
Every time you go 0 for 4 you think the league is racist -- face it, Mick, you're an equal opportunity "out"
: '  --  tiny cubicle, a desk, phone Larry joins him with the pitching charts
Skip studies the charts
He walked eighteen
It's a league record
Struck out eighteen
League record
(beat) And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice -- also league records -- (beat) Joe, the guy's got some serious shit
--   , in street clothes, carrying his suitcases
, 30, older than the other players
And different
More than just opinions, he actually has a point of view
career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever he can get a job
Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the world without baseball
Also unlike Ebby -- he loves baseball desperately
Who're you
Crash speaks slowly, with a trace of cynicism and pride, like an old warrior who knows he's just a hired gun
am the player to be named later
Beat
Skip looks out, half dressed, from his cubicle
Crash Davis
The Crash Davis
(beat, then nonstop) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and  was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and  tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3 -- and  got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear
(remembering) Oh yeah
shoulda throwed a slider
Damn, Crash, how're ya
'm Joe Riggins
Sit down 'm too old for this shit
Why the hell am  back in "" ball
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh
(beat) The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him -- He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head
-- we had the gun on him tonight -- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five
96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97
97
(beat) He's got the best young arm 've seen in 30 years
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what  mean
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes -- (beat) We want you to mature the kid
"Mature" ain't a fuckin' verb
You go to college or what
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year
(beat) He can go all the way
And where can  go
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it
(beat) Beats hell outta working at Sears
Sears sucks, Crash,  tried it once
Sold Lady Kenmores -- it's nasty, nasty work
Even if it's the Carolina League -- this is a chance to play everyday
(angrily) You don't want a player, you want a stable pony
My Triple  contract gets bought out so  can hold the Flavor o' the Month's dick in the bus leagues
(angrily) Fuck this fucking game
fuckin' quit
-- Picks up his luggage, and turns to Skip and Larry before exiting
deep breath Who we play tomorrow
Beat
They know, they share the inability to quit the game
They're all clinging to the Church of Baseball
Winston-Salem
Batting practice at 4:30
and as he does -- Ed (the catcher) enters
You wanted to see me
Yeah, Ed, shut the door
He does
Remains standing
He can see it coming
This is the toughest job a manager has, Ed
(deep breath) But the organization has decided to make a change -- we're releasing you from your contract
-- Silent
Motionless
Empty
: -- as other players return from the shower
Crash watches as as the sports writer, Whitey, interviews him
How's it feel to get your first professional win
It feels "out there"
major rush
mean it doesn't just feel "out there" but it feels out there
Hopeless
Utterly fucking hopeless
: '  -- Loud country music in the players' hangout and pickup spot
It's full of players and lots of young women
, , 25 -- He's slick, urban, smooth
Hi, 'm Millie
'm Tony
play left field
know
at her own table
Max Patkin, looking spiffy in a turtle neck sweater and double breasted blazer, sits down next to her
Old friends
Love the game, Annie, love it (dead serious) When  die 'm gonna have my ashes sprinkled around a pitcher's mound in some ballpark somewhere -- (beat) -- and 'll have a few ashes saved for the rosin bag so 'll still be in the game after 'm gone
What a sweet idea -- another round to them
We didn't order this, honey
(she points) He did
Crash davis sitting alone in the other corner
He waves, and smiles easily
(to Max) Who's that
Hey -- that's Crash Davis
He's played in more towns than  have
Helluva guy -- real different
actually saw him read a book without pictures once Really
Kinda cute
-- He comes over to her table, greets Max as an old friend, and introduces himself
'm Crash Davis
Annie Savoy
Wanta dance
don't dance
don't trust a man who don't dance
It ain't natural
--      on the juke box
Several couples dance, and out of the pack -- -- Spinning and whirling, uninhibited and infectious
He's suddenly dancing with a different , then another, and another
,     the mad performance
Who's he dancing with
All of 'em,  think
-- The whole bar stops to watch him, applauding as he spins to a finish
quirkier "Saturday Night Fever" show
More naive, fun
He climbs off the floor and joins Annie's table
Thanks for the note -- you're right, wasn't bending my back
You got a live arm there
He extends his hand to introduce himself
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh
You need a nickname
That's what  been telling everybody
Wanta dance
She's dancing with me
Crash,  didn't think you -- 'll learn
'mon -- Just a minute, pal
The two men square off quickly
Annie mocks them
You boys gonna fight over little me
, pulling Annie with him
But -- to challenge Crash
Step outside, pal
Love to -- Oh don't be such guys -- But Crash and Ebby head outside
She turns to Max -- Hell, Max, wanta dance
: -- circle is formed
Everybody gathers
Millie clings to Tony, her guy of the moment
Crash and Ebby face off
don't believe in fighting
Pussy
Take the first shot at me
ain't hitting a man first
Hit me in the chest with this
from his jacket pocket, tosses it to Ebby
'd kill ya
From what  hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot Don't try me
Throw it
'mon, right in the chest
No way
'mon, Meat
You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh
(teasing mercilessly) 'mon, Rook -- show me that million dollar arm 'cause 'm getting a good idea about the five cent head -- -- From ten feet away, right at Crash's chest
But, alas -- in the distance
Crash never blinks
Ball four
--   , lunging at him
Who the fuck are you
-- With lightning speed, effortless
And brutal
Ebby goes down
And stays there stunned
He looks up
'm Crash Davis
Your new catcher
And you just got Lesson Number One -- "Don't think -- it can only hurt the ballclub"
(beat) Buy ya a drink
: -- to Billy Eckstein on the juke box
Millie and Tony are also on the dance floor
(on juke box) April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom, Holiday tables under the tree
-- Ebby's right eye is blackened
He holds a drink on it
We fight, she gets the clown -- how's that happen
Shut up --  like this song
(sings along) April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve
She's playing with my mind
It's a damn easy thing to play with
at the table
Well -- you boys stopped fighting yet
Are you pals now
Good
love a little macho male bonding -- think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re- channeled" but  believe in "re- channeling" so who cares, right
(beat) Shall we go to my place
Which one of us
Oh both of you, of course
-- His eyes full of fear and wonder
-- He smiles
the bar together
: '   -- -- Annie lights the candles
-- Both men look around the room with wonder
Ebby is clearly more nervous than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor league career
These are the ground rules
(beat) hook up with one guy a season -- mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring training
(beat) And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far
(beat) So
thought we should get to know each other
Why do you get to choose
Why don't get to choose
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other
It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction
There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey -- slow down
Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door
After 12 years in the minor leagues, don't tryout
Besides --  don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart
or loins
(challenging him) What do you believe in
Crash at the door
Annie's question is slightly taunting
He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion: believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap
(beat) believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,  believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter,  believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and  believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days
(breathless) Oh my
(softly) Don't leave
'night
Crash heads out into the night
Annie hurries to the-door while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered
Hey -- what's all this molecule stuff
-- Crash is on the porch
Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all want is a date
'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'
'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy
'm not interested yet
Ebby appears in the door
Who you calling a "boy"
See ya at the yard, Meat
Crash walks out into the Durham night
Ebby and Annie stand in the doorway
She speaks softly to Ebby
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me
Well shit, then, let's fuck
: '  -- -- Edith Piaf sings "Le Trois Cloches"
across the room
Wait, honey, slow down --  want to watch
She sits in a chair
Piaf sings
Ebby practically rips his shirt off, exposing a great upper body
No, no, no
Put it back on and take it off slowly
Jesus, what kinda broad are you
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch
(turning to the stereo) Shh
love this part
Piaf sings
Annie listens
Ebby re-buttons, then unbuttons his shirt
It drops, revealing his back
Oh my -- what a nice back
Ebby drops his pants
No, no, honey
first the shoes and socks
The socks
It's cold in here
(sweetly, unthreatening) You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on
Ebby considers this
Pulls his pants back up
Takes his socks off
Then his pants
Ebby honey have you ever been handcuffed in bed
: -- Deserted streets of the old tobacco town
Crash walks alone
He picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can
He stops in front of  a store window
He rolls the newspaper like a short bat
He takes a batting stance, and -- in front of the window, studying his reflection
He taken a "swing"
And another
stand in a doorway, watching
: '  -' --  handcuff is locked onto Ebby's wrist
Both his arms are outstretched -- he's getting very excited
Awright
read about stuff like this
Bring it on
Annie calmly drags a chair over and sits down
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman
Who's he play for
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars
Never heard of 'em
Annie opens a book and begins reading as Piaf sings softly
Good -- then listen
(reading) " sing the body electric
The armies of those  love engirth me and engirth them -- " We gonna fuck or what
Shh, shh
(reading) "They will not let me off till  go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them" : -- "Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous -- quivering jelly of love, white blow and delirious juice -- '  -- Intrigued, aroused, frightened
: -- is tossing wadded up balls of paper at Crash who takes beautiful, fluid swings with the rolled up newspaper
Batting practice
'  -- Studying the "pitches" with intense concentration, endlessly working on his game
: -- , ,      at home plate as a pre-game show
Larry is Diana Ross, the other three are the Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky
(  ) Baby love, oh oh, baby love,  need ya oh how  need ya, All ya do is treat me bad, Take my heart and leave me sad
: -- trying to get the players' attention
Listen up, guys, could  have your attention a minute
(a few heads turn) 'm going to be leading a daily chapel service at three in the afternoons here in the locker room and you're all invited to drop by and worship before batting practice
Jimmy, God damn it -- loosen up and get laid
, 25, smooths the creases of his uniform, preening
don't care If you think 'm square but  believe what  believe
All heads turn as: -- He looks trashed
Jesus, Ebby, what truck ran over you
(glassy eyed) Call me "Nuke"
Annie said it's my new nickname
Lots of teasing from around the clubhouse
Annie nailed you
That's great, means you're gonna have a helluva year
Does she fuck as good as they say
We didn't do it, man -- she read poetry to me all night,  swear
It's more tiring than fucking
and starts undressing
Crash sits next to him, looking straight ahead
Bobby nearby
-- of love"
hey, Crash, does that mean what  think it means
What's the deal here
Crash studies Ebby
Your shower shoes have fungus on 'em
You'll never get to the Bigs with fungus on your shower shoes
(beat) Think classy and you'll be classy
If you win 20 in the Show you can let the fungus grow back on your shower shoes and the press'll think you're colorful
(beat) Until you win twenty in the Show, however, it means you're a slob
to the field
Ebby sits silently, holding his shower shoes, taking it all in
: --    -- --
The players sit, stand, stir restlessly
combination of relaxation and intensity not visible from the stands
and helmet by the bat boy
This guy's bringing some serious smoke out there
-  throwing hard
He ain't got shit
-  -- The ritual
The bat boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the bat with great care
-- Heads to the plate
Talking to himself
You ain't getting that cheese by me, meat
-- Upright
Calm
Head still
(
) Look for the fastball up
He's gotta come with the cheese
Relax
Relax
Quick bat
Pop the clubhead
Open the hips
Relax
You're thinking too much
Get outta your fuckin' head, Crash
'  -- His eyes intensely focused
'
-- Starts his windup
(
) Get on top of the ball
Quick bat
Don't let him in your kitchen -- -- Crash strides
Curveball
Crash swings and misses, offstride
Strike one
and picks up dirt
Rubs it on his hands
He's pissed
(
) You stupid fuck, Crash
What're you swinging at a breaking ball for
Why's he starting me off with a hammer
Fuck me
(more dirt) You're okay
Stay back
Stay back, you dumb fuck
Wait
Wait
'   --
-- Lashes a line drive down the first base line
Just foul
Crash has started to first
Pulls up
Returns slowly to the plate
Picks up his bat
Throw that shit again, meat
Throw that weak ass shit
(beat) Now he's gotta try to slip the cheese by me
One and one
You're on top
Now bring me the gas -- '   -- High and tight
Right at Crash's head
The ball seems to accelerate
About to explode his skull
For a moment --
-- It just misses his head
-- Brushes himself off
This son of a bitch throws hard
(beat) Annie, Annie, Annie -- who is this Annie
(catching himself) Jesus, get outta the box you idiot, where's your head
Get the broad outta your head
to the ump
Time out
Time out
-- Motions to the bat boy for the pine tar rag
The boy brings it over
Crash re-applies it to his bat
Get a hit, Crash
Shut up
-- Talking to himself
Awright, awright
You've seen all his pitches
Two and one
Relax
Wait
Quick bat
You can hit this shit -- '  -- Digs in-again
Takes his stance
Upright
Relaxed
Ready
Shorten up
Bring the gas
Be quick -- be quick -- yeah, yeah
: -- She's writing a note quickly, and hands it to Jackson, who hurries off
: '
'   --  major league fastball
It explodes to the plate
Crash swings
And misses
Strike Three
-- Head high, no show of emotion
Almost proud
An old Warrior, not giving an inch even in defeat
-   -- Sits down and starts putting the catcher's gear back on
Deke leans over
Serious heat, eh
He ain't got shit
-- And hands it to Crash, who refuses to accept it, being busy putting his gear on
From Annie
Read it
Dear Crash
You have a lovely swing but you're pulling your hips out too early
'd be happy to meet you at the Batting Cage tomorrow to discuss it
Signed, Annie
Well if there's one chick'd know when you're pulling your hips out early, Annie's the one
Crash doesn't seem too amused
He grabs the note, and the pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout wall
He scrawls a quick note
: '   -- She's watching the players through binoculars as Jackson returns with the note
(looking through the glasses) What'd he say
Jackson looks at the note uneasily, then reads -- It says
" want to -- make
love to you
Crash"
-- Takes the note
Oh my
: -- Bat in hand
Crash a few feet away
Annie spits on her hands, wear batting glove, pumps the bat back and forth
-- Kawoosh
-- Lashes out a line drive
Crash smiles
See my hips
Yep
think Thomas Pynchon's a genius
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting
(beat) But you shouldn't think about it too much
The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain
But you were pulling your hips last night
So
Wanta make love
the next pitch
'm committed to Nuke for the season
You had your chance the other night
What'you see in that guy -- he's dim, pretty boy
young, wild
Young men are uncomplicated
(Crash mutters) And he's not "dim"
He's just inexperienced
My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues
That's my job too
another pitch
Damn
You're pulling your hips out
But they're nice hips
(beat) looked up your records -- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors
That's great
and digs in gamely
Don't tell anybody
Why not
If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ
The record's
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it
Oh no,  think it'd be great
The Sporting News should know about it
No
Please
another one
Damn
Let me
-- He takes his familiar stance
The pitch comes
Crash drills it
Your place or mine
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao- Christian ethics,  am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around -- (whack -- a line drive) Great deal
You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing -- (whack -- a line drive) So what do you really want
You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic
(whack -- a line drive) Or do you want a guy
The pitching machine arm flaps
Empty
Silence
Oh Crash
you do make speeches
Crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate
She follows
-- Twenty-five 10 year olds in uniform with a couple
#1 Hey, are you Crash Davis
Can  have a autograph
amidst 25 Little Leaguers
(as he signs autographs) Well, Annie, your place or mine
You got me all confused
batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing -- 'm not a real batter
'm a woman
Hey, when are you guys gonna start winning
You're terrible
It's a long season, boys
-- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche
Hey
(coming over) What're you guys doing here -- stealing my girl
Now, Nuke, would  do a thing like that
(to the little leaguers) Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh
It's Nuke, it's Nuke
Can  have your autograph
Etc
No prob, kids -- And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers
Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke
See you guys at the ballpark
Crash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers
: -- -- The paint's fading, a couple dings in the body, but loaded under the hood
-- Sam Cooke's "You Send Me"
watching Crash leave
: '  -- The sounds of lovemaking in a darkened room lit only by a few candles
Yes, yes, yesnmmmmyes
(beat) Oh my
(several beats) Oh, that was just fabulous, Crash
Several beats of silence
Crash
He flips on a lamp near the bed
You mean Nuke
You said "Crash"
didn't say "Crash"
said Nuke
You said "Crash"
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love
They'll say the strangest things
You said "Crash"
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name
Nuke considers this fabulous logic
Yeah maybe you're right
You see how nice things are when we go slow
Nuke sighs; and lets his head sink in the pillow
Mmm, hmmm
(beat) You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off
When  got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life
(beat) He likes baseball more than  do
You can learn to like it
wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that
'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever
Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that
God,  never thought of that
(sweetly) There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie -- now get some rest for tonight's game
Nuke rests his head on Annie's shoulder
His eyes are wide open and full of nervous energy
: -- -- In his uniform
Players warming up in the background as the ground crew prepares the field
Hello
Dad
This is Ebby
(beat) Yeah,  know,  know -- you got the Durham papers yet
Well  been a little wild
(defensively) These hitters down here are better than the ones in high school
(trying to change subject) How's Mom
Yeah
Well  am trying hard
am bending my back
you're not coming down' here to visit just yet, are you
(beat) Can  talk to Mom
: -- stand at a mike in front of home plate

As the honorable Mutt Clark drones on -- we : : -- -- Crash and Larry watch him closely, giving advice
As Nuke delivers --

Hi, 'm Millie
'm married
and rubs it on his bat
Bobby notices this
What's that
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits
You a God damn witch
Yes
switch hitting witch
Very common in Puerto Rico
Will that work for me
If you believe in Voodoo
'm 0 for 16
Gimme some of that shit
for Jose to rub with the cross
No, that is not belief
That is desperation
'mon, God damn it, gimme some
, : -- Hair and hats blowing from the chopper turbulence
five, four, three, two, one
let 'er go
One thousand big ones
above the field
The night sky fills with fluttering money     -- charge across the infield to the falling money, scooping it up wildly, brawling, shoving, clawing for the cash
As the money flutters down
: -- on the mound
hand picks it up
Puffs of rosin "smoke"
Nuke is on the mound
-- Just before the first batter
He picks up the rosin bag
Digs a slot for his lead foot to land
And  , in full gear, mask tipped up on his head
Don't try to strike everybody out
(beat) Strikeouts are boring
They're Fascist
Throw some ground balls, it's more Democratic
and we hear the beginning of Nuke's interior monologue
(
) What's this guy know, eh
If he's so great why's he been in the minors for ten years
And if he's so hot how come Annie wants me instead of him
and returns to the mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking
And listen, meat
You don't know shit
If you want to get to the Show, you'll listen to me
She only wants you 'cause she can boss you around, got it
(beat, complete tone change) Relax, have a ball out here
This game's fun, okay
Fun, God damn it
(beat) And don't squeeze the ball so tight
It's an egg
Hold it like an egg
-- And trots back to the plate
'
The first batter steps in
Crash gives the sign for the pitch
Fun
What's he know about fun
(beat) Why's he calling for a curveball wanta bring heat
Shake off the pitch
Throw what you wanta
-- Here comes Crash back out to the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch
Why you shaking me off
wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"
This guy's a first ball fastball hitter
He's looking for heat
But he ain't seen my heat -- Awright, meat, give him your heat
to behind the plate
, past the hitter
He speaks to the opposing leadoff batter
Fastball
Why's he always call me "Meat"
'm the guy driving a Porsche
--  fastball
on the pitch and sends a line shot over the right field fence
-- "Hit Cow, Win Steak" sign, The home run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump
The '
the home run, admiring the shot, enjoying the moment
instantly -- and gets very tough
What're you lookin' at
You're showing up my pitcher, bush -- get your ass in gear
-- Slightly scared
where Nuke watches the Mooing Cow and the circling batter with dismay
Crash smiles
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh
Well,  held it like an egg
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch
(beat) Having fun yet
'm having a blast
(beat) God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew  was gonna throw a fastball
He did know
How
told him
-- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate
-- Takes a deep breath
Don't think
Just throw
Don't think
Just throw
'    --  fastball
powerful, clean, overwhelming fastball
Strike one
God, that was beautiful
What'd do
--  monster
An Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh fastball
Twenty feet wide of the plate
-- The ball hits the bat rack
Bats go flying
: -- Jackson with the radar gun
Oh dear
easy honey
Ninety-five miles an hour
: -- Pacing the mound
Looks in for the sign
-- The batter lines a single to left
' Christ, Skip and Larry are talking about me
Don't get anybody warm in the pen yet
'm okay
'm having fun
-- The batter lines a single to right
'
--   start warming up
Don't yank me in the first, man
'
--   comes out to the mound to talk
Aw, shit
on the mound
Relax
Don't pull me, Skip
'll settle down
'm okay
(fatherly) Relax, Nuke, Relax
(to Crash) What kinda stuff's he got
don't know
haven't caught anything yet
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke
'm trying not to think
Good
But just 'cause you ain't s'posed to think don't mean you ain't s'posed to use your head
in a gruff, reassuring way, and returns to the dugout
Leaving Nuke and Crash
Have some fun, God damn it
-- And as he returns to the plate
: with Jackson and the radar gun
Here we go again, Jackson, hold on tight
Hit Professor Longhair rock and roll
and: : --  batter grounds out weakly
--  -- Crash lets Jose rub his bat with a chicken bone cross
Then steps to the plate and -- -- And circles the bases
--  line drive nearly undresses him
Runners circle the bases
: -- -- Naked bodies in the steamy room
No joking around
team on losing streak
in his uniform and angrily throws an armload of bats into the shower
Anybody not outta the shower in ten seconds gonna get fined a hundred bucks
One, two
in seconds
Players grab a seat, and: as he does every night
No press for five minutes, Whitey
'm doing a column on the Myth of Sisyphus as manifest in a minor league losing streak, Joe, and  thought
-- The chair crashes into a locker
Whitey hurries out
If  ever need a brain transplant 'll choose a sportswriter 'cause that way 'd be getting a brain that's never been used
couple snickers from the players
Skip whirls
What're you laughing at
Silence
The Durham Bulls sit and stand quietly
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout
You know what that makes ya (beat) Lollygaggers
What's our record, Larry
We're eight and sixteen
Eight and sixteen
How'd we ever win eight
(beat) Jose, what's this sign
of signs
Hand to face, hand to belt, hand brushes letters, etc
That's the steal
Wrong
That's the bunt
This is the steal
-- Hand to face, hands to hands
He speaks rapidly -- a private language
Face is "skin to skin"
Skin starts with ""
"" stands for steal if it follows the indicator which is hand to eye 'cause the word "indicator" starts with an "" so  figure "eye" -- (touches his eye) -- would remind you of "" for indicator to indicate that what follows is the sign
figure wrong -- You're a buncha lollygaggers
(beat) This is a simple game
(beat) ya throw the ball, ya hit the ball, ya catch the ball
-- Sitting silently
: -- '   in a cluster
Three of them have The children are crying
The long-suffering women try to calm the kids
' Bobby went hitless again
He's gonna be in a terrible mood
terrible
How'd Mickey do
' He got two hits
' Lucky you
: -- Skip is winding down
We can't win at home -- how we gonna win on the road
We got a twelve day road trip starting tomorrow
(beat) Bus leaves at six in the morning
his little office with Larry
: '  -- He and Larry open a couple beers
--   wearing only a towel
You wanted to see me
Yeah, Bobby, shut the door
(he does) This is the toughest job a manager has
(beat) But the organization has decided to make a change -- Skip,  know 'm in a slump but hit the ball hard tonight, right at 'em
couple flares drop in, and 'm back in the groove
The nearly naked 25 year old man pleads helplessly -- his career is over
: -- -- The Groupies wait in a cluster
The wives wait in another group
Bobby's wife sees Bobby
' (to child) There's Daddy
Wave to Daddy
--
-- Another player has his arm around Bobby, consoling him
The wife knows
' Oh God
: -- is parked
Luggage is loaded
Sleepy players arriving, escorted by wives and girlfriends
-- Off to the side
She pulls something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke
pair of '  , with lace and frills
want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch
What
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently -- plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters
Jesus, Annie,  don't know -- You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain
These'll help move things to the right side
Big League pitchers don't use these
They did when they were in the Carolina League
in his pocket, bewildered
small kiss from Annie, and he hurries to the bus
: -- into their travel bags
-- With a sign: "Married men deposit wedding rings here for road trips"
--  ring is dropped in, and another, and
We begin hearing Annie's  : (
) woman should never ask questions about road trips
: -- -- Wives and girlfriends head back to their apartments, leaving: -- Several blocks to her house
Men don't realize that women always know when they've been unfaithful
(beat) The fact is, upon exact moment of penetration -- the woman knows
through Durham
: - through the North Carolina landscape
This sort of spiritual awareness can be a mixed blessing, especially if you're dating a ballplayer
believe a woman oughta take care of her man so thoroughly that he can go on the road for a few days without having the desire to search out another pair of panties (self-aware) That is probably, however, my most ridiculous belief
(sigh) just hope the boys start winning soon
In some profound way  fear that a last place team is a reflection on its women
through North Carolina
: -- of the bus, doing a crossword puzzle
-- "How to Make a Million Dollars in Real Estate with No Money Down"
-- George Jones sings "He Stopped Loving Her Today"
across the aisle -- Aretha Franklin sings "------"
-- Mickey does likewise, and soon we have
&  going head to head with  &
cacophony
,  and shouts
got one word to say to you -- Shut up
Silence
And then from the back of the bus, some soft, gentle, but slightly dissonant guitar chords
-- Nuke sits across the aisle from Crash, who's re-reading Thomas Pynchon
Nuke has a guitar and is struggling with some chords to "Try a Little Tenderness"
He butchers the chords and the words
(singing softly) Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress
(in disgust) Gimme that
from Nuke
hate people who get the words wrong
It ain't "woolly" it's "weary" and it nobody's got stress, they're wearing a dress
(beat) Listen
of the song
(sings softly) Oh she may be weary, Young girls do get weary, Wearing the same old dress
back at Nuke
How come you don't like me
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game -- and that's my problem
(beat) You got a gift
What do  got
gift
When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt
Nuke looks at his left arm rubs his shoulder curiously
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away
ain't pissing nothing away -- got a Porsche already
944 with and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt -- you need a curve ball
(beat) In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball
You been in the Majors
Yep
Tony and Deke overhear this and turn around
And Crash gets wistful, lyrical, and even slightly hopeful
was in the Show for 21 days, once
(beat) It was the greatest 21 days of my life
You never touch your luggage in the show -- somebody else handles your bags
It's great
(beat) The ballparks are like cathedrals, the hotels all have room service, the women have long legs and brains -- it's a smorgasbord
The women are hot, eh
Yeah -- and so are the pitchers
They throw ungodly breaking stuff in the Show -- exploding sliders
Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement
You could be one of those guys -- but you don't give a fuck, Meat
God damn it 'm sick of you calling me "Meat"
You wanta step outside
as the bus barrels along, grabbing Nuke by the collar
Yeah, let's go
Nuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying
No
Wait a minute
Calm down, Crash
Nuke sits back down
Calms
Reaches for a baseball sitting nearby
He hands the ball to Crash
Teach me how to throw a breaking ball
Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly: As  was saying ya hold it like an egg
As the bus rolls through the country: 60'     -- Max Patkin at the wheel
He waves at the team bus and honks
The opening bars on the National Anthem -- "Oh Say Can You See" And Max roars off through the rolling green-landscape
Hit Hank Williams music to play over: : -   -- in his comic routine, now, for the Winston-Salem team, as Durham is in the field
-  lines a double off the wall

) has a phone to her ear, and writes down each play on a piece of paper, holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his "play by play"

against a jar
Thunk
The sound of ball hitting bat
He punches one of several tape cassettes cued up
crowd roars
An array of special effects is at his fingertips
(on the air) double off the wall by Higgins, and once again the Durham pitchers are unable to get the first out of the inning
-- " " Thunk -- The mallet again
(on the air) Line drive to center -- a diving stab by McFee -- ohhhh
Ball gets by his glove, another run in and the crowd loves it -- --  crowd roars
: -- The bus rolls through a small town
: -- -- Players stagger off, half asleep
(
) (on the air) Bulls will attempt to end a six game losing streak against the Greensboro Astros with Nuke LaLoosh on the hill
: -- -- He pulls the   out of his bag
Looks around the clubhouse
Nobody sees them
He's embarrassed anyway -- and stuffs them back
: -- The batter swings, and: : -- --  note is held up, "Single"-- -- The mallet strikes
(on the air) Base hit centerfield off LaLoosh
(  )  another quick note
--  rapid sequence of the mallet striking the percussive box, and: (on the air) That closes the book on LaLoosh today, 5 earned runs, 5 hits, 5 strikeouts, 5 walks, 5 wild pitches
: -- and he heads for the showers
: '  -- at the kitchen table, listening to the radio
Annie sighs
Millie consoles her
: -- -- Letting the water run over him
The voice of Teddy an the air, editorializing shamelessly
(on the air) It's time to tell it like it is, sports fans -- and this is the most wretched road trip 've seen in 20 years, and possibly the worst Durham team in half a century
(beat) Where are the great Bull players of yesteryear
Where are the Footsie Blakes, the Digger 'Dells, the Gus Palowitzes
'    road trip images: -- Changes his mind, and hides them again
rolling across North Carolina
at a drive through hamburger stand somewhere in the Smoky Mountains
Sack after sack of fast food is passed through the window to Skip
and this time, a Bus with a sign -- "Holiday on Ice" pulls in next to them
(on the air) Is the modern athlete a pale imitation of the great old warriors
Only Crash Davis stands out this year, begging the question, "What are these boys thinking about, 'cause it sure ain't baseball"
: /
-- As the players rise in the bus, Deke is trying to work up excitement about the "Holiday on Ice" bus from which twenty great looking women ice skaters are getting off
getting off the bus
Ice skaters
God
Look't em
that's what we need, y'know -- one night with some skaters and we can get back on track
We need a night off just to stop our losing streak
We need a rainout
can get us a rainout
It's 90 degrees, there ain't been a cloud in the sky in weeks
Hundred bucks says  can get us a rainout tomorrow
You're on
: -- in the dark
Late at night
The cab leaves, and the four men climb over the fence
: -- -- Several valve handles
Crash turns several handles with an iron bar, and
-- And suddenly the field is covered with the clicking of rain-bird sprinklers, throwing long slow arcs of water across the entire field
: --   -- sit on the scoreboard, watching the sprinklers flood the field
six-pack is passed around
: -- -- The Kingston stands in the muck with his ground crew
Wheelbarrows, shovels, sand is piled around
It's hopeless
God damn it
Vandals
Damn kids
We can't get it ready by game time, boss
The General Manager studies the field
Hopeless
He looks up at the sky
Cloudless, sunny
(to his assistant) Call the radio and the paper
(with disgust) The game's been rained out
Organ music -- "The Blue Danube Waltz"
: -- "  " in its matinee performance
The beautiful, leggy women skating to the "Blue Danube Waltz"

Mickey puts the finishing touches on his outfit
Several other players get ready to party

For seven bucks it better be some serious shit
What time is it, eh
When are they coming
The guys lounge around nervously, trying to be casual
: -- set down in front of Crash
Nuke hands Crash a hundred dollar bill
This is from Tony for the rainout
'mon, man, let's go to the party
Naw
"Naw"
There's ice skaters coming
You ever made love to an ice skater
By the dozen
Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies -- (beat) 'm through with one night stands
You're through with one night stands
What do you want
just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries -- and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap  truly am
Nuke just stares at him
You're weird, man --  want a ice skater real bad
Go for it
If  get laid, you won't tell Annie
won't have to
-- And hurries to the party
: -- -- Still blow drying and preening for each other
knock at the door

It's them, it's them

Annie hosts, filling their drink glasses, serving popcorn, and largely staying in the background
' Do you think your husband plays around on the road trips
' No way
Well
God
do we have to talk about that
' guess not
it's just that once asked Mickey if he was faithful to me on the road trips and he said "in his heart he was faithful"
(beat) What the hell does that mean
' It means he's unfaithful -- but only a man would put it in those words
-- Tommy's Wife lifts a baby from the couch, begins rocking It

Larry is with him
just got one word to say to everybody -- shut up

Nuke -- get everybody in here
Hundred dollar fine anybody's not here in five

Get your holy ass in Room 401
He hustles to the next door, and pounds madly

Hundred dollar fine if you're not in #401 in five
Hundred dollars

Sorry ladies

You're in last place anyway

Nuke arrives excitedly
Crash
Skip wants everybody in #401 for a team meeting
Hundred buck fine if ya don't show

Party without me
God -- what a Big League move
and hurries back
: 24   8   -- Some of the players Nuke rounded up are partially dressed
Skip spots the women
Who are you
#1 We're ice skaters
Can we go now
No
want you to hear my philosophy
It'll do you some good (beat) Here it is
This is a simple game
You throw the ball, you hit the ball, you catch the ball
You got that
#1 (frightened) Yes
Are you lovely creatures aware that you are about to compromise yourselves with a buncha bums who are -- (to Larry) -- what are we
Eight and twenty-four
Eight and twenty-four
How'd we ever win 8 games
It's a miracle
Look, guys -- 'm a man,  got needs too

(beat) There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere
(looking around) Where's Crash
-- Hands Skip the hundred dollar bill
He can't make it
Here's his fine
Aw Christ, he don't have to come
He's hitting
350
Don't you think that's a double standard -- we're here and he ain't
believe in a double standard for guys hitting
350

You wanta be roasting your nuts off for Midas Muffler welding exhaust pipes up the assholes of Cadillacs
or -- (beat) You wanta be sitting in the Caddy while some other guy's crawling around in a monkey suit with a blow torch
(beat) There's only two places you can be in life -- in the Caddy or under it
(nearly pleading) These are the best years of your lives
These are the glamor days

Helluva guy -- Silence
Crash flips off the
with the remote
Can  ask you something
What
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties
If he had a good breaking ball, 'd respect the shit outta him
Crash turns off the light
--  bit of light spill on his face
Eyes open
long ways from sleep
: -- '  -- He takes his cap off, wipes his brow
He's pitching
Everything in -
at Nuke, mocking his
'  -- Frightened
-- '   save for his cap and glove
Everyone else is clothed
in the nude
-
and as the batter cranks up to take a vicious swing -- : -- '  -- He awakes with a start
No
and shakes him
Wake up, it's okay
you're dreaming
back to consciousness
Nuke shakes his head, trying to wake up
Crash is almost tender
was playing naked
know,  know --  have that dream all the time
We're almost home
The Bus continues across the Carolina landscape

few of the players' cars are parked
Some of the wives and girlfriends
And Annie
the bus
Tired and beat

He sees Annie and waves
She's waiting next to her old Volvo

God 'm tired
What a trip  was lousy
was worse than lousy
Everytime  pitched -- it was like throwing gasoline on a fire

You only talk about yourself
Aren't you glad to see me
Don't  look nice
Sorry
You look great
'm totally exhausted
Good
Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous
(beat) Let's play catch
Catch
: '  -- Flowers and birdfeeders everywhere
And, 60 feet away in complete, oversized catcher's gear -- '  -- Nuke stares, in his street clothes, but now with a glove and ball
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe-- That's not necessary, Jackson -- (beat) Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign
He does
Jackson flashes some ridiculous signs
This in ridiculous
'm a pro
Just do what  say
Now, which nostril are you breathing through
Which nostril am  breathing through
Annie puts her hand under his nose
The right nostril
Good
My right nostril
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida"
The pingala starts with the left testicle (or left ovary of the female) and ends at the right nostril
She touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of fact manner
He stares back
The ida originates at the right testicle (or ovary) and terminates at the left nostril
'm really beat
need some serious "z's" -- The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball
(beat) And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch
Switch nostrils
Right
Okay, fire a couple in there
to Jackson
Annie's incensed
You're patronizing me
will not be patronized -- If  throw too hard 'll hurt the kid
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six
Nuke gets a little steamed
He feels his nostril, winds, and fires a medium speed fastball to Jackson
(a bit angry) How was that
little better
Gimme the God damn ball
and fires a pitch to Jackson
Alas -- -- Crashing glass
(cynically) How ya like that
Much better
Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me
(beat) This is progress
Nuke smiles and gives in
And reaches for her
give up
Let's go inside, make love, and fall asleep till it's time to go to the ballpark
She takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch
Or
(taking his hand) We could just take that sexual energy and save it for a few hours and re-channel it into your pitching tonight
(shouting) 'mon, Jackson, 've got some lemonade
Jackson runs over in full gear to join them
--  pitcher of lemonade
can't keep up with you
First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher -- now no sex is gonna do it
It's all the same thing
'      -- He points
What's that
--
-- Scrawled in larged letters on the side are the words " "
(matter of factly) That's Max
His ashes anyway
He left no kin
Nuke stares, unsettled
God
think 'm gonna be sick -- Oh don't be silly
Death is nothing to be scared of
It's just another way of living
It's just a fresh start -- kinda like spring training
Nuke thinks about this carefully
Looks at the ashes, at Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head
Death is like spring training
Yes
And so is birth
Now look me in the eyes, Nuke -- (sweetly accusing him) You haven't been wearing my panties, have you
-- Utterly bewildered
: -- over the red panties
Crash notices the panties, and snaps the waistband
Hot
Very hot
Nuke looks around nervously, continues dressing quickly
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while 'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers
She also said  should throw whatever pitches you call for
Annie's a smart lady
Suddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties
Hey, fruit alert
Check out the Rook
-- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke as the players are dressing into their uniforms
Annie says there's no such thing as straight and gay
We're all sexual creatures to start with, and we get formed into certain roles
You believe that
When 'm one and six 'll believe anything
(as they dress) Annie also says that God is a woman
You believe that, Crash, you think God's a lady
God's definitely a woman -- but she's no lady
This is all Commie bullshit
(beat) God has a dick, man
God damn it, Jimmy, you're an expert -- does God have a dick or a pussy
to answer the theological question
Ll heads wait for the answer
The Lord God is tri-une -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
Father and Son
Awright
The guys slap fives, convinced God is a man
(baiting them) Yeah, but He is a brother
Bullshit
God ain't no brother
Deke turns to Crash, full of despair
If there is a God, why am  hitting 200
to restore order
Shut up
This is a damn noisy clubhouse for a team that's lost 15 straight
Silence
Skip takes off his cap -- instantly sincere
Patkin was a tribute to baseball
and one helluva guy
: -- at a mike at home plate, singing: (singing) come to the garden alone, When the dew is still on the roses, And the voice  hear, whispering in my ear,
The Son of God discloses -- '  on the pitcher's mound, as: with the extra ashes from a box
--     "" : -- ""   on the mound
--    -- --   the rosin bag, and paces small crowd
batter steps in to hit
Nuke looks in for the sign
God, these panties feel great
That don't make me queer, right
Right
Whoo
(reads the sign) Breaking ball
-- Breaking ball for a strike
ain't queer
know  ain't
(reads the sign) Fastball
-- Fastball for a strike
: '      -- She charts pitches
Ninety-three miles an hour
He looks wonderful, Jackson
: -- He looks in for the sign
Fastball again
Why's he want the heat --  just threw heat
Don't think, Meat -- give 'em the gas
-- An eye-popping fastball
The batter swings and misses
Strike three
: --       other warily
Jesus -- what's got into Nuke
heard he's wearing women's underwear -- and he's breathing through his pingala nostril
(spitting tobacco) 'm getting too old for this game
--   hits a weak roller to third for the second out
: -- Nuke is pumped up
Paces
God, Annie's got a great ass
How come her panties fit me
That's one of the mysteries of sex  guess
--  check swing dribbler to first for the third out
And the players run into the dugout
: and sits down next to Crash, who's taking off his gear, readying to hit
was great, eh
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging -- in the Show they woulda ripped you
Can't you let me enjoy the moment
The moment's over
(rising to get a bat) If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, 'm going downtown -- in his disarming way, and grabs a bat
: Crash kneels, rubbing the bat handle with pine tar
He studies the pitcher working the first two hitters
and heads to the plate
-- Digs in
dare you to throw me the hammer -- you ain't that stupid
'
- -- The pitcher winds and delivers
And as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand-- Breaking ball -- you fool
-- Crushing a home run deep over the left field wall
: is wary about these events
Two-nothing Bulls in the second -- first time the Bulls have been ahead in weeks, eh Whitey -- (beat) Let's see if the real Nuke LaLoosh will show up -- : for another strike out
Curve ball, fast ball, curve ball
Overpowering
: in her box seat
Oh my
: -- Skip looks at Larry as if to say "What's happening
" Larry just shrugs
: -- Nuke's next pitch
-- Crash circles into foul ground to make the catch, whipping the ball around the infield
for a visit
Hey, 'm cruisin', man -- what're you doing out here
want you to throw this one at the bat rack
Why
'm finally throwin' the damn thing where  want to
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters
Trust me
You're the boss
-- Flashes a sign
: Teddy's getting worked up
-- a staggering start by LaLoosh -- he's thrown 5 cuts on 9 pitches, all of them strikes -- he's got pin point control here tonight, Bull fans
here's the pitch -- : '   --  wild ass rocket thirty feet off line
The    for cover
nervously, muttering
This guy's crazy
Yep
Next one might be at your head
Hell if  know where the damn thing's going
-- Smiles
Winds
Delivers
change up
-- Strike three
Crash whips the ball around the infield
: :  11,  0 -- -- top of the ninth, two outs, one out away from a stunning two hit shutout for LaLoosh
: -- Bearing down
Bear down, Meat, don't let up
You own these guys
Dad'll love a shutout
-- Nuke doesn't like it
No, no -- this guy's looking for heat -- lemme give him the deuce -- Cocky, full of himself
: in her box seat
Oh no -- he's shaking off the sign, Jackson
Big mistake
He'll learn
: This son of a bitch is throwing a two hit shutout and he's shaking me off
(to batter and umpire) Hey Charlie, here comes the deuce
--  hanging curveball
The batter takes an ungodly cut, and  a long home
watching the blast
until toward first with a sneer
For a moment it looks like there'll be a fight -- but the hitter backs off and takes the home run trot as: as the batter circles the bases
Crash walks to the mound
You told him  was throwing a deuce, right
Yep
He really crushed that dinger, didn't he
Musta gone 450 feet
damn
-- Says nothing
Crash puts a new ball in the glove
Returns to the plate
-- Winds
Delivers
Batter hits a weak one hopper back to the mound
Game's over
: '  --  -- raucous celebration of the victory
Booze flows
And we begin hearing the familiar sounds of Piaf
: '  --  -- -- Dressed in a long, flowing nightgown, elegant and old fashioned
She looks fabulous, to Nuke
'm yours
'know, Annie,  been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey -- Not that
mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy
(beat) Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile
Now don't go overboard,  look incredibly hot, right
She strikes a pose
She does look hot
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter
(nervously, with resolve) We better not fuck
Nuke
Just till  lose
Get over here
No
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh -- She starts toward him -- and Nuke flees
Out the door, into the night
Annie slumps in disbelief
: '  -- -- Lights a cigarette
puzzled expression -- things have got out of control
(
) Nuke was so encouraged that he took a vow to not have sex until they lost
Annie reaches over, opens a drawer in her nightstand, and pulls out her baseball glove
She cradles it fondly in her lap, puts it on, pounds it gently
(
) 'see a ballplayer on a streak considers himself touched with magic and he'll do anything to keep from breaking the spell
: -- in his locker
(
) In fact the whole team started making religious connections and everybody got hot
with a chicken bone cross
and prays alone in the corner
: -- and batting practice
(
) figured Nuke would win a couple, then lose, and things would get back to normal
""  like kids
(
) But it didn't happen like that
and for one extraordinary June and July, the Durham Bulls, for whatever perverse reason, began playing baseball with joy and verve and poetry -- in the bullpen, listening to Crash
(
) The two sides of my own brain were all jumbled up and cross-wired
while one side was being neglected, the other was in paradise watching our Bulls play like Big Leaguers
-- Slides into third
(
) We swept a four game series with Kingston, back to back doubleheaders with Winston-Salem, and kicked the holy shit out of Greensboro in a three game series
at a local mall
line of kids to meet them
banner --
(
) They were in demand all over town -- and Crash, who kept hitting dingers, was approaching the minor league record
though  told nobody
-- Another win
4  -- , , ,   dressed as the "Spirit of 176 Drum and Fife Corps" at home plate, surrounded by a Boy Scout Troop
(
) After sweeping a July 4 doubleheader, the Durham Bulls were tied for first
,  ,    for the players outside the clubhouse following a game
as the stadium empties
(
) But beautiful as the winning streak was,  was getting damn lonely
(beat) Something had to be done
needed a man
: -- The sounds of Diana Ross and the Supremes
-- , ,    as the Supremes, singing "Stop in the Name of Love" at the front of the bus
love winning, Crash, you hear me
love it
Teach me everything
It's time you started working on your interviews
What do  gotta do
Learn your cliches
Study them
Know them
They're your friends
Crash hands Nuke a small pad and pen
Write this down
(beat) "We gotta play 'em one day at a time
" Boring
Of course
That's the point
(beat) "'m just happy to be here and hope can help the ballclub
" Jesus
Write, write -- " just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out
" them down
"
Good Lord willing, things'll work out
" Yep
So how's Annie
Nuke looks up from his cliches, startled
She's getting steamed 'cause 'm still re-channeling my sexual energy -- maybe  should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down
What'ya think
You outta your mind
If you give in now you might start losing
(beat) Never fuck with a winning streak
Nuke nods seriously, listening to the master
: -- -- Wives and girlfriends are waiting
The players get off, greet their women
-- They head for her Volvo
on foot, dragging his luggage, when Millie pulls up in her car
Hi, Jimmy
Want a ride
(nervously) Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior
No
Can  give you my testimony
You can do anything you want
(a tiny grin) Hop in
They roar away
: '  -- -- He's just finished eating
Annie circles him
pot of soup on the stove
'm so proud of you and all the guys
Want some more soup
No, no, it was great
How 'bout a back rub
No, that's okay
All  need's a little nap
'll tuck you in
(nervously) You can't seduce me
'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie
and lays it an the table
What's that
She pulls back her skirt slightly, exposing her garter snaps attached to her stockings
That's my leg
know what it is
figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love
She strokes her leg
Nuke stares fearfully
Fundamentals
Sure
(beat) Unsnap my stockings
Nuke squirms, then reaches for her garter snaps
And stops
Crash once called a woman's, uh -- pussy -- y'know how the hair kinda makes a "" shape
-- Yes  do
Well -- he calls it the Bermuda Triangle
He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again
What a nasty thing to say
He didn't mean it nasty
He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do -- especially like that
Oh
(beat) Crash is a very smart man
Now c'mon, honey, give it a try
with two hands
He fumbles, groping awkwardly
Annie stops him gently
Watch
one hand -- each snap
Flick, flick, flick
Magic
The snaps open effortlessly
oh
-  , offering her leg to Nuke
Now you try
-- One handed
Awkwardly again, but -- (sighing sexually) Mmmmmmm
oh yes
-- Reacting vigorously, nervously, desperately
The soup crashes on the floor
No
You're playing with my mind
'm trying to play with your body
knew it -- you're seducing me
Of course 'm seducing you for Godsakes, and 'm doing a damn poor job of it -- (beat) Aren't  pretty
think you're real cute
Cute
hate cute
Baby ducks are cute
wanta be exotic and mysterious
You're exotic and mysterious and cute -- that's why  better leave
Nuke starts to leave
Nuke
You got things all wrong
There's no relation between sex and baseball
Ask Crash
did
What'd he say
He said if  gave in to you 'd start losing again
He did
'll be back when we lose
-- Annie just stares
: --  -- run of the mill cheap modern motel
'     -- in front of a mirror
knock at the door
Come in
the room
Crash stays with his stance
Crash
want you
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh
He's confused -- Aren't we all
Don't you think 'm pretty
Crash puts down the bat, and looks directly at her
As he does he picks up two spring loaded hand exercisers and begins pumping them an he talks
You're gorgeous, God damn it
From the moment  first saw you  knew had to have you
had to have you
want to be had
think of you and the "boy" all the time
He won't make love to me anymore
And he's right
ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak
They don't happen very often
(beat) You know how hard this game is
If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties -- then you are
(beat) And  still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit
want you desperately
Crash can hardly keep up
So he slows her down -- Who are you
Do you have a job
teach part time at the Junior College
What if  told you  was through with Nuke
He learned his lessons quickly and left me
And now you wanta teach me
don't imagine there's much  could teach you
doubt that
Crash,  get wet just thinking about you
thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy
'm ready for a complicated man
-- and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms
said when  think about you,  get wet
Annie,  think you should leave
Annie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self- awareness
She's frustrated, confused, angry and
God damn you -- what is happening
Is there no man who'll have me
(beat) This is the weirdest season  ever saw -- the Durham Bulls can't lose and  can't get laid
(softly) You okay
Annie slides against the wall down to the floor
Tears flow
Her makeup runs
Her eyes are red
(shakily) need a drink
Crash gingerly helps her to her feet
: '  -- of the empty bar
Why baseball
(sighs) was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when  was 5 -- born again before kindergarten
by the time  was 10  knew it was bullshit and at 15  ran away from home
at the most painful memories
pregnant, had an abortion, got pregnant again, had an abortion again
gave up men
Tried women
Missed men
My mother died
(beat) bought a car for $200 and drove to Ft
Lauderdale to bury her
(beat) And after we'd sung some hymns in some wretched Florida funeral home, went outside and something happened -- Her tone becomes wistful, nostalgic
The smell of cut grass in the warm March air overwhelmed me and  heard a noise -- (makes the sound)) -- tok, tok, tok -- and some men shouting
then tok, tok, tok
Crash smiles slightly
He knows
crossed the street -- it was the New York Yankees spring training field -- tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat -- and  sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother
(beat) And  saw him
Who
Thurman Munson
(beat) He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody -- it was beautiful
(beat) And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition
(beat) So  stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball
What's so great about baseball
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else -- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home
(beat) Don't you see
If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is
Silence
don't know if 'd go that far
It's true, It's true
(beat, down) Least it used to be true
It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash
It's possible
No
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60
Well
used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to
Lately 'm not so sure
Why not
(angrily) Whatta you mean "why not"
Are you gonna play forever
Before Crash can answer -- interrupts
They both turn to see: into the nearly empty bar
She leads him by the hand
Annie, Annie
There she is -- we've been looking all over for ya
Hi Crash
right up to their table
And as they hold hands
Jimmy stands there shyly
Well tell 'em, honey
(nervously) We're getting married
Displays a huge ring
Omigawd, honey, 'm so happy for you
He's a virgin
Jimmy squirms defensively
Well, yeah
(to Annie and Crash) guess that probably seems pretty corny to people like you
Oh Jimmy, honey,  think it sounds wonderful
Annie, will you be the bride's maid
: --  -- -- Nuke on the mound
-- Very high
Ball three
: -- Skip and Larry spitting tobacco
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose
Anything bothering him
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril
(spitting tobacco) Okay
: -- Very high
Ball four
to the mound
What's wrong
'm nervous -- my old man's here
-- They both look
--
'   in a special box seat
The man is 45, and is operating a home video camera taking pictures of his son
Hey, he's just your father, man -- he's as full of shit as anybody
at the mound
What the hell's going on
You breathing through the wrong fucking nostril again
Hey, you guys hear Jimmy and Millie are engaged
Wait'll  tell him she's gone down on half the Carolina League -- (threatening) Anybody says anything bad about Millie, 'll break his neck
Hey, guys,  got a game to pitch
at the mound
Don't throw anything to me -- my girlfriend put a curse on my glove
'll take the curse off the son of a bitch
Then you got to cut the head off a live rooster
Shit
from third base
Don't worry, man, this umpire's a God damn racist
-- He's black
: --    watch the growing meeting
What the hell's going on out there
It's a damn convention
Check it out
: -- Larry joins the convention
What the hell's going on out here
Nuke's scared cause his nostrils are jammed and his old man's here, we need a live rooster to take the curse off Jose's glove, and nobody knows what to get Jimmy and Millie for their wedding present -- there's a whole lotta shit we're trying to deal with -- Oh
thought there was a problem
: ' make her
The game can be heard on the radio in the b
g
You should be at the game
No, no -- 'm fine
Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed
Annie holds the dress up to Millie
Five hours
We both just know
(studying the dress) Do you think  deserve to wear white
We all deserve to wear white
to the radio to listen
line drive up the alley's gonna score at least two, here comes the relay -- : --  runner rounds third heading for home
Here comes the throw, on a line
It hits once on the infield grass, takes a long hop -- -- Crash takes the throw
-- Crash blocks the plate
cloud of dust
close play
"" -- And Crash flips out
In a second he is nose to nose with the
got him on the knee
You missed him
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate
-- Screaming face to face
Don't bump me
It was a cocksucking call
Did you call me a cocksucker
No
said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that
You missed the tag
You spit on me
didn't spit on you
You're in the wrong business, Jack -- you're Sears-Roebuck material
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you
'll run you
You want me to call you a cocksucker
Try it
Go ahead
Call me a cocksucker
Beg me
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here
Beg me again
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here
You're a cocksucker
You're outta here
out of the game
: '  -- at the radio
've never seen Crash so angry and frankly, Bull fans, he used a certain word that's a "no-no" with umpires
Crash musta called the guy a cocksucker God, he's so romantic
: the water, letting it stream across him
He raises a can of beer to his lips, drinks it slowly in the shower
As the water runs over Crash
When Crash got throwed out, the game got out of hand
(beat) Jose made three errors with his cursed mitt
--  runner scores
Nuke never quite got in the groove though he didn't pitch bad
-- Ball four
and the winning streak came to an end with a 3-2 loss
(beat) The good news was that a man was about to come calling
the bad news was -- it was the wrong guy
: ' on the stereo --  knock at the door
-- Then refuses to answer it at first
She hides in a corner
Bites her fist
' Annie
You gotta be in there -- can hear that crazy Mexican singer
Annie smiles slightly, and opens the door
We lost
It's okay
She opens the door fully
Nuke's father stands there
'd like you to meet my father
(surprised) Oh -- won't  come in
: ' -- She leads them into the kitchen
' Ebby's told me a lot about you
Uh oh
(beat) Can  offer you some coffee
--  -- She puts a pot of water with a swirl of graciousness
' Yeah
Ebby tells me you're a very spiritual woman
He tells me you've taught him a lot about discipline and self-control
Annie and Nuke exchange glances
Nuke smiles
He's a good student
' We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball -- we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman
Praise the Lord, eh
The Piaf record begins skipping in the next room
Oh my --  better fix that
Ebby will you help me
'm no good with mechanical things Nuke picks up his cue and follows her to: --  -- Annie fixes the record
couldn't dump my old man but maybe later  can sneak away from him
You don't have to
'm starting to understand what you're teaching me
mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit mean 'm getting it -- So am
Nuke, honey, we need to talk -- Nuke gets very aggressive and playful, pinning her
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here -- -- but you're father's in there
Crash says  gotta quit worrying about him -- c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do -- He pins her to the wall, she squirms away
Nuke -- we do need to talk
: Nuke's father is studying pictures on Annie's wall
--  nude woman, two afghans, and a toilet
with the inscription "Better Living Through Mexican Agriculture"
Nuke's father is a bit unsettled by all this, when: The phone rings
into the kitchen -- saved by the bell -- to answer the phone
Nuke trails
(on phone) Hello
Skip
Yeah, as a matter of fact, he is here
She hands the phone to Nuke
It's Skip, for you
( ) Yeah, Skip, it's me
(several beats) Jeez
Jeez
God
Jeez
Nuke hangs up the phone
Looks at Annie and his father
'm going to the Show
(beat) They're sending me up to finish out the season with the Big Club
'm going to the Show
'      and embraces his son
' Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this -- Oh let's not
gotta leave first thing in the morning
That's great
How can  possibly thank you
He embraces her rather formally
Just pitch well and do good
Nuke hustles his father out of the house
will,  will -- 'mon, Dad, 'll dump you off
gotta find Crash
As they exit, Nuke's father turns to Annie: ' God bless you
(to herself) She will, Mr
LaLoosh, she will
in a kitchen chair
An enormous sigh
: -- Nuke knocks on Crash's door
Nobody home
Tony is arriving with his   to the next room
Crash ain't there
He never gets back till four or five -- Where does he go
Well, 'd rather not say
They called me up to the Show and wanta tell Crash goodbye
a heartfelt "five"
Goddamn, that's great
Jesus
(beat) Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but -- (beat) Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown
To Sandy's
the whorehouse
He goes to a whorehouse every night
Don't tell him  told you -- he'd break my neck
-- Disturbed
: -- through a poor neighborhood
Stops at: -- Decades of ad hoc add-ons
That's Sandy's
Keep your extra cash In your shoes
and goes to the door
: '  -- --  small barred window opens
face appears -- a  , , 50
What'you want, kid

Who ain't
Looking for Crash Davis
Ain't here

The door opens
Nuke enters
: '  -- -- Another world

Sleazy
The Doorman leads him down a hallway full of doors enters a room with a

He doesn't look up
Crash is dressed but barefoot
cigarette dangles from his mouth as he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords
Two Hookers at the piano hum along
(singing and playing) But when she does get weary -- Try a little tenderness
-- All the Hookers rise in anticipation of a new customer
Crash keeps playing, never looking up
(singing) You know she's waiting, just anticipating, the things that she'll never possess
(beat) While she's there waiting -- Try a little tenderness
Nuke interrupts the instrumental passage: Crash
'm going to the Show
Crash Ignores him, keeps playing
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season -- Shut up
'm playing
(singing last 8 bars) Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness
(beat) But it's all so easy -- Just try a little tenderness
As Crash plays on -- 'm going to the Show
Then go
by the hair and jerks him to his feet
The two men are face to face
'm trying to thank you
Let go of me
and Crash staggers drunkenly against the piano, regaining his balance as: to break it up
He makin' trouble for you, Mr
Davis
No, no, Sandy, put it down
(drunkenly, to Nuke) Nuke, you know Sandy Grimes
Hit 367 at Louisville in 155
hit
371
He hit
371 -- 'mon, Nuke -- you and me, let's step outside and settle this
Settle what
'mon
don't wanta fight you,  wanta thank you
Let's have a drink and forget this -- God damn it, you fucking virgin prick -- step outside
Crash drunkenly heads out the back door in his underwear
Nuke reluctantly follows
: -- Several of the Hookers follow to watch
Crash is drunk and lost
Nuke in control
'mon, we got nothin' to fight about
You fuck
Why am  a fuck
Why are you a fuck
(beat) 'Cause you got talent
got brains
But you got talent
You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year
(drunken insight) All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound -- and that's for science and dog meat
You're a great catcher
Come over here into the light so can kick your ass
No
Okay, 'll kick your ass there
Crash takes a step toward Nuke
Pulls up his bare feet quickly, stepping on a sharp stone
God damn
forgot my fucking shoes
Honey, go get my shoes
One of the Hookers goes inside for his shoes
'll take you back to the hotel
(drunken, mad) You know what the difference is between hitting
250 and hitting 300
got it figured out
(beat) Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points
Okay
There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks -- you get one extra flare a week -- just one -- a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail -- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium
: -- '  -- Starts to bring them out to him when
she notices cash in one of them
The Hooker takes a few bills for herself, and continues out -- : -- Crash finishes his tirade as: ' He struggles drunkenly to put them on
Forget it
You ain't worth thanking -- -- Crash fires his one free shoe at Nuke hitting him in the back of the head
-- Comes after Crash
Come on, Meat
-- Nuke ducks it and levels Crash with a short right hand
-- Lies there on his back for several beats
Nuke stares
-- Blood trickles from his mouth
Nuke
tell me something
Did you hit me with your right or your left
My right
Silence
Crash's next line is both drunk and sober and we don't know if he's just being clever or if, somehow, he's staged It all
Maybe even he doesn't know
Good
Good
That's terrific
What
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand
Ya might get injured
(smiles) That's another lesson for ya -- now quit fucking around and help me up
-- Nuke stares back
to his feet
Ya look like shit
The two men head inside
: --   -- '  -- The Clubhouse Boy drags Nuke's out to the car and loads the trunk
Annie, Larry and a are watching
: --  -- -- Filling his travel bag
Crash sits on a stool next to him
Sober
Sorry about last night
Forget it
have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon
'you understand that
No
You will
(beat) Look, Nuke -- these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile -- don't worry about it
Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat
That's the secret
(beat) You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance
Fear and ignorance
(raging) No
Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance
(smiles calmly) know
just like to see you get all worked up
Crash calms down
Sighs
Nuke nods and picks up his bags
(knows it's not true) Well,  got Annie all warmed up for ya
(knows it is true) She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know
don't need a crazy woman in my life
Maybe you do
(quick beat) 'know 'm starting to like this game -- baseball's a helluva good way to make a living
Crash speaks with quiet passion, from his soul
It's the best, Nuke
the absolute fucking best
Yeah, thanks for everything
They shake hands, and Nuke heads out the door
Nuke -- (Nuke stops) Good luck
You too
Meat
Nuke smiles
little arrogance and fear
: -- in the Porsche and motions to Annie
They step away from the others
Well  guess this is it
(smiles) won't be needing these anymore
'   from his jacket pocket
The frilly, silk lace is tattered
The panties have been through the mill
She accepts them graciously
Neither will
think 'm ready for the Show
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh -- don't think too much
Don't worry
They look at each other awkwardly, sweetly, and: -- They hesitate, and Nuke heads for his Porsche
to watch
Nuke bids farewell to his father and climbs into his car
gotta go now, Dad
was thinking  could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you -- help you get comfortable
No
If  screw up,  wanta do it alone
'll call
We'll be praying for you
Dad -- if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me
We'll pray anyway
(kindly) If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it
gotta run -- They shake hands, and: '
--    in his Porsche, leaving a trail of dust in the Stadium parking lot
: -- '  --  formal wedding on the pitcher's mound
Millie in white
Jimmy in his uniform
Skip is the best man, also in uniform, and several players and groupies are the attendants, Annie as the Bride's Maid
Organ music plays the wedding march
'  and kisses her
The stands are full of fans
"" towards home plate
: --    -- -- Ninth inning
Durham is leading by a score of 1 to 0
Two outs
-- He delivers
The batter rockets a line drive up the alley
races from first, rounding third, trying to score
relay
-- Here comes the runner
Here comes the throw
close play
terrible collision
Crash goes rolling
The umpire waits -- and in a cloud of dust, Crash holds up the ball
-- Jimmy jumps victoriously in the air
: -- The air of victory
The mood is up and goofy
Beer cans are squirted at Jimmy, the groom
wanta thank everybody and the Lord for the victory, it's a wonderful way to celebrate my marriage -- and guess we're all back on a winning streak, he
few raucous "Fuckin 's" from the team
Hey, Jimmy -- we chipped in and kind got a little gift for ya of a special wedding cake from the Durham Bulls
-- It's -Rated
The decorative Bride and Groom are fucking
Jimmy's embarrassed but it's all good natured
: -- Toweling off, watching the innocent, vulgar fun
He sits down in front of his locker, drying his hair, when the   approaches: Hey, Crash -- Skip wants to see ya
'  -- Wearing only a towel and his shower shoes
: '  -- Skip and Larry sit in postgame routine, checking charts, smoking, half dressed
as he's still drying off
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me
Crash, shut the door
And it hits him
Crash looks at Skip, who looks down at the floor, unwilling to face Crash who then looks at Larry, who also looks away nervously
-- The party rages beyond
(heartfelt) This is the toughest job a manager has
-- He's been in the game too long to be surprised; nonetheless, he's surprised
And hurt
His stoicism is professional
The organization wants to make a change
now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher
Some kid hittin'
300 in Lynchburg
probably a bust
put in a word for you with the organization -- told 'em  thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday
Might be an opening at Salem next year -- -- His eyes are moist
Helluva year, Crash -- you know how it is
Silence
Crash stands there nearly nude
He just nods slightly
Without rancor or bitterness, he turns and re-enters the raucous locker room
: -- -- Crash stops in front of a window and takes his batting stroke, studying the reflection
: : /
-- at the end of a bar
: -- into the residential neighborhoods
Stops
Looks at the street signs
He  , walks on
: '  -- The windows glow
After midnight
-- Hesitates, then walks up the porch stairs
Knocks at the door
Moments later: -- She looks beautiful
Almost as if she was expecting him
At first, silence
Then: got released
heard already
-- Crash enters Annie's house
: '  -- her favorite Piaf record
for both of them
-- Annie closes her eyes, a tiny gasp
He kisses her forehead
She kisses his neck tiny smile from Crash
The same from Annie
on the corner of his mouth
Her hand finds the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his hair
-- They kiss slowly, deeply
As -- -- By degrees, the skirt is raised up her stocking covered leg
At last exposing the beloved    -- Crash's hand expertly holds up the skirt and effortlessly    with a minimum of effort
, ,  -- The garter snaps are free
Oh my
: -- Crash carries Annie to the bed
: '      onto the floor
: '   -- Flick, flick, flick
Crash unbuttons it with one hand in seconds
Even Annie is startled with the speed and ease of Crash's hand
: of his underwear : panties
: -- Remnants of clothes cover parts of their bodies
They tumble out of control to the floor
: '       --  carved oak antique, her hand holds on tight and shakes the dresser
: -- Makeup bottles and pictures and dozens of Annie's special things rattle and fall : '    '  -- Post coital, they lie on the floor blissfully as Piaf finishes
: to Hank Williams
: --    eat an after mid after sex snack
Crash eats a bowl of Wheaties
They each wear one of her robes
: Annie sits, munching a carrot and rolling a joint of marijuana she keeps in a Victorian jewel box
so you see in a former lifetime 'm sure that  was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia
What do you think
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous
(beat) How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo
It doesn't work like that
(stares at him) God, you're gorgeous
Want to dance
-- And fall gradually onto the table top
: lying on the kitchen table
He stretches out a leg and: to the floor
It smashes -- ceramics, milk, cereal go everywhere
As: in the glaring kitchen light
: in her living room
: -- Crash is handcuffed to the bed
He seems perfectly happy as Annie reads Walt Whitman
mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw hinges
: -- Crash reads
wrist and wrist joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger, finger-joints, finger-nail
: '   -- He thumbs through it quickly, puts on a new record
The Dominoes sing "Sixty Minute Man"
And
: -- Candlelight around the bathtub
All we can make out is two heads, two bodies, sloshing wildly In the dim glow
Water splashes, dowses some candles
: -- Each with a copy of a Thomas Pynchon novel
Crash tosses it aside
And disappears under the sheets, playing with her as she struggles to keep reading
She puts down the book
: -- Who doesn't resist, seems even amused
He kisses her deeply, slowly
She kisses him back
They fall onto the bed
: -- Dawn
bird chirps
And we hear a record skipping, repeating endlessly
-- Overturned chairs, spilled and broken cereal bowls, liquor bottles
--  disaster
Clothes scattered across the floor, overturned lamps, the bed lies at a cockeyed angle
Annie and Crash lie face down -- asleep, utterly spent
-- Reaches up and pulls his underwear off of a lampshade, pulls them on, and gets slowly out of bed
He staggers across the bedroom floor, stumbling a bit, into: -- He stumbles across the trashed room
Record album covers, more liquor bottles, pillows, cushions, pictures hanging crookedly on the wall
off the player and breathes a sigh of relief
He sees his pants lying on the floor and pulls them on
-- Pulls out a piece of paper and a pencil
He starts writing
: -- Sun streams in
Annie opens her eyes
Rubs them
Reaches over for Crash
Her hand hits a note
She whirls
He's gone
Only a note
and reads the note
(
) Crash said he had to get an early start to drive to Asheville in the South Atlantic League where he heard they might need a catcher to finish out the season
-- "Love, Crash"
: -- heading for Asheville
: -- -- Looking for work
: -- into yet another locker
: '  -- -- Down on her hands and knees, picking up the broken cereal bowl
(
) The house smelled like sex for days
It was wonderful
The only real cleaning  did was on the kitchen floor 'cause who likes to walk on spilt cereal
on the floor as she's cleaning
She picks it up, sits on the floor under the table, and lights the tiny joint
(
) The funny thing is,  stopped worrying about Nuke
Somehow  knew nothing would stop him
Crash was right -- Nuke had a gift
: () -- of an empty stadium
50,000 seats
Slick
Awesome
He's being interviewed by a , who has a small tape deck and has stuck mike in Nuke's face
(like a big leaguer) 'know, 'm just happy to be here and hope  can help the ballclub just want to give it my best shot and good Lord willing, things'll work out
gotta play 'em one day at a time, 'know
nods attentively as Nuke knowingly delivers the cliches like a veteran
: -- In sharpest contrast to the Big League stadium, a rickety old wooden grandstand, carved into the pine covered hillside
-- In a uniform we've never seen him in, of course
The Asheville Tourists
He picks up some dirt, rubs it on his hands
He's as intense as ever
Still playing for keeps
(at the plate) 'mon, Meat, throw me that weak ass shit -- c'mon, bring the heat, bring it, bring it
'
-- -      delivers a fastball right down the pipe
: '  -- -- She suddenly jerks up
(
) was reading in bed when Crash hit his 247th home run
knew the moment it happened
: -- deep into the trees
He stands at home plate watching it
like Reggie or the Babe
And doesn't move
For several seconds he indulges himself uncharacteristically -- until
toward first
Get your ass in gear
and takes the home run trot slowly
As he heads toward first,      for a brief moment, a tiny gesture of triumph
And then, routinely, he just circles the bases
as he circles the bases
: '   -- for the home run
Above the candles, displayed in the shrine, are her
(
) lit a candle for Crash's dinger
and tried to root the Durham Bulls home to a pennant
: -- in her familiar place in the stadium
Umbrellas go up all around, as: -- The players huddle-in the dugouts
Skip and Larry reading copies of "The Tantric Yoga of Sex"
And spitting tobacco
(
) The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't good enough to hold Crash's jockstrap if ya ask me, and Nuke's replacement had a fastball that  coulda hit (beat) We had a three game lead with two weeks to go when the rains came
over the mound and the plate
(
) It rained and rained and  thought of driving down to Asheville to see Crash but then  thought "No, what you pursue, eludes you"
had to trust Quantum Physics and the Church of Baseball
(beat) It ain't always easy being this religious
and walk out of the ballpark towards home
: -- -- He turns down one street, she heads toward home
: '  -- -- She stops
Looks up
Crash's beat up car in the driveway
Still raining
-- She hesitates, and smiles
Oh my
on the porch owing next to Crash
What happened
quit
Hit my dinger and hung 'em up
moment of silence over the significance of him quitting
'm quitting too
Boys, not baseball
There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring
Salem, Massachusetts
Where all the witches were
Yeah
you a witch
Not yet
It takes years of practice
He smiles slightly and takes her hand
You think  could make it to the Show as a manager
You'd be great, just great
(rattling quickly) 'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an' all -- but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it
(interrupting) Annie -- What
got a lotta time to hear your theories and  wanta hear every damn one of 'em
but right now 'm tired and  don't wanta think about baseball and  don't wanta think about Quantum Physics
don't wanta think about nothing
(beat) just wanta be
can do that, too
He rises, takes her hand, and they head inside
And as the rains fall on Durham
: '  -- -- Candles everywhere
Rain pours down on the windows outside
And
together, in silence
Walt Whitman once said -- " see great things in baseball
It's our game -- the American game (beat) He said "it will repair our losses and be a blessing to us"
(beat) You could look it up
The music -- Dave Frishberg sings "Van Lingle Mungo"
