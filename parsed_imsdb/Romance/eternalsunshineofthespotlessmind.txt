Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2003) by Charlie Kaufman
- It's grand and modern
Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched on the wall in large gold letters
An old woman enters carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages
She seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly
The young receptionist, dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up
Oh, hi
(apologetically) Hi,  was in the neighborhood and thought 'd see -- think he's in a conference
Unfortunately
'm really sorry
Would you just try him
You never know
As long as 'm here
You never know
Of course
Please have a seat
The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her lap
She stares politely straight ahead
(') (quietly into headset) It's her --  know, but couldn't you just -- Yes,  know, but --  know, but she's old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry
(to old woman) 'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now
It's a crazy time of year for us
The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the corner
Its ornaments are holograms
This book -- It's essential that people read it because -- (gravely, patting the manuscript) -- It's the truth
And only  know it
(nodding sympathetically) Maybe after the holidays then
- The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway hall
She stops to catch her breath, then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them
When she arrives at one topped by an , she slips a card in a slot
plastic molded chair drops into the archway
She sits in the chair; it rises
- The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube
The other chairs are peopled with commuters
We stay with the woman as she and the others travel over New York City in the tube
There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline
The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap
It's called: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind This serves as the movie's opening title
The other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes
Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank
- : Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls
The receptionist, Mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area
Behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files
The door opens and Clementine enters
She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt
She's decidedly funky and has blue hair
Mary looks up
May  help you
(approaching reception area) Yeah, hi,  have a one o'clock with Dr
Mierzwiak
Clementine Kruczynski
Yes, please have a seat
He'll be right with you
Clementine sits
She looks tired, maybe hungover
She picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest
- Mary pads down the hallway
She knocks on a closed door
(
) Yes
Mary opens the door, peeks in
Howard Mierzwiak, 40's, professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers
Howard, your one o'clock
(not looking up) Thanks, Mary
You can bring her in
She smiles and nods
It's clear she's in love
It's equally clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue
Mary turns to leave
(') (looking up) Mary
(turning back) Yes
Order me a pastrami for after
Cole slaw, ice tea
(nodding) Thanks
Welcome, Howard
She smiles and heads down the hall
Stan, 30's, tall, spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway
Boo
Hi
She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door
Barely seen you all morning, kiddo
He leans in to kiss her
She cranes her neck to keep him off
(reprimanding whisper) Stan
c'mon
Sorry
just -- (somewhat guiltilly) It's just
y'know
mean
know
Anyway -- Anyway, 've got to do my tap dance here
She indicates the door to the reception area
Stan nods
See you later, alligator
'kay
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you -- better do this, Stan
Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room
(') Ms
Kruczynski
(
) Hi
After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway
Mary leads her down the hall, not looking back
(professionally courteous) How are you today
Okay,  guess
(at Mierzwiak's office) Here we are
Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk
Ms
Kruczynski, please come in
Clementine enters the office
Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and closes the door, leaving them alone
- Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues
Mierzwiak sits across from her
He smiles
How are you today
Okay,  guess
(nodding sympathetically) Well, why don't you tell me what's going on
Do you mind if  turn this on
He indicates a tape recorder
don't care
He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin
(') Well, 've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend,  guess
You guess he's your boyfriend
Or you guess you're having a bad time with hm
What
No
don't like the term boyfriend
It's so gay
Mierzwiak nods
He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral throughout
(') Maybe gay isn't the right word
But, anyway, it's been rough with him
whatever the fuck he is
Heheh
My significant other
heh heh
And guess on a certain level,  want to break it off, but  feel
y'know
it's like this constant questioning and re questioning
Do  end it
Should  give it more time
'm not happy, but what do expect
Relationships require work
You know the drill
The thing that keep coming back to is, 'm not getting any younger,  want to have a baby
at some point
maybe
right
So then think  should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word --  mean, he's a good guy
It's not really settling
Then  think maybe 'm just a victim of movies, y'know
That  have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be
But then  think, no, this is what  really want, so should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it
You know
Agreed
But then  think he is a good guy and
It's complicated
'know
think  know
think we can help
Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship
Everything you can think of
Everything about him
Everything about you
And we'll take it from there
She nods, thinks
Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one -- : The platform is crowded with business commuters
Joel is among them
He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a briefcase
The platform across the tracks from him is empty
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd
He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty platform
Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that platform
Joel gets on and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station
- Joel talks on a phone
The wind howls around him
He tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks
Hi, Cindy
Joel
Listen, 'm not feeling well this morning
No
Food poisoning,  think
Sorry it took me so long to call in, but 've been vomiting
- Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase
He passes an old man with a metal detector
They nod at each other
Later: Joel looks out at the ocean
Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook
He opens it and writes with a gloved hand
January 13th, 2006
Today  skipped work and took the train out to Montauk
(thinks) It's cold
(thinks some more) The sky is gray
(thinks some more) don't know what else to say
Nothing happens
Nothing changes
saw Naomi last night
We had sex
It was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily
Like no time has passed
After two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again
guess that's good
He has no other thoughts
He glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction
She stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt
It's Clementine
He watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to
Once she passed, he watches her walk away
She stops and stares out at the ocean
Joel writes
(
) (') If 'm constitutionally incapable of making eye-contact with a woman  don't know
guess 'd better get back to Naomi
Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season
He peeks cautiously in a dark window
Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick
- It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty
Joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup
An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter
Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood
Joel glances at her bright blue hair
She picks an empty booth and sits
Joel studies her discreetly
The waitress approaches her with a coffee pot
Coffee
God, yes
You've saved my life
The waitress pours the coffee
You know what you want yet
(laughing) Ain't that the question of the century
The waitress is not amused
(') You got grilled cheese and tomato soup
Yeah
We're having a run on it
The waitress heads to the grill
Clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up
(calling) And some cream, please
Clementine looks around the place
Her eyes meet Joel's before he is able to look away
She smiles vaguely
He looks embarrassed, then down at his journal
Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read
Joel glances up, tries to see the cover
It's blue
He can't read the title
- Joel stares out at the ocean
Far down the beach Clementine stares at it, too
Joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean
- Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train
Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends
He waves back, embarrassed
She takes a seat on a bench far down the platform
Joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness
- Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain
After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters
Joel looks up
Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit
She settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car
Joel looks out the window
He feels her watching him
The train is picking up speed
Finally: (calling over the rumble) Hi
Joel looks over
'm sorry
Why
Why what
Why are you sorry
just said hi
No,  didn't know if you were talking to me, so
She looks around the empty car
Really
(embarrassed) Well,  didn't want to assume
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously
Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car
Anyway
Sorry
Hi
Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel
It's okay if  sit closer
So  don't have to scream
Not that  don't need to scream sometimes, believe me
(pause) But  don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something
No,  mean,  don't know
can't really think of much to say probably
Oh
So
She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from
mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here
didn't mean to -- No,  don't want to bug you if you're trying to -- It's okay, really
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe
have a long trip ahead of me
(sits across aisle from Joel) How far are you going
On the train, mean, of course
Rockville Center
Get out
Me too
What are the odds
The weirder part is  think actually recognize you
thought that earlier in the diner
That's why  was looking at you
You work at Borders, right
Ucch, really
You're kidding
God
Bizarre small world, huh
Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now
Really
Because -- Jesus, is it five years
gotta quit right now
-- because  go there all the time don't think  ever saw you before
Well, 'm there
hide in the back as much as is humanly possible
You have a cell phone
need to quit right this minute
'll call in dead
don't have one
'll go on the dole
Like my daddy before me
noticed your hair
guess it made an impression on me, that's why  was pretty sure  recognized you
Ah, the hair
(pulls a strand in front of her eyes, studies it) Blue, right
It's called Blue Ruin
The color
Snappy name, huh
like it
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering
Yeah
Tom Waits says it in -- Exactly
Tom Waits
Which song
can't remember
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution
That'd be a job, coming up with those names
How do you get a job like that
That's what 'll do
Fuck the dole
don't really know how -- Purple Haze, Pink Eraser
You think that could possibly be a full time job
How many hair colors could there be
(pissy) Someone's got that job
(excited) Agent Orange
came up with that one
Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and 'd be great at it
'm sure you would
My writing career
Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski
(thought) The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs
You sure
That doesn't sound -- think
Anyway, 've tried all their colors
More than once
'm getting too old for this
But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality
apply my personality in a paste
You
Oh,  doubt that's the case
Well, you don't know me, so
you don't know, do you
Sorry
was just trying to be nice
Yeah,  got it
There's a silence
(') My name's Clementine, by the way
'm Joel
No jokes about my name
Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice
don't know any jokes about your name
Huckleberry Hound
don't know what that means
Huckleberry Hound
What, are you nuts
'm nut nuts
(singing) Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine
No
Sorry
It's a pretty name, though
It means "merciful", right
(impressed) Yeah
Although it hardly fits
'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told
See,  wouldn't think that about you
(pissy) Why wouldn't you think that about me
Oh
don't know
was just
don't know
was
You seemed nice, so -- Now 'm nice
Don't you know any other adjectives
There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative
mumpish
Well, anyway
Sorry
They sit in silence for a while
just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be
The conductor enters the car
Tickets
Joel hands the conductor his ticket
The conductor punches it and hands it back
What is nice, anyway
mean, besides an adjective
guess it can be an adverb, sort of
The conductor turns to Clementine
She fishes in her bag
(') It doesn't reveal anything
Nice is pandering
Cowardly
(') And life is more interesting than that
Or should be
Jesus God,  hope it is
someday
(to conductor) know it's here
The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated
(') don't need nice
don't need myself to be it and  don't need anyone else to be it at me
Okay
Shit
Shit
know it's here
Hold on
She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through
Joel sees the book she was reading in the diner
It's The Play by Stephen Dixon
(') Damn it
(there it is) Oh
Here
She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly
He punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away
Next stop Southampton
The conductor heads into the next car
Clementine shoves stuff back into her purse
Her hands are a little shaky
She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket, opens it, and downs it
Joel is watching all of this but pretending not to
She looks out the window for a while
The train pulls into the station
The doors open
Nobody gets on
The doors close
The train pulls out
Joel
It's Joel, right
Yes
'm sorry
yelled at you
Was it yelling
can't really tell
Whatever, 'm a little out of sorts today
That's okay
(stares out window) My embarrassing admission is  really like that you're nice
Right now, anyway
can't tell from one moment to the next what 'm going to like
But right now 'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me
That was nice of you
It's no problem
Anyway,  have some stuff  need to -- Oh, okay
Well, sure, 'll just
(stands, throws bag over shoulder) Take care, then
(pulling journal from briefcase) Probably see you at the book store
(heading toward other end of car) Unless  get that hair-color-naming job
Clementine sits and stares out the window
- There are a few more people in the car now
Clementine has inched a few seats closer to Joel
She watches him
His head is immersed in his journal
- It's dark out
The train is pretty crowded
Joel stares out the window
Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him
- The doors open and Joel emerges along with others
He heads to the parking lot, arrives at the car
There's a big dented scrape along the driver's side
He gets in
- Joel drives
He passes Clementine walking
She looks cold
He considers, slows, rolls down his window
Hi
could give you a ride if you need
No, that's okay
Thanks, though
You're sure
It's cold
don't want to take you out of your way
It's okay
Yeah
He pulls over
She climbs in
They drive
Where do you live
You're not a stalker or anything, right
Well,  probably wouldn't say if  were, but no
You can't be too careful
've been stalked
've been told 'm highly stalkable
don't need that
'm not a stalker
(beat) You know Wilmont
Yeah
Wilmont
Near the high school
Joel turns
They drive in silence
(') Look, 'm very sorry  came off sort of nutso
'm not really
It's okay
didn't think you were
There's a silence
So you like bookstores, huh
like to read
Me too
It is Rain Dogs, by the way
Yeah
can't remember that album very well
remember liking it
But -- The song's 9th and Hennepin
spent most of the train ride trying to remember
"Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen
"  Remember
Sort of, um
Remember
"And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And 'm lost in the window/ hide on the stairway/ hang in the curtain/ sleep in your hat
" (starts to cry) Oh, shit
'm so stupid
Sorry
What
'm just a bit of a wreck
" sleep in your hat" makes me cry
(pointing to a house) Me
Joel pulls over
(') Thanks very much
That was very nice of you
Well,  wouldn't want to be -- Oh, geez, 'm full of shit
already told you that
(pause) Anyway
See Ya
Clementine opens the car door
Take care
(turning back) Hey, do you want to have a drink
have lots of drinks
And  could -- Um -- Never mind
Sorry, that was stupid
'm embarrassed
Good night, Joel
'  - Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously
He tries to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings
He looks at the books on her shelves
Clementine is in the kitchen
We see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing drinks and chatting
Thanks
like it, too
Been here about four years
It's really cheap
My downstairs neighbor is old so she's quiet, which is great
And the landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but great, and  have a little porch in the back, which is great, because  can read there, and listen to my crickets and
Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics
(') Two blue ruins
Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of crows flying
(') You like that
Very much
This
someone gave that to me, just like, recently
like it, too
like crows
think  used to be a crow
She caws and hands Joel a drink
Thanks
That was good, that crow sound
Do you believe in that stuff
Reincarnation
don't know
Me neither
Oh, there's an inscription on the back
(takes it off the wall, reads:) The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/ change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day  rued
Frost
(impressed) Yeah
'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch
His stuff seems strictly grade school to me
But this made me cry for some reason
Maybe because it is grade school
'know
It's pretty
miss grade school
don't know why 'm calling it grade school all of a sudden
When  went we called it elementary school
But  like grade school better
Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it
'd like to be from then
Everyone wore hats
Anyway, cheers
Cheers
They click glasses
Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp of her drink
Joel sips
She plops down on the couch and pulls her boots off
God, that feels so fucking good
Take yours off
'm fine
Yeah
Well, have a seat, anyway
Joel sits in a chair across the room
Clementine finishes her drink
(') Ready for another
No, 'm okay for now
She heads toward the kitchen with her glass
Well, 'm ready
Put some music on
Joel crosses to the 's and studies them
What do you want to hear
(
) You pick it
You just say
'm not really -- (
) don't know
can't see them from here, Joel
Just pick something good
Joel studies the unfamiliar 's
He picks up Bang On a Can performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at
Clementine reenters with her drink
(') Oh, excellent choice
She grabs it and sticks it in the  player
The music is dreamy and haunting and slow
Clementine falls back onto the couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink
(') Mmmmmmm
Way to go, Joel
You pick good
Joel sits down in his chair and drinks
There's a silence, which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious
Well,  should probably get going
No, stay
Just for a little while
(opens her eyes, brightly) Refill
No
-- know a man who needs a refill
She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the kitchen
(') (
) (') God bless alcohol, is what  say
Where would  be without it
Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, maybe  don't want to think about that
She giggles
Joel looks around the room again
There are several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher potato, a housewife potato
Clementine returns with Joel's drink and a refill for herself
Thanks
Drink up, young man
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant
Joel looks a little alarmed
(') 'm just kidding
'mon
She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes
Joel watches her, looks at her breasts
She opens her eyes, smiles drunkenly at him
(') 'know, 'm sort of psychic
Yeah
Well,  go to a psychic and she's always telling me 'm psychic
She should know
Do you believe in that stuff
don't know
Me neither
But sometimes  have premonitions, so,  don't know
Maybe that's just coincidence
Right
'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it
'know
Yeah,  don't know
It's hard to know
Exactly
Exactly
That's exactly my feeling about it
It's hard to know
Like, okay, but how many times do  think something and it doesn't happen
That's what you're saying, right
You forget about those times
Right
Yeah,  guess
(dreamy beat) But  think  am
like to think  am
(') It's helpful to think there's some order to things
You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you
Sorry
My life isn't that interesting
go to work
go home
don't know what to say
Oh
(considers this) Does that make you sad
Or anxious
'm always anxious thinking 'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know
Taking advantage of every possibility
Just making sure that 'm not wasting one second of the little time  have
think about that
She looks at him really hard for a long moment
Joel tries to hold her gaze, but can't
He looks down at his drink
Clementine starts to cry again
You're really nice
'm sorry  yelled at you before about it
God, 'm an idiot
do have a tendency to use that word too much
like you
That's the thing about my psychic thing
think that's my greatest psychic power, that  get a sense about people
My problem is never trust it
But  get it
And with you  get that you're a really good guy
Thanks
And, anyway, you sell yourself short can tell
There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain
can tell
My goal
can  tell you my goal
Yeah
(ala Paul Simon) What's the goal, Joel
(laughs) My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me
Do you know what  mean
It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and  think we're all taught we should be consistent
'know
You love someone -- that's it
Forever
You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do
It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through
And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing
You know
Yeah
think so
It's hard to -- Like  wanted to talk to you
didn't need any more reason to do it
Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist
Yeah
You're very nice
God,  have to stop saying that
You're nervous around me, huh
No
'm nervous
You don't need to be nervous around me, though
like you
Do you think 'm repulsively fat
No, not at all
don't either
used to
But 'm through with that
'know, if  don't love my body, then 'm just lost
You know
(') With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend
(beat) So, 've been seeing this guy
Joel looks slightly crestfallen
(') (off his reaction) Well, for the last week, anyway
He's kind of a kid
Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering
Who wouldn't like that
And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart
He's the one who gave me that crow photograph
Oh, yeah
That made me cry
But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because  had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River
It gets frozen this time of year
That's scary sounding
Exactly
used to do it in college and had this urge to go do it again, so got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but  was really disappointment to be there with him
'know
And that's where psychic stuff comes in
Like, it just isn't right with him
'know
think so
don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but
he says so many great things
We like the same writers
This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to
And he's cute
It's fucked up
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime
Okay
Yeah
Oh, great
She sits closer to him
(') 'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and -- (shy) Sounds good
But right now  should go
(pause) You should stay
have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so
(beat) Okay
Joel puts on his overcoat
Clementine heads to the phone table, pulls out a notepad
(') would like you to call me
Would you do that
would like that
Yes
She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him
He puts it in his pocket
He stands there uncomfortably for a moment, then forces himself to speak
(') don't think your personality comes out of a tube
think the hair is just
a pretty topping
She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek
He's surprised and pleased and nervous
(') (shyly formal) So,  enjoyed meeting you
You'll call me, right
Yeah
When
Tomorrow
Tonight
Just to test out the phone lines and all
Okay
We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through the snow and getting in his car
'  - Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center neighborhood
There is no snow on the ground
He seems different, somehow foggy and disoriented
: He arrives at his apartment building and parks
'   - Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the street
There are two dark figures inside
- Them
He hurries inside the building
'  - Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the lights, crosses to look furtively out the window
It's snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight
It was snowing
- There are two of them
Couldn't make them out
The orange glow of a cigarette
Joel squints to see inside the van
Two dark figures talk
One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior
The figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel
The driver waved
So casual, friendly
- 'm like a joke to them
Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched
- guess they figure they can act like they want
They don't have to worry about me remembering
He paces, mulling things over
As he does, the scene starts to change, almost as if it is drying out
might be making a mistake
- Maybe 'm making a mistake
Maybe  just need to learn to live with this
First of all, 'll get over it
Secondly, it happened
Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it
Who said that
Churchill
'm not sure
But  don't care
She did it to me have to rid myself of this
Fuck her
Fuck you, Clementine
The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague
Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his emotional intensity becoming diffused
Joel does not seem aware of this
He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm
He looks at it
It's pink
There's some illegible initials stamped on it
(') Pink
(beat) There was a number on it
remember
1718
(beat) have to follow through with this have no choice
- The pill was pink,  remember
It had some letters and numbers on it
What were they
1718
something
Four digits
don't like taking pills when don't know what they are
have no choice
He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging
He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone
(') We're sorry, the number you have dialed
(beat) Screw you, Clementine, for doing this
We're sorry, the number you have dialed is no longer in service
If you think you have reached this recording in error (') Bye
Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed
By now the scene is lifeless, almost a husk
He hears the apartment building door open
He hears footsteps
(') It's them
- It's too late
His eyelids are getting heavy
He closes his eyes
He hears a key in his apartment door
(') Fuck
- Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop
It's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally
Joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind
He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches Clementine stack books on shelves
Her hair is bright orange now
should maybe talk to you
- Clementine
should just maybe talk to her
Joel rises and heads toward Clementine
love you and if you knew that
if told you what happened
'll explain everything, what we meant to each other
'll tell you everything about our time together
You'll know everything again and
- Maybe if  just explain what happened, wouldn't have to go through this and could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and
Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man approaches Clementine
Joel stops, watches
The young man seems out of breath
He glances over at Joel, then taps Clementine on the shoulder
She turns, annoyed, sees who it is and her face lights up
Clementine
- That's your look for me
Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the ribs
just thought 'd say hi
was in the neighborhood
You were not
was not
Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity
As he stands there, the scene starts to dry out
Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines
The bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy
Come over after 'm done here
can't
want to, but  have to study
You rat
really want to, but tonight's important
Test tomorrow
How could she have done this to me
How could anyone do this to anyone
(to Patrick) You didn't say anything about my hair
It's so cool
You're by far the most sensational person in the room
In the room
In the world
Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd
What's happening here
(looks at watch; it's 9:30) Oh, God
have to go home
They'll be there soon
Joel turns to leave
'  - Joel drives fast, recklessly
The intensity is back
He's weeping as he drives
Gotta get home
How could she do this to me
How could she not care about what we meant to each other
What a fuck
What a fucking monster she is
- Oh, God
miss her
can't believe she's with that guy now
'm never going to see her again
love her so much
What a fucking monster she is
The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment building, and gets out of the car
Joel spots the parked van
We've seen this before, but it's dried out now
Them
- Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff
He's been crying
He looks behind him and finds himself looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on the snowy street
He turns back to the New York Street and spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue
- Joel sits in the small room with his bags
woman across from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap
Her eyes are red from crying
Mary, the receptionist, pokes her head through her window into the waiting room
Hello again, Mr
Barish
Good, you've got your stuff
- Joel walks with his bags behind Mary
(not looking back) How are you today
(at lab) Here we are
- Joel enters
Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab coat
Ah, Mr
Barish
This is Stan
He'll be in charge of your procedure tonight
Stan nods professionally
Mr
Barish
How exactly is this going to work tonight
As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade, Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry and monotonous
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process --  By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared
Like a dream upon waking
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking
Nothing you'll miss
Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment
Suddenly he gets it
It's happening now
'm already in my brain
Mierzwiak looks at the fading room
Yes,  suppose you are
(back in his faded memory persona) So, let's get started -- If we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do
Joel is sitting in a chair
Electrodes connect him to some electronic machinery monitored by Stan
Mierzwiak watches from the corner
We use the articles you brought to create a map of Clementine in your brain
Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase
But you're tracing and erasing now
It's already started
'm home in my bed
Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to Joel
The equipment registers Joel's reaction
Very good
Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl
Joel studies it
The machines register his response
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home
Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine printed on it
Joel looks at the cup
The machines record his reaction
Good
We're getting healthy read-outs
The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy
' Patrick, do me a favor -- Joel is watching Stan
Stan is not speaking, yet his voice continues
'  (') -- and check the voltage levels, 'm not wiping as clean as  would like here
Joel looks up
Stan's voice seems to be coming from above
'  - Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas
His eyes are closed and electrodes connect his head to several machines
The machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the lines
Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines
The voltage looks fine
Then check the connections
Patrick fiddles with some jacks
Does that help
Yeah, that looks better
Thanks
- The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat
Stan pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages
Mierzwiak smiles
Ah, your journal
This will be invaluable
(reading) December 15th, 2004
met someone tonight
Oh, Christ:   don't know what to do
Her name is Clementine and she's amazing
So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive
Things with Naomi and  have been stagnant for so long
The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on
' think we got this one
Let's push on
Joel looks up at the ceiling
'  - Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with Clementine
There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left there, some 's
He pulls a big clump of pages out of his loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag
He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes: December 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today
stayed home
Naomi worked on her dissertation
The scene is fading as he continues to write
- Joel looks for an office number
He finds it
The plaque on the door reads Lacuna Ltd
Joel enters
- Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room
Mary sits in the reception area
May  help you
My name is Joel Barish
have an appointment
Please have a seat
Dr
Mierzwiak will be right with you
- Mary leads Joel down the hall
(without turning) How are you today
Not great
(at Mierzwiak's office) Here we are
Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak
'  - Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area
Joel looks at the tape recorder
'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards
You never should have
Well
did
We can help you through this
Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine
(thinks, then:) It was a mess
don't know how it got this way
' It's kind of a dump, don't you think
Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice
'  - Patrick is checking out the apartment
Stan monitors the equipment
(uninterested) It's an apartment
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain
Uninspired
And there's a stale smell
Sort of stuffy
don't know
Stuffy
Patrick, let's just get through this
We have a long night ahead of us
Yeah
Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a moment
He glances at the unconscious Joel
(') So who do you think is better-looking, me or this guy
Stan glances sideways at Patrick
'  - Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area
So we'll need you to go home and bring in everything you ever received from Clementine and anything that might remind you of her
The scene is faded and disappearing fast
It's gone
'  - Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist
So then she just stops calling
- wasn't going to call her
Not after the way she was
Any messages, Carmen
Carmen the receptionist shakes her head
Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist
(') Any messages for me, Carmen
Nothing, Joel
- It's bullshit
She's punishing me for being honest with her
Joel is at his office desk on the phone
You have no messages
'  - Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages
'  - Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in conversation with someone else
Sorry, Carmen
Any messages
Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation
'  - Joel checks his machine: zero messages
- That's it
'm just gonna-- Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone
- (') 'm gonna tell her 'm through playing games and -- The number you have dialed has been disconnected
Joel's eyes bug
'   - Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's
Why would she do that
-- If you think you have reached this recording in error, please check your number and dial again
don't know, honey
It's horrible
She's punishing me for being honest should just go to her house
don't think you should go there, Joel
Yeah,  don't want to seem desperate
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on
Just make a clean break
don't know
'm so
can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature
Joel, look, the thing is -- (agitated, interrupting) Joel, honey
We have to feed the dog
Would you just wait here
Just a second
Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and close the door behind them
Joel hears a hushed argument ensue in the hall
He notices the dog asleep on the floor
He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another subscription card falls to the floor
He picks it up and is about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not a subscription card at all
It reads: Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her memory
Please never mention their relationship to her again
Thank you
Lacuna Ltd
610 11th Avenue, , Joel stares at the card, incredulous
Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room
(') You weren't supposed to see that
They can't erase memories
It's a joke
It's a nasty Clementine hoax
Sweetie, we called the company
Joel just stands there
Close-up of a vague dictionary page
- Lacuna:  Noun
blank, a missing portion, especially in a manuscript
'  - Joel is on the phone pacing
' You can't tell her, Joel
They explained that
Like waking a sleepwalker
It might have a devastating effect
'  - Joel drives past vague local landmark
' Think about it: to be told you lived an existence of which you have no recollection
' But what am  supposed to do
' Move on, sweetie
' How can
How can  move on when  know 'm the only one to carry this love we had
How do  do that
- Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in movie closed for the season
He weeps
The windows fog up until the outside is completely obscured
- Joel looks for an address
- Joel gets off on the sixth floor
He searches for a room number
As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is faded, vague and mostly erased
He keeps walking, comes to the door marked Lacuna and opens it
Inside he can see vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist
(dead monotone) Hi, May  help you
These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself and hear what's going on in his bedroom
' So, Mary's coming over tonight
Joel looks up
'  - Stan works the joystick
Patrick sits on the bed with Joel
Yeah
Just wanted to let you know
like Mary
like when she comes to visit
just don't think she likes me
She likes you okay
wonder if  should invite my girlfriend over, too
have a girlfriend now
You can if you want
Did  tell you  have a new girlfriend
(re: memory on monitor) This one's history
Moving on
The thing is
my situation is a little weird
My girlfriend situation
Patrick, we need to focus
Stan aims the joystick
'  - Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back to the book
The door opens
He looks up
Clementine is staggering in, drunk
Yo ho ho
It's three
- Shit
The last time  saw you
(') Anyhoo, sweetie,  done a bad thing kinda sorta wrecked your car
can't believe you wrecked my car
You're driving drunk
It's pathetic
a little
was a little tipsy
Don't call me pathetic
Well it is pathetic
And fucking irresponsible
You could've killed somebody
The scene is starting to degrade
The acting becomes anemic
(') don't know, maybe you did kill somebody
Oh Christ  didn't kill anybody
It's just a fucking dent
You're like some old lady or something
- Right
She called me an old lady here, too
And  remember,  said
(') And what are you like
wino
wino
Jesus, Are you from the fifties
wino
(laughs) Face it, Joel
You're freaked out because  was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight
No, see, Clem,  assume you fucked someone tonight
Isn't that how you get people to like you
This shuts Clementine up
She is stung and she starts gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the apartment
Joel is immediately sorry he said this
He follows her around
(') 'm sorry
Okay
didn't mean that just
was just
pissed,  guess
Clementine is out the door
Joel follows
- Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping off in the distance
'  - Joel drives to catch up with Clementine
He rolls down his window to talk to her
Let me drive you home
(without turning) Fuck you, Joel
Faggot
Look at it out here
It's falling apart
'm erasing you
And 'm happy
She keeps clomping
(') You did it to me
can't believe you did this to me
By morning you'll be gone
Ha
He stops the car, gets out
- It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail there is obscured in darkness
Joel wanders it
In the distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop, she doesn't get any farther away
It's lonely
' See, remember that girl
The one we did last week
The one with the potatoes
Joel looks up, startled
' Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend
Was
'  - Stan watches the screen
Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at the unconscious Joel
gotta tell you something
kind of fell in love with her last night
She was unconscious, Patrick
She was beautiful
So sweet and funky and voluptuous
kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what
Jesus, Patrick
- On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan
' know
It's not like
mean, they were clean and all
' Look, just don't tell me this stuff don't want to know this shit
' Yeah, okay
' We have work to do
There's a click and Joel finds himself in -- '  - Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the
It's hard to make out what they're watching
They sit on opposite ends of the couch
They look bored
The scene quickly degenerates
The room fades
' Okay, but there's more
Joel listens
'  (') After we did her,  went to where she worked and  asked her out
Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch
She stares straight ahead at the
' Patrick
do you know how unethical
That must be the guy  saw you with
- In the bookstore that night
The skinny guy
There's a click and Joel finds himself in -- '  - Joel watches
Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks at the
She slips into a skirt
How can you watch this crap
Where are you going
'm fucking crawling out of my skin
The scene starts to fade
Clementine puts on her shoes and heads out the door
- Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily
They barely look at the animals
Clementine watches parents with babies
Oh shit
remember this
(to Clementine) Want to go
(pissy) want to have a baby
Let's talk about it later
No
want to have a baby
have to have a baby
don't think we're ready
You're not ready
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid
She turns violently toward him, glaring
What
(mumbly) don't want to talk about this here
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it
Joel looks around
People are watching
(') You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it
Clem, 'm sorry
shouldn't have -- (screaming now) 'd make a fucking good mother
love children
'm creative and smart and 'd make a fucking good mother
The scene starts to fade
Clementine's rant continues but becomes attenuated and vague
Oh, thank God
It's going
It's you
It's you who can't commit to anything
You have no idea how lucky you are 'm interested in you
don't even know why  am
should just end it right here, Joel
Leave you in the zoo
Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with
She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real emotion in it
The scene is a husk
It's going, Clementine
All the crap and hurt and disappointment
It's all being wiped away
She looks up at him
'm glad
Their eyes lock
She is fading before his eyes
Me, too
- It's noisy and crowded
Joel and Clementine sit at a small table
She is drunk and staring off, blankly
So, um -- (swiveling head toward him) Would you get me another, Joely
Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar
(') Thanky
Thanky
Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention
Joel is paying the bartender
He turns with the drink to head back to the table
He sees Clementine flirting with a man in Joel's seat
Joel is at the table
Clementine looks from her conversation
(') Joel, this is Mark
He likes my boobs
He came over special to tell me that
Isn't that nice
He doesn't think 'm fat
The scene starts to fade
Mark rises
didn't know she was with someone, man
'okay, Mark
Joel doesn't like my boobs
(stage whisper) don't think he likes girls
The bar gets quiet and vague
You're drunk
You're a whiz kid
So perceptive, so -- Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible words, just a whisper -- like a breeze
doorbell buzzes
Joel looks up
'  - Patrick opens the door
Mary stands there in a winter coat, carrying a backpack
(coolly) Oh, hey, Patrick
Hi, Mary
How's it going
She walks past him
Hey, you
Stan and Mary kiss
She looks down at Joel as she takes off her coat
It's freezing out
You found us okay
Yeah
(re: Joel) Poor guy
(looking around) Have anything to drink
We haven't checked
Well, allow me to do the honors
It's fucking freezing and  need something
She heads into the kitchen
Stan turns back to monitor the slivers of light
Mary hates me
've never been popular with the ladies
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties
(guilty beat) Okay, There's more, Stan -- Stan looks over at Patrick
Mary returns with a bottle of scotch and two glasses
Hey, hey
She pours the whiskey
(') Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you
Nah,  don't know
Mary hands a glass to Stan
She holds hers up in a toast
Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders
Mary and Stan click glasses
(') Nietzsche
Beyond Good and Evil
Found it my Bartletts
That's a good one
Yeah,  can't wait to tell Howard
It seems really appropriate
(a little sulky) It's a good one all right
What's your bartlett's
It's a quote book
love quotes
So did Winston Churchill
He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's
Isn't that trippy
(trying to engage) Yeah
Cool
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts
" Very cool
Trippy
like to read what smart people say
So many beautiful, important things
Yup
Don't you think Howard's like that
Smart
Important
(beat) Yup
Definitely
think he'll be in Bartlett's one day
Stan focuses on the monitor
Mary pours herself another drink
Definitely
'  - It's dark
Joel and Clementine are in bed
The memory is already in the midst of being erased
Clementine is talking in a monotonous, robotic manner
You don't tell me things, Joel
'm an open book
tell you everything
Every damn embarrassing thing
You don't trust me
No, it isn't that
want to know you
just don't have anything very interesting about my life
Joel, you're a liar
The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there for a moment, registering Clementine's statement
- Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence
Joel looks around at other couples in the restaurant
Some seem happy and engaged
Others seem bored with each other
He turns back to his food
How's the chicken
- Is that like us
Are we just bored with each other
Good
He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself another glass
She holds the wine bottle up to Joel
(') More
No
Thanks
There's a silence
How's the fish
The scene is fading
It's good
They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves
' Hi, Clementine
-- Why, what's wrong
-- Oh, 'm sorry
-- Well, 'm not sure, kind of have to study for my test -- '  - Patrick is on the phone next to Joel's bed
Stan watches the lights on the computer screen
Hold on
Let me ask my friend
(covering mouthpiece) Stan, can  leave for a little while
My girlfriend is very -- Patrick, we're in the middle of -- She's right in the neighborhood
She's upset
Mary is in the kitchen
She pokes her head out
She's got some pie on a plate
Let him go, Stan
can help
(sighing, to Patrick) Go
(quietly) Mary hates me
(into phone) 'll be right over, Tangerine
'  - Candles are lit
Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on the living room rug listening to music
Joely
Yeah, Tangerine
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit
No
It's my favorite book
Since  was a kid
It's about these toys
There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real
(crying) can't believe 'm crying already
He says, "It takes a long time
That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept
Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby
But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand
" She's weeping
Joel is stroking her hair
They kiss and begin to make love under the blanket
It's sweet and gentle and then it starts to fade
(screaming) No
Jesus, No
He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading
She continues as if she's still being made love to, even though Joel is completely beside himself
He jumps up naked and yells at the ceiling
(') Please
Please
've changed my mind
(looks down at fading Clementine, then at ceiling) don't want this
Wake me up
Stop the procedure
Plea -- '  - Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still
Mary and Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint
After a silence: It's amazing, isn't it
Such a gift Howard gave the world
(a sigh) Yeah
To let people begin again
It's beautiful
You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free
And adults
they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness
hopelessness
And Howard just makes it go away
You love him, don't you
Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught
She is silent for a long moment
No
(beat) Besides, Howard's married, Stan
He's a very serious and ethical man
'm not going to tempt him to betray all he believes in
Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary
- Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges through the snow
'  - Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears
She's crying
He makes his way up her front stairs
She swings open the door and hugs him
Oh, baby, what's going on
don't know
'm lost
'm scared feel like 'm disappearing
'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me
Oh, Tangerine
Nothing makes any sense
Nothing makes any sense
She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick
(') Come up to Boston with me
Sure
We'll go next weekend and -- Now
Now
have to go now
have to see the frozen Charles
Now
Tonight
Um, okay
'll call my study partner
Yay
It'll be great
'll get my shit
She runs into the bedroom
Patrick is at the phone and realizes he doesn't know Joel's number
After a moment's thought, he *69's
The phone rings
' Hi, it's Joel
Please leave a message after the beep
Beep
(whisper) Stan, it's Patrick
Pick up
' Hey, where are you
got into a situation with the old lady
Can you handle things tonight alone
'm really sorry, man
'  - Stan is on the phone
He's really stoned and watches Mary, stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft and low on the stereo
can handle it
He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway
'  - Thanks, Stan
owe you
Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack
He pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the bedroom door
The handwriting is a woman's
He finds what he's looking for
He reads: ' took Joel to walk on Charles River with me last night
It was so beautiful and charming
Joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to please me so much -- he's so sweet -- that he came out after me
We lay down right in the center and watched the stars
He took my hand and said " could
- Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen river
They look up at the stars
die right now, Clem
'm just
happy
've never felt that before
'm just exactly where  want to be
Clementine looks over at him
Her eyes are filled with love and tears
Then they get vague
The scene is being erased
Joel is panicked
(') Clem, no
This can't keep happening
Please
Oh, fuck
Please
Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her sleep, them drinking at a bar
He arrives at a decayed version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak
We can help you through this
Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about -- You have to stop this
What
What do you mean
'm trapped in my head and everything love is being erased
Stop it now
Yes, but
'm just something you're imagining
What can  do
'm in your head, too
'  - Patrick reads the journal
' and we made love right on the ice
It was absolutely freezing on my ass
It was wonderful
Clementine enters, dressed for the cold
Patrick puts the notebook away
'm so excited
Yay
'm excited, too
Oh, and  wanted to give you this
It's a little
thing
Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her
(') didn't have a chance to wrap it
It's gorgeous
(slipping it on) Just my taste
've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry liked
(kisses him) Thanks
So let's get going
Long drive
'  - Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed
- Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front
Such a beautiful view
(looking at her) Yes indeed
(snapping out of memory) Fuck
They're erasing you, Clem
Oh
hired them to
We're in my brain
But want it to stop, before  wake up and don't know you anymore
Wow
Um, well
can't you just force yourself awake
don't know
He concentrates
Nothing happens
(') Aaargh
It's horrible
'm trapped
He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his feet, screaming
But even while he's doing this the memory and Clementine are fading around him
'  - It's raining out
Joel is reading, slouched in a chair
He looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her underwear
She's reading, too
- She's so sexy
loved you on this day
love this memory
The rain
Us just hanging
Clementine looks over at him, smiles
Her brow furrows in thought
What if you hide me
What do you mean
(formulating) Well
if they're looking for me in memories 'm in, what if you take me to a memory 'm not in
(proud) And we can hide there till morning
Joel ponders this
The scene and Clementine are beginning to dissolve
Joel grabs Clementine's hand
She giggles with glee
He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades
Where
Where
Where
He drags her through the landscape of already decayed memories and turns off into: - The kitchen is dated and vague
Joel and Clementine are in an oversized playpen; they're adults but small
Joel wears footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them
He holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll
Clementine is still in her panties and bra
An oversized woman in high heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth preparing dinner
Jesus
What's this
Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman
must be about two
(oddly) want my mommy
She's busy
She's not looking at me
(back to himself, re: doll) Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll
told you about this
(beat) want my mommy
He starts to cry
Clementine tries to comfort him
She hugs him
(') (crying still) want my mommy
(adult, to Clementine) don't want to lose you, Clem
'm right here
'm scared
want my mommy
don't want to lose you
don't want to lose
Joel, Joely, look
it's not fading
The memory
think we're hidden
Joel sucks in some snot
His mother scurries back and forth clanging pots
The room is not decaying
Joel smiles
'  - Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering after sex
Stan suddenly perks up
He looks at the monitor
It's stopped
What
Listen, it's not erasing
He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen
(') It's not erasing
He's off the screen
Where
don't know
He's not on the map
Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze
He fiddles nervously with the equipment
(') don't know what to do
don't know what to do
Crap
Crap
Well, what should we do
don't know
just said that
Sor-ry (beat) We have to do something
He can't wake up half done
Shit
He jerks the joystick spastically
Mary, also naked, gets up and looks over his shoulder at the screen
(definitely) We should call Howard
Stan turns and looks at her
He's stoned and trying to understand her motivation
No way
can handle this
This guy's only half cooked
There's no time to fuck around, Stan
Stan tries to think
He paces
Mary watches him
Finally: (without making eye contact) Okay
He dials the phone, waits
(') Hello, Howard
'  - The room is dark
groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone
His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening
Stan
What's going on
' The guy we're doing
He's disappeared from the map
can't find him anywhere
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared
' was away from the monitor for a second
had it on automatic
had to go pee
Well, where was Patrick
' He went home sick
Jesus
All right, what's the address
' 1062 Sherman Drive
Apartment 1E, Rockville Center
Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad
He hangs up
'  - Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary
He's coming
You better go
Hell no
She starts getting dressed
(') Shit, 'm so stoned
don't want him to see me stoned
Stop being stoned, Mary
She hurries into the bathroom with her bag
(') (
) (') God,  look like shit
God
Mary slams the bathroom door
Stan puts his head in his hands
- Joel and Clementine are in the playpen
Joel's oversized mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the head
How's my baby boy
She's gone
really want her to pick me up
It's weird how strong that desire is
Clementine holds his hand
He looks over at her
You know, we're okay
They're not finding us
You'll remember me in the morning
And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over
loved you so much this day
On my bed in your panties
remember  thought, how impossibly lucky am  to have you on my bed in your panties
She kisses him
You remember what happened next
came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty
And  climbed on the bed with you and you said something like -- -- another rainy day
Whatever shall we do
He laughs
She unbuttons his pajamas
They begin to make love
Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen
Joel stops, looks at Clementine
There's this guy
What
There's this guy
heard him talking in my apartment
He's one of the eraser guys
And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him
Really
Is he cute
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased
Gross
You must remember to tell me this in the morning
'm, like, so freaked out now
'  - It's a rust bucket
Clementine drives through the snow
She's crying and holding Patrick's hand
What's wrong with me
Nothing is wrong with you
You're the most wonderful person 've ever met
She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even harder
'  - Stan works on trying to get the signal back
His hair is combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but still stoned
Mary is pacing nervously to and from the window, looking out into the night
She's dressed also, and she's wearing more make-up now
Her hair is pulled up into some sort of style
Suddenly she freezes at the window
There he is
Oh my God
Oh my God
Do look okay
She doesn't say anything
(') 'm still stoned
Are you
Crap
She looks in the mirror
(') (to Joel) Your Visine didn't do shit, fella
The doorbell buzzes
Mary lunges for the door, then calms herself before opening it
Mierzwiak, holding an equipment bag, looks surprised
Mary
What are you doing here
She came to help, Howard
wanted to learn as much about the procedure as possible, Howard
think it's important for my job
to help comfort the clientele
You know
Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters
Mary closes the door
Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment
Let's get to the bottom of this
Shall we
He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling
(') Odd
He fiddles some more
Mary looks on, fascinated
tried that already
Did you try going through -Gate
Yeah
Of course
Mierzwiak ponders
He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system
'm going to do a Spectrum search throughout his memory, see if anything comes up
Mierzwiak presses some more buttons
The program starts up
much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this screen
It rotates
Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small distant light in the brain
He zeroes in on it
(') Okay, here it is
don't know why it's off the map like that, but -- - Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized mother
Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing
The mother doesn't seem to see her
Little baby getting awwwl cleean
Awl clean
(to Clementine) love getting bathed in the sink
It's such a feeling of security
(giggling) 've never seen you happier
The elements of the scene flash explosively away:  Joel's mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the kitchen, Clementine
Joel is thrown into: - He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in movie theater
The movie on the giant screen is partially obscured by a fence
Joel and Clementine drink wine
'  - Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen
Okay, we're back in
That was beautiful to watch, Howard
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist
Well, thank you, Mary
(sighing) You get some sleep, Howard
'll take it from here
Yeah, probably a good idea
- Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what the characters on the screen are saying
But can't you see
love you, Antoine
Don't call me Antoine
My name is Wally
Yes, but  can't love a man named Wally
She starts to fade
The scene starts to fade
Joel remembers their previous plan
They found us before
The plan didn't work
don't know what to do now
(mouthing to woman on screen) Hide me somewhere deeper
Somewhere buried
Joel grabs her
They run off just as the scene decays into a husk behind them
'  - Stan is back at the controls
Mierzwiak's at the door with Mary
Howard, they've disappeared again
Oh dear
'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired
He nods, distractedly
She smiles to herself as he heads back to the equipment
- Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school building toward the bike rack
Clementine is with him, dressed as she was in the parked car
Look at you, cutey
What are we doing
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me
- 'm terrified
thought if  hung around the art room long enough, he'd go home and  could get my bike
They head toward the bike rack
Joel's is the only bike remaining
(') Poor Joel
They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner
Hi, Jill
He calls me Jill
Everyone calls me Jill after this
The other kids laughs
Just shut up, Joe
'm going home
don't think so
We're fighting
don't want to fight you
The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight
"  Joe Early throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side
joel falls and stays down, covering himself
'mon, Jill
Get up, faggot
'mon
Joel doesn't say anything
He peeks humiliated at Clementine
She's watching him
She's got a tear in her eye
She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him
'm too scared to even throw a punch
When  tell people this story  leave that part out
The scene flashes violently to white and is gone
'  - Mierzwiak is at the machine
We got him back
Stan,  think 'm just going to have to get through this manually
We're running late
- It's cold
Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up
She points at a house up the beach
Our house
Our house
She runs ahead, laughing
The scene is decaying
Joel chases after her
Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you
Remember
He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in: '  - It's dark
Joel, junior high school size, is in bed masturbating
Clementine is in there, too, in her winter coat, still laughing from before
She realizes what's going on
(mock offended) Joel
(continuing to masturbate) don't like it either, but 'm just trying to find horrible secret place to -- Joel's mother pops her head in the door
Joel,  was just -- (sees what's going on) Oh
Um
'll ask you in the morning, honey
Have a good night
The mother backs out, closes the door
Joel cringes
Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was swiped from
Flash
It's all gone
- Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle on a slice of cheesecake in front of her
Joel hands her a small wrapped box
Happy Birthday
(unwrapping the gift) Thanks, Joely
present
Oh boy
She pulls out the bracelet
It's the same bracelet Patrick gave her
(') Oh, Joel
It's beautiful
(slip it on) mean, you're the first guy who ever bought me a piece of jewelry  could honestly say that about
He notices she's starting to fade
scoured the city for it
love it
She leans across the table to kiss him
He grabs her and runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night
- Joel is one of a group of five year olds
He holds a hammer and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon
The other boys are goading him
'mon, Joel, you have to
Do it already
Joel doesn't want to
Clementine watches
can't
have to go home
'll do it later
- didn't want to do this
But  had to or they would've called me a girl
Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer
Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom
The kids hoot
- can't believe  did that
'm so ashamed
live bird watches from a tree
Clementine, still dressed for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls Joel away from the other boys
The two of them walk down Joel's suburban street
It's okay
You were a little kid
(beat) This is a great birthday present
Getting to see you as a boy
She kisses him and they walk holding hands
(pointing) That's where  live
Lived
Joel looks down at her hand
It's fading
The bracelet is gone
Clementine is gone
His childhood house is gone
'  - Mierzwiak works the equipment
He has located a small area of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them
'm getting the hang of it
still understand it
But 'm finding him quickly enough
'm hopeful there won't be too much peripheral eradication
Mary sits on the bed
(a little giggly) like watching you work
Stan sighs, grabs his coat
'll go out for a smoke
If no one minds
(not looking up) That's fine, Stan
Mary doesn't say anything
Stan huffs and is out the door
Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light
Mary gets up her courage to speak
Do you like quotes, Howard
How do you mean
Oh, um, like famous quotes
find reading them inspirational to me
And in my reading 've come across some thought you might like, too
Oh
Well, 'd love to hear some
Mary is thrilled, beside herself
She tries to calm down
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders
" Is that Nietzsche
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard
And here  was thinking  could tell you something you didn't know
It's a good quote, Mary
'm glad we both know it
He smiles at her
She's flustered, flattered
(sputtering) There's another one  like,  read
It's by Pope Alexander
Alexander Pope
Yes, shit
Oops, sorry
(puts hand over mouth) Sorry
It's just  told myself  wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then  go ahead and do it
Like  psyched myself out
It's no big deal
You are such a sweetheart
There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air
Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it
(') Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot
The world forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd"
She smiles, proud and embarrassed
That's lovely
Really
thought it was appropriate maybe
That's all
(beat, then quickly) really admire the work that you do know it's not proper to be so familiar but  guess since we're outside the workplace  feel a certain liberty to -- It's fine, Mary
'm happy to hear it
Okay
Good
Great
Thanks
(blurting) like you, Howard
an awful lot
Is that terrible
Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his unflappable self
You're a wonderful girl, Mary
She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly
've loved you for a very long time
'm sorry
shouldn't have said that
've got a wife, Mary
Kids
You know that
(suddenly weepy) wish  was your wife
wish  had your kids
Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug
It turns into kiss
He pulls away
We can't do this
No you're right
Once again
You're a decent man, Howard
He smiles sadly at her
She smiles courageously at him
want you to know it's not because 'm not interested
If that means anything
They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back to locating and eradicating blips of lights
'   - Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette
He has an unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window
He watches Mierzwiak and Mary
They're talking as Howard works
It appears to be a very serious discussion
car pulls up outside
Stan turns to see
middle-aged woman gets out, checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside
Mierzwiak's resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again
This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel
The woman in the window is transfixed
As Mierzwiak fumbles to unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window
He practically shrieks and jumps up
- Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up simultaneously
'  - Mary looks confusedly at Howard
What
She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who turns and walks off in a huff
(') Oh my God
Mierzwiak is already in his coat
He's out the door
'   - The woman is at her car
Stan watches from the van
Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman
Hollis
Hollis
( - ) knew it, Howard
don't even know why bothered to copy the damn address
It didn't start out to be this
came here to work
It's a one-time mistake
Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now
Hollis is in her car
(heroically) Mrs
Mierzwiak, it's true
And it's not Mr
Mierzwiak's fault
'm a stupid little girl with a stupid little crush
basically forced him into it
swear
Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak
Don't be a monster, Howard
Tell the girl
Stan is out of the van now, listening
Mary shivers in the cold, hugs herself
There's a long silence
Then: Tell me what
Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes
Mary looks back and forth between them
Hollis starts her car
Poor kid
You can have him
You did
She drives off
Mary watches Howard with increased foreboding
What, Howard
We
have a history
'm sorry
You wanted the procedure
You wanted it done
to get past
have to finish in there
It's almost morning
We'll talk later
He shuffles inside
Mary stands there, unable to digest this, struggling in vain to remember
Stan watches
Let me take you home
Mary shakes her head "no
"  She walks off, dazed
- Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river and look up at the night sky
could die right now, Clem
'm just happy
've never felt that before
'm just exactly where  want to be
Clementine looks over at him
Their eyes meet
She sobs
want to go home
She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and continues, now running
- Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car
She tries to look out the window but can only see her own reflection
'  - It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing the job
Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the map of Joel's brain
He targets it
- Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his oversized father
Clementine is naked and in the boat, too
She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon
love this book, Joel
Thank you so much for telling me about it
Joel is his father
The father is drunk and sullen
He faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake
Don't be like me, son
Don't waste your life
You'll come to a point someday where it'll be too late
You'll be sewn into your fate
It was horrifying, seeing my father like that
There was no hope for me if his life was such a failure
And he saw failure in me, too, written in my future
Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel
(') Joel, you're not sewn in
He's wrong
and there'll be nowhere to go except where you're headed, like a train on a track
Inevitable, unalterable
The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light
- Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across from Clementine
He is ragged and jarred
'm done, Clem
'm just going to ride it out
Hiding is clearly not working
Yeah
want to enjoy my little time left with you
This is our first "date" date
Do you remember what we talked about
Naomi,  guess
Yeah
What was  wearing
God,  should know
Your hair was red
remember it matched the wallpaper
Egad, were you horrified
No
think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons
She is wearing the black dress
No, you were with me when  bought that
At that place on East 6th
It was later
- The scene has already been erased
It's just a decayed husk
vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress
- Clementine wears a generic black dress now
Right
Something black though
'll buy that
Black's always good
We did talk about Naomi
said: Are you sure
You seem unsure
'm sure,  said
But you weren't
could tell
was so nervous
remember  couldn't think of anything to say
There were long silences
There is a long silence
(') thought  was foolish
thought 'd mistaken infatuation for love
You said: So what
Infatuation is good, too
And  didn't have an argument
- Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house
dropped you off after
You said -- (Mae West) Come up and see me
now
It's very late
Yes, exactly
Exactly my point
'  - Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex
This was our first time
The scene starts to fade
Joel watches Clementine disappear
- Mary enters the dark room, frazzled
She flips on the fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one with her name on it
Her jaw drops
With a shaky hand, she puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play
" Okay, so just tell me what you remember
And we'll take it from there
' (shaky) Um,  liked you immediately
At the job interview
You seemed so
important and mature
And  loved that you were helping all these people
You didn't come on to me at all
liked that was tongue-tied around you at first wanted you to think  was smart
You were so nice
loved the way you smelled
couldn't wait to come to work
had these fantasies of us being married and having kids and just
(starts to cry) and so
then
when
that one day, when  thought you looked at me back
like
Oh, Howie,  can't do this
How can  do this
It's what's best, Mary
You know that
Mary slumps to the floor
We move into her eyes
' Yeah,  know
Oh, God
Okay, well, was so excited
flirtatious look from Mierzwiak
'  (') Remember you bought me that little wind-up frog
vague shot of a wind-up frog
'  (') And you said
vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice
'  (') "This is for your desk
Just a little token" Back to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape
'  (') knew then
knew something was going to happen
something wonderful
'  - Joel sits in the quiet living room
The scene is fading
Naomi
- On the couch
Dark
Quiet
wondered if  had made a terrible mistake almost reached for the phone about a thousand times
thought  could take it back, erase it, explain  had momentarily lost my mind
Then  told myself we weren't happy
That was the truth
That what we were was safe
It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason thought about Clementine and the spark when  was with her, but then  thought what you and  had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun
But  wanted fun
saw other people having fun and  wanted it
Then  thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; 'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit
then thought maybe not, maybe not
And then thought, as  always do at this point in my argument, about dying
- An elderly man sits
- projected myself to the end of my life in some vague rendition of my old man self
imagined looking back with a tremendous hole of regret in my heart
'  - Joel sits
- didn't pick up the phone to call you, Naomi
didn't pick up the phone
The scene dissolves
'  - Namoi is red-eyed from crying
She is packing things in boxes
Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what to say
She holds up a book
The scene starts to fade
Yours
You take it
don't know
She tosses it in a box
(') Naomi,  really value our relationship
hope it's possible for us to stay in touch
Don't do this to me now, Joel
Really
'  - Joel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in the trunk of a car
There's another woman down there with her
They get into the car and drive off
'  - Joel talks to Clementine
The scene is fogging over
told her today  need to end it
Is that what you want
did it
guess that means something
Clementine shrugs
The scene fades
- Joel walks with Naomi
So what's going on, Joel
don't know, 've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other
What
'know, we've been,  don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and -- Don't say "we" when you mean "you
" think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy
If one person is unhappy, both have to be
by definition
Bullshit
Who is it
You met someone
No
just need some space, maybe
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems
It's not somebody else
- hate myself
Naomi walks off
Joel watches her
The scene fades
'  - Joel enters, looks around
There's no sign of Clementine
Joel approaches a male employee
Is there a Clementine who works here
#1 (calling to another male employee) Mark, is Clem on tonight
#2 On my dick, bro
(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed) Oh, hey
Yeah,  think she's upstairs in Philosophy
Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine
Hi
She turns
didn't think you'd show your face around me again
figured you were humiliated
You did run away, after all
Sorry to track you down like this
'm not a stalker
But  needed to see you
(seemingly uninterested) Yeah
'd like to
take you out or something
Well, you're married
Not yet
Not married
Look, man, 'm telling you right off the bat, 'm high maintenance
So 'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there
If you want to be with me, you're with me
Okay
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again
She goes back to stacking
Joel stands there helplessly
just think that you have some kind of
quality that seems really important to me
The scene is disintegrating
Clementine's speech is delivered without passion
Joel, 'm not a concept
want you to just keep that in your head
Too many guys think 'm a concept or  complete them or 'm going to make them alive, but 'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind
Don't assign me yours
remember that speech really well
(smiling) had you pegged, didn't
You had the whole human race pegged
Probably
still thought you were going to save me
Even after that
know
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around
Remember me
Try your best
Maybe we can
The scene is gone
'  - Joel sits forlornly in the back seat
Rob drives and Carrie sits in the front passenger seat
The car stops in front of Joel's apartment building
Thanks, guys
hope you feel better, sweetie
Yeah
Say hi to Naomi
The car door closes
- Joel climbs the stairs
- hope she's not up
need to think
'  - The lights are off
Joel sits on a chair near the window, writing in his journal
The streetlight illuminates the paper
Naomi sleeps in the bed
- met someone tonight at a party on the beach
Her name is Clementine
There is something alive about her
Naomi turns over in bed, sees Joel
(full of sleep) Hi
Hi
How was it
You didn't miss much
Rob Carrie say hello
Hi, Rob and Carrie
Go back to sleep
The room is starting to decompose
Yeah
Come to bed
'm cold
In a minute
Naomi turns over
Joel goes back to his writing
- (more and more emotionless) don't know what to do about this
've been feeling so alienated and numb lately
Forever
The thought of not acknowledging my feelings again seems self-destructive
How can  continue on this path toward a living death, a life filled with obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless, hopeless
need to speak with Clementine
The scene has turned to a husk
'  - Joel is at his closet, putting on a sweater
Naomi is at the dining room table, papers spread out before her, writing
Joel turns and watches her for a moment
So you don't mind
've got to finish this chapter anyway
The scene is fading
Okay
wish you could come
- This is it
The night we met
My God, it's over
(') Me, too
He approaches Naomi, kisses her on the top of the head
She continues to write
(') Say hi to Rob and Carrie
Have some fun
hope you get your work done
(sighing) Yeah
'  - Rob drives
Carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front passenger seat
Joel sits in the back
'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it
You okay
You seem quiet
Just a little overworked, maybe
- The trip to the party where  met Clementine
My first memory of her is now my last memory of her
Joel looks out the window
Carrie turns around and says something to Joel
She is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz
remember you turned around
Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me
did
You said, things were fine
remember
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel
remember watching you walk down the beach with her and  thought, oh shit
Yeah, you told me that later
told you that later
Joel looks out he window
He sees the husk of a memory on the darkened roadside
It's Joel and Carrie in: '  - Faded
Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee
Who was the girl you walked off with
No one
- Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot
- Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along
Is this the right way
- Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire down the beach
People and music can be heard
- Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his lap
People warm themselves at the fire
Joel watches couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy
You were down by the surf
could just make you out in the dark
Joel looks down to the water
There's Clementine, in her orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea
(') Your back to me
In that orange sweatshirt  would come to know so well and even hate eventually
At the time thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt
- remember being drawn to you even then
thought,  love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean
(') But  went back to my food
The next thing  remember,  felt someone sitting next to me and  saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye
shot of the orange sleeve
Joel looks up
Hi there
Hi
- was so nervous
What were you doing there,  wondered
Your hair was lime green
Green revolution
shot of her green hair
You said
saw you sitting over here
By yourself
thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either
Yeah
don't ever know what to say
can't tell you how happy  am to hear that
mean,  don't mean 'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow
'm such a loser
Every time  come to a party  tell myself 'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then  hate myself after for being such a clod
Even then  didn't believe you entirely
thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people
- But  thought,  don't know,  thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what  was feeling and that you were attracted to it
But,  don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know
mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff
- And  just liked you so much
(') You did
You liked me
You know what  did
Yeah,  know
'm fishing
You said -- She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate
'm Clementine
Can  borrow a piece of your chicken
And you picked it out of my plate before could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers
(') remember -- - The grease on your chin in the bonfire light
Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin
Oh God, how horrid
'm Joel
- No, it was lovely
(') Hi, Joel
So no jokes about my name
You mean, like
(singing) Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine
Huckleberry Hound
That sort of thing
Yeah, like that
Nope
No jokes
My favorite thing when was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll
think your name is magic
She smiles
(eyes welling) This is it, Joel
It's gonna be gone soon
know
What do we do
Enjoy it
Say good-bye
She nods
Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf
(') So you're still on the Zoloft
- Next thing  remember we were walking down near the surf
No,  stopped
didn't want to feel like  was being artificially modulated
know what you mean
That's why stopped
But my sleeping is really fucked up
don't think 've slept in a year
You should try Xanax
mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works
and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there
Like insurance
yeah
'll give you a couple
See what you think
Okay
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova
love her
Really
Me, too
don't meet people who even know who she is and  work in a book store
think she's great
Me too
There's this poem -- Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
think, before
Seems too coincidental that way
Yeah, maybe
Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for the winter
(') Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live
Yeah, yeah
It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom  could send all these lines"
Yes
love that poem
It breaks my heart
'm so excited you know it
(pointing to houses) Look, houses in which we don't live
Joel chuckles appreciatively
(') wish we did
You married
Um, no
Let's move into this neighborhood
Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house
Joel is nervous
do sort of live with somebody though
Oh
She walks to the next house, tries the door
(') Male or female
Female
At least  haven't been barking up the wrong tree
She finds a window that's unlatched
She lifts it
(') Cool
What are you doing
It's freezing out here
She scrambles in the window
Joel looks around, panicked
(whisper) Clementine
- couldn't believe you did that
was paralyzed with fear
The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning
(') 'mon, man
The water's fine
Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me
This place is closed up
Electricity's off
hesitated for what seemed like forever
could see you wanted to come in, Joel
He walks cautiously toward the door
(') As soon as you walked in
knew  had you
You knew  knew that, right
- Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door behind him
knew
knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
It's dark
Yeah
What's your girlfriend's name
Naomi
She's searching through drawers for something
She pulls out a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face
Ah-ha
Now  can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet
think we should go
No, it's our house
Just tonight -- (looking at envelope on counter) -- we're David and Ruth Laskin
Which one do you want to be
prefer to be Ruth but 'm flexible
(opens cabinet) Alcohol
You make drinks
'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth
'm ruthless at the moment
She runs upstairs, giggling
The room is drying out, turning into a husk
(calling after her) really should go
really need to catch my ride
- didn't want to go
was too nervous
thought, maybe you were a nut
But you were exciting
You called from upstairs
(') (flat) So go
did
walked out the door
felt like  was a scared little kid thought you knew that about me
ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation
You said, "so go" with such disdain
(') (poking her head downstairs) What if you stay this time
walked out the door
There's no more memory
Come back and make up a good-bye at least
Let's pretend we had one
Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her way through the decaying environment
(') Bye, Joel
love you
She smiles
They kiss
It fades
-- - Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire
This scene, too, is disintegrating
It dries up and Joel is just standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen in the distance like a photograph
- Joel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front
Did you have fun
Joel nods glumly
Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse outside the moving car window
He sees dried-out version of previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops
He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the beach with Rob and Carrie
It, too, is decaying
Soon all has crumbled into dust
Everything goes black
'  - Howard watches the monitor
The last specks of light are fading
It grows dark
He is tired, his eyes are hollow
He turns to Stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn
Okay
Stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up
He pulls the electrodes off of Joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags
Howard dials the bedside phone
He waits as it rings
' Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks
We can't come to -- Howard hangs up
'   - Stan and Howard load the last of the equipment into the back of the van
He and Howard look at each other
So, 've got to drop the van off
Thanks, Stan
Thanks
'  - Patrick and Mary are heading home from Boston
Mary is silent and depressed
Patrick tries to break the silence
You want to stop for coffee or something
Mary shakes her head "no
"  Long silence
(') Well, it was sure beautiful on that river
Thanks for sharing it with me
Mary doesn't say anything
Silence
(') Well do it again soon
- Stan pulls the van into space marked "Lacuna
"  He gets out, crosses to his car
Mary is sitting on the hood
Hey
(beat) Do you swear you didn't know
swear
And you never even suspected
Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together
Once, maybe
She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue
(') It was here
At his car
was coming back from a job and spotted you together
You seemed caught
waved
You giggled
How did  look
(beat) Happy
Happy with a secret
Mary starts to cry
And after that
never saw you together like that again
So  figured  was imagining things
Mary says nothing
(') really like you, Mary
You know that
Do you remember anything else
What was wearing
Was  standing close to him
Was  leaning against his car like owned it
How did he look at me when giggled
Tell me everything
(thinking) You were in red
That red sweater with the little flowers,  think
You were leaning against his car
(thinking) He looked a little like a kid
Kind of goofy and wide-eyed
'd never seen him look like that before
Happy
You looked beautiful
You looked in love
(heading toward the levator) Thanks, Stan
She stops but doesn't turn to face him
(') You're nice
(beat) But  love him
knew  loved him
Now know
He nods
She waves, heads to the elevator
'  - Joel awakens
The apartment is neat, like when he went to sleep
He gets out of bed and heads into the bathroom
- Joel waits on the crowded platform
The platform across the tracks is empty
Joel's train arrives
It's packed
He squeezes on with all the other commuters
- Joel works in his cubicle over the light table
He seems distracted
He dials his phone
He's nervous
Hi
Naomi
Yeah, hi
How are you know,  know
It's been a long time
Not too much
You
Oh, that's great
Congratulations
Maybe  could buy you dinner to celebrate
Tonight
'm free
Okay, good
- Mary does paperwork at her desk
She looks through her reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with their bags of stuff
'  - Mierzwiak dials his phone and waits
He hangs up
Mary enters with the papers
need this signed, Howard
He takes it, unable to make eye contact
He signs it, hands it back
(') Thanks
(beat) So
do we talk about this
or what
don't know what 'm supposed say, Mary
want to do the right thing here
Do you love me
Did you love me
Something
listened to my tape can't believe 've been sitting right in front of it for a year
It's like listening to someone else's story mean,  hear myself talking about having sex with you and  can't even imagine you naked
can't even say "naked" to you
have a family, Mary
You made me have an abortion
It was a mutual decision
You made me have you erased
loved you
love you
How could you -- didn't make you
You thought it best
(off her stare) But, look,  take full responsibility
She looks at him for a long while
Then, out of frustration, she screams
- Joel sits across from Naomi
(oddly cautious) So
you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years
'm sorry
Well, it was my fault -- the break-up
'm sorry
Oh, sweetie
It really does cut both ways
We were taking each other for granted and -- miss you
Miss you, too
(awkward pause) have been seeing someone for a little while
(trying for enthusiasm) Oh
Great
That's great
religion instructor at Columbia good guy
He's a good guy
'm sorry
really shouldn't have -- 'm glad you called
'  - Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex
There are certain sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost immediately
She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to him
They finish and lie there
So you think the dissertation will get published
don;t know
'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny
'  - Clementine lies in bed with Patrick
- The platform is crowded with business commuters
Joel is among them
The platform across the tracks from them is empty
Suddenly, Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd
He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the empty platform
An almost empty train pulls into that platform
Joel gets on the train and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station
'  - Mary gets out of bed
She has been crying all night
She's a wreck
She puts on some coffee then crosses into the living room area
Sitting there are piles of the files from work
She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in
She pulls another file out
This one has Joel's name on it
She copies it onto an envelope
'  - Joel says goodbye to Clementine
So you'll call me, right
Yeah
When
Tomorrow
Tonight
Just to test out the phone lines
Yeah
Joel exits
We stay on Clementine as she watches Joel head to his car, tromping through the snow
'  - Joel enters, drops his overcoat on a chair, dials the phone
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel
' Hi
How's it going
' Good
called you at work today
They said you were home sick
know
had to take the day to think
' Yeah,  tried you at home
Did you get my message
just got in
' Long day thinking
Joel flips on messages with volume down
Yeah,  suppose so
(cheerful) Hi
They told me you were sick
So
Where are you
had a really nice time last night
Just wanted to say hi, so
hi
Call me
'm home
Call me
' That's me
There you are
(pause) Naomi, it's just
'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had
Okay, Joel
suppose you're right
had a good time last night
really did
So 'm going to get some sleep
'm glad you're okay
We'll speak soon
'Night
She hangs up and Joel stands there for a minute feeling creepy, then he dials the number on a piece of paper
' What took you so long
just walked in
' Hmmm
Do you miss me
Oddly enough,  do
' Ha Ha
You said,  do
guess that means we're married
guess so
' Tomorrow night
honeymoon on ice
- Clementine steps out onto it
Joel follows nervously
Don't worry
It's really solid this time of year
don't know
She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence
(') This is so beautiful
She squeezes his hand
Isn't it
She runs and slides on the ice
Joel is by himself now
don't know
What if it breaks
What if
Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars
Joel is paralyzed
He looks back at the shore
think  should go back
Joel, come here
Please
He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her
She reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down
He lies on his back beside her, their bodies touching
He wants to turn to her, but out of shyness, doesn't
She holds his hand
They look up at the stars
She smiles, doesn't say anything and snuggles closer to him
Listen, did you want to make love
Make love
Have sex
'know -- Oh, um
Because  just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now
That's okay
-- 'm sorry
just wanted to say that
This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and -- Hey, Joel -- -- and 'm just too nervous around you right now
'm nervous, too
Yeah
wouldn't have thought that
Well, you obviously don't know me
'm nervous because  have and enormous crush on you
She smiles up at the sky
Show me which constellations you know
We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila envelopes
One by one they open the envelopes and pull out tapes
We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as people listen to their tapes
'  - Joel drops Clementine off
She kisses him
'  - Joel enters with his mail
He opens a manila envelope, reads the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo, listens
Joel dials the phone
' Yeah
Did you send this
Is it a joke
' probably got the same thing as you
mean,  haven't even told anyone 've met you
Who would even know to do this
' (matter of fact) Maybe it's true then
It's my voice on the tape
That's what you have to say
How could it be true
never even heard of any procedure like this
It's a joke
Maybe
Call someone who'd know
We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone
We hear over and over:  "Is this true
", "Did this really happen
", "Do  know you
", "Is it true
" '  - Carrie is on the phone
She pauses nervously, then speaks: Yes, Joel
It is true
We weren't supposed to say anything
They say it's like waking a sleepwalker
'  - Joel hangs up
He dials the phone
It's true
' know
spoke to my friend Magda
Joel is immersed in the several page document
Look,  have to go
have to think
' Joel, we've fucked
We've made love
Like a million times
And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night
Isn't that lovely
Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers
He just stands there dumbly
'  (') Come over here, sweetheart
Please
'  - Joel and Clementine review their separate Lacuna packages together
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling
Says you were a bully
(laughing) bully
Moi
That's what it says
You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid
Well, sounds like me
Sorry, man
(reading) Says you were jealous and suspicious
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests
Did  use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it
don't know
Doesn't sound like me
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
Says you were constantly calling me a slob
(laughs) It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored
Don't you think
(considering) sort of do
But  only see it as a fantasy version of reality
Cleaned up enough to be erotic
We should have sex
It's old hat for us
She smiles at nervous Joel
(') You know my body like the back of your hand
She unbuttons her blouse
(') Every curve, every freckle
She takes off her shirt
He stares at her
He has clearly never seen this body before
You're so beautiful
She approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her waist for the first time
- Stan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding their files, a stunned-looking lot
There is a new woman in the reception window
The file cases behind her are bare
May  help you
work here
used to work here
Stan
Please just tell Howard 'm here to clean out my desk
(into phone) Mr
Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes sir
(to Stan) He says he needs to see you
'  - Stan enters
Mierzwiak is pale and pacing
She should not have done this, Stan
As mad as she was
as justifiably -- don't know what you're talking about, Howard
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people
Jesus
Mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor looking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over Stan's position
He is in the process of interviewing a sad young woman
so  called everybody  know and asked them to tell me everything
Now know my entire history with him, but it's in the form of a story, 'm losing my mind
This is why people must never be told
It's like waking a -- don't know what to do
Before thought  was depressed for no reason
Now it's like 've been assigned a reason
This never should've happened, ma'am
We'll take care of it
know you don't like me much, Stan, but please talk to Mary
She of all people should know this is a dangerous thing she's doing
- Joel works over his light box
His phone rings
Hi, it's Joel
' Hey, lover
Whatcha doing
'm just, y'know, passing the time best can till  can see you
' God,  can't believe  ever hated you
You must have been crazy
' Guess what 'm wearing
don't know
Panties and -- ' Your dried cum
Jesus
You're still excited by my irreverence
You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock
" can't stop thinking about you
Yay
Meet me after work by the old mill
What old mill
Is that somewhere we -- just wanted to say that
Come by my house
'  - Mary opens the door
Stan stands there with two cups of take out coffee
Oh
Hi
What do you want, Stan
Can
brought some -- She steps aside for Stan to enter
He does, looks around, sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor
(') What's this
Nothing
know what it is
Then why did you ask me
don't know
just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office
They have a right to know
Howard is a thief
He steals the truth
(suddenly weeping) can't remember my baby
can't remember my baby
It existed and  can't even remember
Do you understand that
Stan doesn't know what to say
He stands there dumbly
Mary slumps into a ball on a chair
Mary, people come to him voluntarily
won't allow it
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
What do you think of that
That's from my quote book
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased
(hysterically) Remember the Alamo
Remember the Alamo
Mary
please
This is hurting people
Long pause, then: (small) don't want to hurt people
(breaking down) But these things happened
All these little sadnesses, the big ones
What if no one remembers
What does that do to the world
(beat, quietly) Someone has to remember, Stan
They look at each other
- Vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig
' was by myself in the park because my friend Davia was sick that day
was on a swing
There was this smiling man walking a little bushy dog -- Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash
'  (') The man said something like, "He's friendly --" Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the woman's
'  (') "-- he won't bite
" He won't bite
You can pet him if you want
Shot of the girl petting the dog
Do you want to give him a biscuit
The girl nods
(') They're in my car
Why don't you -- ' Excuse me
Hello
- Mary, with a headset on, looks up, startled
She switches off the tape
She has been crying
There's a pile of tapes next to her
The distraught woman is standing there
May  help you
'm here for Dr
Mierzwiak
My name is Helene Kernfeld
Yes, please have a seat
The doctor will be with you momentarily
The woman sits
Mary presses an intercom button
(') Howard, your 10:30
She switches the tape back on
' He took me to his car and
Vague shot of the girl being raped
- The old woman is staring off blankly, her giant manuscript in her lap, as she travels over the New York skyline
We move into her eyes
Vague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined space: The young girl being raped by the man in the car
soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered friends
couple fighting, from the woman's point of view
find you physically repulsive
can't even look at you
They look at each other in silence
little boy being called "faggot" by an endless succession of boys
The aftermath of a car accident from the driver's
Mary having an abortion
- The old woman and her chair lift out of the line of commuters
- It's modern and well-appointed
The old woman enters, sits behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the drawer
She takes some pills with water
An old man enters
How are you today, Mary
() Let's see
Still dying, Howard
() You don't have to jump down my throat was trying to be nice
() Well, don't try
It's unbecoming on you
Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back
Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc, places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and listens, somewhat wearily but attentively
We watch the color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording
Another old woman enters the office
Old Mary looks up, seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape
() (') May  help you
'd like to make an appointment
() think the doctor is free this morning
He can probably take you right away for an initial consultation
The second old woman smiles gratefully
'  - Old Howard works at his desk
Old Mary enters with the second old woman
() Dr
Mierzwiak, this is Clementine Kruczynski
She'd like to talk to you
Old Howard and the old Mary eye each other
() Hello, Ms
Kruczynski
Nice to meet you
Please have a seat
He indicates a sitting area
She sits
He joins her
() (') Would you mind if  tape our discussion
She shakes her hear
He punches a couple of buttons on his computer console
tape recorder starts up and his computer screen lights up so only he can see it
On it we see a whole file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them involving Joel Barish
() (') So, why don't you begin by telling me why you've come here
() Well,  met this man, Joel, three years ago at a senior dance
We'd both been alone for so long and
- The old woman (Mary) travels in the commuter tube over Manhattan
It's late, the tube is mostly empty
She has earphones on
() (
) remember Joel and  were having breakfast -- An old man and the second old woman eat breakfast
() (
) --  said something like we should go upstate and see the leaves change
The old man looks up from his cereal and stares blankly
The woman smiles, but there is no response
just a dead stare
() (
) (') He just stared at me as if  didn't exist
As if  had never existed
- The second old woman's (Clementine) voice drones tinnily on in the distance
The old woman with the earphones is dead, her eyes glassy and unseeing
() (
) -- his eyes used to be so filled with love
But it was gone
How can  go back to being alone after seeing love was alone for so long
What had  done with my life
was alone so long
'  - The old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to modern versions of the erasing machines
Two young technicians monitor the equipment
The woman's bedside phone rings
Her machine picks up
After a moment: ' Hi, it's Joel
What's going on, Clem
Why won't you call me back
Please call me
We need to speak
The machine clicks off
One of the technicians reaches over and presses the "erase" button on the machine
