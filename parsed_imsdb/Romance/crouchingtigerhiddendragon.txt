Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon by Wang Hui Ling, James Schamus, Tsai Kuo Jung based on the novel by Wang Du Lu - Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy
As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering the village
One of the men recognizes him
Master Li is here
: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome
In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai, drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building
- Aunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls
Shu Lien
'  - Yu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in
Li Mu Bai is here
- How's everything
Fine
Please come in
Yu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in
Li carries a large object, wrapped in silk
Yu smiles
Mu Bai
It's been too long
It has
(he glances around the room) How's business
Good
And how are you
Fine
An awkward pause
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain
He said you were practicing deep meditation
Yes
The mountain must be so peaceful
envy you
My work keeps me so busy,  hardly get any rest
left the training early
Why
You're a Wudan fighter
Training is everything
During my meditation training came to a place of deep silence
was surrounded by light
Time and space disappeared
had come to a place my master had never told me about
You were enlightened
No
didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment
Instead
was surrounded by an endless sorrow couldn't bear it
broke off my meditation
couldn't go on
There was something
pulling me back
What was it
Something  can't let go of
You are leaving soon
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking
Perhaps  could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me
Li unwraps the object
It is an ancient, astonishingly beautiful sword
The Green Destiny Sword
You're giving it to Sir Te
am
He has always been our greatest protector
don't understand
How can you part with it
It has always been with you
Too many men have died at its edge
It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade
You use it justly, you're worthy of it
It's time for me to leave it behind
So what will you do now
Li doesn't reply
Come with me to Peking
You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself
It'll be just like old times
First  must visit my master's grave
It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him
have yet to avenge his death
And yet 'm thinking of quitting
must pray for his forgiveness
Join me once you have finished can wait for you in Peking
Perhaps
Customs officials have just finished checking the contents in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia
The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the boundaries of Peking
Yu, riding a handsome horse and clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection
Ok
Pass
Thanks
Let's go into the city
Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages
Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of medicinal herbs
Everything got here safely
'm much obliged
Just doing my job
Sun Security has been the best since your father started it
You're a credit to his memory
Thank you
mean it
From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by the morning sun
Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages are fighting to get through the boulevards
group of jugglers perform at a corner
Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse
'   - Yu presents the sword to Sir Te
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon
He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it
It's too fine a gift
cannot accept it
Sir Te
It has brought him as much trouble as glory
Help him to leave these troubles behind
Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew
All right
'll act as the sword's custodian
De Lu, the head servant, enters
Governor Yu has arrived
must change
(getting up) You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me
Please accept our thanks
Please do not be such a stranger
You'll stay the night as my guest
Now, Shu Lien
tell me something
And forgive me for prying
Your father was a great friend to me, and  think of you as my own daughter
Please, Sir Te, what is it
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days
maybe he's trying to tell you something
don't know
Don't be coy
've always known about your feelings for each other
All these years, it's a shame
neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other
You're both wasting precious time
beg your pardon
Li Mu Bai and aren't cowards
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him
'll give him an earful
'  - Yu and De Lu approach the study
Sir Te said to leave the sword in here
De Lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman inside
The woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy hanging on the walls
Who are you
'm your guest today
am Governor Yu's daughter
This is Sir Te's study
You are here to
was looking for a quiet corner
am Sir Te's head servant
And this is another of our guests
'  - Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal
The handle is heavy
And the blade is no ordinary metal
Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons
You're just not used to handling it
But  have had much practice
As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us
They'd let me play with their weapons
The scabbard is so beautiful
Beautiful but dangerous
Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire
It's 400 years old
Exquisite
You said it belongs to
My friend Li Mu Bai
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift
Li Mu Bai
The famous warrior
Why would he give his sword to Sir Te
You're too young to understand
You're a sword fighter too
Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath
An eerie sound resonates within the study
Jen is even more impressed
Yes,  am
But  prefer the machete
Certain moves, however, call for a sword
Really
Yu puts the sword back in the case
(longingly) It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity
Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long
've read all about people like you
Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is
But you're just like the characters in the stories
Sure
No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds
They tell you all about that in those books
You know what  mean
'm getting married soon, but  haven't lived the life  want
So  heard
Congratulations
It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it
You're not married, are you
What do you think
No
You couldn't roam around freely if you were
You're probably right
Yu studies Jen
The room falls silent for a moment
- It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple
Jen is leaving the study escorted by her maid
She turns to Yu for a final good-bye
Yu seems intrigued by the encounter
'  - Two lighted lanterns are raised up
'  - Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu
Go ahead, Governor Yu
Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the sword
He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword
Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword out from its sheath
The sword gives off a luminous blue glow in the dark
Two feet 9 inches long
1 inch wide
The handle is 1 inch deep, 2
6 inches wide
Seven-tenths of an inch thick
With seven rubies missing from the hilt
You can tell the design dates back to before the Chin era
Engraved with a technique lost by the time of the Han Dynasty
Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te
sword by itself rules nothing
It comes alive only through skillful manipulation
see your point
Please continue
The Imperial Court isn't the problem
With royalty and officials everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps security tight
But Peking is not like the West
Here, you'll find all sorts of characters
Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order
Don't depend only on the court
Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld can ensure your position
Be strong, yet supple
This is the way to rule
'  - maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings
Someone knocks and the maid goes to answer the door
Governess
Let me do it
The maid leaves as the governess enters the room
Please sit
've made you silk pajamas
Do you want to change into them
Put them down
heard you met Shu Lien today
Do you know her
She's one of those
Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind
Jen shoots her an angry look
'll socialize with whomever please
Don't invite danger into your father's house
She's about to say something, then thinks better of it
'm tired now
Go to bed then
Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon
God knows what the future will bring
It will be just the same
Enough
'm tired
Autumn is coming
'll shut the windows for you
The governess leaves
Jen sits on the side of her bed, thinking
'  - wide shot of the compound
patrol man greets Master Bo, Sir Te's head of security
The place is serene
Chilly, eh
Yes, Master Bo
As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background
/
'  - masked figure silently opens the window and enters the room
It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and wraps the sword
Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling
The thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard
Bo tries to stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the roof as Bo yells out
Someone help
Stop him
He's on the roof
The sword's been stolen
Stop thief
Stop him
The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street
Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting people to the theft
People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among them
- Bo runs through the streets
The thief is nowhere in sight
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing
Bo hurries towards the source
'  - Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter
It's Jade Fox
We must avenge mother
The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over a wall, just as Bo arrives
Do something
He's getting away
- The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu
Yu and the hooded figure face off
Return the sword, and 'll let you go
The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight
Yu attacks, but the figure repels her
You've been trained at Wudan
The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop
Yu catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series of lightning-quick blows
'  - Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away
You're mistaken
We're just street performers
We were rehearsing
Father
You were rehearsing
Who are you trying to fool
May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai
They run off
Where did that thief go
Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into Governor Yu's compound
Governor Yu's house
Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight
Get down here
Give back the sword
' - Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief
small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu
She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity to get away
Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the empty courtyard
'   - De Lu escorts Yu into Te's
Sir Te awaits you
'   - Men are standing at attention
Bo is giving his account of what happened, as Yu enters
'm sure the thief is in the Yu household
How dare you imply
But  say -- -- Enough
The men hustle out
Bo can barely contain his frustration
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword
Yes, though  doubt he's involved in this
But the sword could be in his compound
Then someone's trying to set him up
We should inform Li Mu Bai
'  - Madam Yu is returning from temple
The governess is helping her out of the carriage
Servants are peeling bills off a wall across the street
What is it
Madam Yu, someone's put up posters
partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not escape justice
" is seen on the ground
Let me see
Someone is after Jade Fox
Preposterous, looking for her here
Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the flyer away and follows her
hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu
She studies it, then puts it in her pocket, and moves on
- Bo is searching for the Tsais
The bridge is full of jugglers
But the two are nowhere to be found
- Bo quizzes a homeless man
Where are they
don't know
haven't seen them in two days
Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking quickly into an alley
Bo follows her
' May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken- down bamboo fence
Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai oiling their weapons
'  - Jen practices calligraphy
The governess is by her side embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen
The maid enters
There is a Miss Shu Lien here to see you
Jen stops and looks up at them
Miss is busy right now
'll tell her
Show her in
The governess shoots her a look
This spells trouble
have a guest
The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in
This way please
The governess and Yu exchange quick glances
The governess bows slightly and departs
've missed you
How so
'm bored
Yu sees the calligraphy
You're doing calligraphy
'll write your name
Just for fun
Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness
never realized my name looks like "sword
" Jen freezes slightly
You write gracefully
Calligraphy is so similar to fencing
Maybe it is
wouldn't know
The maid enters with tea
Please
Thank you for seeing me
hear your wedding day is near
You must be overwhelmed by the preparations
'm hardly doing a thing
The less think of it the better
My parents are arranging everything
The Gous are a very powerful family
My marrying one will be good for my father's career
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family
Am
wish  were like the heroes in the books  read
Like you and Li Mu Bai
guess 'm happy to be marrying
But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom  love
That is true happiness
Do you think so
Let me tell you a story
About you and Li Mu Bai
Yes
Did you know  was once engaged to be married
No, really
His name was Meng Si Zhao
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath
One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy
After, Li Mu Bai and  went through a lot together
Our feelings for each other grew stronger
But how could we dishonor Meng's memory
So the freedom you talk about,  too desire it
But have never tasted it
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's
am not an aristocrat, as you are
but  must still respect a woman's duties
Don't distance us
From now on, let's be like sisters
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage
'  - The maid escorts Yu out
Yu pauses, looks around, and sees the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a corner
'  - Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly from bed and looks out the window
light breeze stirs her hair
The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face dissolves, into
/
/  - the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she lets the dry desert air flow through her hair
She sits in a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback, that is traveling through the spectacular desert
Across from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant
What a godforsaken place
Can't your father be appointed closer to civilization
Jen
are you listening to me
Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a beautiful mountainside
'  - Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed
'  - Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a tree, watching Jen
Let's go
They drop down silently and walk away
From another rooftop, Lo looks silently on
'  - Tsai and May enter the house
'  - Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going through their belongings
Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's mask -- revealing Bo
Tsai has another long knife at his throat
Who are you
Wait
'm a friend
Tsai pauses
'  -  () May fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling pot of vegetable and meatball soup
Her father and Bo are now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight
don't care about your sword
Why were you spying on the Yus
'm looking for someone
Jade Fox
'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district
Jade Fox is a master criminal
hear she infiltrated the Yus
She must have come with them when they transferred here
But with Yu's reputation, can't just go in and accuse her
This Jade Fox is a woman
Yes
Then leave her to me
Pardon me, but  doubt you can handle her
My wife was quite a martial arts expert
Jade Fox killed her
So you see, this is personal
Leave her to me
It's ready
(re: the soup) 'm ready for anything
Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks
May intercepts him with her own chopsticks
Father gets first dip
Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a meatball but to catch an incoming dart
dart wrapped with a note
Bo jumps up
They're gone
What does it say
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill
"  Good, the fox is out of her hole
'  - Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to another man, whose back is to her
Shu Lien, look who's here
The man turns around -- it's Li Mu Bai
'  - Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu
But something is going on at the Yu household
What have you discovered
From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer
Li takes it, his face darkening
Jade Fox
Impossible
You always suspected she'd fled to the West
didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu
So  shall avenge my master's death after all
Be careful
Sir Te requires discretion
Official business is difficult enough
Don't let personal feelings make it worse
And  don't know
even this poster
could be some sort of trap
Did you see who posted it
Yu pauses
No
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's
On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's
Were you involved
It was Bo, Sir Te's man
hear he followed the thief to the Yus'
Have you questioned him yet
No, not yet
But your men are watching over Yu's compund
No, 'd already sent them home
You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that 'll get it back soon using my own methods
That's not what  meant
don't care about the sword
What do you mean
Didn't you come back here for it
don't know it was stolen until got here
Then, why did you come
Well, we had talked
De Lu enters
Pardon my intrusion
Master Li, your room is ready
Thank you
Please lead the way
- Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree
Bo stifles a yawn
The fox doesn't care much for punctuality
Still no sign of her
An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over her face, holding a cane
The three exchange glances
Enough
Show yourself
The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess
Tsai
you dog
You will pay for your stubbornness
That's what you think, old witch
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less
But if you resist,  won't stop until you're dead
Father
Let me avenge my mother's death
You'll soon end up like her, you little whore
You'll pay for that
fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when the opportunity presents itself
(to Bo) She's going to paralyze you
Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo
May shoots an arrow at her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May
May
Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill, Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them
Tsai, you filthy mongrel
An ambush
Father, are you all right
Li addresses Fox
Wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago
It's been a long time, Jade Fox
You don't remember me
But you should remember my master
You infiltrated Wudan while  was away
You stole our master
Now it's time for you to pay
Your master underestimated us women
Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he would never teach me
He deserved to die by a woman's hand
You stole the secrets of Wudan's highest martial arts
But after ten years of training, your moves are still undisciplined
And today, under a Wudan sword
you will die
Li easily brings Fox to the ground
Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox
figure masked in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her
Disciple, we'll kill them all
Let's go
Another one
must get rid of Tsai
Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked figure
Who are you
Why is the Green Destiny in your possession
What's it to you
My name is Li Mu Bai
The Green Destiny is mine
Jade Fox can't be your master
Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move
'm just playing around
Tell me, who is your master
Let's go
We must kill them
Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it back, hitting him in the head
Fox and the masked figure leap away
May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head
Bo kneels beside her
Father
' - Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed from over the body of Tsai
Bo and May stand before them
This is Tsai
My father
Police Inspector from Shaan
This should be reported to Governor Yu
The victim is an officer
You believe the killer is hiding out in his compound
'd bet my life on it
(to Li and Yu) Come with me
He exits the room
'  - Te, Li, and Yu are seated
This needs to be resolved, and quickly
'll get into the Yu household and get her
'll ferret out Fox and her gang
We must be careful
Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security
Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him
It might get Sir Te in trouble
This is a delicate matter
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter
What do you have in mind
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs
Sir Te and Li look puzzled
'  - Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen
They busy themselves with various items for her trousseau
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts
She's being so considerate
'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today
heard Sir Te lost something
And now Madame Te's not feeling well
Jen sits silently reading
We know who stole the missing item
If the thief returns it, 'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further
That's good
Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves
It's very embarassing
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes
that can bring ruin to themselves and their families
But don't be too lenient
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking
murderer
Yes
The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master
Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down
female criminal
Now that's news
Jen becomes visibly upset
You say she killed a policeman
Yes, from the West
He went undercover and and followed her here, Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same
doubt it
This thief
it very unusual
As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea
As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the pot slips from her hand
Without even looking down, Jen instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move
And most likely smarter than a mere killer
Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by
(formal) Greetings, Sir Te
Hello, Madam Yu
This is Li Mu Bai, the renowned swordsman
Delighted to meet you
Li sizes Jen up
Miss Yu is soon to be married
Congratulations
'  - May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard
Why don't you come in
'm standing guard
Come in
It's cold
She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him
Come in
We don't have to fear Jade Fox if we're together
- still, dark night
'  - Something moves in the moonlight
hooded figure jumps down
Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward
Isn't it a bit too late to be out
You've brought me the sword
do as  please
The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with incredible speed and grabs the sword from her
Where's your master
What's it to you
The figure floats away
Li chases after her
- The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops, displaying amazing floating skills
- The figure bounces into an old monastery
Li is already there
Had enough flying
You've got potential
You've studied the Wudan Manual but you don't understand it
You need a real master
The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her eyes
Do you think you are a real master
Like most things,  am nothing
It's the same for this sword
All of it is simply a state of mind
Stop talking like a monk
Just fight
Then tell me where Jade Fox is
On guard
Real sharpness comes without effort
- The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of her
The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her
Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack
The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly
Li gets even more elusive, using a branch to repel her
No growth without assistant
No action without reaction
No desire without restraint
Now give yourself up and find yourself again
There is a lesson for you
Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it slightly
Go ahead
Why should
You need practice
can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness
Why do you want to teach me
've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets
And if  use them to kill you
That's a risk 'm willing to take
Deep down, you're good
Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you
The figure's eyes cloud with tears
Wudan is a whorehouse
Keep your lessons
The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing alone in the monastery
'  - Jen slips in through the window
She pulls off her mask, as she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing
You're home late
or should  say early
Why are you still here
You killed a policeman
You should leave
You'll bring ruin on my whole family
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword
Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun
You, too, are responsible for that death
Come with me
You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat
Denied your talent
As a master and disciple we will rule
'll never live as a thief
You're already a thief
That was just for fun
How can leave
Where would  go
Wherever we want
We'll get rid of anyone in our way
Even your father
Shut up
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle
kill or be killed
Exciting, isn't it
owe you nothing
Yes, you do
You are still my disciple
Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few blows
Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's pressure points, disabling her
Jen pushes her across the room
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual
You couldn't even decipher the symbols
studied the diagrams
But you hid the details
You wouldn't have understood, even if  had tried to explain
You know
you've gone as far as you can go
hid my skills so as not to hurt you
If  hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, 'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me
Master
started learning from you in secret when  was 10
You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu
But once  realized could surpass you,  became so frightened
Everything fell apart
had no one to guide me, no one to learn from
Believe me, 've a lesson or two left to teach you
Fox exits
'  - The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back
'  - Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully at ease with the weapon
He spins around to find Yu standing in the doorway
The sword is back
are you happy
Li smiles
admit, getting it back makes me realize how much 'd missed it
But it's not your sword anymore
You gave it to Sir Te
True
But  must borrow it for one last mission
Jade Fox must die at its edge
Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's
You did your job well
But, this girl
saw her last night
knew she would intrigue you
She needs direction
and training
She's an aristocrat's daughter
She's not one of us
In any case, it will all be over soon
You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry
That's not for her
She should come to Wudan and become a disciple
But Wudan does not accept women
For her, they might make an exception
If not, 'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon
It's not our affair
Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object
thought by giving away the sword, could escape the Giang Hu world
But the cycle of bloodshed continues
wish there were something more could do to help you
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien
'  - Jen is asleep
noise awakens her
Lo opens the window and sneaks in -- right into the point of Jen's waiting sword
Jen's sword drops to the ground
Lo
Jen
Lo grabs her by the wrist
You shouldn't have come
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days
it took me a while to get in here
can't wait any longer
was wrong to let you go
Come back with me
You'll be happy in the desert
You'll be free there
Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms again
You've been looking for me all this time
: /
/  - Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it
Jen admires the piece, her most prized possession
Madam Yu sits opposite her
Jen
stop playing with it
Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the sky darkens
won't break it
/  - Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan
It's Dark Cloud
Dark Cloud is coming
His warning is useless
From Jen's pov, we see the guards slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords
Lower the shade, don't let them see you
() Don't touch the women
Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints
Lo approaches the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand
She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse flails beside him
She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their escape on horseback
Let's go
- Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed
Come get your comb
She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and flings her off her horse
Hurry back to your mother
Lo rides on as she charges after her horse
- group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up, keeping a respectable distance
They notice her and rise as she dismounts
One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few feet away
In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and knocked his nose into his face
He crumples to the sand
The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances, and charge her at once
In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or dragging their fallen comrades back
Lo calls out and stops the fight
She's mine
- Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about 20 feet apart
Their pace has slowed considerably
In fact, they're dead tired
Let's stop a moment
Give it back
(shouting a bit) You're tired
You need rest
Your horse needs water
There's a creek up here
He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed
Well, there used to be
What's your name
'm Lo
The Hans call me Dark Cloud
'm not that tall or big, but 'm quick as lightning
My comb
She kicks him
They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted, collapses
She kicks him a few times, then collapses too
- Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of animal fur
She sits up with a start and checks her clothes
Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave
Next to her are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp arrows
She quickly grabs one of the arrows
If you like that arrow,  can make you a bow
Great for hunting wild chicken
They're delicious
Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but her legs betray her and she falls
You need to eat, understand
Then you'll have the strength to fight
Understand
He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac
He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she starts to wolf it down
You're eating too fast
Slowly
- Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape
chicken roasts over a fire
Lo whistles
Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head
Lo passes out as Jen scurries away
- Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered
But soon she passes out
- Jen again awakes inside the cave
Lo tries to feed her some water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to find that her legs and hands are tied up
You've got quite a temper
It's better this way
You coward
Still in a bad mood
At least you're speaking
What's your name
Jen spits at Lo
didn't think the Hans had names like that
Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness
In the flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows
Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub
He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and dishevelled body
He comes over and unties her
Relax
If  had wanted to,  would already have done it
You must be dying for a bath
Fresh water's hard to get here
But  managed to bring some up
You can wear my clothes when you're done
They're clean
Don't worry
'll sing, so you'll know where  am
After the bath, you'll be calmer
Jen nods and the bandit releases her
He starts to sing as he walks out
Jen waits until the sound recedes before closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit
While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud rendition of a tribal song
Lo apparently doesn't remember all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few passages
Jen smiles
- Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles from the soles of her feet
No more hitting on the head
All this trouble for a comb
It's mine
It means a lot to me
barbarian like you wouldn't understand
Not true
can use it to pick fleas from my horse
By the way, 'm a real Manchurian
'm sorry
guessed wrong though you were a Han
Give me back my comb
don't take orders from anyone
Give it back
Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a little blood from his chest
Furious, Lo lunges at her and they tussle briefly
Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and the scuffling becomes more like foreplay
Violence turns into unleashed passion
- Lo and Jen ride across the desert
Jen holds tightly to him
- Lo and Jen lie in the bath together
When  was a boy, one night,  saw a thousand shooting stars thought, where did they all go
'm an orphan
used to look for stars alone
thought if  rode to the other end of the desert, 'd find them
've been riding in the desert ever since
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit
He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb
Lo pauses
Out here, you always fight for survival
You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance
Slowly, your gang becomes your family
All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars
am a man
And now 've found the brightest star of all
- Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars
Your father's men are looking for you
Jen doesn't respond
- Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass
- Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff
Lo looks over, viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him
They see a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance
Your father's men are still looking for you
They're still out there, circling closer
Let them look
It is trouble for me
Jen bites her lip
Don't send me back
You must decide
You might get tired of this life
You might begin to miss your family
If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too
She would miss us
Jen
want you to be mine forever will make my mark on the world will earn your parents' respect
We have a legend
Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish
Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped
He didn't die
He wasn't even hurt
He floated away, far away, never to return
He knew his wish had come true
If you believe, it will happen
The elders say, " faithful heart makes wishes come true
" - Jen and Lo kiss
Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair and presses it into his palm
Jen starts to cry
They embrace
Keep it safe
Return it to me when we are together again
will
(smiling painfully) If you don't, 'll come after you
And  won't let you off so easy
- Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning light
End of flashback
'  - Wherever  went, someone always recognized me
really tried
Later,  heard you came to Peking
was afraid 'd never see you again
So  came
can't let you marry
Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from outside the door
(whispering) Go
Jen
(through her tears) Don't ever come back
Lo hovers at the window frame
So it's over
Jen pauses
Yes
Lo thrusts a small object in her hand
He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall
We heard noises
It was just a cat
The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door
Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo has given her
- The noise and color of a wedding procession
marching band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a handsome white horse
- Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides silently in the bride's carriage
- Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city gate
You think Jade Fox will show up
She's out there, but  doubt she'll show herself
We'll keep our eyes open
Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl
- small arrow flies into the carriage
Jen calmly lifts the red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the panelling inside the carriage
We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen doesn't seem to notice
(v
o
) Jen
Come with me
You're mine
Lo runs wildly into the crowd
Come with me to the desert
Jen
Come with me to Xin Jiang
The guards surround Lo, but he escapes
- Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers pressed against Lo's neck
Yu comes running around the corner and sees them
Where is Jade Fox
Yu jumps in and pushes Li away
(to Lo) Come with me
Hurry
- Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who look him over
(to Lo) You thought she'd give it all up and go back West with you
She's mine
Either way, you are no good to her dead
With the Gou and Yu clans hunting you, you'll soon be in their hands
don't care anymore
If you truly loved her, you wouldn't say that
Don't you want to see her again
All right
'll write you an introduction
Take it to Wudan
Wait there for news from me
All right
- Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the compound, a sense of panic in the air
Yu gives Li a look
Li shrugs
'  - crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty sword case, his voice rising
When will this end
They take it, they put it back, they take it again
My home is turning into a warehouse
Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te
Speak
Jen has run away
Gou found the wedding chamber empty
Governor Yu requests your assistance
You know the Giang Hu underworld
He wants to find her, and keep her from harm
Sir Te, leave this to us
Don't worry
- Jen arrives at the tea stall
She places her sword on the table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu martial arts characters sitting nearby
What can  serve you
As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm
The cup is dirty
The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away
The men approach Jen
Hello
What is your name
(without lifting her eyes) Long
It's young Master Long
My apologies
'm Iron Eagle Sung and this is my brother in arms, Flying Cougar Li Yun
What brings you to Huai An, and where are you headed, Master Long
Anywhere there's action
The two men exchange glances
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance
Don't bother
You don't seem to understand
So what if  don't
We have ways of helping you understand
The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped into scraps by Jen
(stunned) Are you related to Li Mu Bai
He is my defeated foe
- Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the horses in the background
Have some tea
As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch
Embarrassed, Li pulls back
Shu Lien
The things we touch have no permanence
My master would say
there is nothing we can hold on to in this world
Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real
Not everything is an illusion
My hand
wasn't that real
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice
All this time, 've never had the courage to touch it
Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption tried sincerely to give it up but have brought us only trouble
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger
You're right, but  don't know what to do
want to be with you
just like this
It gives me a sense of peace
Li Mu Bai smiles
- Jen walks upstairs
waiter greets her
Please follow me
want a clean room
We have plenty
Your order
Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down
Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs, a little starchy, but keep the sauce light, shark fin soup, mixed vegetables, and some warm wine
(dazed) have to order from a bigger restaurant
Hurry then
The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to place the orders
Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not much money left
large group of Giang Hu characters enters
They survey the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs
That's him
am Iron Arm Mi
heard a true master has arrived
have come to seek a lesson
Jen ignores him
(bristles) You asked for it
Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea
Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at a sensitive pressure point
This provokes a reaction from the other men
What kind of Iron Arm are you
You have amazing technique
am Flying Machete
Are you related to Southern Crane
Southern Duck
don't eat anything with two feet
Who could remember such long-winded names
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and you don't know his master, Southern Crane
Who are you
'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou
(furious) Gou
hate that name
It makes me puke
Too bad you're named Gou
You'll be the first to feel my sword today
Jen leaps up and dives into battle
The men all use different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the powerful Green Destiny
Hold it
Don't you know Monk Jing
monk, in a place like this
You need a lesson
Who are you
She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing the Green Destiny
Who am
am
am the Invincible Sword Goddess
Armed with the Incredible
Green Destiny
Be you Li or Southern Crane
lower your head
and ask for mercy
am the desert dragon
leave no trace
Today  fly over Eu-Mei
Tomorrow
'll kick over Wudan Mountain
Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks
- Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who battled with Jen
We politely asked for a friendly match, but she showed no respect, and attacked us
Everyone came by to teach her a lesson
Her sword was just too powerful
've traveled everywhere, but never met anyone so uncivilized
(heavily bandaged) She kept accusing me of being Gou Jun Pei's brother
Who is this Gou, anyway
Her husband
The men all nod their heads
- Li and Yu ride together
(to Yu) We're close to your headquarters
Go home and check in
What about you
'll look around and catch up later
Not a bad idea
Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters
Yu takes a fork off the road
Thunder can be heard in the darkening sky
- group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front yard of Sun Security
They stop when Yu enters
Mistress, you're back
It's you
How's everything here
Fine
You've been gone a while
Yes, and  leave again tomorrow
Your wife was due
Yeah, a baby girl
Good
'll be happy if she's half as strong as you
Mrs
Wu
You're back
How's the arm
Still sore
Much better
You've been gone so long
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night
(excited) 'll go and make up his room
Aunt Wu hustles out
Yu goes into her own room
Yu lights incense for her former fiance Meng
Hearing something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing outside downstairs
Sister Shu Lien
'  - Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some clothes
Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets herself on the edge of Yu's bed
Yu brings over the clothes
Here you must be in proper attire
'm just borrowing some clean clothes
'm not staying
'll give them to you
was just passing by and wondered how you were
Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on Yu's shoulder in tears
You, sister
Look at the trouble you've caused
Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like
If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice
You can run from marriage, but not your parents
They forced me to marry
Go back to them first
Then you can decide about Lo
You know about Lo
He really loves you
Come back to Peking with me
We'll find a solution
Where is he now
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements
He sent him to Wudan Mountain
You're working together to set me up
'm leaving
How dare you accuse us
always knew you had stolen the sword
've done nothing but protect you and your family
And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt
Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him
We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all
You're no sister of mine
What do  care
You were never a real friend anyway
But  wonder, how long could you last as my enemy
Jen gets up to leave
Yu intercepts her
Put the sword down
Jen jumps out
- Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are still practicing
They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder
(calling out) Jen
Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny
Everyone out
Shut the doors
The men leave
Fine
the friendship is over
Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and begins her battle with Jen
Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none are any match for the Green Destiny
After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands
Don't touch it
That's Li Mu Bai's sword
Come and get it if you can
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing
Don't be a sore loser
Go ahead
Take your pick
'll wait
Go ahead
Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks
Just as the Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade at Jen's neck
She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls back
Give me the sword
Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm
Take it
Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in
(enraged) Stop it
You don't deserve the Green Destiny
Not another lecture
On guard
Let's end this here
Only the sword will settle this
Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail
- Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind
- Jen runs into a sea of bamboo
She appears to have lost Li but is not slowing down
Her white clothes are now stained with blood and mud
The wind had picked up and every breeze sounds like an air attack by Li
The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin their dances and dodges
They glance off bamboos and each other while staying afloat
Finally Jen lands on the same stick of bamboo as Li
The two hold their positions for a while, as the bamboo bends
only let you go because  wanted to see the real you
Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely
What do you know about a true heart
Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree
The bamboo straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground
Jen quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li
Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo forest
- Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock about a few feet wide amid the rapids
Jen vaults onto the rock and scuffles with Li
Jen loses her balance
What do you want
What 've always wanted, to teach you
All right
If you can take back the sword in three moves, 'll go with you
Li takes the sword back
Give it back
Kneel
Never
Then you have no use for the sword
Li throws the sword into the rapids
Jen dives in to retrieve it
He follows Jen downstream by hopping from one rock to another
Jen recovers the sword but is herself drowning
Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the rapids and fishes Jen out
Jade Fox carries the unconscious Jen away
Li gives chase, but loses them
- It's raining
Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine paste and then dips a needle in the paste
She burns the needle point, causing a blue smoke
She lights some incense and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious
Sooner or later, they'd drag you back to Peking
Your parents will never accept you again
But why go home
We've gone this far, we won't stop now
You'll always be my lady
At last, we'll be our own masters
We'll be happy
That's the most important thing
All we have left is each other, right
Lie down and rest
Jen is too weak to respond
Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny
- Fox scurries ahead in the rain
Her eyes catch something, but she keeps moving
- Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu
She's crazy
You should have killed her
didn't have the heart
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it
Yu senses movement at the window
Looking out, she sees Jade Fox in the distance
- Jen wakes up, flushed from fever
She takes a sip from a cup of water -- it's empty
She tosses the cup, gets up, and walks into the rain
- Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the raindrops
Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li standing there
Jen limps towards him while mumbling
Is it me or the sword you want
Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes
You've been drugged
Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner
- Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to
Where is Jade Fox
Jen gestures that she doesn't know
Yu and Bo enter
Yu looks at Jen
What happened
Jade Fox drugged her
How did you get here
We followed Jade Fox
Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's direction
Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all, sending them flinging hither and thither
Fox shows herself
Li attacks her
She falls back, bleeding to death
And so you die
Li touches his neck
And so shall you
Li pulls a single needle from his neck
poisoned needle
You deserve to die, but the life was hoping to take
was Jen's
Ten years  devoted to you
But you deceived me
You hid the manual's true meaning
never improved
but your progress was limitless
You know what poison is
An eight-year-old girl, full of deceit
That's poison
Jen
My only family
my only enemy
Jade Fox dies
You can't die
Tell us what poison you used
You can't die
Tell us the antidote
You can't let Li Mu Bai die
She used Purple Yin
Purple Yin poison
It goes straight to the heart
My blood will soon reverse its flow
It's the same poison she used to kill my master
There is no antidote
That can't be
Everything has an antithesis
Why not this
The antidote exists
She taught it to me
The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare
Trust me
As you have helped me, let me help you
All right
Hurry
will hold on as long as  can
(takes the comb from her hair) Take my horse and go to the compound
Give this to Mrs
Wu
She'll help you
Hurry
Spare your energy
'll be back
- Bo is burying Fox in the rain
- The guards surround Jen
She pushes past them
Where is Mrs
Wu
Aunt Wu comes running out
Stop it
Jen pulls out Yu's comb
Shu Lien told me to show you this
Let her in
- Yu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational, eerily calm
Mu Bai, hold on
Give me some hope
Shu Lien
Save your strength
My life is departing
've only one breath left
Use it to meditate
Free yourself from this world as you have been taught
Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath
Do not waste it
for me
've already wasted my whole life
want to tell you with my last breath
have always loved you
would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side
as a condemned soul
than enter heaven without you
Because of your love will never be a lonely spirit
Yu cries
She kisses him lightly
He closes his eyes
- As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine in her hands
- Li is in Yu's arms
They're holding hands
The sun shines in
Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers -- he is dead
Jen is at the door
He's gone
Bo peeks over Jen's shoulder
Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny
Jen kneels
Yu raises the sword, but doesn't kill her
Bo
please take this sword back to Sir Te
He takes the sword from her
(to Jen) Now you must go to Wudan Mountain
Lo awaits you there
Promise me one thing, whatever path you take in this life
be true to yourself
- Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple gate, and sees Lo standing there
He runs to her
She greets him
- Jen and Lo make love
- Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him, Jen gone
- Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge
The gorges below are shrouded in clouds
She looks back at him
Do you remember the legend of the young man
" faithful heart makes wishes come true
" Make a wish, Lo
Lo pauses
(closing his eyes) To be back in the desert, together again
Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds
They seem to catch her gently, before she disappears into them
Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down his cheeks
