" " Screenplay by Robert Ramsey, Matthew Stone Ethan Coen & Joel Coen Based on a story by Robert Ramsey, Matthew Stone and John Romano 3/25/97 - It is late night, and deserted
Engine noise approaches; headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing
It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing -- a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with it
We hold as another car approaches
This one is a conservative sedan, whose occupant does not sing
The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt and cocked bow tie
He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing over his forehead, and he merrily sings "Casey Jones" along with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus
The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and approaches with its singing
The car enters and roars away
After a beat of quiet, the conservative sedan enters and recedes
We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel
The singing, squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a halt
The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a half-empty bottle of champagne
The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag
Number Seven
She trots away
The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself
He straightens his bow tie
He puffs his bounding forelock with one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection
Zing
The man enters and looks around
The young woman's dress is tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen
The man pulls an imaginary train whistle
Choo
Choo
He looks around, in a closet, under the bed
'm a locomotive, baby
'm the Wabash cannonball
'm a hunka-hunka burninnnnn' love
got fire in my boiler and a fuh -- a fuh -- He is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from behind the window curtain
salacious smiles spreads across his lips
He pulls on the cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductor's cap
Tickets, please
The man is stripping off his clothes
Excuse me, Miss, is this the train to Ecsssstasy
Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're comin' to a tunnel
Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed just as -- -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky black man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat rushes into the room with a video camera glued to his eye
He looks like Clarence Thomas with a mustache
'm gonna nail your ass
The young woman screams, clutching the sheets to her naked bosom
Rex leaps from the bed, still clad only in his chemindefer boxers, and darts around the room seeking egress
The man with the video charges around the room following Rex Rex is stumbling around the room in a panic, looking for his clothing
The camera swish-pans back to the young woman still screaming in the bed
'm gonna nail your ass
We swish-pan back to Rex as he bends over to pick up his trousers, mooning us
'm gonna nail your ass
To reveal that we are in the detective -- Gus Petch's -- office
nailed his ass
Faintly, from the television monitor we hear screaming and mayhem
' Trains
Watching the monitor,   is a sensual beauty, with intelligence and class
She watches the monitor without expression
thought he'd outgrown trains
Gus Petch sits behind a desk
They never grow-up, lady
They just get tubby
Me, 've always had ample proportions
But it's all muscle -- 'm hard as a rock
'm not on of these cream puff sit-behind-a desk private dicks; 'm an assnailer So  see
Faintly, from the monitor: 'm gonna nail your ass
We hear the Young Woman
Marylin reacts
Hard to believe that's the best he could do
Probably you're the best he could do
Oh
Thank you
You're takin' it pretty well
seen 'em weep like they'd hired me to prove their husbands weren't fooling around
And  seen 'em celebrate
Like  just handed 'em a winning lottery ticket
Marylin turns her attention back to the screen
'm just enjoying the movie
All from the perspective of a moving automobile
The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and wave at the camera
It is la dolce vita Los Angeles style
handsome, fortyish man in a town car talks into cellular phone
This is
-- hello Marjory, any messages
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Have Wrigley look up Oliphant v
Oliphant for its relevance to the Chapman filing
She took the kids where
Tahoe
Which side of Tahoe
Great
If the cruise goes all the way around the lake, she left the state and she's in breach
She can't leave the state
Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to attach everything
Primary residence, autos, stocks
(Beat) Sure
Put him through
(Beat) Hello Ross
What
She's sleeping with the nanny
Well, you're separated
She can sleep with -- is this the one you slept with
Oh guy
Interesting career choice
Hmmm
Yes
know you want her dead
Everyone in your tax bracket wants their ex wives dead
Rex is trying his key in the front door of his house
Finding it doesn't, work he rattles the knob, then leans on the doorbell
We hear distant chimes
Honey
Honey
Finally, through the intercom: Rex
Get away from the door
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this
We are
And it's winding down
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now
Everything  have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business
The business is my entire life
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe
Marylin
Rex
Go away
don't want to have to sic the dogs on you
Dogs
From inside the house we hear the menacing sound of On an interior wall; it says , ,  & pull back shows that we are in a waiting room, and a receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Rex Rexroth
Mr
Massey will be right with you
- Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm
The problem is that everyone is willing to compromise
That's the problem with the institution of marriage -- it's based on compromise
Even through its dissolution
One attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach
The process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the "goodies
" Some say, "Life is compromise
" But at Massey Myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent
The Receptionist pokes her head into the conference room
Your eleven o'clock is here
Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will continue this at the Associates Meeting next Friday
In the meantime, want you to consider this
Ivan the Terrible, Henry the , Attila the Hun -- what did they have in common
As he exits
Middle names
' You may have seen it in the issue before last of "World of Interiors
" There's a Rothko on the wall, an Elle Bleu humidor on the desk, peonies in the vase, and the diploma is from Yale
Mr
Rexroth
Rex, please
Miles Massey
Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign
Thank you
Now Rex
He leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest concern
-- Tell me your troubles
Rex, nervous, laughs ruefully
Jeez
Where do  start
Miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return
Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place
That's her job
You have to respect that
When  first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other
Not emotionally, of course
We just couldn't keep our hands off each other
Mm
But then
But then
Quietly
Time marches on
Ardor cools
No
Not exactly
It didn't exactly cool
Marylin is a knock-out
And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there
Ah
You know what  mean when  say "it
" Gotcha
No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex
Seems like there's more of it than ever before -- Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife
Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described
don't know
can assume
Not in court you can't
Has she retained counsel
'm not sure
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities
Video
Mmm
And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup
Rex hangs his head
Miles sighs sympathetically
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves
Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek
What are, for you, the parameters of the possible
That's the problem
can't afford to give her anything
Nothing
know that sounds rough but 'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and 'm mortgaged up to my ass
If this deal goes south, 'm ruined -- 'll lose millions
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear
Well -- is that possible
Miles smiles at him
-
- Marylin power walks along the San Vicente Bike Path with her friends   and
It's early, but the path is crowded with bikers, bladers, runners, power walkers, wheelchair racers etc
Ramona pushes her infant in a baby jogger
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow
didn't know Barry had a beach house
Neither did  until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name
(To Marylin) So who'd you hire
Ruth Rabino
She's a legend
Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman
She definitely did a Factor
She did a Harriman
Wow
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass
've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful
'll just keep having children think 'm pregnant, by the way
Ramona
Don't get Mia Farrow on us
Three is not Farrow
Who's Rex's guy
Miles Massey
Of Massey Myerson
Do you know him
By reputation
He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second
Muriel Rumsey
Who's she
Now
She's a night manager at McDonalds
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position
No
You like kids
can't have a baby with a man don't love
And  can't submit a child to divorce
It's not so bad these days
Kids like joint custody
Two sets of toys
Maybe next time
Maybe
We do have a man for you
Thorstenson Gieselensen
He just separated from his third
He's in fish
He is fish
She's keeping his name
And one of his planes
And all seven of his children And only two are hers
Please
'm not seeing anyone until this is over
One husband at a time
wish  had your discipline
We are close on the person on the witness stand, a woman in her 60's
Mrs
Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married -- Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession
was a hostess
For Trans-World Airlines
What is your husband's profession
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks
He's very successful
At the counsel's table in the foreground Miles chats, voice lowered with , a boyish, bespectacled junior associate
Beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing her testimony
Wait
He wants to give her
Nothing
And she has
Video
What the fuck
Miles turns to Wrigley with a look of indignation
He gestures to their surroundings
Wrigley
Sorry
Sometimes  have serious doubts about you
am very sorry
Am  mentoring the wrong mentee
No
You're not
could be mentoring Kramer
Kramer clerked for Scalia
Wrigley looks suicidal
(
) Couldn't you simply walk away from this abusive relationship
No, he had the videos
Anyway,  need a challenge
This -- He waves dismissively at the courtroom
-- is not a challenge
need something  can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs
He had a device he called the Intruder
Mr
Massey
ask again, if you have any questions for the complainant
'm sorry, your honor,  was just conferring with my associate
He rises
Now then, Mrs
Guttman
Do you know a gentleman named Morris Rudnick
Well, yes, Morris is my accountant
(sadly) Accountant
He reaches back and Wrigley puts a manila file in his hand
We would like to offer these photographs into evidence
- The receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Marylin and her attorney Ruth Rabinow
Ruth is a sturdy woman in her late 60's
If Mrs
Guttman had gone to law school
Mr
Massey will see you now
In the middle of the Massy Meyerson conference table is a large fruit and pastry plate
The door swings open
Miles rises
Ruth
They shake hands
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth
And you must be Mrs
Rexroth
And you must be Mr
Massey
They appraise each other for a beat
They are impressed and, they are impressive
As they settle in: (Sadly) Hello, Rex
Marylin
Are you alright
You lost weight
My whole metabolism is -- off
Miles has been staring at Marylin
She notices this, and smiles shyly
He snaps out of it
So, Ruth
How's Sam
Sam is Sam
He's taking up fly fishing
He's in a yert in Montana
yert
(To Rex) Ruth is a living legend, Rex
At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana
In a yert
What's a yert
(Dryly) ran into your mother at the radiologist last week
What
Oh, just a routine mammogram
She said to say hello
She's going to Positano with your brother's family
tight, terse smile from Miles
How nice
Positano is beautiful
Remember when we were there, Rex
We stayed in the Santo Pietro
That hotel on the cliff
Yeah
They drift for a moment
So, Miles
If you have a proposal, let's hear it
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation
My client has ruled that out
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice
That's delusional
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order
Ha Ha
(conceding the point) Heh heh
What's so goddamn funny
Miles lays a hand on his arm
Please -- let me handle this
He puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at Ruth
-- So much for the icebreakers
What're you after, Ruth
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets
Why only fifty percent, Ruth
Why not ask for a hundred percent
Oh brother
Here we go
Why not a hundred and fifty percent
Yes
Maybe you're right, Miles
Maybe we're being too conservative
Seventy five percent
Rex winces
Rubs his stomach
Marylin leans forward and whispers to him
Do you need a Tagamet
You have some
She removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with several vials of prescription drugs
These are yours
Not according to Mrs
Rabinow
She hands the pills to a grateful Rex
Their hands touch for a moment
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes
(Contrite) Sometimes  forget
She looks at him like a concerned parent
Miles and Ruth watch the interaction
(To the attorneys) 'm sorry
Where were we
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets
Are you familiar with Kirshner
Kirshner does not apply
Kirshner was in Kentucky
What's Kirshner
Please -- let me handle this
Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line
The primary residence and percent of the remaining assets
You're becoming tedious Miles
Aren't we going in the wrong direction
Shhh
Please
Let me do my job
(To Ruth) Buy a clue, Ruthie
Have you forgotten about Kirshner
Ruth stands and closes her attache case
See you at the preliminary
Miles calls to Ruth's retreating back
Fine
We'll eat all the pastry
Going through the door, Ruth doesn't react, but Marylin following, glances back -- bemused, but with a trace of a smile
Rex swallows two more tablets
He sits, looking despondent
think that went as well as could be expected
She always looked out for me
And she had private investigators assisting her
(Sentimental) She brought my digestive enzymes
In anticipation of making you sick
Maybe  should reconsider my
Miles looks at him
Shakes his head, sadly
superficial display of marital solicitude, and you lose your resolve
Rex
underestimated you
But 'm your attorney, and if you choose to reward her for that mediocre charade of spousal concern
He shrugs, helplessly
You're right
Screw her
- woman walking across a gymnasium floor
Suddenly, she's assaulted by a huge, grotesquely garbed assailant
His sweats barely cover his massive, overdeveloped musculature
On his head, a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet
He grabs the woman, yanks her back towards him
She reacts swiftly
With a ferocious "," she stomps on his foot, and smashes him in the face
The mugger raises his hands in a gesture of submission
We pull back and see that we are in a Self Defense Class
Two instructors, two "muggers" and ten women students all wearing -shirts with the words -Personal Safety
Marylin and Sarah sit against the wall
don't know what his game is
He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals
And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable
Well what does he want
don't know
Ruth kept her cool, but  could tell she was surprised
He has a reputation for being tough
Marylin watches as a new "victim" begin her walk across the gym
(Grinning) Lilly's up
Oh, God
The mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward the "victim
" She glances over her shoulder, and at the sight of the monster bearing down on her, screams and runs to the exit
Marylin and Sarah giggle, but reproachful looks from the other students force them to affect concerned looks
(Whispers) Every week -- 'm dying
The two Instructors and the Mugger try to coax the sobbing woman back into the room
They clasp her in an empathic group hug
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence
If  didn't know better, 'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination
So where are you now
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court
Shit
Get this
He called and invited me to dinner
The , a vivacious phys ed major, approaches Marylin
Marylin
Ready
Huh
Oh, yeah
Sure
Marylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage, passing the traumatized Lilly
That's completely odd
Marylin begins the Victim walk
The Mugger quickly moves up from the rear
(To Sarah) know
That's why  accepted
Find out what's up with this clown
The Mugger is upon her
He grabs her hair
She stomps his foot, and smoothly wheels around  him in the nose with her elbow, while   in the groin
The women Cheer
That was excellent, Marylin
But you forgot to yell "no
" Ah
(Calmly, to the Mugger) No
: - Miles rises from his seat as Marylin enters
Mrs
Rexroth
Thank you for coming
The Maitre d' is pulling out a chair for her
have to admit
was curious
And hungry
' Something to start
Some wine, perhaps
Miles glances at the wine list
French
(She smiles) Bordeaux
Hmmm
Chateau Margaux '57
Miles nods at the maitre d' who returns the nod and withdraws
assume this is on Rex
Isn't everything
Miles regards her
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but  was unprepared
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery
" Miles leans back, props his chin on one fist, and considers her
Simon & Garfunkel
She laughs
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin
Did you see the tape
Not yet
See the tape
Then we can discuss my heart
waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which Miles sips and -- He nods at the waiter who pours two glasses
Tell me Mr
Massey
What was your performance about this afternoon
What does your lawyer think
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down
But you don't agree
How do you know
Why would you be here
told you
was hungry
a menu enters frame
It is handed to Marylin; another is handed to Miles
'll have the tournedos of beef
And the lady will have the same
(To Marylin) assume you're a carnivore
know you do
She addresses the waiter
Risotto with white truffles, please
Miles looks at her with appreciation
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight
" You didn't ask me here to pick me up
You could get in trouble for that
Not really
You're not my client
Freedom of association
Big issue with the First Amendment fans
Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend
Have you ever been married, Miles
No
You don't believe in it
As a matter of fact, 'm a huge fan
You just haven't met the right person
No
haven't
Have you
She regards him for a moment
All right, Miles
Let me tell you everything you  you know
was married to Rex for a long time was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend
There was only one thing  did wrong during the five years we were together got five years older
Think he should be able to ditch me for that
He wants a reconciliation
See the tape
Then we can discuss reconciliation
Rex screwed up and nailed his ass
Now 'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it
Then 'm getting on with my life
That's all 'm after
Gotcha
What is it you're after, Miles
Oh, 'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount
Well, don't look at mine
(
) Oyez
Oyez
Family court for the fifth district of Los Angeles County is now in session
large black woman in judicial robes and raiment enters from behind the Solomonic Platform
-- The Honorable Marva Munson presiding
All rise
Massey, Wrigley, and Rex Rexroth in between, rise
Rex and Wrigley remain respectfully standing, facing forward, as they whisper out of the side of their mouths: Have you sat before her before
Wrigley considers
-- the judge sits
We argue
We argue before her
She sits before us
Okay
Has she sat before you before
You can't sit before her
That's the rule
She sits before we argue
Miles glances over and hisses: Shut
Up
We are on a close lateral track of the jurors faces as they sit, with earphones on, in the darkened courtroom, illuminated by a flickering  monitor
Leaking tinnily through the headsets we hear a very faint: 'm gonna nail your ass
The track ends over at Marylin's table, where Marylin also wearing headphones, looks on with studied stoicism
Ruth lays a consoling hand on her shoulder
Marylin Rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on the witness stand
She is modestly dressed and her attitude is one of shocked, wounded innocence
was devastated
Of course
Thank you, Mrs
Rexroth
Mr
Massey, any questions
Miles soberly rises
Mmmm -- He paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be lost in thought
Marylin watches him
Finally Miles, still pacing, declaims: "Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery
" Marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled irritation
Miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a faint smile
Do you know those lines, Mrs
Rexroth
Marylin examines him with guarded eyes
Ruth sensing something unscripted going on, tries to cut it off
Objection, your honor
Grounds
Uh
poetry recitation
Let me rephrase
Mrs
Rexroth, how high is that wall around your heart
Marylin eyes him suspiciously
Your honor, this is harassment
Arid frankly it's still a little
She flutters one hand
arty farty
Rephrase
Mrs
Rexroth, have you ever been in love
Marylin hesitates, gives a "what does this mean look" to Ruth
She returns a "beats me
" Yes
loved my husband, Rex
And you've always loved him
Smiles slips out: "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight
" Miles returns a fleeting smile
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him
Yes
Why is that so difficult for you to understand
She looks at Rex with tender sorrow
Rex was -- is -- a very appealing man
am sorry  couldn't
(Tearing up) tried my best
Miles almost smiles
She's good
That'll be all Mrs
Rexroth
Please forgive me for causing you additional anguish
(To the Judge) Thank you, Your Honor
No further questions
Bailiff offers to help Marylin off the stand
She politely and courageously declines
Who's next, Mrs
Rabinow
We rest, Your Honor
Mr
Massey
Yes, Your honor
call Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg
Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg
Marylin, in the process of reseating herself behind her table, pauses
Ruth notices this and leans in
Who's that
Jesus
An attractive woman in her mid fifties advances to be sworn
She was a beauty, but her glory days are past and she's not taking it well
She looks tense and slightly hypo-manic
She speaks in a breathy, giggly voice, and smiles frequently for no apparent reason
Mrs
Isenberg
Banderas
Mrs
Banderas, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God
Yes, Mr
Bailiff
do
Now, Mrs
Banderas
What is your relationship to Mrs
Rexroth
We don't have much of a relationship anymore
haven't seen her since before she married Rex
We had some very nice times prior to that
We were quite close
(To Marylin) Is this a lover
Please
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs
Rexroth
You know -- you are her
Mother
What
Marylin sighs
Her Mother
Patricia smiles coyly
Gives Marylin a silly little wave by way of greeting
Hi, Sweetie
Hard to believe  know
'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters
(Mumbles) He'll regret this
Have you ever met Mr
Rexroth
No
haven't
But 've been out of town
(Little girlish wave) Hello, Rex
Hello there
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law
No
Uh uh
don't think so
Hmm
No
Well
no
Objection, Your Honor
This isn't about Mrs
Rexroth's filial obligations
Sustained
Did you know Mrs
Rexroth was married
Of course
Of course she was married
What else would she be
Single don't think so
She laughs merrily at some private joke between her and her psyche
Let me tell you something about Patty
Who's "Patty
" Oh
That's her name
Patricia
Like mine
was Pat and she was Patty
But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot
" To Marylin
After Marylin Monroe
see
And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin
When she was a tiny girl
And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up
She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman
She always said -- (Very Shirley Temple) "When  grow up,  want to be divorced
" She laughs happily at the memory
Divorce was her childhood aspiration
Well, not just divorce
She used to say " want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy
" And  guess her dream is coming true
(To Marylin) 'm happy for you Patty '   - Pasta being cooked
Salad being tossed
Wine glasses are filled
It's Girl's Night at the beach
It was like that scene in The Godfather
Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family
And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother
They brought the brother from Sicily
And Frankie can't say a word
He can't testify
That's what it was like seeing Pat in there couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her
Why do you think she did it
(Shrugs) Maybe she wanted a free trip to
Maybe they offered her money
Massey is very seductive
Who knows
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed
That stinks
They left you with absolutely nothing
It makes you wonder about the entire legal system
Like Rodney King
They bought her speech
If  was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any
That doesn't make sense
It's like punishing you for being goal oriented
Well, you can live here as long as you want
Do you have any plans
Nothing specific, but 'll have my own place soon
So, Marylin
Is that what you said when you were a little girl
Probably
Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice
What was supposed to say
Anthropologist
begged you to have a baby
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub
You're not
No
'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine
: - Miles is at his weekly chess game with his college friend, , a disaffected plastic surgeon
Miles, Cohiba in hand, studies the board
Dr
Ken sips his Merlot
Moves a piece
She got absolutely nothing
Zero
Zip
So
won't be seeing her
Your clients usually visit me after the settlement
Not this one
Not unless her covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need
Everyone needs plastic surgery
You need it
don't need it
You want Botox
What the hell is Botox
It's a form of botulism
just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them
Why in God's name would  want
No frown lines
(Notices Miles watch) New watch
It's a LeCoultre Revers
You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones
Why would you need two time zones
You never leave Beverly Hills
It was a gift from a client
Set one side for Bel Air
Botox
Christ
We had aspirations when we were in college
We did not
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon
was going to clerk for the Supreme Court
was going to play golf
You were going to have Asian girlfriends
Denial is not a river in Egypt
Kenneth moves a chess piece
You're in check
should be in therapy
' Miles addresses  , a client
Yes
Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures
And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious
But Bonnie, who is the real victim here
Let me suggest the following
Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you -- (Reacts) Well,  wouldn't say -- Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly -- He -- Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing -- They hate each other -- So he says now
But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own
As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man
He stares contemplatively at the ceiling and, after a beat, responds to the silence: Am  going to far here
squawk box interrupts with a female voice
Mr
Massey, Mr
Meyerson would like to see you when you have a moment
Miles is surprised
Herb wants to see me
When you have a moment
Slatted shades are drawn against the sun
It is dim, gloomy
We can just make out the shape of an ancient man -- small, hunched -- seated behind an enormous desk
gallows shape next to him is hard to make out; it is tall, rail thin and fixed with a swinging, glinting appendage
voice -- old, dry, rasping, lightly accented of a long- gone Brooklyn boyhood -- seems disembodied and sourceless, as if it is the voice of the gloom itself
Thoity-six objections sustained, tree overruled; fawteen summary judgements sought, toiteen ranite, eighteen movments to voice fuh respondent's prejudice, eighteen ranite which is a hunnut pissent An arm is being extended toward us and the glinting appendage swings with it: we see that it is an  which snakes down and into the hunched man's suit sleeve
-- Twelve cawt days on the Rexrawt case alone; tree hunut'n twenty billable hours paralegal soivicies; four hunnut'n two billable associate counsel and consultative; six hunnut'n eighty billable at full attorney rate and eightyfive lunches charged
Miles takes the man's offered hand, withered and roped with veins, and accepts its clammy shake
-- Counseluh, you are the engine that drives this foim -- He leans back in his chair, breathing heavily, and runs a tongue over his sandpapery lips
He is wearing oversize Swifty- Lazar style glasses, heavily tinted in spite of the dark
At length Thank you Herb
Miles sits behind his desk, fingers steepled, staring at nothing, a haunted look on his face
His intercom : Mr
Massey -- Please
No calls
'm feeling very fragile
'm sorry, Mr
Massey, but  felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you
Marylin Rexroth
When does she -- She's here now
Miles runs his fingers through his hair, carefully examining himself in the mirror
Suavely smiling
Marylin
How nice
He clears his throat, begins again with lower pitch, suave smile still in place Marylin
How lovely, uh -- He runs a finger across his teeth, which squeak, then puts back the suave smile -- Marylin
What a pleasure -- On Miles as he opens the door, suavely smiling
Marylin, what a pleas -- who the fuck are you
Facing him in the doorway is a large roughly handsome middle aged man in a business suit
Just behind him is Marylin Rexroth, looking as coolly beautiful as ever
She smoothly puts in: Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may  introduce Howard
Doyle of Doyle Oil
told you we know each other, baby
Mr
Massey represented my ex-brother- in law
Martin Reiser
Oh
Right
Won't you have a seat
(To Marylin) After you, Doll
Marylin glides into the office
Seats herself on the couch
Doyle sits next to her, one proprietary hand on her knee
And how is Mrs
Reiser
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint
Naturally, she misses her kids
Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair
Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop
So she's uh, flourishing
She makes felt wallets
Got one right here
Doyle pulls out a deranged piece of felt stuffed with money
Most of the contents slip to the floor
Yeah
know
Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do
Miles,  know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so 'll come to the point
Howard and  are planning to marry
Miles is stunned
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh
Yep
My divorce just came through
Shoulda called you
Coulda cut a better deal
My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children
But,  don't know
Guess 'm just a softie
After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin
She was your best friend
(Thinks) Sixteen years
Howard Jr
is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve
(To Miles) Here
Got pictures
He removes a family photo from the felt wallet
It's of Howard and two fat teenagers
Apparently the former Mrs
Doyle was cut out, but an ear and part of a hairdo are sill visible in the shot
uh guess congratulations are in order
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and
Honey,  don't think this is really relevant to
and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch
Just a shoulder to cry on deal
One thing leads to another and before  know it -- -- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another
No
had no idea until after, but -- He looks at her with predatory lust
Baby
You are so
(Coy) Howard
He pulls her close to him and plants a massive kiss on her
What a touching story
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same
This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but
(man to man) like my women with two boobs
Miles flashes Marylin a "you are " look, but she assiduously avoids eye contact
Howard and  are here, Miles, because have learned through bitter experience that when it comes to matrimonial law, you are the very best
Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned
was slandered in court
You did good, Massey
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard --  wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement
And -- there's no talking her out of it
Believe me, 've tried
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated
She said "penetrate
" Heh heh heh
He gropes her
She giggles like a teenager
Oh, for the love of
That is true, isn't it Miles
Your pre-nup is the best there is
That is correct
Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law
Harvard
Whoa, Daddy
just want to make sure that you both -- He eyes Marylin
-- understand what you're asking for here
The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during
No one can profit from the marriage
The pre-nup protects the wealthier party
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck
No wriggle room
Wriggle Room
Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house
Screw the screening room
(slightly sickened) -- and we are sure
Eyes boring into Marylin
-- we are both sure that's what we want
Absolutely
Course  can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again
Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl
(laughing) We'd better go before we get thrown out
Marylin and Howard wait for an elevator as Miles trots out to catch them
Excuse me, Mr
Doyle, if  could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment
What part
'd just like to have a word with her
Why not
'm going to have her for a lifetime
Miles drags her to the side as Doyle checks his Sports Pager
What are you doing
She backs up as he tries to close the space between them
Getting married
To him
He's a sick freak
He's passionate
Passionate
He's a pervert
He should have to register when he moves
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time
Marylin
Listen to me
No
You listen to me
(Very quiet and deliberate) You busted me, Miles
You left me with nothing
What did you expect me to do
Get a degree in counseling
Write a book about table linen
Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, 'm not quite ready for that
But why him
We told you
We realized we've always been in love
He has backed her against the wall of an alcove which shelters a flowering ficus
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged
So  hear
Is that all
No, that's not all
He moves to kiss her
You fascinate me
She deftly slides out of the way
Miles watches her as she heads down the hall
As she gets on the elevator, Howard grabs her butt with one hand, while giving Miles a high sign with the other
'  - Miles stares at the chessboard
Do you think 'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family
Got any symptoms
Yes
The inability to experience pleasure
Oh
That
(beat) Don't waste time with your queen
What
The Center Counter Defense
The thing is not to move your queen too early
She can't really love that idiot, can she
What
Marylin Rexroth
She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle
Doyle Oil
(Miles nods) Massey Pre-nup
(Miles nods again) She loves him
He's the wrong man
Miles
Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either
- From behind the bower,   emerges, strumming his guitar and singing: Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme -- Remember me to one who lives there
pullback reveals Howard
Doyle before the altar with Marylin
He is in a tuxedo and yarmulke
She is dressed in a simple, Kennedy-type gown
-- she once was a true love of mine
The last arpeggiated chord rings out; birds tweet, everyone sits
As Miles and Wrigley seat themselves, Wrigley is sniffling
Miles is irritated
What the hell is wrong with you
can't help it
Even with the business we're in,  -- it gets me every time
It's so -- optimistic
Is she going through with it
As the crowd quiets with the end of the song, Wrigley murmurs: If she's not going through with it, she's cutting it awful close
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme
Ingredients
Spices
Spicy ingredients for the banquet we call -- life
Marriage is like a Great Feast
Courtship is the Appetizer
small mixed green taste of things to come
The Early Years -- The First Course -- a carefully poached fish dish dependent on freshness and delicate handling
Or perhaps a light pasta -- a tortellini stuffed with cheese and hope
(Whispers, to Miles) You have any gum or mints
The main course -- Mature Love -- a hearty stew, cooked slowly in the oven of companionship until the meat falls off the bone
And then -- dessert
The reward for years spent together -- the sweetness of a Life Well Lived
sorbet of grandchildren, followed by the decafe demitasse of retirement
There is silence, broken only by the twitter of birds and the restlessness of a hungry audience
Finally: Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang though the lean years as well as those that are heavily marbled
do
And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel
The stock in your sauce
do
Argh
Heads turn
Miles bites a knuckle
Birds twitter
Then, by the power vested in me by the state of California, and as the maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star Restaurant of Life,  now pronounce you -- man and wife
kiss
Cheers
Applause
Rabbi Bolensky strolls through the crowd with a heaping platter of smoked salmon
Miles is darkly brooding as Wrigley opens a Tiffany box to show him the contents
What do you think
What are they
Berry spoons
Spoons
Honestly Wrigley, 'm surprised at you
What is this
Some Martha Stewart suggestion
Those are the most cockamamie things 've ever -- Miles -- why so angry
Miles sounds wistful: Why couldn't we be the club sandwich
Ding Ding -- Howard
is tapping a knife against his wine glass
The crowd quiets
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: have something to say to my bride
Howard
turns to one side to address Marylin, taking one of her hands between his paws, as she beams up at him
-- Darling, like the rabbi said
life is a banquet,  Grand Bouffe, and Marylin, darling
just want you to know that  am  the kitchen and
Laughter from the gallery
And 'm going to start this marriage by
Because the hot hors d'oerve of this love story is -- Pre-nup Primavera
He reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of paper
Carmine
Bring on the Pesto
Caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of Doyle
Marylin looks on, surprised and bemused
-- This is for you, darling
He starts tearing strips off the piece of paper, dipping them into the sauce, and eating them
His mouth stuffed with paper, Doyle repeats: -- this is for you, Darling
The crowd is murmuring--the murmurs grow in volume -- a smattering of applause -- cheers -- more applause -- wild cheers
Slowly rhythmically, Miles starts thumping his hand together, nodding comprehension
Brilliant
Next to him Wrigley is puzzled
Why is he doing that
Miles' hand-clapping accelerates
Brilliant
It's brilliant
He's eating the pre-nup
Wrigley's eyes widen
He looks back at Doyle eating the paper
This is for you, Darling
Wrigley bursts into tears
That's -- the most romantic thing 've ever seen -- in my
,
Marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations
Miles approaches and draws her aside
'd like to offer my congratulations
That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's
Howard is a beautiful person
Yes
He's a diamond in the rough
And  have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough
Miles
Miles
Miles
am thrilled for you, but tell me this
How'd you get Howard to do it
've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea
It was his idea
It was a gesture of love and trust
Be happy for me, Miles
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me
(She holds a plate of food for him) Have you tried the duck
figure a couple of months
That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry
He takes the plate of food from her
It has bones
Be sure to swallow one
Although knowing you as  do -- there will be no settlement
This time it will be complete and total annihilation
With a  we  : uniformed pilot and copilot are cruising the corporate jet high above a vast ocean of clouds
The pilot is wearing a headset
After a long moment of listening he shakes his head
Jesus -- - What --
-- 've heard some -- 've heard some sick things -- in my -- - What
The pilot reaches above his head and throws a small toggle switch and the cockpit is Awash with the sound of screaming, laughter and music: Oh Casey Jones was the rounder's name, 'was on the 6:02 that he rode to fame
Screaming with laughter, two naked damsels in conductor's caps are pushing Rex Rexroth around the cabin on a miniature locomotive
He is wearing his railroad boxers and bellowing "The Ballad of Casey Jones
" - Who is that guy
Rex Rexroth, the mini-mall king
Getting to be the richest man on the West Coast, from what they say
The copilot shakes his head
- Jesus
Hup
Come all you rounders if you wanna hear
- Why're they going to Muncie
The pilot shrugs
He's thinking of buying Indiana

And of course we shall have to litigate

Nevertheless, we question whether the continuing expenses for his special ed classes are truly justified given the great strides -- Wrigley enters
'm sorry 'm late
was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant
Guess what
Marylin Rexroth is divorced
(Delighted) and  hear she's richer than Croesus
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs
Croesus
She could buy and sell you ten times over
She deserves every penny
They pay great athletes a fortune
Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power
He hits the call button
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle
What
She owes me a meal
'd stay away from her, Miles
know you would, Wrigley
But would Kramer
We hear the Receptionist Voice: Mrs
Doyle for you
We move in on one of the tables where Marylin and Miles sit as a waiter pours them champagne
Le Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, 1982
Thank you
'll take care of it
As he fill Marylin's glass: Raises his own in a toast
To victory
don't feel victorious Miles feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated
have pictures of him with another woman
More pictures
My God, Marylin
You can open an erotic art gallery
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs
No
Just to comfort you, and appreciate you -- (Reproachfully) You really think  engineered the whole thing
You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme
You came here to celebrate because you think 'm without morality or soul
You -- (With difficulty) sound like my mother
The Waiter hands Miles a menu
Should we order
Yes,  -- well, 'm not really
Not hungry, huh
Neither am
long pensive moment
Miles reaches across the table and takes her hand
She lets him
He strokes it
Miles drives
Marylin sits silently looking out the window
Miles pulls up to the huge house
Thank you
And good-night
He takes her hand again
Marylin -- She puts a finger to his lips
Sadly, Miles relinquishes her hand
She exits the car and walks up to the front door
Miles watches her go
- We hear Court  on in the background
Miles alone in bed, reading Art In America
Witness is being examined by the Prosecutor: and he asked you if
if  reckon  could find someone to keel him his wife
Who asked you this
Dean Leonard
Da defendant
(Points to the defendant) That guy

There are distant, echoing wails
Along a pointing suitcoated arm
Eighteen hunnut billable hours
Twelve hunnut'n twenty-one motions tuh void
The woozy track finds the cadaverous hand at the end of the arm with an  tube swinging from it
Miles stands next to the arm
He's holding an assault type weapon
five nunnut'n sixty faw summary judgenents
hunnut'n twenty-nine thousand four hunnut'n seventeen lunches charged
Miles shoots -- Bonnie falls
Then Mrs
Guttman
Marylin is next
Miles hesitates
Counseluh
Counseluh
Miles points the gun at Herb
He bolts up in bed, sweating
He gazes stuporously about, reaching for the ringing phone
Hello
Miles
Yes
Marylin
You're right about me
am worthless
am nothing
don't deserve to live
Marylin
When did  say
don't blame them for betraying me
don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father
You see, Miles, 'm going to tell you something about me
Something you may or may not know
suck
We hear the  of Tires
(yelling at someone) Screw you, asswipe
Marylin
Forgive me but are you -- drunk
little
(Scream) You get out of the car
That's right, Fuctard
'm talkin' to you
You shouldn't be driving
Where are you
'm on Sunset
Near the Beverly Hills hotel
Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo
live right near there
The 800 Block of Maple
Come here
Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here
Okay
Should  stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for -- No
Don't stop
Okay Miles
- Marylin sits in the den
She's had some coffee and, although teary and disheveled, is no longer psychotic
just cried when  got home
Somehow, your disdain for me -- 'm pretty tough Miles, but 'm human
All my life people have been ascribing these terrible motives to me
used to think they were jealous, or they didn't understand, but
dunno
Maybe others see something in me
Something 'm not even aware of
Anyway, thank you for letting me come here
guess  was a little drunk
She takes the coffee cup and has a sip
She looks like a lost waif
You have a very nice home, Miles
Very inviting
Thank you
You have wonderful art
love that lithograph
Hockney
Yes
just got that, actually
It was a gift
From a -- girlfriend
No
No
don't have a
no
It was from a client
No kidding
'll bet you have some very grateful clients
What'd Rex buy you
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans
Marylin looks at a photograph Miles has on a side table
The Woman has her arm around one of them
The other stands close to her
Smiling, but awkward and tentative
Is that you
Me
Yes
Oh
And that is -- mom
Yeah
Mom
Mom and brother
You look like you were a very sensitive child
You have expressive eyes
Miles walks over to look at the picture
Hmmm
And your mother was very beautiful
She must be proud of you
She never particularly cared for me
She didn't love you
No
She loved me
She would never not love her son
She just didn't
wasn't her "type
" She said  was a very, colicky baby
You know
Difficult
Not a good sleeper
Didn't eat well
We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup -- She held that against you
Apparently she was very disappointed
Boy
Boy, oh boy
Marylin looks at the picture again
And yes -- you can see how hesitant Miles was
Marylin is moved
flash of something genuine crosses her face
And here  thought my mother was
Your mother was
Oh right
You met Patricia
She takes a sip of coffee
Regards Miles
We're damaged goods
No, we're not
We are, Miles
You know 'm right
There's something "off" about you and me Miles
And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on
Maybe
That is bullshit
Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho
can't believe you're saying this, Marylin
There's nothing wrong with us
We're attractive and charismatic and successful and
like us
'm sorry Miles
You shouldn't listen to me
'm sure you have a very fulfilling life
'd better go
'm depressing
No
Thank you for the coffee
It's very robust
She stands
Picks up her purse
Walks over to him with an outstretched hand
Friends
Don't go
Stay with me for a while
He doesn't release her hand
Instead he draws her to him, and kisses her
She kisses him
He kisses her back
She
: - Mile and Marylin -- making love
They are in post coital wrap
have to say -- 'm speechless
No
'm never speechless
'm a little embarrassed
'm not used to losing control with such -- volume
And 'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something  want to ask you
What is it Miles
want
want to
She waits, puzzled
want to be your -- your wife
Huh
No
That wasn't right
want to be  wife
Did you just propose to me
Yes
am
What else could those words mean
believe we belong together and we can make one another happy
And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin
You have more experience at this than  do
Yes
Yes
Yes, you do have more experience
Yes, Miles
accept
You do
Do you want me to sleep on it
No
Do you want to sleep on it
No ma'am
have been asleep all my life up to this moment
Marylin, will you marry me
Yes
Again
They kiss
don't have a ring
know
have a watch
She laughs
Kisses him
'm happy
Miles and Kenneth wait
Dressed in suits
Miles looks nervous
'm happy for you, pal
Thanks, buddy
Is she Asian
Asian
No
Well

Wrigley, rushes in, carrying a briefcase
Wrigley
Miles
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley
Wrigley this is my friend, Dr
Beck
The plastic surgeon

Do you have it

You have the pre-nup
No

Was  supposed to have a pre-nup
No
You have the ring
Wrigley has the pre-nup
Oh

Marylin enters
She looks outstanding
Her friends, Sarah Sorkin and Ramona Barcelona (who is now visibly pregnant) accompany her
Dr

Of course you do
You're Dr

Sarah Sorkin
Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey
Hello Miles
Congratulations Miles
Hi
Hello
(To Marylin) Marylin
You know my young associate, Wrigley
do
He was at my divorce and my wedding
What would a marital related event be without Wrigley
It has become a tradition, hasn't it
loved the berry spoons
(Wrigley beams) didn't have any
Thank you
Well, Wrigley brought something else for you today, darling
Wrigley pulls a sheaf of papers from the briefcase
This -- is the Massey Pre-nup
Wrigley hastily pulls a ballpoint from his pocket and clicks it
Miles grabs the pre-nup, and as he turns to Marylin, his tone softens
Marylin, you're welcome to examine it, but as you know -- it's iron clad
It is
It's famous
tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well -- The Judge is here
Over here, Judge Munson
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing
Yes
Short notice you know, but think there's nice closure to it
Hello Judge Muson
pleasure as always
What's up with you two
We're getting married
Judge laughs
What's the gag
gag
No
Marylin looks at the pre-nup
Then pulls Miles aside
Excuse me, Judge Muson
You got it, Patty
(To Miles) You brought a pre-nup to our wedding
Yes
(She isn't having the expected reaction) It's for your protection, sweetheart
You're the one with the -- the
-- the coin
Miles
don't want to sign this want this marriage to be different
Okay
Judge Munsen and Wrigley are here, but other than that
Should  go out for a smoke
No
Judge -- just a sec
But Marylin, if we sign it,  can't hope to benefit from the marriage
(Sadly) Oh Miles
What  mean is, your wealth is completely protected
As if a lead veil had been drawn across
She looks deep into his eyes
Into his soul
Miles
Listen to me
You are about to become my husband
don't want to be protected from you
want to be protected for you
(Moved) Ohhh
But
want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property
That's all 've ever wanted
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed
want to be exposed
You're vulnerable
It's about time
You're a sitting duck
(To Miles, with great affection) Quack
Miles and Marylin stand before the alter
Do you, Miles Herbert Massey of Massey Meyerson take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth- Doyle
Yes
"Doyle", to be your lawful wedded wife to -- do, yah  do, uh huh -- Let me finish
She glares at Miles
-- Jesus
Haven't you ever been married before
Chastened, Miles bows his head
-- To have and hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part
There is a long beat, through which Miles stares at his shoes
Marylin looks at him
--  do
And do you, Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth Doyle, take Miles Herbert Massey of Massey Meyerson, to be your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part
do
now pronounce you man and wife
Wrigley bursts into tears
: - Miles and Marylin asleep in bed
The
Miles wakes, turns to his beautiful wife -- kisses her good morning
She gives him a sleepy Smile
Miles dressing for work
Marylin, in a Sabia Rosa bathrobe places a tray with coffee next to him
He holds up two ties for her-approval
She selects one
He puts it on
Miles and Marylin reading Newspapers while eating breakfast
She serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates Wrigley's berry spoons
They laugh heartily
Marylin waves good bye as Miles backs drives to the office
She waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the lawn
He has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married life
Due to its brevity -- these pictures are uneventful, the Massey's wear the same outfit in most of them
Miles works
He is interrupted by the voice of his
have Mrs
Massey on line one for you
Miles picks up
Mom
He laughs and laughs
We hear Marylin's laughter coming through the receiver
Miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips
Marylin at the doorway, greets Miles as he arrives home
As Miles changes into his casual after work outfit, (khakis
) Marylin sits at the edge of the bed
He's telling her about his day, and she is rapt with attention
The Massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta
The tulips are in the middle of the table
Miles and Marylin snuggle on a couch and watch Seinfeld
Miles in bed on the new Frette Linen
few too many pillows, but he's making it work
Marylin enters the bedroom in a nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and nastiness
He puts down his book as she gets into bed with him
They gaze at one another -- the picture of contentment and impending lust
- -   - Miles is addressing the young associates
For the first time in my life, stand before you naked
vulnerable
and in love
Love word matrimonial lawyers shy away from
Ironic isn't it -- that  have been frightened of this emotion which is, in a sense, the seed of my livelihood
But today,  am here to tell you: Love should cause us no fear
Love should cause us no shame
Love
is good
(He lets it sink in) Let me ask you a question
When our clients come to us confused, angry, hurting because their flame of love is fluttering and threatens to die -- should we seek to extinguish that flame, so that we can sift through the smoldering wreckage for our paltry reward
Or should we seek to fan this precious flame -- this most precious flame -- back to loving, roaring life
The young associates look confused
Wrigley raises his hand
Extinguish
Should we counsel fear -- or trust
Should we seek to destroy -- or to build
Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love
(another raised hand) Kramer
Build
The decision of course, is each of ours
For my part,  have made the leap of love, and there is no going back -- Herb Myserson sits in the back of the room
He watches, breathing heavily
- Miles and Marylin watching a cable movie crowded together on the small sofa
'm sorry
'm squishing you
'll move to the
No
Stay
want you close to me
This couch is wrong
It's not a "married couch
" He surveys his surroundings with a critical eye
Honey,  could sit
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad
Hardly
You have six bedrooms know
But 've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things
Woman things
Personalize it
Marylinize it
Make this your house
He hands her a credit card
Here's my card
Spend as much as you want
We get mileage
Well,  suppose  could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie -- Good
(Beat) Are those foods
Fabric and fringe
Exactly
And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery
(He takes her hands) It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if  took out the refrigeration unit -- Miles
think a nursery should be right off the master suite
My parents put mine in the guest house
Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when was seven months old because  was so -- She stops him with a kiss
You want children, don't you
- pricey antique store near Melrose
You said 'yes' didn't you
said yes
She picks up an antique Chinese bowl
Is this Ming
It's not Ming
It's Tong
Is Tong older than Ming
think Ming is older than Tong
(To the Salesman hovering nearby) What is this
That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl
It's Chen dynasty
Ok
'll take it
He sets it aside next to the formidable pile of loot the girls have accumulated
can't do this anymore
Let's get some lunch
What about rugs
thought we were stopping at Mansour
Right
(To Marylin) And will this be check or --
She hands him the Platinum Visa
(Glances at it) Very good, Mrs
Massey
He trots off with the card
Marylin absently fingers an antique guided candelabra
(Sigh) Well
He said to "make the house mine
" Oh boy
If he only knew
Yeah
guess
You know -- What
He's not what  expected
He's very -- he's so -- happy
But you're going through with it
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know 've never been the first wife
Rex was married before me
So what
Miles is different
He's still so idealistic
Well, that's about to change big time
He has no cynicism or anger
For once 'm not the repository of rage at some other woman
Soon, you'll have your own rage
guess
- Miles is buying a huge bouquet of flowers
As he exits he is stopped by a
She is in her 40's but looks older
Wait
know you
Yes
You're Miles Massey
You probably don't recognize me
The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair
Excuse me
You ruined my life you sonofabitch
Gimme those
She grabs the flowers
Pulls petal off one of the roses and eats it
But my brother got you
He got you, you slimeball
runs over
Emily
What are you
(To the nurse) Is she yours
Howard Doyle is my brother
You know my brother, Howard Doyle
You do know my brother, don't you
'm sorry, Sir
Emily
Give the man back
Yes,  know Howard Doyle
He tricked you
With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup
Howard Doyle
He got you
You married Marylin, didn't you
You thought she had money Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me
And to Marylin Rexroth
Yeah
heard all about it
My brother Howard Doyle got you
(singsong) Neener neener neener
' Ruth calmly watches Miles ranting around her office
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his
What kind of sick -- Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle
They don't like the way you operate
They helped her
He never ate the pre-nup, did he
have no idea what Howard Doyle eats
'm not a damn dietician
Did Marylin end up with money
She's  wife
Why don't you ask her
Anyway,  assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup
don't have a pre-nup Miles hangs his head
Ruth sighs sympathetically
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars
Don't give me that crap
That's crap
And it's good
'll have you suspended
'll have you disbarred
Don't threaten me, Miles
did nothing illegal
why did she do it, Ruth
Why
That's attorney client privilege
(As she goes back into her work) Sorry, Miles
But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose -- - Marylin greets him at the door
Hi
Hello Marylin
have a surprise for you
bet
She brings him inside
The place has been massively accessorized
Antiques, rugs, lamps and assorted tasteful chatchkies
There is a new Biedermeyer couch in the den
Ta Da
Miles looks at it, expressionless
You don't like it
He stares at her -- a very dark look
You don't like me
(Flatly) love you
want to have your baby
What's wrong Miles
Did  spend too much
She retrieves all the receipts from her purse
Miles
have a very good relationship with all the salesmen
can return everything
Can you Marylin
Can you return the trust
Can you return the hopes
The dreams
Can you just
(Bitterly) Miles
You're scaring me
(Pulls himself together) 'm sorry, Darling
love it
It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and
It's you, Marylin
It is
Marylin is on the phone with Ruth
But Ruth -- things have changed -- yes -- yes  understand
But you see -- couldn't file, did
And maybe wasn't going to file
Maybe -- maybe Ruth -- Yes
Okay
-   - The bedroom door is closed
Marylin knocks repeatedly
Miles
Open the door, Miles
Please open the door
want to talk to you
Miles
'm coming in
Here come
She pushes the door open
No Miles in sight
On the bed, scrawled on a piece of mMm stationery, taped to one of the mMm Frette pillows -- a note which reads -- "If you prick us, do we not bleed
If you tickle us, do we not laugh
If you poison us, do we not die " ' Kenneth stares at the chessboard
Court  is on the background
We are back at the Trial of New Jersey v
Medrano
Mr
Medrano is accused of killing his wife, Alicia in 1992
He claims it was suicide
Let's return to the courtroom
See the action in the courtroom -- The Prosecutor shows the jury an extremely large handgun
How far would this gun have to be in order to inflict a wound without leaving powder burns on the scalp
Approximately three feet
And how could Mrs
Medrano shoot herself in the back of the head from a distance of three feet
Really long arms
He moves a piece
They won't get a conviction
The husband called it in as a suicide
The forensic guys weren't thinking murder
'm sure some of the evidence was compromised
It's your move, Miles
(Sadly) already made my move, Kenneth
private yoga class
Marylin, Sarah and Ramona are in the plow position
The yuppie Sikh instructor places his weight on Sarah
Vishu
Knock it off
That hurts
Breathe through it
Sarah tries a few deep breaths
Marylin concentrates hard
That's good, Marylin
don't even know where he is
He looked so devastated
If  could just talk to him for a few minutes
Was that the bell
It sounded like a bell
'll be right back
- Marylin walks to the door
Opens it
Two
Yes
Can  help you
Marylin Hamilton Rexroth Doyle Massey
Yes
We have a warrant for your arrest
What
-  - Marylin is photographed front and profile
She is finger printed; she is searched and relieved of her jewelry; and finally, she is throw into a holding tank with several other women -- trapped
She clings despondently to the bars
- Ruth is admitted to the holding area
- Police Officer walks down the hall
Unlocks the door
You can go now, Mrs
Massey
Someone made bail
Marylin exits
' Marylin sits next to Ruth
Forgery and Fraud
You used his credit card
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to -- Quite a little shopping spree
How do you spend six figures in less than six hours
Oh, never mind 've seen it before
've seen everything
Do you think he set me up
Do you think that was his intention
Like  know his intention
Or yours for that matter
(Sighs) should join Sam
'm too old for this bullshit
He never even asked
He just assumed -- He was right, wasn't he
So
Now what
Now
Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her
- Miles opens the door
Marylin is standing there
Well
Well
Well
Look who made bail
May  come in
don't know
Maybe  should grab my mace
'm a civil attorney
have little experience with "the criminal mind
" 'd just like to pick up a few of my things don't believe you have "things
" On the contrary
We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine
Marylin walks into the den
Sits on the new sofa
Comfy
What do you want
want to nail you ass
Are you threatening me, because 'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail
'm reporting you to the
The
They owe me
'm expecting a refund
He laughs
She looks at him, dead serious
'm clean with the
've reported every dollar 've ever made
Try again, girlfriend
'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin
'm talking about -- She opens a humidor and takes out a Cigar
(Chomping on the Cigar) Got a light
What kind of "stuff
" She reaches into her purse
Pulls out a Dunhill and expertly lights the cigar
Arty Farty stuff
(Pointing to the Hockney) Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans
Watches and mileage on private jets
Stuff, Miles
Stuff you get from grateful clients
Those are gifts
Salary
Unreported income
(Glancing at his watch) By the way, what time  it on Bellagio Road
You can't prove anything
don't have to
That's what the guys do
And they do it with great zeal
See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel
well, they feel like saps
And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel
(Puffing on the cigar) What is this
Romeo and Julieta
You're out of your league, Marylin
Rexroth was a primate
'm a professional
know
So am , right
And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service
He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague
(She stands to leave) think it's only fair to warn you: 'm going to file an action, Miles
And after a decent interval  plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house
Meaning my house
believe the residence will be part of the settlement
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you
Drop the bogus forgery charge and 'll forget about your generous friends slash clients
That's blackmail
That's marriage
She gives him a peck on the cheek
As she leaves: You'll always be my favorite husband
Miles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the paintings
He looks at the watch
And the cigars
And the picture of his mother
Pity you can't be here
You'd enjoy this
We pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under Herb Meyerson's wheelchair where it collects drainage
She now places it up on the  gantry and connects, and swaps the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage
We are once again in Herb Meyerson's gloomy office, its venetians blocking most of the light and making Herb a dark, enigmatic figure
This woman has humbled, shamed and disgrazed the entire foim
reverse shows Miles standing in front of Herb's desk
Yes Herb, Counseluh, this foim deals in powuh
This foim deals in p'seption
This foim cannot prospuh
nor long endowwa
if it is p'seeved as dancin' to the music
He waves his free arm to the beat of music unheard
-- of the hoidy-goidy
understand Herb
just
for the first time in my career -- don't know what to do
'm a patsy
sitting duck
'm lost
Lost
'll tell you what you can do, you can -- He brings himself up short and turns to the nurse
-- leave us
She heads for the door
-- You can act like a man
Let me tell you sumpn, smart guy
You tawt you had it all figgud out
Trust
Marriage
All ya goddamn love love love
Well now you lissean me
'm gonna talk to you about the goddamn He climbs unsteadily to his feet and tries to pace, gesticulating, with the  swaying dangerously behind him
-- We
We  the law
We make our goddamn bread and by the law
And sometimes, counseluh, we    -- He pauses to let this sink in
-- but conseluh -- This is not one a those times
- Miles is in bed, morosely watching Court
Close on   - We are interrupting our scheduled weekend coverage because we have just received word there is a verdict in the Kentucky v Leonard Case
We now join the case -- live
(Reads) Of the charges of murder in the first degree, we the jury find the defendant -- not guilty
Nikki speaks to her Guest Host
He got away with it
Simpson started a trend
: An edgy looking gangster,
He is perspiring heavily
He breathes through his mouth with the rasping wheeze of an asthmatic
His labored breath rattles as he stares across the table at someone off
At length, a voice: Are you Joe
Still staring, but perhaps by way of answer, the gangster raises an inhaler, sticks it in his mouth, and squeezes
Dumbarton
reverse shows Miles seated across a small round table in a seedy low-lit clam house
Photos of Ted Kennedy and the Pope adorn the walls
am here representing Mr
Dumbarton, on a
matter of some delicacy
Who's the pigeon
Excuse me
Who do you want me to kill
Well -- , uh, that is to say Mr
Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey
Is that
one person
Here's her picture
He is shoving an envelope across the table
and the address where she's staying
It's the residence of a Mr
Massey
Uh, Dumbarton
Massey
Uh, it's not Mr
Dumbarton's house
Though he's not involved
And because of an impending legal action this needs to happen within a certain
time frame
Uh
on an expedited basis
The gangster stares expressionlessly
He raises the inhaler again and, with his eyes still on Miles, squeezes
You're in a rush
Mr
Dumbarton is, yes
long beat
Finally, Miles explodes She won't suffer, will she
He bites a knuckle, gazing fearfully at the gangster
The gangster stares impassively back
not unless you pay extra
An enormous oak paneled room
Furnished with chairs sofas and a huge circular bed
fire roars in the far corner
On the wall above the bed a film loop is being projected -- soft core pornographic images
On the bed, Rex is surrounded by three naked beauties, smeared in cola dust and wearing conductor caps
've been working on the railroad -- All the livelong day
've been working on the railroad Just to pass the time away
Can'tcha hear the whistle
the whistle
Rex hunches over, clutching his left arm
One by one, the girls stop dancing and stare
There is a somber silence, broken by another
Awwwwwww -- The girls are all watching now
One of them steps forward
-- Whatsa matter, Rexie
' guest room
Dark, dirty and filled with empty bottles of expensive French wine
We hear a phone ringing in a different room
It rings several times
The figure on the bed stirs, rolls over, moans, clamps a pillow over his head
The ring of the distant telephone is interrupted and we hear a muffled voice: Hello
Yes, he's here
Just a minute -- We hear approaching footsteps and Kenneth enters the background, knotting a bathrobe
He turns on the light in the room
Miles
It's for you
The figure on the couch pulls away the pillow
It is indeed Miles Massey
He blearily takes the offered phone
Hello
Yes -- what
Yes --  see -- After another listening beat he drops the phone away
He remains staring dully out into space
My God
What
That was Marvin Untermeyer
Yes
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney
What do you mean, was
Rex just had a massive coronary
In the middle of a business meeting
He's dead
Kenneth is mildly puzzled
'm sorry to hear that
But you weren't close, were you
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old
He never redrafted it
Yes
Miles voice is still flat, expressionless: Everything goes to Marylin
He looks up a at Kenneth
She's rich
We're still married
We have no pre-nup
So, that's good, right
Miles paces with the telephone
He punches numbers with the thumb of the hand holding the phone; his other hand holds a coffee cup from which he takes trembling slurps
This is Joe
Wuddya need
Then a beep
Joe
This is Mr
uh
friend of -- we met
This is to instruct you it's No Go
Do you understand me on Marylin Rexroth Doyle -- No Go
He slams down the phone
Who was that
That was -- oh, shit
What if he's on his way over there
Huh
Consumed with remorse, Miles moans
Marylin
What have  done
don't know, but don't call me Marylin
Miles drives, speeding, taking corners hard while punching numbers into his car phone
Get her out, buy some time; get her out -- - In the bedroom, the phone starts ringing
hand enters to pick it up
We follow the hand up to reveal Hello
Marylin
Miles
Miles
Where have you been
've been trying to get in touch
You have to leave the house immediately
will, Miles
will leave
But Miles -- No buts
Now
Out
Just listen to me
'm sorry, Miles
It's true that my initial intention was to
Please
Leave the house
fell in love Miles
So did
Now pack up a few basics and -- You do
You do love me
Marylin hangs up the phone
She walks slowly around the room, pausing at the mantelpiece to pick up a framed picture of Miles, which she contemplatively regards
We pan with her continued walk to bring Joe into frame
He stands with his back pressed to the wall
She's started for a moment, but quickly recoups: Whoever sent you, 'll pay double
Mr
Dumbarton
She shows him the picture of Miles
Is this Mr
Dumbarton
No
She cocks an eye at him
That's his lawyer
Triple
Who's the pigeon
We faintly hear a car screeching to a halt
Massey exits the car
He clutches a can of mace
We hear a key scrape in the lock
The front door swings open onto a dark foyer as Miles tiptoes in
(Whispers) Marylin
Miles tiptoes through, looking warily about
He backs through the swinging doors connecting to the kitchen
Finds himself face to face with Joe
Joe
Thank God you're in time
You're not in time
'm in time
Thank God 'm in time
Joe stares at him
It's a no go
Get it
No one any the wiser
Okay
He makes a cow-herding motion with his hands
You can go home now
Goodbye
Thanks so much
Joe takes out his gun
No no
No contract
It's all over
This has no effect on Joe who is unscrewing his silencer
Miles is exasperated
Suddenly -- Marylin appears
It's a no go, Joe
Marylin
It's okay Joe
Joe glances at both of them with barely concealed contempt
Wait
He works for
Now
But first, he worked for you
You were going to have this thug
Wait just a second there
You sent him here
You unearthed this pestilence
You're calling me a pestilence
That's a hoot
(To Joe) 'm sorry
That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds
(To Miles) Did you really mean what you said on the phone
It wasn't because you found out about Rex
Nonono
Marylin -- 'm your husband
'd be entitled to Rex's money
No matter what happened to you
That's true
Lemme tell you something
You are the pestilence
'm the exterminator
Oh Joe, be happy for us
'll pay you the twenty thousand
It was fifty for you
(To Miles) That's cause you're a lawyer
gave her the lawyer discount
(Looks at Marylin) But  shouldn't of
Cause you're a whore
whore who worships the dollar
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical
Shut up
was a lawyer
Just like you
And my clients
Whores just like you
Were you with a firm
Kaplan
Kaplan
know Kaplan
Wait
You're Joe Gittelson
knew you looked -- You were great -- we studied you
Twenty years in "matrimonial law" and it made me sick
(He wheezes) broke up homes and families, never givin' it a second thought
Till one day
had an epiphany
You know what that is
(They nod) Came with a damn stigmata if you can believe that
said to myself -- Joe -- everyone you see wants blood
Everyone wants their ex's dead
So why jerk around with rest
You wanna best serve your clients
Kill em
Joe is raising the gun at Miles
Miles sprays him with Mace
-- Joe fires blindly, scrunching his eyes against the chemical, sucking for breath like a jet engine revving for a take-off
-- Marylin elbows him in the face, breaking his nose
She finishes with a solid groin kick
It slows him down, but doesn't stop him
Joe stumbles a bit, but regains his footing
-- Joe is rampaging around the room, still firing, thumping at his chest with his free hand for his inhaler
Marylin runs to Miles
He takes her hand and they run toward the door, seeking egress
-- still firing, he pulls out the inhaler but blindly bobbles it
Joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from falling
He momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler
Miles pops up in front of him
Marylin
Run
'll distract him
'm not leaving you
took self defense Joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points the inhaler at Miles
He squeezes --  -- Miles squints against the asthma mist and lets out a horrified: Joe
The off-screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a body dropping heavily to the floor
Silence
Marylin runs over to Miles
They look sadly down at the floor
told him it was no go
- Wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against the other
Miles sits gazing sadly out the window
The room is empty
There is the whir of ventilation
The click of the door attracts both their attention and brings them to their feet
Marylin walks in, chic and beautiful as ever, followed by Ruth, who sits next to her, places her attache case on the table top, and snaps its clasps
Alright
Ruth
Miles and Marylin are looking at each other
Quietly: Hello Marylin
Hello Miles
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us
It's not something  wanted either
But then --  guess -- something inside me died when  realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me
Yes
know
It's exactly how  felt when  realized you'd hired the goon to kill
Now you both wait a minute
Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone
Hear, hear
There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats
Wrigley looks at Miles
Apparently, from what  can gather, a burglar broke into your house -- became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself
Miles is still looking at Marylin
Where does that leave us
We've outlined a settlement
She pushes a piece of paper across the table
We think it's more than generous
Miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle of the table
He looks at Marylin
My client is prepared to consider a reconciliation
Marylin looks a Miles
How could  trust you, after
after all of this
Miles, staring at Marylin, cuts in: You wounded me first, Marylin
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth
You're forgetting Howard Doyle
Forgery
Fraud
Income tax evasion
Murder
Murder
don't see how we can ever find our way back from
Miles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit coat
He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the table in front of him and, still gazing at her: You know
there's nothing in the Massey pre-nup that says it can't be executed after the parties wed
He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name
He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin
Gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently picks up the paper
There is a long silence
We hear only the hum of ventilation, and Wrigley's quiet snuffling
Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper
Marylin however, looks only at Miles
It's the Massey pre-nup -- Marylin rips the paper in half
(bored) -kay
'm going back to the office Wrigley sobs openly
Come on Wrigley, 'll buy you a drink and an anti depressant
No one will ever love me that way
Not if you're lucky
No
Miles rises slowly to his feet
He puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward
Marylin rises slowly to her feet
She leans forward
They kiss
Let's go home
- We hear a  --
Gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing -- but quickly prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from one end of the yard to the other
The smashing is becoming louder
Breaks the beautiful wood panelling in the room next to the master suite
Wait
Just wait for one minute
Sweet Jesus, are you crazy
he's the one wielding the axe
His co-worker casts a look in our direction
reaches under the rubble and removes one box of Cohiba Especials
Sorry, Mr
Massey
Thought you cleared that shit out
#2 You know, man
those things'll kill ya
know all you old boomer potheads like em
They're illegal, and you get to put em in fancy boxes -- but -- shit man
It's still tobacco
Mightily pregnant
You know, sweets, he's right
Miles casts a rueful look at the cigars
Pre-Castro
Fine
They were created during a dictatorship
(Placing a protective hand on her  belly) What if something happened to you
What would  tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like
" Miles looks at the box, then at his wife
He tosses the box to the concerned construction worker
Here, buddy
These are for you
The construction worker gives him a very hostile look
(Mumbles) Great
Now  can die
Well
You'd say "they devoted a whole semester at Harvard to your Dad
But your Mom was the one that ever only nailed his ass
" Sweet
thought so
