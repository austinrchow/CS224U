' Written by Sean Anders & John Morris dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room
slide projector dimly lights
, a crew-cutted Robert Stack type in a suit, as he addresses the group
The current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry figure - it could be any of about a billion people
So, let's keep a steely eye out for this bastard
() Before we dismiss, this is your monthly reminder of why we're here
Fuller advances to a slide of the American flag
Close on one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties
He politely pays close attention to the presentation
(') The American people want to travel
(Slide: Family in front of a fake dinosaur) They want to attend baseball contests (Slide: Fat guys spilling beers as they go for a foul ball) and popular music concerts
(Slide: John Tesh) Close on another face in the group
doughy man with three- day scruff and a trendily long haircut
He looks bored, rolling his eyes at the speech
(') They want to be happy
(Slide: People line dancing) But, Security comes first
(Slide: Army soldier with a massive machine gun guards a play- ground) Without security there can be no happy
You are America's front line in the global war on terror
Let's hit the trenches and let's be careful out there
(Slide:  logo) The lights come up and as the group files out we get a better look at their uniforms
The  agents move out into the
-    - The agents take their places, manning the screening equipment
We push in on the bald man as he takes up his post next to the walk-through metal detector
This is He is not a looker
His uniform only serves to highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and demeanor are pleasant and kind
2
The scruffy agent is
He stands at the x-ray monitor
As the bags begin to move through, he does not pay any attention, rather he hands Kirk a flyer
Kirk, bro
Tonight
: The flyer reads, "Wheel in the Sky - a Tribute to Journey at Club Vertigo - Every Tuesday Night
" Stainer is pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo
don't know, Stainer
Dude, you never come see us anymore
It's been like four months
Time to forget about Marnie and get back on the whores
Stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable
Fuller shoots a stern look from his office
It's not that
It's my Grandma
'll probably be at the hospital for the next few nights
Oh, shit
spaced that
How's she doing
She's hanging in there but it doesn't look good
Dude, 'm sorry
She's a great lady
That sucks
Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line
Mr
Fuller appears behind Kirk, taps his shoulder and subtly motions to the Arab
Kirk smiles at the potential terrorist
Hey there, Habib
(perfect English with a southern accent) Howdy Kirk
Lemme guess;  been flagged for a random search
3
Yeah, sorry
'll get you out of here quick
You off to Boston again
No, sir
Pediatric convention in Delaware
Kirk opens Habib's bag
(') Kirk,  know you're just doing your job but, for Pete's sake, ya'll know me
'm sorry
It's just
Kirk gestures to his boss as he zips the bag back up
(') Okay, Habib, you're all set buddy
Have a good trip
Thanks Kirk
See you next time
Fuller again appears behind Kirk
(') (to fuller - now in a thick Arab accent) Praise be to Allah
You think that's funny
You wanna sit in first class or you wanna sit on my gloved and jellied finger
- Follow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind
Although we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see several men stare as she passes by on her way into
More stares from more men and even a few women as we follow the legs to the check-in line
The legs glide to the front and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent
4
From the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket agents
(One on each side of the legs
) One is black and one white; each are dealing with customers
They simultaneously notice our woman
They suspiciously eye one another and the race is on
Each agent begins typing furiously to expedite their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next
Angle on the   as he waits on a yuppie couple
() Okay, how many bags are you checking
Any bags
Is this one too big to carry on
No
Carry it on
Good call
Grant, you don't want to lug that thing all over the airport
The agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh
He looks to his right to check the progress of the  , who is waiting on an old Asian woman
() Did you pack your bags yourself
The Asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the question but she smiles and nods along
Yes
Has anyone unknown to you asked you to carry anything onto your flight
More smiles and blank nods
Yes
think you mean
You can't do that
5
She doesn't know what the hell 'm talking about
Where exactly is gate F5
Just past F4
Have a day now folks
Let's hustle it up
Sank you
No sweat
Keep it moving
The Asian woman is not going anywhere
The black agent leans into her face and barks once like a dog
Her smile turns to fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie
Next
Reverse to show the woman they were competing for
She is a classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty
Drop dead beautiful
She is startled by the sudden call from both men
She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the black agent
He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co- worker, who is being an overtly sore loser
Hi, 'm booked on flight 94 to Burbank
Molly McCall
(trying way too hard) California
Fantastic
So do you travel quite a bit
The white agent moves to loiter around the black agent's station, just to get a better look at
Hey Derek
You got the     numbers on the (making it up as he    goes) new, um, procedures for the,    um, airport thing
regarding the,    ah, planes
(to Molly) Whassup
- Kirk is at his post
6
Stainer works the next x-ray belt, where a young rocker type is running a guitar case through
Stainer stops the belt and moves it back to get a better look
Les Paul Classic re-issue
() No, it's a sixty-five
Mint
Fuck you
No way
The rocker boy looks at his watch as Stainer rolls the case through and pops it open
Dude, 'm late for my flight
Sorry,  have to search this case for, you know, explosives and such
This thing is sweet
Stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the bins and bags pile up before him
At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing through
Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else
No flirting or stammering - just friendly and relaxed
Morning
Oh, hello again
Second trip in two days
Molly is putting her laptop back in her bag
Uggh
Yeah
It's just a short hop to
but they've got me going back and forth three days in a row
This client is killing me
Well hang in there kiddo and guess 'll see you tomorrow
7
It's a date
Molly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man except Kirk watches
Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk
Did'ja see that
Boy would  ever like to
you know
put my penis in her vagina
(wink) Back at Stainer's station
As he puts the guitar back in its case, he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine
Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes
What the hell
He grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch
Dude,  am so sorry
Sorry my ass
This thing is worth more than you make in a year, you clumsy motherfucker
Yeah,  bet it was but
Stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand
(') " is not responsible for items lost or damaged in the security screening process
" Stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand- written on the back
He reads them aloud
(') "
so fuck you
" - Kirk enters to find his , an attractive old woman, sitting with a short, plain woman about Kirk's age
Hey Mom
Hey Marnie
8
Oh, hi Sweetie
Across the room, Kirk's father is speaking to a man who looks a bit like Kirk
The man is telling a funny story that cracks up
The two pretend to box for a moment
Who's that guy Dad's with
(the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside
Kirk, you've been really great about your mom and  staying so close since we broke up but  know how much Grammy meant to you
Well, is it okay with you that 'm here
Sure
It's fine
(it's not) Okay, good
Then can  introduce you to my new boyfriend
She leads Kirk over to the man who is speaking with his father
They are laughing again
(') Ron, this is Kirk
Uh, oh - the ex
Awkward
(Ron and Mr
Kettner laugh) No
'm just jack-assin' with you, pirate
Great to meet you
How you doing
've been better
Right
Of course
'm sorry about your grandmother
It's just so
Well, old people, you know, what are you gonna do
Yeah
Thanks
Kirk's brother  and his fiance  enter from the hall
They are both in their late thirties and good-looking for trailer trash
Debbie is about seven months pregnant
9
Little brother
Grammy wants to see you
Okay
Well,  better get in there
Eric and Debbie walk with Kirk down the hall
Listen, 'm pretty sure she wants to discuss the will
She won't tell us dick, so we're kind of hoping you can grease the wheels
Okay, but you know Grammy didn't have all that much
Once the hospital and
and the ah
Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what not
Well, it's not going to leave enough to get worked up over
We've got a wedding to pay for, Kirk and
Debbie, let me handle this
We've got a wedding to pay for, numbnuts, and you know Mom and Dad are going to Branson next month
Now you always been Grammy's favorite so we're counting on you to get in there and sort out what's what
- ' In a dimly lit hospital room, a very old woman lies in a bed
She is hooked up to an
and several monitors
Kirk comes in and forces a smile
Grammy's voice is weak and shaky
There you are Big Slick
Did you bring 'em
Grammy, you really shouldn't
10
Just hand 'em over
'm on death's door and you know it
Kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes
(') Oh, for Christ's sake
Filters
Grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag
Kirk tears up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life
love you Grammy
Don't start that shit now
You're looking at one lucky old broad who's done a lot - skydiving, rollerderby, colored fellas
got no complaints
So when the check comes  don't want any blubbering or bullshit outta you
Just enjoy your life like did mine and raise a glass to your old Grammy once in a while
Kirk hugs her and he cries a bit
(') You know how much  love you Kirk
- Molly is coming through Kirk's lane again
Mr
Fuller steps in and stops her before she crosses through
Ma'am, could you please remove your jacket and shoes
Oh, sure
She does
Fuller is leering at her stellar body
She's about to go through when he stops her again
Why don't we go ahead and strip off that belt too while we're at it
Molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt
She starts to move through but again Fuller stops her with a raised palm
He then motions to her breasts and crotch
11
(') Any piercings you'd like me to know about
Why don't you just come on through, ma'am, and we'll see if anything sets off the machine
Molly steps through
The machine does not go off
She gathers her things and mouths a silent, "Thank You" to Kirk as she walks on
Fuller glares at Kirk but before he can say anything, , a young agent, calls out from the office
Kirk buddy
Phone call
Kirk walks over to take the call
You best hope the terrorists are taking personal calls on the job too, mister
Kirk takes the phone from Randy
This is Kirk Kettner
Kirk's expression tells us that some sad news is coming in
- Kirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee
He opens his wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger Grammy and an eight-year-old Kirk in a casino
Grammy is smoking a cigarette and dealing blackjack while Kirk sits at the table
Kirk tears up and puts his face in his hands
Molly is passing
She sees Kirk and stops
Oh Geeze
Please tell me  didn't get you in trouble back there
No, no
It's not that
ah lost somebody today
Molly sits down and puts her hand on his hand
12
Oh my God
'm so sorry know
lost my grandmother a few months ago and
Kirk tears up again and so does Molly
(') Your grandmother too
And you were close
Oh, you poor thing
Kirk tries to keep it together
Molly looks at the photo
She used to be a blackjack dealer at the Horseshoe
When  was little, she taught me and my friends how to play poker
Turned us into a bunch of eight-year-old degenerate gamblers
They share a sad laugh
(') So, your grandmother too, huh
Molly removes a small clear-plastic booklet of photos from her bag and shows a picture of her grandmother
My Grammy Keenan was ninety four but independent right to the end
She was always trying to cook for everyone
You couldn't stop her
Oh, God,  know
Grammy used to change her own oil
Right up until a few months ago
She was
Do you change your own oil
() No
wouldn't know where to begin
know, me neither
She could barley walk and 'd come over and find her lying under her Cadillac all covered in grease
They share a laugh and Kirk is cheering up a bit
An announcement comes over the
13
final boarding call for United flight 94 to Burbank
Oh, geeze, that's me
'm so sorry
No, no
Go catch your flight
Molly stands and offers her hand to Kirk
'm Molly
Kirk Kettner
Molly squeezes Kirk's hand, grabs her bags and trots off toward her gate
businessman near Kirk's table reaches over and gives him a playful chuck on the shoulder
Dead Grandma
(a nod and a cheek click) Nice one
Molly arrives at the gate just in time to make her flight
Kirk gathers his things and notices that Molly left her pictures on the table
He looks through them
In the last pouch are some business cards that read, "Molly McCall - Event Planner
" Her cell number is on the card
737 Molly is sitting in a window seat
The flight is mostly empty
The two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a moves from the row behind her to the seat next to Molly
He casually smiles as though there is nothing odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat (and many full rows) are open
Molly looks at the vacant seats and then at him as if to say, "You've got to be kidding
" How you doin'
Molly's phone rings and she fumbles to answer it sitting two rows back looks annoyed
14
:  / Hello
Oh, hi
Molly McCall
Who's calling please
It's Kirk
From the coffee shop
You left your pictures with me
If you tell me which gate you're at, can run them right down to you
Oh, no
'm already on the plane and we're pushing back right now
Okay, well 'll leave them at the lost and found and when you get
Oh geeze, some of those are my only prints
It would be such a huge favor if you could hold on to them for me
'm coming back next week
Oh, sure
But how will
The female passenger hails the flight attendant
She's talking on her phone
The creepy businessman gives the woman the finger and then looks to Molly for approval
He doesn't get it
have your number in my phone
As soon as  get back 'll call you and arrange to pick them up, okay
Thank you so much, Kirk
Molly turns off her phone and holds it up for the flight attendant to see
(') Thanks
'm really sorry
15
You believe these pricks
So, what do you do
: - Kirk comes in and stops at the bar to order a beer
Two men are waving to him from a table near the stage
Kirk gets his bottle and snakes through the crowd toward his friends
On stage, Stainer (in his afro wig) plays guitar as his band finishes the last chorus of "Lovin', Touchin' Squeezin'
" Thank you
We're going to take a little breakski but we'll be back in a few minutes to do Frontiers
The band turns to put down their instruments and the house music kicks in
Kirk arrives where his friends are standing at a high bar table
looks like Howdy Doody at 33
is good- looking and dressed semi-hipster
Devon gives Kirk a hug
Hey Kirk
How you been holdin' up
It's been a rough week but, you know, all of the services and family stuff keep you pretty busy
really miss her, though
Jack hugs Kirk as well
She sounded like a hell of a lady
(
) Oh, fuck yeah
Kirk's Grandma was the shit
Stainer arrives, hugs Kirk and gives him a kiss on the head
(') She's with God now, buddy - and you just know she's bustin' his balls
Kirk laughs and Stainer raises his glass
16
(') To Stella
The guys all raise their glasses and take a drink
This is just what Grammy wanted and it's cheering Kirk up
Kirk's cell phone rings
He has to talk loud over the music
Hello
Oh, Hi
'm sorry  can barely hear you
'm at a club and
Club Vertigo
Oh, yeah - it's right down the street from there
Okay, sounds good
Kirk hangs up
What was that all about
Nothing, just a passenger
She accidentally left something with me
She's going to stop in and pick it up  guess
She's coming here
She a cute gal
Very
Well alright dude
That's a leave- behind
She digs you
No she doesn't
Trust me
She does a leave behind and then just happens to be in the neighborhood
She practically has her hands in your pants
No, seriously - it's nothing
She's way out of my league
Dude, you said Marnie was out of your league and let's face it, Marnie's kinda nasty
17
Marnie is standing behind Stainer
He doesn't miss a beat
(') Marnie
don't you think Marnie Tomkins is kind of nasty
don't know who that is
Oh, you don't know Marnie Tomkins
She's just this girl
thought you knew her
Anyway, she's pretty nasty looking
but you're looking good
Kirk, 'm sorry about Grammy
The guys slink away to give Kirk and Marnie some privacy
(') realize she was never that crazy about me but  know how much you loved her and  hope you're okay
Thanks
Thanks, 'll be alright
Listen, are you going to Branson with your folks next month
No
It's not really my thing
What's wrong with Branson
You too good for Branson now
No
Branson's
awesome
Well, your mom invited Ron and along
We'd love to go but not if it's going to be weird for you
Kirk considers this
It will be weird
(') mean the tickets are non- refundable but it's up to you
18
Stainer overhears this and groans out loud
No
You should go
'm sure you'll have a great time
Totally
Marnie hugs Kirk
This makes him uncomfortable
Kirk, 'm sorry about what happened with us
You're going to make someone very happy someday, but you have to get over me first, okay
Is it a deal
Marnie hugs him again and then departs
She's going to Branson with your fucking parents
And bringing her new fucking boyfriend
Yeah
He seems like a good guy, though
He's an entrepreneur
Across the room they see Marnie return to Ron with a hug
Entrepreneur
Kirk,  know that guy
He owns a Pizza Hut
So
That's a business
It's not even a real Pizza Hut
It's one of those strip-mall take- out ones
They don't even have chicken wings
The guy's a fuckin' douche bag
He's got more going on than  do
That's all 'm saying
Dude, you can do a hell of a lot better than her
One door closes, another door opens
19
Fuck you Devon, that doesn't even make any sense
But take this broad that's coming here tonight - got a feeling about her
You're gonna get on that
Absolutely
Visualize it
appreciate what you guys are trying to do but, 'm telling you, have zero chance with this one and 'm completely okay with that
That's defeatist thinking
No it isn't
It's just like saying 'll never go to the moon and 'm okay with that too
You're saying you don't want to go to the moon
That's bullshit
No
'm saying that  never will go to the moon but 'm not going to get down about it because, you know -  never expected to
You don't know
Technology and shit
You might go to the moon
Kirk waves to someone at the door
The guys look up
The guys' : Molly is stepping toward them - dressed in a beautiful gown
They laugh the way you might laugh at a particularly brutal football tackle
Holy Frijole
Oh shit
Yeah, you're right
Sorry, bro
You'll go to the moon before you'll hit that
No chance
20
told you
Molly arrives at their table
Hey
There you are
Molly hugs Kirk
From across the bar, Marnie takes notice
Here  am
'm sorry 'm so overdressed just came from a work thing
Are you doing okay with
everything
Oh, you know
Hey, these are my best friends - Jack, Devon and Stainer
The guys'
s drop like stones as they shake her hand
Stainer
Yeah, just a nickname
Doesn't really mean nothin'
Oh
Here's your pictures - all safe and sound
Kirk hands Molly the pictures
Thank you so much for taking care of them for me
need to get some copies made
If  lost these
uugh
No trouble at all
Hey, have you eaten yet
Um
21
was going to go grab a bite
Let me buy you dinner to pay you back
You don't have to pay me back
know
want to
Come on
The place across the street has the best greasy burgers in town
burger does sound good
(then to the guys) 'm going to just ah
Molly waves goodbye and heads for the door
Kirk starts to follow but Stainer pulls him back for a quick huddle
Dude
It's cool that she's buying you dinner but do not get your hopes up about this one
Don't worry
Believe me,  know
Kirk catches up with Molly
Marnie watches them exit
big guy has overheard this and leans over to Stainer
Good advice there friend
Your boy ain't got a prayer with that chick
You talking shit about my buddy
'Cause 'm giving out free fuckin' ambulance rides
Big Guy assesses the crazy on Stainer's face and stands down
(') Yeah,  didn't think so
- Kirk and Molly sit across from one another in a booth
The arrives
Start you off with something to drink ma'am
22
'll have a Bass
And for your
brother
What
Oh, 'm not her brother
Oh, 'm sorry
just figured
You know what, a Bass sounds good
Make that two
Great
Sorry
The waiter exits
So
You know what  do, what about you
Your card said event planner
How'd you get into that
Well, it wasn't the original plan
went to law school
Ended up at a big firm but  hated it
Then, they asked me to plan the Christmas party
It was a big hit and a few months later  was done with law
Wow
know
Pernicious career move, right
Oh,  don't know what that word means
What was it
Close on Molly's smile
She finds Kirk's unabashed admission very refreshing and endearing
'm sorry
Like, destructive or
23
Oh, okay
No,  don't think that's so perni
gious
Pernicious
Good - new word
No, not pernicious at all
Not if you enjoy the work
really do
We do a lot of charity events and  get to work with some of the most amazing human beings on some really fun projects
Next month 'm doing a cancer benefit with Billy Joel
Wow
love Billy Joel
The only downside is  have to do a lot of public speaking and 've always struggled with stage fright
Oh man - That's my number one fear
'm terrified of getting up in front of people
'd rather get a Kentucky root canal
Molly laughs
An older -  steps up to the table and stands facing her with his back to Kirk
- Excuse me,  was just sitting over at the bar and  was wondering; has anyone told you today that you are absolutely stunning
Are you seriously hitting on me right in front of my boyfriend
He turns to Kirk and both men start to laugh
- This is your boyfriend
24
Oh, yeah right
(Catches Molly's unspoken instructions
) But, yeah
'm her boyfriend,  guess, so
- Really
Wow
Well
sorry
Honest mistake
The man gives Kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar
Did you get a load of that hair- piece
What is it with men mean, look at you
You're bald and you're fine with it
little dignity is all 'm saying
The toupees and plugs and the teen- dream sports cars
Oh geeze, 'm sorry
Do you drive a sports car
drive a 94 Taurus
It's got / but  wouldn't call it a sports car per se
Molly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets of conversation as they eat, chat and laugh
(') So here's this little old lady trying to go through security with six pounds of weed in her girdle
Cut
The food is being served
Oh, my God
love that book
Cut
The waitress is picking up the empty plates
So, a duck walks into a bar
Cut
Molly is laughing while she's paying the bill
Well, 've got an early morning should go
Thanks for coming along
This was really fun
And thanks again for helping me out
25
No, thank you for dinner
feel bad that you won't let me
Oh, stop it
Listen,  handle some of the charity events for the Coyotes and 've got some tickets for the hockey game tomorrow night
You interested
Kirk is a bit taken aback and confused
Is she actually asking him out on a real date
() Um, sure
Yeah, great
mean, 'm free tomorrow night
She digs two tickets out of her purse and hands them over
Perfect
hate to see them go to waste
There's two so maybe bring Stainer
Kirk's expression is as much relief as disappointment
Oh, right
Thanks
Thank you
- Kirk and Stainer are on their way through security
huge security guard runs a metal-detector wand over Stainer
Whatcha runnin' there a -235
don't know sir
The two hundred series are dog shit
You couldn't find a bazooka with that thing
You should look into the new eight fifties
Can you keep it moving sir
26
Kirk and Stainer arrive at the third row to find two open seats right next to the penalty box
To Kirk's surprise, in the next seat - Molly
Kirk elbows Stainer
Hey, it's Molly
She's here
() Huh
Hey guys
You made it
Hooray
Thanks for coming
Oh, yeah
Wouldn't miss it
Thanks for the sweet seats
Guys, this is my best friend in the whole world, Patty
This is Kirk and, um, Stainer, right
Patty is over 200 pounds with a pretty face and an edge that comes from a lifetime of taking crap from morons
Hey boys
Nice to meet you
Patty's my assistant and my go-to gal
Whatever you need, she can make it happen on a moments notice
You need a cock-shaped cake with a cotton-candy bush delivered by four o'clock
'm your connection
Oh, and she likes to shock people so don't let her freak you out
How 'bout that
So, we're going to grab some beers
Can we bring you ladies anything
Beer
Nachos
Patty, cotton candy
27
Stainer and Kirk stand in the beer line
That's it
She's setting you up with the fat chick
Ooohhh
Okay
Okay
That makes sense, right
When Molly was here was like, "what
" But, okay
Well, Patty seems cool
She's funny
Well, yeah, she has to be
What does that mean
Nothing
The fat chick seems great
You never know, bro, that fat chick could wind up being the love of your life
Kirk returns a look of annoyance
(') Patty, 'm saying
Patty could be the love of your life
The game has started
Kirk, Stainer, Molly and Patty are cheering
The puck smacks the glass before them and another player skates up for it
As he mucks it from the edge, he looks up and sees Molly
He's distracted just long enough to get brutally checked face first into the glass
penalty is called on the player who hit him
That player skates into the penalty box near Molly
The name on his jersey reads, "
" He speaks with a thick Canadian accent
Hey Molly
Yer lookin' good, eh
That was a bogus call, Bobby
Your skates barely left the ice
know
What's that aboot, eh
28
(nervously to Reese) Yeah, that ref is like a total blindo, man
Blindo
Kirk, Molly's sister is blind
Oh, 'm sorry
didn't mean
(not offended) Oh,  know
It's fine
The radio announcers are calling the game
Forty Five seconds left on the Power Play and the Sharks are knocking at the door
So, after the game, you wanna party
You know my policy on players, Bobby
And you might have noticed we've already got dates
The penalty ends and the ref opens the box but Reese is not paying attention
Come on, Molly
Just give me a chance, eh
'm a great guy - ask any of these assholes
The crowd is booing Reese
Reese, you'd better
You can't seriously be blowing me off for these two hosers
29
Hey
Fuck you Reese
You suck this year anyway
Reese raises his squirt bottle over the glass and squirts Stainer
(') You dick
Stainer is immediately on his feet, climbing the glass and trying to pummel the huge player
Security is on him in a flash and dragging him, kicking & swearing, out of the arena
Reese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late
The Sharks score and the crowd revolts
red-haired redneck woman, sitting two rows back, calls out to Molly and company
- You idiots just cost us a goal hope you're happy
You'd better check that tone, Reba
You do  want me comin' up there
Patty
Stop it
'll go see what can do about Stainer
No, this is my fault, 'll take care of it
No, it's okay
know the head of security
'll be right back
Molly exits and Patty sits back down next to Kirk
God, 'm really embarrassed
That's okay, if Reese did that to me 'd have gone over the glass too
But  would have landed a few before they got me
Reese has been all over Molly ever since she dumped her boyfriend
tell you, that girl has nothing but trouble when it comes to men
30
What
How is that even possible
She's so
Tell me about it
'm no lezbo but sometimes she makes me want to strap on - if know what 'm saying
Yeah
think  do
It's a curse, looking like that
Who has the balls to hit on her
Just the most arrogant -holes like Reese out there
Yeah,  suppose
Listen, Molly brought me along tonight because, you know, she thought  might be 'interested
' Oh
Oh yeah
But, just for honesty's sake, 'm not interested
No offense
No
Hey
None taken
don't blame you
know 'm no Brad Pitt
That's cool
What
You
No, 'm talking about your pal, Stainer
know he's your friend but he seems like kind of a dumbshit
() Wait
Why would you think  was talking about you
'm sorry
didn't mean to assume anything
Oh my God
You don't have a clue do you
Molly's really into you
31
Oh, yeah right
Kirk laughs hard until he realizes that Patty isn't laughing
Patty's nod says, "'m serious
" (') But
why would
knockout like Molly be interested in a spud like you
Well, yeah
Got me
Again, no offense
But listen, Kirk, your dream girl just showed up
Try not to blow it
Close on Kirk's terrified expression
The  of a bowling ball demolishing ten pins
- The place is crowded and classic rock is cranking
It's an old alley with overhead-projection score sheets
Kirk, Stainer and Devon sit and talk while Jack throws a strike
Atta boy Jackers
It doesn't add up, Kirk
If Molly's so into you, why bring her friend and give you two tickets
She was hoping to set Patty up with you
Oh, great
It's okay, she wasn't interested
So you're saying the hottest babe in the world wants you and the fat chick isn't into me
Will you listen to yourself
Fuck you
() 32
(') What did Molly have to say about all this
don't know, Stainer, somebody got thrown out of the game and  had to drive him home, remember
Pretty impressive catch, Kirky
There's no way
Don't get him all worked up
Her friend was fuckin' with him
Molly said herself that Patty loves to mess with people
Kirk, you deserve a gal like her
And Stainer, why don't you try to be a little more supportive
Why don't you try a little shut the fuck up, Devon
This week, we're not taking dating tips from the guy who met his wife in eighth grade
Are we still bowling
Stainer picks up a crappy, beat up ball from the ball return
All 'm saying is - she's just too hot
No judgement on Kirky, the guy's just outgunned here
can't argue with him
Stainer goes to the line
The  (a pro-type with a custom ball and glove) on the next lane is already standing about to roll
Stainer starts to step up
Yo, house ball
was up first
Oh for fucks
What is it with you people
Just wait your turn
33
All this noise and bullshit in this place and 'm such a distraction over here in your god damned peripheral vision
Okay Stains, take it easy
The bowler stands glaring back
Well
Fuckin' roll then
The bowler takes another minute to set
Stainer lets out a long sigh
The bowler steps to the line and Stainer rushes into his own delivery
Both men throw gutters
The bowler comes at Stainer but their friends separate them
You're lucky motherfucker
Oh yeah
Bring it, Brunswick
Stainer
Cool your jets, buster
The bowler's friends drag him away
Stainer takes a deep breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode
Okay
Anyway
love Kirky but let's face it, the guy's a three
Stainer, that's just dirty pool
He's at least a four
You're outta your fuckin' mind - four
You go ahead and pump rainbows up his ass
'm just being honest
Stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the glass
It projects onto the overhead scoreboard
can live with three
34
He's a nice guy and he's funny
Those are a half a point each
Stainer continues the equation on the projector
(') But he drives a shit box so we gotta deduct a point for that
Kirk said she likes his Taurus
That's so fucked,  won't even dignify it with a response
So we're back to three
Meanwhile, this Molly is a hard ten
hard ten
Generally, if a broad is that hot you can deduct a few points for dumb or shallow but she went to law school and her sister's blind
That's a hard ten, friends, and that is rare
seven point disparity - that's a chasm
The most you can jump is two points
can't even get a ten
Oh, not even you, huh
'm a five, okay
Bullshit
Then what am
You're a seven and a half
Fine, you're a five then
Okay, so  get a two point bump for being in a band
That puts me at seven
On a good day, most  can bag is a niner
35
What about your shitty car
Artist exemption
'm expected to have a shitty car
Is there an artist exemption for being a jag-off
Fuckin'  there is
Stainer's right
Patty was probably just messing around
It's not a big deal
Let's just bowl
What about Rick Ocasek
Billy Joel, Donald Trump
Yeah, dumbass
Those are the wild- cards
Money and fame
So, if he were a millionaire
mil ain't what it once was, Jackie
Devon's practically a millionaire for Christ sake
mil might get you an eight but to bring down a ten now days - two million minimum
Stainer finishes the equation by writing, "Kirk = Fucked
" Kirk's phone rings
He checks the  and his eyes go wide
(into the phone) Hey, Molly
Um, yeah, sure
No, that sounds good
Yeah,  know where that is
Um, okay, yeah
see you then
Kirk hangs up and gapes at his friends, who wait in suspense
(') Holy crap
(dazed pause) She just asked me out for tomorrow night
36
Kirk exchanges fives, fists, tips and hugs with Devon and Jack
Stainer shakes his head, still not buying it
' Kirk runs into the otherwise empty restroom
He stares into the mirror and his smile fades into panic
He splashes water on his face
He reaches for a paper towel but the dispenser is empty
(to himself) It's okay
Get it together
Guys do this all the time
You can do this
You can make it happen
'  (
) (from inside a stall) You better not be jerking off in the sink, man
- Kirk's Taurus pulls into a space
He climbs out and slams the door
As it closes, he reaches but too late
He looks through the window
The keys are hanging in the ignition
, the Russian driver, is chipper and bubbly as he sings along with "'m Like a Bird" on the radio
Kirk is knocked around by Willy's crazy driving
In the mirror, Willy notices Kirk's dazed expression
(thick accent) Kirk
You look like someone made a second number in your breakfast cereal
You are doing okay, yes
You know what Willy
honestly don't know how 'm doing
He does not know
should be doing awesome but don't know
Know what  mean
Nope
37
How are you
Perfect
Willy is having another kick ass of a day
Willy takes a hard left and some suitcases fall on Kirk
- Kirk is picking up a coffee
As he walks on, he takes a sip
The lid comes off and hot coffee spills on his shirt
(
) Way to go, Big Slick
Stainer is now next to Kirk, who glares back at him as they walk across the food court
short, plain girl behind the Orange Julius counter gives them an apprehensive wave
(') Oh, shit
Let's go this way
Stainer returns an uncomfortable smile but then redirects their path away from her
Kirk waves
Who's that
Nobody
Just some chick  boned once when  was drunk
You look like shit, bro
Thanks
had trouble sleeping last night
This Molly thing don't want to want this, you know
It just seems too good to be true
just don't get it
know what you mean
There has to be some explanation
can't think of one
Not one that makes any sense
38
Well, let's spitball it a little
You've got dick for money so she's no gold digger
Oohh
Did you ever see Double Indemnity
Please don't say she wants me to kill someone
Okay, then
maybe she's on a scavenger hunt
You know, like find a wagon wheel, a wiffle ball bat and a fat, bald  agent - that kind of thing
Kirk is no longer responding
(') Oh, shit, dude
Al Qaeda
Think about it
You're a  agent, she's a terrorist
Kirk walks away
- Kirk, still in his  uniform, walks past a large laundromat to a small storefront next door
The chipped and faded lettering on the glass reads, "Maury Hammerstein, Attorney At Law - Aggressive, Dynamic Representation Since 1942
" As Kirk reaches for the door, he notices a small hand-written sign, " don't make change
" He goes inside
Wood paneling, buzzing fluorescent lights and furniture the Salvation Army would sell only as firewood
Eric and Debbie sit with Kirk's parents
There are two elderly women and another middle aged man in the room as well
Maury, who's about a hundred years old - cute and meek, fusses with an ancient  while smoking a cigarette
Kirk sits down next to Eric
Kirk notices a free bank calender on Maury's desk - dated 1991
It's about time, numbnuts
came right from work
39
Okay Maury - we're all here
Oh
You bet
You betcha
Okay, hi there Kirk
Firstly, let me just say how awful sorry  am
Stella was one heck of a gal and a real dish
Anyhow, let me just
Maury gets the  going
"Wheel of Fortune" comes up on the screen
(') Oh mercy
didn't tape over her with The Wheel did
The picture goes to snow and then stutters into a shot of Grammy sitting in her kitchen
She has just clicked the video camera on with a remote control
(') Oh, good
There she is
Testing
One, two, three, four
Oh, this God damned thing
She gets up and fusses with the camera
(') Jap piece of shit
Is it on
Cutaway to Kirk tearing up
Grammy sits back down
(') Okay, my name is Stella Edith Dakin and if you're watching this, 'm dead as a doorknob and  ain't spent all my money yet
got shit to do today so 'm going to get right to it
This is my last will and testament and if you miss anything the old Jew's got the paperwork
Okay, here's the deal
Everyone besides Kirk leans in, excited to hear what they might get
phone rings
Maury looks around but the ringing is coming from the
Grammy answers the phone
40
(') Hello
'm kind of busy right now Eric
Oh, for God's sake, boy
How can you be sure it's even yours
It could be practically anybody's
No, 'm not paying for that
Well, then  guess you're going to be a daddy
Congratulations, now  gotta go
She hangs up, puts on her glasses and lights up a smoke
(') Anyway
love all of you, despite some of the shit you pulled, but spent my life a gambler and  always put my money on the best bet
The odds of any of you fish doing anything worthwhile with my stack are slim to none
So old Grammy's going all in on Big Slick
Everyone looks at Kirk who is stunned
(') 'm proud of you, Kirk
Don't let your old Grammy down
Do something good with it
She blows a kiss, lifts the remote and aims it at the camera
(') Oh, for Christ sakes
She throws the remote at the lens
The picture goes to snow
So Kirk gets it all
That is bullshit
Eric, it can't be much
Well
Maury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers
He dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic
Let's see here
Looks like she had herself six 's in savings
() 41
(') Um, another three grand in bonds, give or take
Her life insurance will pay pert-near seventy grand
He adds this up on an old adding machine (the kind with the hand crank) and writes $77,800 on a chalk board, which is mounted on the wall behind him
She left him eighty grand
Most of Stella's retirement home expenses were covered by her reverse mortgage
But, figure in thirty thousand still due to Arborwood Village
She racked up forty-seven thousand in medical bills
And my fee, of course, which now stands at two thousand and change - which is real reasonable, folks
He writes "Liabilities = $79,000    Total -$1,200
" So Kirk owes money
Shit, man
That is God damn hilarious
- The upscale restaurant is crowded
Kirk and Molly are eating at a small table
Kirk is not relaxed like he had been the last time they ate together
He is sweating and trying to remain cool
The Maitre d is eyeing them suspiciously
But, you can't legally be held responsible for her debt
What kind of hack is this attorney
It's okay
had it in savings
The waiter brings a drink to Molly
(French accent) Madame
From ze gentleman in ze grey suit
From his table, a good looking man smiles and raises a drink to Molly
She nods back - polite but annoyed
42
Anyway
Grammy hated owing anyone money
'm afraid she couldn't rest if she wasn't square with the house
It's the least  can do
She practically raised me
You're a good man, Kirk
Molly smiles and takes his hands
The maitre d is watching and getting angry
The waiter returns with another drink
From ze gentleman in ze purple tie
Another guy raises his glass to her from the bar
Molly is getting irritated
Kirk is feeling smaller every minute
Listen, no more drinks
Please
Of course
No more drinks, madame
'm sorry
This happens sometimes
Yeah,  get that a lot too
'm sure the next one will be for me
Molly laughs
The best looking man Kirk has ever seen walks up to the table
He and Molly hug
Oh, my gosh
Talon
didn't realize you were in town already
just flew in this morning
Kirk, this is Talon
This is my good friend, Kirk
Great to meet you, sir
Talon gives Kirk a winning handshake, complete with wink
43
(') So, do we have you for our Disabled Angels Program again this year
Wouldn't miss it
That's fantastic
(to Kirk) Mol is always a big hit with the kids
Please
You're the one the kids go crazy for
So you two work together
Only once a year
Talon is our charity liaison at the air show
And
And my ex-boyfriend
Kirk starts to choke
He grabs his water glass and takes a swig but the ice collapses and the water pours all over him
Oh, boy
guess  better
Kirk heads off to the bathroom, muttering to himself
(') Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
' Kirk is drying his shirt
man is still zipping up as he takes the next sink
Before washing, he offers a handshake
Excuse me
My name is Max Fleming
'm a financial planner
Kirk takes the handshake reluctantly and then gets a business card
Max then starts to wash up - so does Kirk
Oh, Hi
44
Please forgive me but 'm curious
Who manages your portfolio
My portfolio
don't really
Max takes the last paper towel - forcing Kirk to drip dry
It's okay if you'd rather not say admit that selling my services in a men's room is a tad aggressive but isn't that what a man of your means requires in his financial planner
My means
Judging by the company you're keeping, 'd say that you're making a handsome living
can help you do even better
Kirk exits reading Max's card - somewhat bewildered
The Maitre d stops Kirk and speaks in a French accent
Excusez-moi Monsieur
Might  have a word
Oh, sure
Is everything all right
The Maitre d looks around and then leans in and speaks quietly - now without the French accent
My kids eat here
My mother's here right now you son of a bitch
Okay
Did
Look,  can appreciate that this is not some common street-walker
You're obviously willing to pay for the best but we can't have this kind of thing at my place
45
What
'm not paying anyone
We're just on a date
You are on a date with her
What am  an idiot
Now,  don't wish to embarrass you, sir, or make a scene
So, enjoy your dinner but, be warned, do not ever bring another professional into my place
(louder and back into the French accent) Tres bien Monsieur
When Kirk rounds the corner, he sees that Molly and Talon are still talking
Kirk hides behind a plant
Molly is beaming
She stands to hug Talon and kiss his cheek before he exits the restaurant
Kirk returns to the table
Oh, no
Did  miss Talon
He had to go but he asked me tell you how much he enjoyed meeting you
Yeah
Super
He, uh, seems like a great guy
He is
He's wonderful
know, know - the blue eyes and the rock hard abs, right
But he's really so much more than that
gallery in New York just opened an exhibit of his photography
He's a genius
(to the waiter) Can we get the check
Madame, your bill has been covered by ze woman in ze Raiders Jacket
butch woman in the bar raises a glass in Molly's direction
'  - Molly and Kirk pull into a parking lot
46
Oh my gosh
This is your apartment
used to live in this neighborhood back in college
Yeah, 'm gonna move to a better place pretty soon
We used to come to parties over here sometimes
Oooohh
Can come up and see your place
' It's Friday night and several college parties are raging in the complex
Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the balcony hall toward his door
They pass a few college students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a bush
Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf
' Kirk and Molly enter
The apartment is neat, clean and fairly sparse
It's not much,  know
No,  like it
Molly walks around and examines certain items
Kirk quietly hides a framed picture of Marnie
Molly passes his computer desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears
Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer comes to life, revealing a "Hot Back-Door Asians" website
Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the monitor
She turns to see what he's doing
He smiles
She moves on to a rack of DVDs
(') Wow, we have a lot of the same DVDs
Life of Brian, Cool Hand Luke, Family Guy
Beaches, Kirk
What
It's a good movie
love that movie
47
She spots a crate full of vinyl records
(') Wow, records
No Way
Look at all this Cheap Trick
You like Cheap Trick
Are you kidding
Heaven Tonight is the first album  ever owned hand-me-down from my big sister
She was the coolest person in the whole world
She notices an upright piano in the corner
(') You play the piano
little
My grandma taught me
It was kind of our thing
She was a great player
Ragtime, show tunes, that kind of thing
'm really not very good
She plops down on the couch
Oh, 'll bet you're great
Play something for me
No,  can't really play in front of people
What, the stage fright thing
Come on it's just me
Please
No,  really can't
Trust me, you're not missing anything
Kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into a little dance of almost sitting
He finally commits to sit
So you've never played in front of anyone
48
Nope
Almost did once
talent show in high school
just sat up there drenched in sweat
really thought  could do it but then made my big mistake
Let me guess
You looked at the audience
Yep
All these eyes on me
'm shaking, my head is spinning, 'm trying to remember if  even play the piano
and then,  puked
Right there on the stage
the piano actually
Shut up
You're lying
Why would you do that
It was a reflex
was trying not to barf on the floor
Turns out it's a lot easier to clean puke off a stage than out of a baby grand
Yeah, that has to be a real bitch
Oh,  shouldn't be laughing
You poor thing
Molly brushes his hair back with her hand
Kirk is frozen with fear
Molly leans in
Kirk also leans in but not too far
Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make this official
She takes him by the collar, reels him in and kisses him
They make out for a moment
Kirk is near panic but he does his best to keep it together
Sorry
'm a little cotton-mouthed
'm going to get a glass of water
How 'bout for you
Water
nice glass of, you know
water
Yeah
That sounds good
49
Kirk steps away from her and disappears into
' He pours a glass of water
He's about to return when he sees his reflection in the window
The boner under his khakis is not subtle
He looks down and starts to panic
Um
You want anything to eat
(
) No thanks
Kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in
He takes a few deep, calming breaths
He closes the fridge - still at full alert
Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building
He grabs a Time Magazine
He flips through frantically
He turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article
Oh come on
He is sweating like crazy
(
) Can  give you a hand
No
got it
Kirk finally flips to a picture of Barbara Bush
He stares at it hard
His boner begins to retreat
' Listen Kirk,  want you to know that  would really like to, you know, to be with you tonight
(
) Really
' The boner pops back up
Kirk silently mouths, "
" at his mischievous little man
(
) Well, sure
But
just don't think 'm ready yet
50
Kirk's reply is rushed with enthusiastic relief
Sure
Sure
Yeah
No problem
Great
That's
that's great
Ice
You want some ice
(
) Sure
Kirk opens the freezer
He puts a few cubes in her water and then grabs a fistful and shoves his hand in his pants
' Molly gets cozy on the couch and looks even sexier
mean, don't get me wrong
want to
Believe me - getting naked and crazy sounds fantastic right now
(
) Shit
Are you okay
(
) Yeah, fine
' Kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink
He finds duct tape
He pulls some tape off the roll
It makes a loud noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up
Kirk opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot
He coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll
(
) just think we should get to know each other first
'm no prude
mean, 'm pretty generous in bed
Once  trust a person,  like to experiment and get pretty wild
Oh, dear God
(
) But,  just need to feel safe first
51
Kirk finishes taping up, zips his pants and checks his profile in the reflection from the window
' Kirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner
Hey
'm totally fine with that
You're the best
Kirk gives an "aw-shucks" head tilt
Molly stands
(') Okay, well, 'd better go then
They walk to the door
Molly leans in and they kiss a few moments more
Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little snug
She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to retrieve them
Suddenly she starts coughing
She puts her fist over her mouth
Kirk's :   As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch
Kirk winces again
She hears the tape start to give way
She looks up, slightly confused
Kirk looks around as though he's looking for the source of the sound
Molly stands
(') had a really nice time
'll call you tomorrow
Great
Kirk opens the door for Molly
' As Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss
Two studly male college students are playing foosball on their patio
They stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk
Molly trots off
#1 Damn, man
That chick is fine
Kirk returns a cool "whassup" nod to the guys
#2 All right Mr
Kettner
52
#1 You wanna play some foos
No thanks fellas
Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside
' He drifts over to his piano and sits down
The joy of what has just happened is plastered on his face
He launches into a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp
Soon a neighbor is pounding on the wall
Kirk stops playing
Sorry, Mrs
Neusbaum
Kirk continues his celebration, dancing around the apartment
He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it
(') Ron seems like a swell guy
love Pizza Hut
What
Who's this
Why, this is my girlfriend, Molly
Oh, don't be that way
Oh, there, there, now
Here's a tissue
He drops the picture and continues the dance
'   - Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan
The smile continues as he drifts off to sleep
Time lapses as Kirk sleeps and the sun comes up
Still smiling, his eyes open like a shot and he reaches for his phone - "No Missed Calls
" : 1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom
He checks his gut and hairline in the mirror
2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the box
It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached along with a card that reads, "Happy Graduation - Love Mom and Dad
" He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads the directions
The parts are spread out all over the floor
He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses underneath him
He checks his phone
"No Missed Calls
" 3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the cupboards
53
He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl
He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal and then checks his phone
"No Missed Calls
" 3) He surfs the web
He reads info on the Hair Club For Men site
He moves to Hot_or_Not
com
The first woman is very pretty
He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive
Her score is three
Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten
He checks his phone
He moves on to "BackDoorAsians
com
" 4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on
The lower third reads, "'s 24 Hours of Bond
" No Missed Calls
The sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls
Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them as he watches
It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls
The morning light is creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls
5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk
He is a mess - tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit
He passes the magazine rack and something catches his eye
It's a gorgeous picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur Magazine
Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack
6) Kirk is walking home
Every street sign, billboard and - shirt he sees reads, "
" '   - He stands in the shower sulking
He hears the phone ring in the next room
He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts to dry off as he runs into the bedroom
He reaches the charger base but the phone is not there
He stands and listens hard to the ringing
He runs into the living room
Angle on the phone
It's hiding under a pillow on the couch
In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up papers and magazines
The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's panic increases until he finally spots the phone
Kirk dives for it, losing his towel in the process
Hello
Hello
(
) Took you long enough
What were you doing, taking a growler
Kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him
She can see his ass through the window
He covers up
54
Sorry, Mrs
Nuesbaum
- Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the shops and restaurants
Kirk holds a stack of flyers for Stainer's band
As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer
Kirk, it's a simple rule of life
Look around
People are pretty evenly matched
Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk
Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty, ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit
Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one who asked me out
So, why
That first night, were you intimidated by her
No,  didn't think  had a chance
Exactly
So you were relaxed and funny
You were on
Stainer posts several "Wheel in the Sky" flyers on a kiosk
So  gotta get back to that
That's just it, Kirky
Now that she's opened the door, you can't get back to that
So 'll have to fake it
Forget it
You can't fake that far
broad like her - she'll smell that horseshit a mile away
55
Kirk and Stainer enter a
and take a table on the crowded patio
Can we get a couple of menus
(then to Kirk) You eating
Maybe just a salad
Dude, one salad ain't going make up for thirty years of chili dogs
know
But  got dinner with my folks later
Fun
Be sure and stab your brother in the eye with a fork for me
Sorry, Eric's not coming tonight
Kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with knockout girl) who pass Kirk and Stainer's table on their way to the valet stand
Stainer rolls his eyes
(') You know what - this is ridiculous
'm just going to call her
Fuck you are
Put that thing away
You do not call her
Don't you get it
Talon is back in town
No, she broke up with him
So, you're telling me you were sitting there, a sweating, quivering stutter-bucket and when you came back from the can, Molly's hugging a guy who's so good looking you'd probably fuck him
What do you think she's doing this weekend
56
So what am  supposed to do
What can you do
She hasn't called - she's not going to
You're probably right
Just count yourself lucky
You got to kiss a goddess and you got out before she recalibrated your hardware
chick like that can raise the bar too high and then once she dumps you, nobody else measures up
No, you're right
You know what - it's good
It's better
'm actually relieved
You should have seen this Talon guy
Man
All 've been thinking about is having to be naked in front of her don't need that kind of pressure
The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and the nerdy guy opens the door for her
Stainer shakes his head as if to say, "Was there even a doubt
" Kirk's phone is sitting on the table - it rings
Kirk and Stainer can see Molly's name on the caller
Don't do it
The phone rings again
Kirk glances down at the phone
Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk
Close on Kirk's eyes turning weak
Close on Stainer's threatening eyes
Kirk gives up and looks away
Stainer's eyes calm
Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's wrist, pinning it to the table
Cut it out
Let it go
57
Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but Stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around like battling snakes
Kirk presses the button to answer the call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone
Hello
Oh, no problem
Yeah was super busy yesterday anyway
Would you look at yourself
Stainer lets go and Kirk sits up and backs away
Well,  have dinner with my folks tonight
Oh,  wouldn't want to subject you to them
Okay
If you want to
can pick you up
Kirk gives a confident smile and an " told you she'd call" nod
Stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head
(') Oh, sure
Well then let me call you back in a few minutes and 'll give you directions
Alrighty
Yeah
Buh-bye
Well,  guess you just solved that
An hour with your family and she'll file for a restraining order
No
Eric's not going to be there
It's going to be good
You might be wrong about Molly
She might
Stainer spots a round little boy posting a "Lost Puppy" flyer over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk
(to the boy) Whoa
don't think so Spanky little lower
The boy instead posts it over a "Walk For a Cure" poster
' '  - Molly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a quaint residential street
58
She climbs out of her car, checking the address on a small sheet of paper
She sees Kirk sitting on the front porch
You found it
had good directions
She steps up the front walk toward Kirk, who points to a little yellow note taped to the front door
'm sorry
My folks aren't back yet
We're locked out
You don't have a key
No
My dad's kind of obsessed with home-security
Like someone's going to break in and steal his Reader's Digest collection
very old man wobbles out of the house next door with a beagle on a leash
The man struggles a bit with the dog
(') Hi, Mr
Riley
Well, howdy Kirk
Hey, what do say you take the night off and 'll take Noodle around the block for you
(to Molly) Are you up for a walk
That sounds great
Geeze Kirk, that's mighty nice
Kirk jogs over to take the leash
Noodle jumps up on Kirk
He and Molly pet the excited dog
(baby talk) Yes
Always happy to see you, pretty girl
Yes you are a pretty girl
Yes you are
59
Molly takes note - animal lover - big points
You're a good boy, Kirk
It's no trouble at all
Molly and Kirk start down the sidewalk with Noodle
An old woman comes out of the next house with her dog on a leash
Honey
Are you back in business
(To Molly) had a little neighborhood dog- walking service when  was a kid
(to the woman) No problem, Mrs
, we can take Norton along too
Several soft-faded cuts as Kirk and Molly move through the neighborhood
Soon they have a third dog
Kirk points out landmarks as they talk and laugh
Now they have a fourth dog
Molly takes his arm
The evening light is a bit dimmer as they give Noodle back to Mr
Riley
Kirk turns toward his parents' house
Now there's a car parked in the driveway and a jacked-up, knobby- tired pick-up parked out front
The truck has two bumper stickers ("One Nation Under
" and "No Fat Chicks
") flanking a vanity license plate that reads, "-
" Kirk's shoulders slump at the sight of it
(') Hey, you know what 'm thinking, let's go get Chinese
What are you talking about
want to meet your family
They start toward the door
Molly's cell phone rings
(') 'm so sorry
It's Patty
've got to take this
Go ahead
'll be right in
' '  - Kirk comes through the front door to find his father in the living room watching a hockey game
60
Hey dad
(without looking up) Kirk
(
) Hi sweetie
Eric steps out of the kitchen with three beers
Close the door, fucknut
Hey Eric
thought you were hanging drywall tonight
Nah
Fuckin' Leroy fired me again
Like that dick never came to work with a little buzz on
Okay, listen,  brought a date tonight
really like her
Please don't embarrass me in front of her
'll do anything you want
promise  won't mention her goiter
Eric and Dad crack up
flushing sound and then Ron comes out of the bathroom
He's buckling up
Kirk's shoulders drop again
did like you said Mr
Eric tosses Ron and Mr
Kettner each a beer
Oh, hey Ron
So Marnie's here
Marnie appears in the door of the kitchen
She's holding a corningware pot filled with mashed potatoes
Molly finishes her call
She's up the front steps and Kirk lets her in
Eric, Ron and Mr
Kettner are stunned
Marnie drops the pot and it smashes on the floor in front of her
61
Mrs
Kettner and Debbie rush out to see what Marnie is gaping at
Debbie (still pregnant) is immediately threatened by the way Eric is looking at Molly
(') Everyone, this is Molly McCall
Kirk's never seen his family so impressed
He can't hide his grin
Ron pops the cap off his beer and it overflows a bit
' '  - Kirk, Molly, Mr
& Mrs
Kettner, Marnie, Ron and Debbie sit around the kitchen table and feast on a meatloaf dinner
Eric is at the fridge grabbing a beer
Marnie is angrily watching Ron whose eyes are all over Molly
You want another one Dad
You read my mind
You two take it easy now
We have guests
() Eric honey, 'm sure if you apologize to Leroy, he'll take you back
Eric returns to the table with the beers
Nah, fuck him
Anyways, Leroy ain't payin' shit ever since he trucked in all those spics from Fresno
Geeze Eric
Ron looks offended and raises a palm to indicate that
got this, Kirk
Eric, before you go bad-mouthin' a whole group of people, you should know that my grandmother on my father's side is from Fresno
Hey, 'm sorry
didn't know
() So, Molly
What do you do
'm an event planner
62
You see
That's using your head
That's a business to get into
Well, thank you Eric
Book a band, blow up a few balloons and people pay out the ass for it
There's a little more to it than that, Eric
Molly handles some big events
She's even doing a benefit with Billy Joel next month
() Actually, Eric's right
Just a few balloons
Molly smiles to reassure Kirk that she can handle herself
You know, Molly, 'm a business owner myself
little restaurant
wouldn't really call it a restaurant, Ron
We serve food that people eat
So - restaurant
It's a Pizza Hut with no tables
It's a take out place
So, Molly, me and Debbie here are getting hitched
What do you get for a wedding job
Kirk raises his eyebrows into "please-behave-yourself" puppy dog eyes
Eric shoots back an "oh whatever" sneer
Hmmm
Honestly,  don't really do a lot of weddings
specialize more in fund-raisers, corporate events, that kind of thing
() 63
(') Right now 'm working on the annual benefit for the Children's Cancer Center
But you've done weddings
've done a few
So, what do you get for one
Dad, could you
Don't get your panties in a wad, Kirk
He's just making conversation
Geeze, there are so many factors that affect the cost of a wedding
We're looking at about two hundred people and we're gonna do this whole Nascar theme
'm getting a kick-ass dress made out of actual checkered flags and Eric is going to be in an orange tux with a big Home Depot logo on the back and Tony Stewart's number 20 on the shoulders
Oh, how fun
So what's the damage for supervising something like that
Eric, please
'm just talkin' ballpark
'm ain't gonna try and Jew her down
64
Okay
Before expenses, my base fee for a non-charity event is fifteen thousand
So, 'd ballpark that somewhere around twenty-five grand
() Fuck a duck
For a moment everyone is chewing and there is a break in the conversation
Kirk is getting wound up tighter and tighter
(') So you're making a comfortable living, you seem like you got your head together more or less and Christ, look at ya
What the hell you doing with numbnuts here
Eric
Come on, Ma - we're all thinking it
Molly, 'm so sorry
No, it's fine
The truth is, Kirk and  are just getting to know one another but so far,  think he's decent, he's funny and
You know, when we first met, Kirk asked me in all sincerity if  knew how to do an oil change
Eric, Ron and Mr
Kettner each let out a quick burst of "yeah right" laughter
(') know
And, you're right,  don't but
just love that he asked
moment passes as they all process this
The women at the table all know exactly what Molly means
The men are simply confused
Funny
Kirk is funny
Tell us a joke there Sinbad
65
(to Kirk) Well  hope you can hold onto this one pumpkin
(to Molly) When Marnie broke up with him he was devastated for months, the poor little guy
Marnie looks up, surprised and touched by the comment
Kirk is mortified
No shit, when you dump him, he's liable to kill himself
Kirk rubs his own head to keep it from exploding
Molly calms him with a hand on his back
This move isn't lost on Marnie
' '  - Kirk splashes water on his face and then looks for a towel but can't find one
He's forced to use his sleeve
He is a wreck
He takes a deep breath and steps out into
' ' to find Marnie at the front door putting her coat on
Are you heading home
Got to get home and let Peanut out
(she wipes some lint off of Kirk's shirt sleeve
) Kirk, you look really good
Thanks
You do too
Marnie smiles a sad smile
Ron
Let's go
'm coming
It was really fantastic to meet you Molly
If you ever need a pizza
Ron gives Molly a hug that makes Marnie as uncomfortable as it does Molly
He then passes Kirk as he crosses to the front door, carrying a pile of foiled over paper plates
66
(') Cripes Kirk
Crack a window in there pirate
Ron and Marnie exit
Kirk walks back into
' ' Mrs
Kettner and Molly are cleaning up
Molly, you don't have to do that
No, It's fine
You let us have some girl time
Take these downstairs to your dad
She hands Kirk a bag of Fritos and shoes him through the basement door
' '  - Kirk's father has built a tacky little basement bar decorated with neon beer signs and Eric's old trophies and ribbons
Mr
Kettner and Debbie sit at the bar and smoke as Eric stands behind the bar and serves them cocktails
Kirk comes down the basement stairs and joins them
The hockey game wrap-up highlights are running on a  mounted above the bar
So, what was the final score
You think you're hot shit now
Is that it
Look, Eric, you've had a lot to drink tonight and
Don't tell him what to do
(to Eric) You're doing fine, baby
You think you're better than me
Say it
Well take a look around, Big Slick
(re: trophies) Every one of these says Eric
First place
First Place
() 67
(') Winner
Winner
You think you're the winner now
Well forget it, man
don't buy this for a second
() Well, it's been fun
Now don't be that way, boy
All your big brother is trying to say is that we're worried about you
You show up here with that piece of ass
Either you're fucking with us or she's fucking with you so which is it
Look,  know she's a little out of my league but
little
Are you shitting me
Alright, alright
think we can all agree that Debbie here is one wicked hot box
Debbie smiles and squeezes Eric's hand
Mr
Kettner nods and raises his glass
She's um
very attractive
Yeah, and this Molly makes her look like a pig
Debbie lets go of Eric's hand and storms upstairs
(') You see
This girl of yours is already startin' shit
(Calling after Debbie) Come on baby
Kirk didn't mean nothing by that
Look,  don't know what's going on either but
'm goin' upstairs and gettin' to the bottom of this
68
Eric
No
think this gal is messing with my little brother and 'm not going to sit still for it
Eric
Okay
know
'm sure she's just slumming or something and it's all going to be over any minute but, Jesus Christ
She'll come to her senses without any help from you
She's up there with
Kirk turns to point up the stairs
As he glances back, he finds Molly standing on the steps listening and frowning down at him
Before Kirk can get a word out, Molly storms out of the house
Kirk runs upstairs but she's in her car before he can get out the front door
Eric appears behind him
Way to go numbnuts
You should have let me handle it
- Kirk stands at work, searching Habib's bag and looking grouchy
Fuller monitors Kirk, arms crossed
Habib lets out a long irritated sigh
know
'm sorry, man
Kirk hands the bag back to Habib and sends him on his way
Randy, another agent, hands Kirk a note
: The note reads, "Kirk, We need to talk
'm in the food court
-
" Kirk sighs
Stainer is now reading over Kirk's shoulder
Well,  guess this is it
'm surprised she even bothered
The food court is crowded
Kirk looks around for Molly but does not see her
69
(
) Good, you got my note
Kirk turns to find Marnie sitting at a table working on a Burrito Supreme
Oh
Yeah
Hi
'm sorry to bug you at work but this couldn't wait
Kirk sits down
(') Kirk,  think  messed up
see a change in you and  like it
So, was thinking that we should maybe
get back together
Just to try it out, you know
Wow
don't know, Marnie
Why not
Please don't say it's because of this Molly person
No,  think  already screwed that up anyway
Good
was really worried about you with her
She seems like kind of a bitch
What
She is not
Well, she acts like she's better than everyone with her hybrid car and her la-de-da charity work
She doesn't do that at all, Marnie
You're just putting that on her
70
Okay, maybe so
See
This is what mean
You never argued with me before
You're really growing
What about Ron
If you want to get back together, of course, 'll break up with Ron
You mean you're still with him
'm not going to risk being all alone just because you don't know what's good for you
Come on, Kirk
Deep down, you know where you belong
You're right,  think  do
Say hi to Ron for me
Kirk stands and walks away
- Kirk and Stainer are at the ticket gate
Kirk pays for his ticket but Stainer stands staring at him
What
This wasn't my idea
ain't dropping twenty bucks to go in there
God-damned planes are in the sky
can see 'em just fine from the parking lot for free
Kirk begrudgingly buys Stainer a ticket
Kirk and Stainer move through the crowd
Stainer now carries a corn dog, a giant soda and an armload of Air Show memorabilia, including an inflatable /-18 Hornet
71
She's working one of the kids' charities
'm guessing they might be down by the rides
Whoa dude, check it out
The Blue Angels
Five men in flight suits and aviator sunglasses strut through the crowd in slow motion
They exude masculine confidence
(') Those are the coolest guys in the entire world
Think about it - George Clooney or Derek Jeter would trade places with those guys in a second
Can you imagine the sheer magnitude of puss those fuckers tag
'm gonna get 'em to sign my Hornet
Stainer runs toward them
He joins some kids and beautiful women who are already getting autographs
Kirk spots Molly working a charity booth
He crosses to her
She turns to him with a this-better-be-good stance
Molly
Kirk
just wanted to apologize for last night
for my family
Your family  can deal with
And for me
For what  said
Do you really think 'm that shallow
You think  need to slum
No
don't know what to think
You just have to understand that this is a new area for me
Believe it or not,  don't have gobs of experience with beautiful women
72
Is that all  am to you
No, but  don't have much experience with brilliant, successful, wonderful women either
This melts Molly a bit
Kirk, this can't work if you put me up on some kind of pedestal
It's not that
Okay, look
When  was a kid, we played a lot of baseball in my neighborhood
The worst part was picking teams because  was always picked last
Every time
Like they couldn't start a friggin' game without first establishing how much  sucked
So, now you come along and make me feel like the first pick
But
what if  can't hit
Molly softens and smiles
You already got to first base
Just keep your eye on the ball
Kirk nods and smiles back
Molly steals a quick kiss
(') Let me tie up a couple things and 'll show you around the grounds
Sounds good
Molly goes into a tent to speak to Patty
Kirk watches her with a calm, relieved smile
(
) Boy, she sure is something, huh
Kirk turns toward the imposing Blue Angel pilot standing behind him
The pilot removes his shades - it's Talon
73
It's Kirk right
(firm handshake) Excellent to see you again, sir
Oh, Talon
You're a Blue Angel
Yes sir, a Naval Aviator
Perfect
Okay,  get it - Talon is what - your call-sign
No, it's my name
Then what's your call-sign
Oh, 'd rather not say
It's embarrassing
Just something the guys gave me
Talon puts his arm around Kirk and walks him away from the booth
(') Anyway listen Kirk, is it fair to say that you and Mol are close
Yeah,  guess
Well,  understand that fellas like yourself tend to have uniquely candid relationships with the women they befriend
Am  right
Fellas like myself
Don't get me wrong
have no problem with your lifestyle
What grown men do in the privacy of their homes is none of my concern
Talon, 'm not
74
Hey, 'm in the Navy
don't ask and  don't expect you to tell
Talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone
(') Now,  don't know what Molly's told you about me, but anything bad - deserve
hurt that girl
hurt one of God's own angels and 've regretted it every minute since
No
She speaks very highly
God as my witness,   make it right
get her back
Can count on you to put in the good word for me, Poncho
Um
Sure
You're the man
Come here
Talon embraces Kirk in a tight hug
(') There you go
Feel the tolerance
Another Blue Angel calls over while signing Stainer's plane
#2 Yo
Foot-Long
We scramble in ten
Roger
Talon finishes the long hug
He and the other Blue Angels walk off in formation
Stainer rejoins Kirk
That was Talon
Who
The Blue Angel guy
(cracking up) Duuuuude
Molly joins them
75
: 1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd
Kirk's  as every guy that passes checks her out
Close on Kirk's proud expression
The Blue Angels take flight
Close on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate formation
wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell out "" inside a heart
Reverse to pan across Molly (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter
) 2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre
She squeezes his hand and he smiles back at her
Molly turns back to the screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look
The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and stares down at her cleavage
The man looks up to meet Kirk's gaze and smiles back
He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind Molly's head
Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back
Molly is oblivious to this exchange
3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has stopped to tie his shoe
When he trots after her to catch up, he is tackled by two cops
Nice try pervert
Molly spins around, horrified
(') It's okay ma'am
This fat tub of shit was following you but we got him
Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the cop's grasp
4) Kirk, in his  uniform, addresses a group of patients at the Children's Cancer Center
He demonstrates a metal detector wand
Molly sits with the kids who look bored out of their minds
Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has come up behind him
Talon is dressed in his flight suit and carrying an arm-load of toy jets
The kids excitedly jump up and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him
- Dressed up and wearing party hats, Kirk, Stainer, Devon, Jack and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant
76
The place is decorated with balloons and streamers
huge banner reads, "
" Seriously, what's with the banner
She's blind, right
Seems like they could have saved a few bucks there
Patty runs in
Here they come
Everybody hide
Is that really necessary
Stainer
Just hide
They hide
Molly leads her sister, , into the restaurant
"Surprise
" Molly hugs Katie
(') (to Stainer) Still think she's Al Qaeda
Stainer brushes off the comment
Molly waves Kirk over
Katie, 'd like you to meet Kirk
It's so nice to meet you, 've heard great things
Oh, thank you
Molly raves about her big sister non-stop
May
Katie reaches out to feel Kirk's face
She's a bit perplexed by the result
Two blind teenaged boys approach
Mrs
McCall
Robert
Is Jerry with you
Yes, ma'am
Happy Birthday
77
It's so nice you came
(to Molly) These are two of my star pupils, Robert and Jerry
Boys, this is my sister, Molly
It's nice to meet you
They each feel Molly's face and then start elbowing one another like a couple of horny construction workers
cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but uncopyrighted birthday song
Katie blows out her candles
What's your wish, Katie
wish Kirk would play the piano for me
Kirk's face drops
Molly kisses her sister on the forehead as she has obviously coached the response
Immediately Patty is behind Kirk, pushing him
Kirk tries to politely decline but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the piano bench
Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play
Really
can barely play
Come on, Kirk
For my birthday
Kirk is sweating
He reaches for the keys but he is now white as a ghost
Molly watches in suspense, rethinking what she's done
Kirk's hands shake
He moves them around, hunting for a place to begin
The party-goers stare and the room gets quiet
Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though he might vomit
Molly presses play on a  player behind the bar
Suddenly, a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound system
Katie jumps up to dance with her friends
Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off
Talon appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder
It's okay Kirk
You'll rock us next time right chief
78
Oh, hey Talon
Thanks
'm glad you're here
feel terrible about our little misunderstanding
don't know what had me thinking you were a gay fella
Molly tells me you two have been seeing each other
Patty passes between them and gives Talon a dirty look
(') She's got every right
'd hate me too
()  want to congratulate you, Poncho
You're the better man
Now, 'll step aside and truly wish you the best of luck
wouldn't wish losing that girl on my worst foe
But, make no mistake, you blow it and 'll be waiting in wings
Love and war, right chief
Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute
Kirk holds his forced confidence until Talon departs
Once alone, Kirk's poise deflates and he plops down into a chair
The party goes on and Katie opens a small present
Oh, it's a
Who's this from
Nobody claims it but Jack and Devon look at Stainer
What
It's closed captioned
Patty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is away from the group
Across the room, Talon raises a glass to them
Patty gives Talon the finger
What did he do
Listen, Molly would kill me if she knew  was telling you this but 'm trying to do you a favor
79
Okay
Molly has this physical
um issue
You know, kind of like a birth defect
Oh, my God
It's not a big deal but she's really self-conscious about it
Talon and some other guys she's dated have been weirded out and made her feel like a freak
What is it
It's better if she tells you but if you can't deal with it, just get lost now and don't put her through that heartbreak again
No, no
wouldn't do that
Good
'Cause if you do, it'll be your last conscious act
(she stands) Cake
Patty heads off to get some cake
Kirk sits, considering this information
He looks at Molly
She is wearing a small black dress
She looks perfect in every way
Kirk crosses the room and walks out to the
He throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance similar to the one he had done after their first kiss
Stainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and Jack are smoking a bowl
Devon hears Kirk's celebration and peers around the corner
He waves the others over
The guys come around the front to join Kirk
Dude
80
(playfully chipper) My friends
Whassup Bitches
What
What's going on
My troubles are over boys
It's all going to work out
Check it out - Molly has
Wait for it
Kirk pauses for dramatic effect and then puts his thumbs up
(') a birth defect
Excuse me
That's terrible
No
That's awesome
Don't you get it
Ahhhh No
Sure,  get it
She needs a good guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she dates can't handle it, right
It sent Talon packing
Kirk and Stainer high five
Jack and Devon look disturbed
Well, what's wrong with her
don't know yet
Patty just said she had a physical issue
Well that could be anything
Did she say it was a birth defect
81
She said it was, "something like a birth defect
" What if it's something really bad
hope it is
hope it's something that would make most guys run screaming
It won't matter to me
love her
That's cool that you love her but it's pretty fucked up to be rooting for a harsh deformity
Oh, wow
What if this is Patty's way of telling you that Molly is a man
Hey, if that chick has a dick, 'll suck it
- Kirk and Molly are cleaning up after the party
Kirk is relaxed and in a fantastic mood
Patty gets her coat and hugs Molly before exiting
Molly sheepishly approaches Kirk
Kirk, 'm so sorry about the piano thing
It was stupid of me
No
know what you were trying to do
It's okay
wish  could have played for her but
Well, anyway, thanks for all your help with Katie's party
know it meant a lot to her
Molly kisses Kirk
Now he's calm and kisses her back passionately
She smiles a naughty smile at him
(') Tonight
82
Tonight
They start cleaning up as fast as they can
Kirk is beaming
'  - : Kirk and Molly enter her modern, luxurious condo
Kirk takes her coat
They kiss
Kirk opens a bottle of wine
He pours one glass to share
They sit on the couch talking
Kirk is on
He is confident and silly and Molly is eating it up
They are making out passionately on the couch
Molly stands and extends her hand to Kirk
Kirk stands and his boner is impossible to miss
This time he looks down at it as if to say, "How 'bout them apples
" Molly laughs and leads him into the bedroom
Kirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom
He lights a candle
He is now in a normal state of nervousness but nothing like he had been before
He pulls out a stick of gum
He chews it quickly and spits it out
Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this
He decides to sit
Molly opens the door
She is wearing sexy ligerie and slippers
She looks perfect
She crosses to the bed and sits down next to Kirk
They kiss but Molly stops
Kirk, before we do this, there's something 'm really insecure about and you're going to see it sooner or later so
Hey, take a look at me
Molly smiles nervously
She stands in front of him, Crying Game style
She removes her feet from her slippers and looks down at them
Kirk looks down
Even her feet are fantastic
(') What
83
Don't rush me
Okay, look
She parts her toes
They are webbed
Kirk's face drops
That's it
Kirk jumps up and paces around
(') That's it
That's the best you can do
This is your big flaw
If you can't handle it
Jesus Christ
can't
thought you were going to show me some kind of hairy growth or a third nipple or something  could work with
What the hell is wrong with you
You know what's wrong with me
'll tell you
'm fat
'm bald
'm ugly
'm hairy
'm uncoordinated
'm uncreative
'm not a college graduate
've never been to Europe
have a shitty job
drive a shitty car
You want me to go on
Because  can
No
So, here  think that the perfect Molly McCall is finally going to show me a good reason why she's messing around with the likes of me
And this is all you got
You can't wear friggin' flip-flops
Kirk, 've given you plenty of good reasons
84
Oh, yeah
'm nice
'm funny ask cute, stupid questions
Right
That doesn't get a three hooked up with a ten
Not in this world
three what
What are you talking about
Look
What the hell is going on here
What are you up to
What am  up to
Good God
Please, tell me you're a terrorist
Tell me you're on a scavenger hunt
Just tell me something that makes sense because all you're doing is driving me nuts
(hurt and resigned) The only thing 'm going to tell you is that 'd like you to leave
Fine
'm going
Webbed feet
Are you fucking kidding me
Kirk grabs his coat and heads out the door
Molly slumps onto her bed and cries as the door slams
- Kirk is at his post looking terribly sad
Stainer is working at the same lane and is obviously feeling bad for his friend
Fuller taps Kirk on the shoulder to alert him that Habib is coming through
Habib sees this and takes his bag straight to the search table, where he opens it for Kirk
Kirk doesn't look inside
Go on, Habib
You're good
Really
Great
Habib steps off to his gate
Fuller gets in Kirk's face
85
You think you're pretty smart don't you Kettner
Thin ice mister
Kirk stomps away from the checkpoint
(') Good
Don't come back, Kettner
America is safer without you
Stainer goes after Kirk
Kirk walks out the doors
Stainer catches up to him and they walk down the busy curb at a quick, angry pace
Kirky
Hold up, man
What are you doing
You can't let her screw up your life
Get away from me Stainer
Whoa
Don't take it out on me
We both knew this Molly thing wasn't going to work out
It ain't my fault
You're right
It's not your fault
It's my fault for listening to all your
pernicious advice
What the fuck you talkin' about
All you did was fill my head with all this crap about threes and tens and how 'm not worthy
Are you worthy of a chick like that
Maybe
don't know
But that's not the point
You're supposed to be my God damned best friend
You know what
() 86
(') think you were jealous and you set out to sabotage us from the start
That is total bullshit
Then why weren't you there for me
What if she actually liked me
Maybe with a little help,  could have pulled it off
Kirk steps onto an
Willy (the Russian) is behind the wheel and as happy as ever
few others are seated on the bus
Stainer follows Kirk on board
They remain standing, holding onto poles
It is Kirk and his crazy friend Stinker and they are most upset
Willy steps on it and drives like a maniac, knocking Kirk and Stainer around as they argue
Kirk, she was going to hurt you
Look at me
'm hurt now
Willy occasionally blurts out mindless echoes of their argument, which Kirk and Stainer mostly ignore, like
He's hurting now
The longer this went on the worse it would have been
guarantee it
You don't know what you're talking about
He does not know
Yes,  do, Kirk
know exactly what 'm talking about
87
Perhaps he does know after all
Remember last year when you hardly saw me for about two months
met my own perfect ten
Tina Jordan
Smart, cool and hot like you wouldn't believe
Hotter than Molly even
Yeah right
So how come  never heard a word about her until now
Yes, how come no word of this Tina
didn't tell anyone
didn't want to jinx it
She was perfect
was spilling over with
with fucking happy
You know
Fucking happy
Two months into it, she dumps me
And  knew it was coming
girl like that
Sooner or later she was bound to get a better offer
But it kicked my ass, man
was depressed for months
That's what that was
You said you had that fatigue syndrome thing
didn't want everyone knowing what a pussy  was
Dude, it was a hurt can't even put into words
What a pussy
couldn't watch you go through that 'cause  love you, man
You're the brother  never had
Stainer leans over and hugs Kirk
Kirk doesn't hug back
88
You have a brother, Stainer
Yeah, but he's a cheese-dick
Kirk's phone rings
He answers, forcing Stainer to let go
Hello
Maury sits at his desk
Kirk
Geeze, 'm glad  caught you
Listen son,  got something to tell you and don't get mad at me okay
'Cause this thing ain't my fault
You might want to sit down for this
Kirk slumps into a seat and listens, looking upset and shocked
Stainer stares at Kirk, trying to get a sense of what Kirk is being told
What
'  - Patty sits behind a reception desk in a small but stylish lobby
sign above her desk reads, "McCall Events
" Kirk walks in
Patty puts down her work and stares back at him
Is Molly in
You got some big red apples showing your face around here again
know
'm sorry
just
Is she here
No
Get lost
Stainer bursts in sweating and panting
89
(') Oh, for Christ sake
This one too
Patty comes out from behind her desk
(') 'm warning you both - Molly has been through enough
You go near her and  will fuck you all the way up
Understand
Stainer swaggers up into Patty's face
Listen, bitch
Patty throws an elbow and Stainer's head jacks back
She is instantly on him, grabbing him in a headlock and punching him in the face
(') Ahhh
Jesus Christ
Kirk
Who's your Mommy
Come on
Who's your Mommy
You are
That's right
Patty is, isn't she
Patty
Cut it out
just came to tell her that something happened
Something really major happened
Patty stops punching and looks up curiously
Stainer remains in the headlock - also curious
What happened
Patty punches him again
You shut your hole
(to Kirk) What happened
First off, 'm sorry
Okay
90
Patty rams Stainer's head into the door
Every time you say you're sorry, dumbshit here gets his bell rung
Okay, okay
Sorry
just
Patty slams him again
Dude
Stop apologizing
Look
know  was acting like an idiot
She's just so
Well, was really having a hard time with everyone thinking  was Molly's brother or her co-worker or her gay friend or whatever
mean, nobody believed that we were together
It's too late for this shit, Kirk
But 've got it worked out now
Patty and Stainer wait for it
Kirk decides how to phrase it
(') My Grandmother left me three million dollars
Seriously
Patty drops Stainer on the floor
thought she was a blackjack dealer
It turns out she bought stock in Caesars Palace back in the sixties
Nobody knew she still had it don't think she even knew
Wow
So, what does this have to do with Molly
91
See
Now it makes sense - me with her
'm a millionaire now
So, what, now you can afford her
No
No
get it
It's not a whore thing
Now it works out in his own mind
Right
He can relax and stop acting like a freak because now he's bringing something to the table
Right, Kirky
Right
Well, no
Now that you say it out loud
don't know
You know what, Kirk -  told Molly you were different but you're just as shallow and full of shit as the rest of them, aren't you
Yeah, maybe  am
Kirk walks out
- Stainer is at his post watching the luggage on the x-ray monitor
Suddenly, he sees Kirk coming through followed by Marnie, Mr
& Mrs
Kettner, Eric and Debbie (still pregnant)
They are all wearing bright yellow sweatshirts
Stainer runs around the machine to hug Kirk, who looks a little numb
Kirky
How you been, brother
What are you doing here
Me and Marnie and the family are going to Branson
You know
So you're "Branson Bound
" Stainer is referring to Kirk's shirt that reads, " " in big letters
92
() These were Marnie's idea
To make it easy for us to stick together
The others come through
Their shirts are decorated likewise
Come on, Kirk
gotta go
Stainer takes the boarding pass from Kirk's hand
Relax, your flight doesn't leave for another forty five minutes
(to Marnie) 'll meet you guys down at the gate, alright
Marnie isn't pleased but she's going along with it
Eric calls back as they all head to the gate
Hey Stainer
Long time no see
Take care, bro
Why is he so nice all of a sudden
Probably because 'm getting three million dollars next week
Shit, that's right
() So you're back with Marnie then, huh
Yeah,  know, but it's for the best
'm more secure with her
'm actually happy to be done with all that Molly craziness
Ron comes through security and over to Kirk
93
Hey Stainer
Hey Pirate, can you spot me a twenty
want to get me one of them travel pillows
Kirk gives Ron a twenty and Ron steps away
Stainer is appalled
He calls after Ron
How come 'm not a pirate
(then to Kirk) Dude, do not tell me that he's going with you guys
He already bought his ticket and my dad likes him
It's no big deal
Look at me Big Slick
Kirk doesn't look into his eyes
What
Look at me
Kirk looks
(') Tell me things are good
Don't be such a drama queen
Things are fine
gotta go
Alright, man
It was good to see you, Kirk
They exchange an awkward handshake
Kirk walks away
Stainer stands alone, watching him go
Stainer tightens his jaw and runs his fingers through his hair
Finally he kicks his head back and, with great determination, he stomps off in the opposite direction
Follow Stainer past security, dodging passengers and carts
He arrives at the
94
Stainer marches up to the Orange Julius
short, doughy, plain girl works the counter
(This is the same girl that Stainer had claimed to have "boned" earlier
) She's wearing an orange visor and rubber gloves
Several customers are waiting but Stainer moves to stand in front of her
She looks up from her smoothie
She has drink powder on her face
She groans to see him
Elmer, 've got customers here
Tina,  need to know right now why it didn't work out with us
She hands a smoothie to a customer
That's a large Julius
Twelve fifty
This is important
was good to you
was sensitive, right
Hey, Desperado, you gonna order something or what
Stainer gets in the customer's face
The fuck you just call me
Oh, for Christ's
Tammy
Can you cover me
- large crowd of passengers are waiting to board
The gate agent, makes an announcement
Okay folks, we're going to start by boarding the  group
All 's are now welcome to board
Marnie butts into the line
95
() Look, 've got seven people in my party so we're going to need to board right away
Are you folks in the  group
What difference does that make
Well, because you seem like a little bit of a
May  see your boarding pass
Fine
We're not in the  group but we're still getting on next
She hands him the pass - marked "
" Oh, it looks like you're a raging So, you're gonna want to take a seat until your group is called
She stomps away
- Stainer and Tina sit at a table
He sits with his head down like a sad little boy
She pities him
really liked you Elmer, but all that stuff about me being a ten and how lucky you were and always checking up to see if  was going to dump you
Well, you did dump me, so
What could  do
You were all up in my business all the time couldn't breathe
It was my stupid job, wasn't it
You were embarrassed
96
work at Orange Julius, Elmer
If you would have just chilled out and been yourself
Okay,  can do that
She holds up her finger with an engagement ring on it
Stainer drops his head onto the table
Tina rubs his hair for a second and then walks away
- 737 - Kirk is somber as he finds his seat near the middle of the plane
From two rows back, Eric reaches over some other passengers to tap Kirk on the shoulder
Tom fuckin' Wopat, bro
Eric hangs up a high five and Kirk leaves it hanging
Kirk takes a seat on the aisle next to Marnie
He gives Marnie a forced smile
She puts her head on his shoulder
Pan over to the window seat where Ron sits watching them, wearing his new travel pillow
Suddenly, there is a commotion at the front of the plane
What
You don't have authority on board this aircraft
Stainer barges past the flight attendant, holding up his badge
It's okay folks
This guy's drunk as fuck and he shit himself
We gotta get him off the plane
Stainer grabs Kirk by the shoulder, pulls him out of his seat and about two rows down the aisle before Kirk overpowers him and stops
Stainer
What are you nuts
You were right
messed you up
We gotta fix this thing
Let's go
97
Stainer
No
Believe it or not, this isn't about you
In fact it's none of your business
Kirky
In junior high  peed my pants in class and Eric started calling me Stainer, remember
Okay, yeah
Pretty soon everyone else started calling me Stainer because they knew it would make me cry
Then you told me to own that name, to call myself Stainer so nobody could hurt me with it anymore
What's your point
My point is
um
Oh, shit was just in the crapper and  had this thing all worked out
Damn it
The pilot is now behind Stainer and towering over him
Sir, 'm going to have to ask you to exit the aircraft immediately
Stainer turns into his face
'm going to have to ask you to fuck off immediately before  feed you your own fuckin' teeth
The pilot backs up and goes for help
Jesus Stains
You're going to get arrested
And  won't be here to bail you out this time
Ooohh
That was my point
You saved me
That time and a bunch of other times too
() 98
(') You gotta let me save you this time
It's my turn
Your grandma didn't leave you three million bucks so you could take these a- holes to Branson
Eric gets up and steps into Stainer's face
In mid-sentence and without pausing Stainer zaps Eric with a stun gun
Eric sails back into his seat as Stainer continues
(') These people hardly know you
Stainer,  appreciate that you think you're helping me but 'm with Marnie now
Kirk, Marnie's a fuckin' bitch
(to Marnie) All due respect
Hit him Kirk
Or else  will
Fuller and two other security people enter the plane
The pilot briefs them on what's happening
Kirk
You said Marnie makes you feel secure but security is bullshit
Look at our jobs
It's all for show
For all we know, there's a bomb on this plane right now
The other passengers gasp and most of them look at Habib, who sits a few seats behind Kirk
What
Fuller grabs Stainer by the collar
You want to see what  think of security
Stainer turns and punches Fuller in the face, knocking him backwards onto the other agents
Oh, Stainer, what did you do
99
Kirk
When  added all this up for you  made one big mistake
You are a ten
'  ,
Kirk just stares back
Fuller and the agents grab Stainer but he clutches a seat and stays put
(') You're not buying any of this bullshit are you
No
Stainer loses his grip and the agents drag him off the plane
Kirk sits down and Marnie comforts him
- Over a bummed out song we see different areas of the airport
People on moving sidewalks
People on escalators
Bags moving around on a carousel
People in line
Flight Arrival and Departure times
Food trays moving down a buffet
Bags moving by on the x-ray monitor
People walking like cattle to their gates
Through the crowd, we see a man running against the traffic
It's Kirk
- Molly,   looking beautiful in a formal gown, moves through a sea of   tables
Hundreds of formally dressed people are seated   around the tables, eating dinner
Molly greets, kisses   and shakes hands with several people as she goes
Kirk is huffing and puffing as he rounds the corner and arrives at the checkpoint
He looks around frantically
Randy
Where's Stainer
Randy points to a room marked, "Airport Security - Authorized Personnel Only
" Kirk bursts in to find Stainer bent over a metal table
Fuller (with two black eyes) and another agent hold him down as a homeland security agent stands behind Stainer, giving him the full cavity search
Kirk doesn't miss a beat
100
Stainer
don't have a car here
need your van
Right on
The keys are in my jacket
jacket is hanging by the door
Kirk reaches in and grabs the keys
He turns fast and exits
Fuller jacks Stainer's head onto the table
(') Kirky wait
The door opens more slowly and Kirk regards his friend with great reverence
Stainer strains to lift his head against Fuller's strength
(') Listen, Kirk
(dramatic pause and music) It's three on the tree and the clutch sticks
Stainer's head is jacked back onto the table
Thanks buddy
Kirk bolts
- This room is set up as a staging area for the cancer benefit
Patty and several others are buzzing around preparing for the next phase of the evening
Molly enters, holding a walkie talkie up to her head and speaking into it
No,  need the staff ready to help with bids when the auction begins
- over
- don't think we can spare anyone - over
Patty grabs the walkie talkie
Leslie
We're not here to feed these people, we're here to cure fucking cancer
() 101
(') Now  want every one of those motherfuckers back there taking bids in fifteen - out
Patty tosses the walkie-talkie back and then crosses to help a group of young cancer patients, some in wheelchairs, to unpack their sculptures and label them for the auction
stressed-out woman in a  hairdo picks up a 's sculpture
She hails Molly
Ms
McCall, we've got a big problem
What is it
This young man has made an ashtray
Okay
Well, what do you want from me
Kids make ashtrays
It's a cancer benefit
Don't you think this sends the wrong message
It's a really nice ashtray
They're not bidding on the artwork; they're bidding on the kids
It's fine
Beehive sighs hard and hands the ashtray back to the boy
Molly turns around and a look of surprise comes over her
(') What are you doing here
Reverse to show Talon holding a ridiculously large flower arrangement
came to say 'm sorry and to put in a request for a second chance
- Ms
McCall, the auction is underway - over
102
'm sorry
have to get in there
Can we talk about this afterwards
'm looking forward to it
The emcee is taking bids on a little sculpture of an abstract four-legged animal
Timothy Brigg's sculpture of a
fire truck
Sold to the woman in the green dress for four hundred fifty dollars
Congratulations ma'am and thanks so much
Molly picks up the small boy's ashtray and joins the emcee on stage
She takes a deep breath before facing the crowd
(') Our next item
Well, here she is folks, the woman who donates her time to make this amazing event possible, our own Molly McCall
Huge applause
Thank you
Thanks, Bob
'm so sorry for my tardiness
The next item up for bids is from nine-year- old Walter Benegan
And this is a
little something that you can put your paper clips or do-dads in
Oh, who am  kidding, it's an ashtray
(audience laughs) Let's start the bidding at one hundred dollars
One hundred
One hundred
Thank you sir
Two hundred
Two hundred to the
103
2 Two Fifty
Two seventy five
Fantastic
Two-seventy-five
Do hear three hundred
No replies
The small boy hangs his head
He was hoping his piece would fetch more
His mother pats him on the head
(') Two Seventy Five going once
Going twice
(
) Ten thousand dollars
The small boy looks up, elated
The spotlight searches the room and lands on Kirk near the back
The audience applauds
Kirk
hope you don't really think this is going to
Eleven thousand
Talon stands across the room, crossing his arms in defiance
What
Eric bursts in through a door near Kirk
Fifteen Thousand
Fifteen thousand five hundred
Both of you
This is ridiculous
Go get him Kirk
It's chump change to you now
Twenty Thousand
104
The crowd applauds
Is that a serious bid
Fifty thousand dollars
Bigger applause
Talon
Please
Eric makes a fist to indicate that it's time for the killing blow
Kirk nods back his agreement
Three million dollars
Eric's eyes go wide
This is not what he had in mind
The crowd erupts into laughter
Talon also laughs off the bid
Kirk, that's your entire inheritance
The crowd shifts from laughter into excited chatter
(') Folks, calm down
don't want to get anyone's hopes up
It's only fair that  clarify something to the bidder
Kirk, please understand that if you commit this money, we will all be eternally grateful and  think your grandmother will be very proud of you
But it doesn't change anything between you and me
This sets off a volley of whispers among the crowd and puts a smile on Talon's face
(') So, again, is this a serious bid
Kirk looks to Molly, then his brother - who is shaking his head
He then scans the hopeful expressions on the faces of the kids and their parents
Kirk takes a deep breath
Three million dollars
105
You stupid son of a bitch
Three million going once
Going twice
Sold to the man in the Branson Bound sweatshirt
The crowd cheers
Congratulations to little Walter whose ashtray has brought in more than any piece in our history
The young sculptor beams
The crowd cheers again
Kirk gives a smile and a nod of resignation as he leaves the room
Kirk and Eric sit at the bar, each nursing a drink
Eric is fuming
You are such a numbnut
am telling you - absolute numbnuttery
(
) Excuse me
May  use that ashtray
Kirk turns to find that he is sitting next to  , who is smoking a cigar
Eric passes him the ashtray that Kirk just bought
Sure
Careful with it there, Captain Jack
It cost him three million bucks
Billy Joel, ashes in the ashtray
Yeah,  saw that
Tough break in there, my friend
Still, that was a hell of a good thing you did for those kids
Thanks
Beautiful women huh
What are you gonna do
106
guess 'm going to go home
It's none of my business but  do know a thing or two about hooking up with women who are out of your league
Can  tell you a little secret
Kirk and Eric look at one another in disbelief and then at Joel
Sure
Look, it's not about money, fame or power
Whoa
All due respect there, Big Shot
How would you know
You had all that shit when you bagged the big ones
Yeah, but  had all that shit when lost 'em too
It's not enough
You believe this fuckin' guy
Jesus Christ, Eric
'm trying to get some advice from Billy Joel
Do you think you could manage to shut the fuck up for two minutes
Fine
Geeze
What's up your ass
Thank you
Look kid, it's not what you can give 'em or even what you can give up
It's what your made of
Joel places a cocktail in front of Kirk and then clinks his own against it
107
- Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome The Piano Man
The Entertainer
And our foundation's greatest champion
Mr
Billy Joel
The crowd cheers as the curtain rises
The crowd's excitement turns to confusion
From the back of the room, Molly notices the crowd's reaction
She turns to see Kirk seated before the huge white grand piano, his hands sweaty and shaking over the keys
Kirk looks at the crowd
Hundreds of confused faces stare back at him
Beehive rushes Patty in a panic
Aren't you going to do something about this
Lady, he just gave three million dollars
He can go up there and try to blow himself for all  care
Kirk wrings his hands as they shake harder
Billy Joel stands in the wings and gives Kirk a nod of, "You can do it
" Molly turns to walk away but notes ring out from the piano and she stops
Kirk plays and sings "Just the Way You Are" - badly
His voice and hands shake but he forges on
The audience is confused, cringing and restless
Someone starts booing
Kirk can't help but glance up to see who it is - it's Eric
When Kirk reaches the instrumental break, he settles in a bit - he can actually play
As the last note fades, Kirk leaps up, and runs out into the
108
Kirk bursts out the door and vomits into a dumpster
He falls backwards against the wall and slides down into a sitting position
(
) You realize that there's a good chance this won't work out
Molly steps out into the alley
(') And you could get hurt
know
And you're going to have to be naked in front of me at some point
can work up to that
Kirk stands up
(') So, you and me are
Three million dollars for kids with cancer and you sing to me
'm not made of wood you know
Molly hugs him
The first intro riff of a piano version of "Pressure" kicks in and the crowd inside goes crazy
(') But one condition
Anything
You have to go brush your teeth right now
Talon walks out into the alley, still holding the flowers
So, Molly
Can we finish our conversation
109
Kirk takes Molly's hand and leads her past Talon
Sorry Poncho, she's with me
: - Close on a preacher
The vows you have just heard are a unique expression of the love between two souls
Close on Kirk - looking dapper but sweaty and nervous
(
) (') Two souls who have come together this day in holy matrimony
Close on Molly - looking more beautiful than ever
(') And by the power vested in me by the great state of Nevada,  now pronounce you husband and wife
You may now

Each are dressed in tuxes that represent the colors, numbers and sponsors of certain drivers
Molly stands among the bridesmaids
Each dressed in a checkered-flag gown
Ron and Marnie are also in the wedding party
Debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and Eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss
