Because you smell like dog poo

You're made of poo

Because moms have been spreading it for years

That little boy is doing those terrible things because he
We see our little girl take this in, like she is just now beginning to understand the ways of the world
(
) Do you understand what this means
We are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk -- that means he likes you
Sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood

Vernon date spot with , cute but holding onto his frat boy roots
They sip their near empty cocktails
So, Janine told me you're a real estate agent
Yeah
But don't worry - not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus benches and grocery carts
So just like on frisbees and notepads
Conor laughs
Gigi smiles -- she's doing well
You got it
Much classier
My thoughts exactly
Gigi sips her drink, and looks at Conor
wonder why Janine never thought of introducing us before
Yeah,  don't know,  ummm - Their  appears, cutting him off
You guys ready for another round
Conor looks to Gigi
7/20/7                                                    5
You want one more
Only if you do
But  mean, if you have to get going  totally
Gigi trails off
Conor considers this for a
We can see on Gigi's face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance
It's an eternity
Umm
Sure
One more
Gigi breathes a  of relief
(') You had Ketel and soda, right
Gigi  and , clearly flattered that Conor remembered her order
She scoots a little closer to him
'  - Gigi and Conor  outside the restaurant
Well, Conor,  had a really nice time
Yeah
It was really nice meeting you
-bye
Gigi waves flirtatiously and walks away, smiling
She turns around to look, and sees Conor Gigi        and dials
(') Hey, it's me
He's cute
think it went well
She sneaks another look over her shoulder to see Conor
(') And  think he might me leaving me a message at home as - we - speak

Conor, that's so nice
Thank you
As Anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of her
He looks back to see her - he's , good looking and supremely likeable
They share a smile
Do you want to go ahead
Hmm
Go ahead
You've only got two things
(into phone) Hold on
She looks at what he's got - a
(') You've only got one thing
Well, technically it's six
And 'm still mulling over a gum purchase
So
He steps aside to let her go
She smiles
(into phone) Hey, let me call you right back
7/20/7                                                    7
She hangs up the phone and moves past Ben, hands her things to the
As he rings them up - she looks back at Ben - they
She hands the cashier her  card - he swipes it
Oh my word
Come on
Seriously
just deposited money today
There's no way - It's not that
Let me check something
He turns and rifles through a stack of papers, finally finding what he was looking for
(') Congratulations
You won
What
Our "Sizzlin' Summer" promotion
You're our 1000th customer in June
The cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an and hands it to Anna
She
Are you kidding
Do  have that kind of manner
joking manner
Anna looks to Ben
She looks like she's about to burst
swear to god, this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me
Ben can't tell if she's kidding
Really
Is that sad
7/20/7                                                   8
No, it's - charming
Congratulations
Anna smiles wide, admiring her cooler
Then - Wait, no
can't accept this
You were here first
didn't win at all
Yes, you did
Trust me - it's fate
You were meant to have that cooler
Anna throws her arms around him and hugs him
Thank you
Ben can't help but laugh
- Conor enters his apartment
sits on the couch watching
Hey
How was the date
Fine
You know
Conor heads for the kitchen, and turns back
(') Why are you here
My cable's out
Conor returns from the kitchen with a beer
You didn't hear the phone ring, did you
Nope
Shit
Anna gave me the "'ll call you right back
" How long ago

Alex winces
Sorry, dude
Do  call back
Alex shrugs
(') know
'll call back and say that 'm going to bed
At 9:30
Genius
It is genius
Because then  can say: "In case you were going to call me back - don't - 'cause 'll be sleeping
" Sounds foolproof
Conor pulls off his jacket and tosses it next to a box - which contains about 50
On each frisbee: , : Conor dials his cell phone as he heads back to his room

" " '    - We  up to find Anna and Ben
Anna looks at her phone, presses  and stashes it in her purse
Sorry
What was  saying
think you were telling me how you don't want to be like your mom and wake up and realize you didn't pursue your dreams
7/20/7                                                   10
Ben opens his  and offers Anna a piece
She takes one and laughs, a bit embarrassed
Was
Little intense for grocery store chatter
Sorry
It's
might even be able to help you out
There's a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients
That would be - amazing
What are you - like my savior
Anna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper
She writes down her number, and holds it out to him
He looks at it, contemplating
He doesn't take it
Look
'm married
don't do this
Don't do what
Help struggling singers
Help hot Pilates instructing singers who happen to be very charming
Anna takes the slip of paper and puts it away
Do you want to give me your card
That's legit
bet you're allowed to do that
Ben considers this
Right
guess that would be
: We see Anna and Ben talking
They shake hands awkwardly and Ben
- Ben gets in the car, bag in hand, and joins , 40, arty and kind looking, who's behind the wheel
10 7/20/7                                                      11
So, who was that
prospective client
Yeah right
can talk to a woman Neil
It doesn't have to be like that
Neil looks at him, smirk growing
(') Just drive
Neil starts the car and they pull away
- Neil walks into a vast space
Nice art, a cozy yet architectural look - a cool place to live
Hey, babe
You here
We  over to a couch - where  is wrapped in a throw blanket, watching
She's got her hair in a messy bun
Hey honey
He joins her on the couch
And sees that the  is off
Everything
Yeah
Just got off the phone
Neil gets up again
You want some tea or something
It was my baby sister
She's getting married
11 7/20/7                                                12
That's great
've always liked that Devon guy
That's really great
Beth looks at him
She doesn't look that happy
Do you think it's great
Yeah
So, you think it's great that they're getting married, but you never feel like we're going against nature or something by not getting married
No, babe
He sits back down, puts his arms around her
(') Going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey
We're just two people who aren't married
Beth manages a weak smile
Right
actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married
Look at my parents - all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking
Yeah,  know
get that
Like 've always told you -  love you - and we don't need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship
Yeah
Lemme get you some tea

He exits
Beth starts to , but quickly dries her tears, and forces herself to pull it together
- brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood - clearly under massive renovation
- We make our way through rooms with plastic covering the doorways - until we find  stepping into the hallway
She checks herself in a vintage mirror, straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find , on her cell phone
Gigi slams it closed
, so clearly he hasn't called
Gigi shakes her head
(') Maybe he's away on business
He sells real estate
In Baltimore
Staying in town is his business
Right
Janine ponders this
(') Look, let me tell you - after the first time  went out with Ben, he didn't call me for eleven days
And now he's like the world's best husband
That happens all the time
Really
Yes, really
Gigi manages a small smile
This is all your fault
What
Why
13 7/20/7                                                   14
You set me up with him
No - you asked if  knew any guys and gave Conor your number
That's not a set up
When  do a set up -  weigh pros and cons
do my due diligence
All know about Conor is he sold us this house
Gigi peers out the window
He sold you a house in the ghetto
It's a neighborhood "in transition
" Gigi makes a move for the phone, Janine stops her
(') Seriously, stop
He said he always hangs at Red Maple after work
Maybe  should do a little drive-by
Please, don't
He'll call
Off Gigi - panic seeping in
:
' , pretty if a little thick in the middle, sits in the courtyard of an office park in her work clothes
Caller  was the worst thing that's ever happened to me
Total invasion of my personal freedom
When a guy doesn't call me, it is my right - my duty even - to call him and hang up several thousand times
Or at least until his mother shouts at me in Albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone
mean, calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers - and who is & f'ing  to take that away from me
() 14 7/20/7                                                15
(') Next thing you know, someone is going to ban me from sitting in my car in front of a guy's house, blaring "Where Is Your Heart" by Kelly Clarkson until his new stupid girlfriend comes outside and threatens to scratch my eyes out with her acrylics
mean, a girl deserves freedom of expression, right
- Pilates class
We pan down the row of mats, obediently doing The Mermaid
We finally land on Gigi's mat: Gigi manages to twist herself into a passable Mermaid - as her   lies in full view on her mat
'  -  - Shower is on, curtain pulled
An out of the shower and grabs it from the sink
Mom,  gotta call you back
'  -  - Gigi lays in bed, her   right next to her head
One eye  , checks the phone, and closes again
- typical, corporate style office
Walled off cubicles for the junior execs, outer offices for management
Gigi is in her cubicle
Janine, her friend and, we now learn, co-worker, sits on Gigi's desk
So, this was at the end of the date, or at the beginning
End
Why - does it matter
Yeah
"Nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date is normal
"Nice meeting you" at the end could be a blow off
Maybe it was at the beginning
Then that's fine
He's gonna call
15 7/20/7                                                   16
Or maybe it was at the end
Or maybe it was nice to meet me
Wait - was it "nice meeting you" or "nice to meet you"
Shit
can't remember
"Nice to meet you" is
"Nice meeting you" is like "Do you want your receipt in the bag
" The girls look up to find  standing there, listening
Remember the days when you guys at least pretended to be working when  came in
Beth heads to her office
Janine and Gigi follow
(') Janine, how's the press release
Janine, clearly organized, flips open her notebook: Beckon the baking to begin
McCormick, the flavor expert, introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely delight dessert divas
Gigi stifles a laugh
Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration - but otherwise good
(to Gigi) Where are we with the company newsletter
am so almost done with that
It's just been a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in market research, when the guy - who may or may not be the guy of my dreams - refuses to call me
Beth looks at Gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss
16 7/20/7                                                 17
Look, after my first date with Neil, called him
There are no rules anymore
Why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass
- Gigi sits at her desk, Janine standing by her side
She's got a few sheets of paper on her desk
Gigi takes a deep breath, picks up the office phone and dials
Janine gives her a thumbs up
It's ringing
Pretty standard
(listening to receiver) Yes
Voicemail
Your notes
Gigi nods - it's all under control
(reading off her paper) Hey, Conor
It's Gigi
just thought, hadn't heard from you and,  mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy's call anyway, right
Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused
She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - "What does this say
"
Janine looks - she's no help
(') (clearly ad-libbing) mean, we're all equal, right
More than equal -- more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people - (rifles through the pages) -  mean  don't know if you saw that Dateline - but women practically have penises now, right
(looks to Janine, helpless) Well, call me
This is Gigi
Call me
17 7/20/7                                                   18
Gigi hangs up, unsure
She looks to Janine
Don't worry
He's totally gonna call
'  - Gigi stares at the
Then she feigns disinterest in the phone
It still doesn't ring
Finally, she picks up the receiver to listen for a dial tone
And
How can there be no dial tone
She frantically jiggles the cord, then hears something
(') Mom
Is that you
can't talk now
'll call you back
She hangs up, stares at the phone again
look of crosses her face
She dials
(') Janine
It's me
Conor never called, so 'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at Red Maple
Pick up if you want to stop me

Gigi hurriedly hangs up, and heads out the door

We follow a ,    as we wind through the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to: -  - busy kitchen
Off the kitchen a door leads to: -  - sits at a small, cluttered desk, rifling through some papers
Then, from the doorway: Knock knock

Alex looks up to see   - Red Maple's hot hostess, standing in the doorway
She makes her way in
Hey
So
Here we are
Same shift again
know
make the schedule
() figured it was no coincidence
She leans against the desk
Alex keeps working
(') had fun the other night
Yeah
It's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you
Kelli Ann laughs, then thinks - wait, was that nice
Anyway -  was thinking, maybe tonight after work
we could, you know
Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her
Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun
But we're way understaffed tonight -  even have to man the bar - and that's why  scheduled you
To work
So
He goes back to work
Kelli Ann stands there, frozen
Alex can feel her eyes on him
(') Are we good here
Kelli Ann's face goes flush
She tries to hide it
She backs up, puts on a smile
No
We're good
She leaves
Alex exhales, goes back to work
19 7/20/7                                                   20
- In the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands chatting with , 18, a busboy, who smokes a cigarette he holds just outside the doorway
Kelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and ( )
He has to take a step to catch his balance
He turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps walking eyes front
He and Tyrone share a look
Dude
know
Tyrone laughs as Alex shakes his head, not happy
- Gigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for Conor
She tries to move toward the bar as she's met by Kelli Ann, who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile
Are you joining us for dinner or - 'm meeting someone
guy
Ugh
Why
Hmmmm
Nothing
Sorry
For dinner
Gigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention
'm meeting someone
believe you mentioned that
Gigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor
20 7/20/7                                                    21
'm gonna wait at the bar
That's a great idea
Gigi walks off
Kelli Ann takes her place behind the hostess stand
Gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door
Alex, now behind the bar, approaches
What can  get you
Oh, that's
'm meeting someone
Alex takes her in
She's clearly nervous
Oh, yeah
Got a hot date
don't know if you'd call it hot -- mean this guy Conor and  have only been out the one time so -- Wait - Conor Barry
Gigi is busted
Oh, uhh, yeah -- Conor's not coming in tonight
Did he forget he was supposed to meet you
See when  said "meeting someone"  guess that was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word "meeting"- Because  could just call him -- Alex reaches for the phone
21 7/20/7                                                  22
mean, totally unnecessary mean,  actually was just - in the area - so  figured 'd just swing by and see if he was around - because - uhhh --- Alex waits, looking at Gigi, amused
She is panicking
(') uhh, had to return his -- Gigi frantically searches her coat pockets - searching for something, anything - and finally fishes out
She looks at it - and decides to go with it
(') Pen
had to return this - pen
He left this
So,  thought  should really return it before he - you know - (conspiratorially to Alex) -- freaks out
Alex looks at her skeptically
And then takes the , and inspects it
Dr
Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry
Look, 'm not gonna judge about what may or may not be important to someone
That's not even his dentist
Oh, really
Then who's his dentist
My dad
Gigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds
'm Gigi
Conor and  went out last week
And  just
thought if  ran into him
don't know
'm gonna go
Gigi struggles to get out quickly
Alex looks at her - holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens
22 7/20/7                                                 23
Hey
Just - hang out for a second
Lemme buy you a drink
Gigi  and sits back down
- It's late
The bar is nearly empty
Alex is totaling receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink
Look, you seem like a cool girl, so 'm just gonna be honest - Conor is never going to call you
Oh really
How do you know
Because 'm a guy
It's how we do it
() He said it was nice meeting me
don't care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham
Over a week went by - and he didn't call
But maybe he called me and  didn't get the message
Or maybe he lost my number, or was out of town, or was hit by a cab, or his grandma died
Or maybe he just didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again
Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a year later she ran into him -- Your friend Terri's an idiot
And she's the exception
23 7/20/7                                                 24
But what if 'm the exception
You're not
You're the rule
And the rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't want to call you
Really
Always
Yeah
Always
know what blowing off a woman looks like
do it early and  do it often
Trust me - if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit - - he doesn't
No exceptions
Gigi thinks this over
Why are you telling me all of this
Aren't these man-secrets - like why men need to watch televised golf
Alex
don't know
You looked like you could really use the help
Thank you
You've given me a lot to think about
Gigi smiles at him
- Gigi comes in - carrying a    , with crazy hair and wearing the last outfit we saw her in
Everything
was up all night
Please say you were working on the newsletter
24 7/20/7                                                 25
Sure
It's basically done
But this is important
What's happening with your hair
Beth comes out of her office and looks at Gigi
Please come in my office before the others see that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair
- '  - Gigi paces in front of Beth's desk
think  figured it out
Remember when went out with that notary public
And he cheated on me
And then Anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning - but then he totally changed and they're married and crazy in love
thought that guy was a process server
No, notary
Anyway, the point is - Anastasia is the exception
Not the rule
We have to stop listening to these stories - because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front don't really care about you very much
Okay
Gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper
Exhibit : Chad, the drummer who lived in his storage space
He only used me for rides, yet  continued to stalk him for most of 1998
Then there was Don, who broke up with me every Friday so he could have his weekends free
was so delusional about our relationship that referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist
() 25 7/20/7                                                  26
(') And all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after
But that's the exception
And we're not the exception - we're the rule
Gigi sits down, spent
But Beth has been listening
So let me see if  understand
What you're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her -- that's the exception
And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls - like me - for seven years without getting married - are never getting married
Beth is serious
Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack
No
No, no, no
That's not what 'm saying
This has absolutely nothing to do with you
was just talking, you know, about me
Specifically
Off Beth, knowing it's about her, too
- Anna and , beautiful but doesn't know it, sit in side by side pedicure chairs
Anna holds a
It is impossible not to like this guy
'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside Eddie's, and then he tells me he's married
You'd think 'd be pissed, but  literally could not stop myself from liking him
But he's married
realize that
keep trying to force myself to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman, and even that doesn't cool it off
What is my problem
26 7/20/7                                                  27
There was this guy who worked in my dad's printing business
Married for fifteen years to a nice lady
And then he meets this woman at some church event
And he told my dad he just had never felt anything like it before
mean, he had finally met the love of his life
So, he divorced his wife, and he's been with this other woman for 22 years and they are blissfully happy
mean, what if you meet the love of your life - but you already married someone else
Are you supposed to pass them by
You're right
'm calling him
Anna pulls her feet out of the pedicure bath, goes in a private corner, and dials her cell phone
(') Hey, Ben
This is Anna Marks
(
) Hey, Anna
What's up
Well,  was just taking you up on your offer
You said you might know someone who could help me out and  thought we could discuss it -- over coffee
Anna waits for a response
On the other end she hears some rustling, some silence, definitely awkwardness
(
) Look,  just
can't Anna
You seem great
It's just -  don't know should go
Take care
Anna takes this in -
She hangs up
Her eyes sting
She can't face Mary so she just stares at weird, bleached out photos of nails and
Finally, she looks at her cell phone and dials again
- Conor opens the door to find Anna standing there
am so psyched that you called
27 7/20/7                                                 28
Cool
had sort of given up on you when you didn't call me back the other night
Well, you know
was just thinking about you
Conor buys it, and ushers her inside
- Anna is stretched out with a wine glass in hand, feet in Conor's lap
He rubs her feet as they talk
Your turn
Give me the categories again
There are four
Sexy, smart, funny or cute
And each person can only be two
Like Sarah Jessica Parker is funny and sexy
Or Bill Clinton is sexy and smart
love that you are hot for Clinton
So, which am
What was  again
Smart and cute
Conor smiles, happy for any compliment
You're sexy
Very sexy
And cute
She bangs him on the head with a pillow
No
Cute and sexy are in the looks column
No one wants to be in all one column
28 7/20/7                                                29
Well,  sound like a jackass if  say you're all four
But you're so obviously all four
Especially sexy
You're the best
Anna sits up, and moves to Conor
She looks at him, pulls him in for a nice, long
(') better go
Oh
mean, you could just stay here tonight
Anna gives him a knowing look
(') What
It's been a while
know
It's just - 'm fried
Is that alright
Sure
Of course
Anna smiles and gets up
Conor reluctantly follows her to the door
She     , smiles, and leaves

Why are you hanging that

You don't like it there
love it there
But just - stop

It's the image, isn't it
didn't see it before, but - you're right - it totally looks like a sagging boob
Beth is silent
(') You want me to take it down
No
want you stop doing anything nice
Is this a trick
No
need you to stop being nice to me - unless you're gonna marry me after
Neil laughs
(') Is that funny
No
It was just -  was just-- See, you can't keep being nice to me and can't keep pretending like this is something that it's not
We've been together over seven years
You know me
You either want to marry me or you don't
Or there is the possibility that  just don't really believe in the concept of - Bullshit for every woman who's been told by some guy that he doesn't believe in marriage just to see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four year old girl he met at the gym
Bullshit
Beth tries to hold back her tears
Neil looks stunned
He hops down off the couch and goes to her
Honey, where is all this coming from
30 7/20/7                                                     31

So  never ask
But now 'm going to --- Neil looks at her
She looks at him

Beth looks at Neil
There is a long, painful

She walks out of the room

was with Damon for six years
He asked me to marry him on the phone, because he's just so different and cool like that
Said he'd eventually get me a ring, which he didn't, but he did buy himself a ring because isn't that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the ring
Then, my favorite part is,  stayed with him even after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a "relation vacation
" Isn't that a cute name
Let me explain the concept: it involves dating a girl from the time she's thirty two to the time she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and then, after all that, wanting to take a year off
And giving it a fun name that you can put on t-shirts

Hey, Anna
This is Ben
Look,  know it's been a little while since you called
just - it took me by surprise
But  offered to help you with your career, and  don't see why  can't do that, right
So, give me a call
Maybe you can come by the office this week or something
Okay, take care
Bye
Ben hangs up
And    until :
Gigi's co-worker
And Ben's
Hey, how -- Ben is
Shit - you scared me
Janine looks at him
Is everything
Yeah
Everything's fine
Why
She sits down next to him, looks at him intently
Are you smoking again
No, sweetie
Why
Well - you get jumpy when you smoke
Ben puts his arm around Janine, and pulls her close
'm not smoking
So, why don't we worry about what color we're gonna paint this room, instead of worrying about things that aren't happening
Janine contentedly curls up to Ben
don't know -  was thinking maybe - pink
32 7/20/7                                                  33
Pink
Seriously
Well,  mean, at some point
Janine gives Ben a knowing look
He gets it
You sure we're ready for this now
No
But  mean, we could paint one room pink and one blue just in case
Ben looks at her and
You've already created the perfect family in this house, and we don't even have drywall
'm sorry
know  promised we'd wait to talk about it - Ben looks at her, snuggled against him
think we're almost ready to start talking about it
Janine smiles

You go back to the office after happy hour
What's happy about that

Janine and Gigi melt
(') So, 'd love to call you sometime
Do you have a card
Of course
Gigi hands him her card with lightning speed
And here's my info
Jarrad hands Gigi   as well
(') Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi
He starts to head over to his
Gigi is confused
So, wait -- how are we doing this
Are you hearing from me or am  getting a call
Jarrad turns back
What
You said you'd love to call me, but then you said "look forward to hearing from you
" See how that's kinda confusing
Look - we'll talk
We'll get in touch
He tries to take off again
Ooopsie - you did it again
Very vague
You know what
Why don't we just say that you'll call me, and then we can skip all the nonsense
Jarrad just gives her a blank stare
34 7/20/7                                                   35

He takes off
The girls watch him
He was cute
Please don't cyber-stalk him
Gigi looks at the name on the card -   - and then -
(') Wait - what are you doing
'm not calling him
If he wants to see me - he'll call
Wow, that guy Alex really made an impression on you
Was he hot
No
He was just -- right

Hey
So, did you see it
'm not sure about this
You gotta trust me
It's a burgeoning market
You're gonna make a fortune
Conor looks at the paper
Yeah
hope so
But, like - did you have to put me on the page with the massage ads
It was either that or on the page with the personals

Why would she want to hang out with us and our husbands
Seriously, Beth, isn't that exactly what you want to avoid right now
But before Beth can even answer -- 38 7/20/7                                                  39
You know what - if being in the wedding is too painful- You guys, it's cool
'm fine
So lost a little time
Big deal
Beth grabs her purse and starts for the door
So not a big deal
You're still really young
So young
Everything you learned in that relationship is just gonna make the next one so much stronger
Exactly
Beth exits, still wearing a half-sewn bridesmaid's dress
She wasted so much time
knew he was never gonna propose
Shit
The girls nod in agreement
- Ben sits behind his desk, sifting through a pile of papers
We  around to Anna sitting across from him

Ben
(') Seriously
Why
It'll be good for me
Tell me how you decided that you could not be without this other woman
We'd been together since college
She gave me an ultimatum: we get married or we break up
So, we got married
Seriously
You just caved
It's complicated
Really
You're a dick if you date a girl for too long, and don't marry her
But you marry her, and then you're an asshole for marrying her before you're ready
Shit - don't know
He looks at her

Okay, maybe  need to be harsh -- Conor is never going to be interested in you
No,  know
This is about - (she looks at the card) - Jarrad
You have a sec
Okay
So  meet him at happy hour and he was completely charming -- Lemme guess - he said the only thing happy about this hour is you
He may have used some derivative of that
So, he says he's going to call, but then gave me his card and -- He's not interested
You don't even know if he called -- Did he
No
But the thing is,  honestly think he's expecting my call

What is it

Here - put on my favorite

We met at a coffee shop in 1971

had no idea who he was
But he had this big mop of hair and these eyes that just looked past you and through you and into you all at the same time

It was amazing
Maya pulls out a cigarette and lights it

another opportunity missed
Mom, please - It's the truth

Umm -  don't think so - Sweetie go get that picture - you know the one - Anna just looks at her - pleadingly

Wow
That's - unbelievable
So that's what we're dealing with here, for reference
Imagine meeting someone who looks like that in a coffee shop
Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna
That's funny, because,  mean,  guess kinda did
Anna and  met at a restaurant
That serves coffee
So, not a coffee shop, but
still - He looks from Maya to Anna
Maya stands up
That's sweet
But if we're comparing stories - (indicating with her glass) She's no me - and you're no Tim Buckley
With that, Maya heads inside

Anna looks to Conor apologetically
He just smiles
'   - Anna and Conor walk to the front door of her apartment
Thanks again for coming with me
You make it so much easier
Are you kidding
like your mom
She's cool
Yeah, well - cool's not always what you're looking for in a mom

If a girl is into you, she's sleeping with you
And if after a month - two months at the very outside - she's not sleeping with you, she does not like you
guess the trick is, how to spot this girl early - so you don't waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that it's never gonna happen
So, 've got some signs about how to spot this girl - gleaned from my own experience, of course
girl will never sleep with you if: she calls you cuddly or dependable, she pops a zit in front of you, her name is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1-3

By being more gay friendly

may have to use that
Conor heads back toward his room

This may be too much
don't know
You dress like that - and you're already seeing a girl who won't sleep with you -  think maybe you can pull it off

hear you
Am  supposed to not be friends with a guy just because he's married, and happens to have this insane smile and this ass that makes me want to dry hump
52 7/20/7                                                  53
think  just fell in love
girl who talks about a dry hump
Classy, right
Classy is lame
Anna sits at the edge of the pool
So, friends, right
Totally
And with that, Anna pulls off her top
And then her sweats
And, totally naked, slides into the pool
You wanna come in
'm sorry
don't trust myself
You can just watch
He does
You may be the best friend 've ever had
Anna , and then dunks her head under the water
-  - Ben comes in the front door, drops his gym bag
Janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine
He leans in to kiss her on the cheek
She does not look happy
Honey - you smell different
Ben pulls back smoothly
Different how
don't know
53 7/20/7                                                   54
Well that's an odd thing to say
She looks at him
He tries to coolly meet her gaze
Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes found
In the side yard
What part of "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for you to wrap your brain around
What
Do not lie to me, Ben
Please
Are you serious
We have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily
You find cigarettes, and you automatically assume they're mine
Well, yes
Honey, 'm not lying
And you are really freaking out
think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on
Just please - relax
Ben walks away
Off Janine, wanting to believe him
-  - Ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock
He stands, unsure, before deciding to  on the side of the boat
emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered
Ah
My first visitor
This boat is sick
How come you never invited me out before
Well, this was supposed to be just for Beth and  - for our retirement
Leave our jobs
Sell the house
Take off
54 7/20/7                                                   55
Neil is clearly having a tough time
Ben doesn't know what to say
They're silent for a second
(') Sorry
Where are my manners
Permission to board granted
'll show you around
Ben smiles, steps on to the boat
- :  cigarette being lit
to reveal Neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out into the bay
Ben stands across from him, looking on
(re: cigarette) Sorry
It's
Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben
So Janine sent you to check on me
Yeah
Pretty much
Any message from Beth
Ben shakes his head no
Neil seems disappointed
think she's been busy getting ready for her sister's funeral though, so
Her sister's what
Wedding
Her sister's wedding
What did say
Neil is now
You said funeral
No,  didn't
Shit, did
55 7/20/7                                                   56
Neil
Even Ben sees the humor
The marriage thing is weird, man never thought Beth would give me an ultimatum
Really
Why not
That's what women do
Right
forgot
That's how Janine got you to bite the bullet
Yup
Neil looks at Ben, curious
Do you regret it
No
So you're happy
You'd say you're happily married
Ben looks at Neil as if he's crazy
love Janine
Neil takes a drag and looks out over the harbor
- We  down one of the long tables to find Beth, a crab with a mallet
The others at the table turn to look at her, annoyed
And that's when we see - there seems to be a party and  underway
Now,  know when my cousin Paige says those vows tomorrow, there are going to be hearts breaking all over the world
Beth's sister, Paige, smiles
(') So, keep in mind, her sister Beth is still on the market
56 7/20/7                                                57
The cousin  at Beth
Beth goes white
(') Sure, she's an older model, but she's still got a lot of miles left in her
But don't stay on the lot too long, Bethie, or next year's models will -- , 60s, nearly tramples guests to grab the mic
- that's enough of the speeches
Time to eat
So enjoy the crab
And the yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas
Mixed reaction from the crowd as Ken puts the mic down
He starts to return to his table - when he sees Beth trying to make a sneaky exit
He catches up to her
(') Bethie, your cousin Jay has always been a jackass
know
And even he's married
So, you'll get married a little bit later than some people
Big deal
You never did anything the way every one else did it, and that's what 've always thought was so great about you
'm your oldest daughter, and 'm the only one not married
If this was Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to sacrifice me or something
Ken laughs and puts his arm around Beth
Honey, look
When everyone else was just going to camp at the , you borrowed my New York Times, found some arts camp in the Berkshires, wrote away for information, then got accepted on your own
You were nine
You never did things the way everyone else did
Why not
57 7/20/7                                                   58
Because that's you
That's why you're my favorite daughter
Beth's eyes go
don't think you're supposed to say that
Well,  don't give a shit
'm retired, and 'll say what  want
'll say it into the mic if you want -- That's
It's true, though
know
They
'    - Gigi sits sipping a drink, alone, when Alex comes in the door and goes directly to her table
Sorry 'm late
That's
like a little time before a blind date - prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars -- He's not coming
Alex motions to the  to bring them another round
(') Can't wait to hear that story about the molars, though
How can he already not like me
58 7/20/7                                                59
screwed up
told Bill it was Thursday, but  meant Tuesday
Gigi is disappointed
The waitress drops off their drinks
They toast - then observe the
Awesome
'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl - (motions to  at the bar) - she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak
The  is standing between
Nope
How do you know
See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise thing
She's interested
He's not
You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not interested
Actually,  can
manage a restaurant
see this stuff go down every night
Watch -- As if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy  his elbow into the , hard, causing her to spill her drink
Tom Cruise Guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge
Alex looks smug
Man, you have a gift
And check out droopy dawg on her other side
He can buy her drinks all night, and she'll insist there's no "spark
" Maybe there isn't
You need a spark
The "spark" thing is bullshit
59 7/20/7                                                60
Really
Enlighten me
Guys invented the "spark" so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a "spark
" And you all buy it
You love it
You all thrive on it because you all love drama
don't
Really
So you don't wait until the last minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of not knowing whether you'll make it
She's busted
Maybe
And let me guess - when you were stalking Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days, even though the date was just kind of mediocre
Yeah
See, you thrive on drama
You gotta be more like me - if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like her - probably with smaller pores and bigger implants
That's beautiful
Thanks
They continue drinking and observing the scene
Why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again
60 7/20/7                                                  61
dunno
like you
You do
Don't start doodling my name on your binder
just mean,  like you, like like basset hounds
They're kinda pathetic - so you want to cheer them up
Again with the sensitivity
Alex smiles at her
Gigi can't help but smile back
- Janine walks down the hallway, with  (40, stocky), her contractor
She's inspecting the crown molding
It looks good
Yes
He does good work
He's very good
Janine stops and looks at Javier
He looks back at her
Javier
Yes
Javier, if  asked you an honest question, do you think you could give me an honest answer
think so
Good
Because  think some of your guys have been - smoking
61 7/20/7                                                 62
Janine looks at Javier
It's awkwardly silent
(') Javier
Is that the question
Yes
Oh
It seemed like a statement
The question part was implied - didn't really hear it in the inflection- Javier - have your guys been smoking or not
No, ma'am
My guys don't smoke on the job site
They're all good guys
Are you sure your guys aren't sneaking around here
And smoking
And lying to me
And -- smoking
She's starting to freak Javier out
'm pretty sure
need you to be honest with me, Javier
Because  can't have someone lying to me
To my face
Under my roof
On my time
(very softly) That's a lot of prepositions
Janine does not hear him, and barrels on - mean, there is no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there mean, we made promises to one another -- 62 7/20/7                                                   63
Javier looks at her - what the hell is she talking about
(') What  mean is, we had a contract
Which is like making promises to each other, right
Maybe  should just get back to work
Yes
Fine
Good idea
Javier starts to leave
(') But, we're good here, right
Me and you
Blank stare from Javier
Janine slaps on a smile
(') Okay, great
The molding really does look great
Javier gives a forced smile, and heads back to work
- ( and ) sip from bottles of Volvic water as they wander through a kitchen, inspecting the cabinetry
Conor comes into to frame, wearing a toned down version of his "gay friendly" clothes
Hello, my name is Conor
Please sign in whenever you get a chance
He gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island - next to which Anna stands
Conor joins her
This is insane
You're like the Liza Minelli of real estate
know
Your friend Mary's a genius
The house is     - opening closets, admiring floors, munching on complimentary cookies
Alright
Gotta run
63 7/20/7                                                   64
You got a class
Uh, no
Just some stuff
See you later
Sure
Conor goes in for a , but Anna's not ready for it - so he just ends up grabbing her
It's awkward
She leaves, Conor tries to play it off, looks around the room
Skip and Larry look at him sympathetically
(') What
She's holding out on you, isn't she
'm not sure  get your meaning
It's obvious
She won't sleep with you
It's written all over your puppy dog face
Conor looks at them, decides not to fight it
It's killing me
Literally
'm dying
Skip and Larry move closer, Larry grabs a plate
Here, have a cookie
just -  have no idea what she's doing
cannot read her signals - at all
We used to sleep together - all the time
Well, that's not true,  don't know why said that, it wasn't all the time
But it did happen -  know 'm not making this up
And then, out of nowhere, it stops
But she still calls, she stops by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a massage, she leaves cute messages - but it never goes
mean, what is she doing
64 7/20/7                                                   65
Honestly - we may not have the best insight
Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals
He's right
Like - here's " want to sleep with you"
He looks at Larry
Larry looks back at him
They don't break their gaze
One, two, three - that's it
Three seconds or more - it's on
Here's " don't want to sleep with you
" Skip look at Larry again
Larry meets his gaze
One, two - (he looks away) No
Thanks for playing
Move along
It's that simple
You're right
That's no help at all
But listen -  can tell you this
Gay or straight, you're not going to get anywhere by being inactive
She clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something
So the next time you're in the position - don't take no for an answer
Skip looks at Larry, concerned
That sounds like felonious advice
You're right
Let me rephrase
Don't take maybe for an answer
Conor takes this in - that's not a bad idea
65 7/20/7                                                  66
'  - Cute studio apartment
And Ben is in the bed
Anna walks in from the bathroom, in a robe
Ben watches her
Wait
Stop
What
Shit
This is bad
What
am so into you
Anna
She joins him in bed
(') 'm lying here watching you and seriously have never felt this way before
have to forcibly make my brain stop thinking about you
mean, all the time
Why stop
She looks at Ben
He's not smiling
Because  don't do stuff like this
Stuff like what
Like having sex with women who are not my wife
First of all, 'm not women
'm just one
He waits
What's second of all
66 7/20/7                                                 67
didn't have a second of all
thought second of all was going to make me feel better
Anna thinks
Second of all -  can't stop thinking about you, either
They look at each other for a
have to tell her
What
have to tell her
Anna's eyes light up, but she tries to cover
don't want to push you to -- want to be with you
And  can't do that if 'm lying to her
You know what's best
As Ben pulls her to him, she lets a smile take hold
:
' , 60's, with a kind but very wise face, talks to the camera in his   attire, standing in front of a posh Upper East Side building
Here's the thing - my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island
But if she wasn't, 'd tell her the same thing 'd like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married guy
() 67 7/20/7                                                   68
(') And here is that advice --- get stocks, cash, annuities, a deed in your name
Don't settle for flowers and a shopping spree at Bendel's
Think to the future
We all know that none of these guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and the classic eight on Park Avenue
So,  wanna tell these young ladies, as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time -- get something that can last
Because guarantee you - he won't
And that's the best fatherly advice  can give
- Mary and Anna, in sweats and Ugg boots and dirty hair, both load their carts with cheap beauty products
'm not picking out china patterns or anything - but 've never felt anything like this before
This is crazy
can't believe he's gonna leave his wife for you
No, he's not leaving his wife for me
He's just - he's a good guy
And he can't really explore what we could be if he's lying to her
Mary looks at her
(') He's kind of leaving his wife for me
Is this crazy
This is totally crazy
We barely know each other
don't know
Remember Becca, my sister's friend
Some guy waits on her at Bennigan's - by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one
You're totally right
It can happen
Not for me
68 7/20/7                                                69
Well, what about texter
Texter has yet to make any verbal contact
mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and 'd never know because  never actually hear his voice
doubt he has a stoma - That's not the point
The point is - can't text
'm not charming via text
My sarcasm doesn't come through,  can't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard -- So don't text
It's not just texting
It's email and voicemail and snail mail - That's just mail - Whatever
None of it's working
've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work, and then  call him back at home, and he emails me to my Blackberry, and then  text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone -- and it just totally gets out of hand
miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't
That's it
Now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies
It's exhausting
Anna, who is trying a different shade of nail polish on each finger, calmly looks up at Mary
So what about the singer guy
69 7/20/7                                                   70

Yeah,  like him
That's great
Totally
felt like we connected
'  - Gigi sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, eating graham crackers and watching     on The phone
Hello
:
-  - Even in the office we can hear the din of the bar scene
Oh, hey
You're home
Where am  supposed to be
Out
It's Saturday night
You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me
It's kind of limiting
was just calling to let you know - 'm having a party at my place next weekend
You should come
Gigi considers this
don't know
Won't Conor be there
Might be kinda awkward
He's in  for the weekend at some real estate conference
But there's gonna be a bunch of single guys
70 7/20/7                                                 71
So  will have plenty of chances to be awkward
Thank god
Don't worry
'll be there
'll talk you through it
Gigi smiles
So, the party - is it like a big party, more of a mellow hang or -- outside Alex's office
Yeah,
Gotta go -  think someone just dropped 84 wine glasses
Gigi hangs up, and goes back to watching her movie
: The  screen as Mary Stuart Masterson (as ) and Eric Stoltz (as ) hang out in a garage
Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who'll be swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips
think  can handle it
It's cool
was just gonna work on it with you but - if you're comfortable
great
Wait
How do you work on it
Pretend 'm a girl,
mean, pretend 'm her
Amanda
Gigi sits up
light bulb has gone off
As she watches Keith and Watts kiss on screen, a smile crosses her face
- Gigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine: 71 7/20/7                                               72
He's into me
Awesome
knew it
(she hugs Gigi) Who's this now
Alex
It's totally clear to me now
He's Watts
What
From Some Kind of Wonderful
Wait, isn't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts
Yes
So, why aren't you Watts
'm Eric Stoltz
What
Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones, but really she's in love with Eric Stoltz herself
Wait - so who's Amanda Jones
guess Conor at first
Now men in general
But that's not the point
The point is -- he's into me
You know,  knew there had to be a reason he was spending all that time with you
72 7/20/7                                                 73
know
It's so obvious now -- there are so many signs
Oooh, gimme the signs
love to hear about the signs
Janine rolls her chair closer to Gigi's desk
At first they were small - like when first called he said "Good to hear from you" - Totally good sign
Right
And then the next time  called he was with a woman - but he still took the call
And talked to me for a while
You know it was a woman
He called her "babe
" guy does not leave a woman - to talk to another woman - unless there's something going on
know
And it gets more obvious mean, please - there was no guy he was going to fix me up with
The fix up was him
Wait - really
He shows up - without this fictitious Bill character - and the two of us basically have a date
And then he calls me to invite me to a party at his place
You're right
He so likes you
Janine rolls her chair up to Gigi's computer screen

Would you guys wanna do Napa Valley - 've always wanted to go there
Gigi laughs but doesn't fight as Janine starts searching

They are all looking at her computer screen

mean we video iChatted
While holding coffee
Kinda like having coffee
Nathan hands her the phone
Just call your voice mail
And he told me he had a gig last night, so he probably got in real late
Did tell you he was singer
Just call
Mary cradles the receiver with her shoulder and dials
On speaker
Mary hits the  button

We pull back to reveal Ben and Janine, in the wide aisle of Home Depot, as Janine really studies the two pieces of wood
Finally, she  to one of them
That one
No
That's the laminate
That one isn't real hardwood floor
No
But it looks exactly the same - at like one one hundredth of the cost
Janine considers this
75 7/20/7                                                   76
still wanna go with the real wood
But you can't even tell the difference
That's not the point
Then what's the point
just don't like the way it's pretending to be wood
If you're not wood, then don't try to look like wood
don't think it's pretending -- Ben is making light
But Janine is all business
It's a lie
Just be up front - tell people what you really are
Ben takes this in
His cheeks start to burn
You're right
'm sorry
You're totally right
It's
Maybe we should look at the grills and come back
As she starts to steer their giant cart away, Ben just stands there, fused to the ground
Finally: slept with someone
Janine stops, doesn't say anything
(') -- heard you
She doesn't turn to face him
Total silence
76 7/20/7                                               77
(') You tell me this in Home Depot because you know how  hate a public scene
That is not why  - knew it
You asshole
'm sorry
'm so sorry
And it's you that's been smoking, too, isn't it
What
Why does that matter
Janine turns to Ben
She is
-  -  -
No
No
haven't
Janine just   ,
(') Look,  talked to Neil, and he said could stay on his boat for a while if -- Now Janine's eyes go wide with disbelief
And now you want to move out
You're like - what - leaving me
Ben looks confused, but is trying to roll with it
No
just assumed that you wouldn't want me to -- We're not going to deal with this
We're not going to figure out a way to work through this
77 7/20/7                                                  78
just assumed that once  told you, you would want me -- out
Is that what you want
(almost a whisper) No
She heads down the aisle with the cart
Ben follows, confused - that didn't go how he thought it would
- The lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the- century mansion
The procession of a wedding has just begun
start things off
Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with her husband,
Beth's sister Catherine and her husband  are next
Big smiles all around
Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort - , a 12 year old  , wearing a coral bow tie
Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy - who stops to piss on a chair leg
Beth is not happy
- lavish reception
Beth takes her seat next to , 40s
Dan looks over at Beth's place card
You must be Beth
Yep
've heard a lot about you from Paige

Oh, yeah
So you are - (looks at his placecard) Dan

Really
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse
But didn't know if that would fit on a card
Beth slaps on a fake smile, and grabs for the wine
'  - is in full swing
Typical affair for someone in their late 20's - mediocre food but decent alcohol
Gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix
She tries smiling at a  , who ignores her
So Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of Chex Mix into her mouth
It makes your breath stink
Pardon
Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday night gay mode - standing next to her
Chex Mix
learned the hard way made out with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff
He said my breath smelled like trout
Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back
Thanks for the tip
'm sorry
That was rude
And that guy made out with was a total asshole

You want me to smell you
'm sure you don't smell like trout
Gigi
Thanks
'm good
She cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath
'm Nathan
This is Bruce
Gigi
How do you guys know Alex
We don't
Our friend Mary heard about it from some guy named Conor
Gigi smiles in recognition
How do you know Alex
hope -  mean 'm pretty sure - something is about to happen between us
So, you're here as like a guest, or like his date
hate that - when you don't know if you're a date - so you don't know if you should bring a friend, or if you're like co-hosting or if you should stay til the end to have alone time -- Suddenly, a look of  sweeps across Gigi's face
He didn't really say
She reflexively      and starts gorging on it again
Nathan stops her
(') But 'm sure 'm more than just a guest
mean - there have been signs

Cool
did get a slight waft of trout, though
Take a mint
He reaches in his pocket
Gigi looks at him gratefully
Thank you
- Dinner is over
The dance floor is crowded
The bride, Paige, is out there
Beth's dad is dancing with her mom
Beth's dad gives Beth a wink as she heads onto to the dance floor with , 50s and fat
So, where's Neil
We actually broke up
No way
You guys were together for like ten years
Seven
But yes, a long time
They continue to dance
Too bad cousins can't marry, huh
Cuz then we could maybe -- Eeew Dominic, gross
Beth swats Dominic on the arm, and he laughs
And then they are distracted by a
Everyone has stopped dancing
They are looking to the floor, near the band

'  - The place is packed
Gigi is smashed into a hallway, trying to look relaxed
Alex comes up behind her
had no idea it would be such a madhouse
Gigi turns to him and smiles
Hey
Great party
Are any guys hitting on you
Do you need me to evaluate their level of interest
They were gay
Even  know that their level of interest was probably low
Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it still think you guys would hit it off
Gigi smiles knowingly - on to Alex's scam
Oh
Right
(air quotes) "Bill"
Alex doesn't know how to take that
Anyway - 'm on my way to put out some more liquor
But it looks like the food could use some refreshing -- He looks at the
Everything is empty
(') Would you mind helping
mean, just refill the chips and stuff
You mean, kind of like --- co-hosting

Alex looks

Uhh,
The chips are on top of the fridge
He walks away
Gigi smiles
'  - The party is now even more crowded
Gigi weaves her way through the crowd
She's deftly holding  , passing them off to various people as she walks
She stops at the food table, rearranges a few bowls
She  '  across the room, he's talking to friends
She smiles and gives a
He gives an awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation
'  -  - Gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some
She chats with a couple of -, very much at home
- #1 Really great party
Thanks
When Alex said he wanted to have a party,  was like "Let's do it
" - #2 Thanks so much for having us
No problem
Anytime
An attractive   enters the kitchen, and starts Gigi watches with interest
(') Can  help you find something
The Tall Girl finds a  in the cabinet, and grabs it
No, that's
got it
She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl
Gigi is

What
Alex asked me to get the dip together
Thanks for getting it started
Gigi's face grows red
The Tall Girl tastes the dip
(') Hmmm - could use a little more dill
Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and heads back out to the party
Gigi looks to the confused party-goers, not pleased
'  - Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave
People are getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning
Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline
When someone's underwear ends up in your toaster oven - it's been a good party
Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs
guess people had fun
Then, the   emerges
Alex, you want me to start cleaning up
Gigi
That's sweet of you
But  thought 'd stick around, so 'll take care of it
No
got it
The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a trash bag
Gigi grabs one, too
Alex looks mystified
Knock yourselves out

Everyone's gone - except the and , who sit on the couch playing a   on the
Gigi enters from the kitchen
think 've rounded up the last of the beer bottles
The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game
Gigi stands there awkwardly
(') So, umm - what game is this
They ignore her
She looks around
It's awkward
(') Well, maybe  should just -- you know -- mean it's past three and -- Suck it
Alex tosses down his controller
You are sensational
The tall girl beams
Gigi flinches
Did you say it's past three
Man, gotta go
Gigi suppresses a
The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug, and heads out
Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next to him on the couch
They're silent for a moment
Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but  really gotta get to bed
Is that an invitation
What
'm sorry
That was cheesy
'm not good at this
85 7/20/7                                                 86
But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is at him
She puts his face in her hands, and starts to
Finally, Gigi pulls away
She looks breathless
(') Yes
Alex looks a little afraid
(') knew it
knew it
The best relationships grow out of friendships
She goes in to kiss him again
This time he stops her
Wait - what
Ummmm
Now you and  are in a relationship
Well, 'd say if we're not at relationship station--ship, we're at least on the track
Alex gets up off the couch
And why would you think that, exactly
Because there were - you know - signs
Really
Like what
Ummm - it was good to hear from me
You talked to me even when you were with a girl
felt something
She trails off
Alex is not pleased
What are you talking about
What have been saying since  met you
If a guy wants to date you
86 7/20/7                                                87
() No
Why would you do this
thought you were Watts
Alex doesn't even hear her
Why do women do this
Why do they build this stuff up in their minds, take each little thing a guy does and twist it into something else -- Gigi stands there, embarrassed, taking Alex's berating
'd rather be like that - than like you
Excuse me
Maybe  dissect each little thing, and put myself out there too much, and maybe even thrive on the drama of it all-- but at least that means  still care
You think you've won because women are expendable to you
Sure, you don't get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way, but you don't fall in love that way, either
You haven't won, Alex
You're alone
Gigi grabs her bag
(') may do a lot of stupid shit - but know 'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are
Gigi turns and heads out the door
'  -  - Gigi looks at the phone, and then finally
87 7/20/7                                                 88
Hey Janine, 'm sorry it's so late, but just - don't start picking out your bridesmaid dress,
know this isn't the first time this has happened, it's just - this one wasn't about whether he liked me
just really liked him
Gigi hangs up, lays on the bed, snaps off the light
- Ken Murphy, Beth's dad, lies in bed, in a Notre Dame sweatshirt, with papers, and books surrounding him
Beth clears his breakfast dishes off of the bed
You want anything else
Yeah
Less of that cardboardy brown stuff
More regular people food
The cardboardy brown stuff is called whole grain bread
Maybe you could just fry me up a couple sausage links
People who have just had heart attacks generally are not advised to eat animal fat, stuffed in synthetic casings
Ken looks at her, with a wry smile
Did  tell you that you're not only my favorite daughter, but you're also the prettiest
So much better looking than those other dogs
Seriously
It's not gonna work this time
But appreciate the effort
Beth takes his dirty dishes and heads for the door

-  - Beth hauls the dishes downstairs and through the den where Steven, Laura's husband, is on the couch, intently watching the golf channel
Hey, Beth
Grab me a beer if you're going that way
Beth rolls her eyes
(') And a little plate of cold cuts if there are any left
Beth just keeps on walking
-   - Beth walks by Paige, on the couch, and , Paige's new husband, on the floor, surrounded by a mess of He has an old   tune
You might wanna kill the volume just a smidge
My mom is finally taking a nap
You think your dad really wants to hang on to all this vinyl
My collection could use a bunch of these
Turn it the fuck down
Both Devon and Paige look at her, stunned
-  - The kitchen is a total
Beth sets the dishes down in a precarious pile of other dishes, and sees her sisters Laura and Catherine at the kitchen table
finally got mom to lay down in the spare room
All we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles, so after  tackle some of these dishes, maybe we can go to the store
Our new brother is trying to co-opt dad's property before he's even dead

(') And Laura, your husband would really like a beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel
Beth looks up
Laura is pointing to Catherine, who has her head in her hands
She's
(') It's
It's all gonna be
What am  gonna do without dad
First of all, he's upstairs watching 'Oprah After The Show'
And second of all - you have us
But he's always been - the one who's there for me
What about your husband
Where the hell is he
Playing ultimate frisbee
His team may make the quarterfinals
Beth rolls her eyes
The  crash in the sink
- Janine sits at Beth's desk, across from Gigi, who stares at her in disbelief
Janine fiddles with a
Do you know who it is
(shaking her head "no") It doesn't matter
So are you going to - leave - him
Gigi, he's my husband
He's not just some guy that didn't call me back
And he did admit it to me
He didn't wait to get caught
That takes courage
90 7/20/7                                                 91
Gigi is clearly
(') 'm sorry
didn't mean that
know Alex was not just some guy
It's
It's my fault, you know
What
'm willing to accept my responsibility in this
forced him into getting married
He wasn't ready
Janine - this is not your fault
It is
've - changed
used to be fun
was fun when we met
You're still fun
Janine looks at Gigi, the tears come
We never have sex anymore
Lots of couples got through lulls
No
We never have sex
Realistically, what did  expect him to do
don't think that's really -- She looks down at the  in her hand
This is too small
gotta tell Javier
What

gotta go
Tell Beth  took a personal day
Janine grabs her purse, heads out as Gigi looks on
:
' (50's, highly manicured, upper class type) sits on a yacht in what looks to be the French Riviera
My first husband was unimpressive found him in bed with his big breasted secretary when  came home early from the Maldives
So unoriginal, it made me feel sorry for him
My second husband was a pinch more creative
Cheated on me with my sister - but made me believe that was insane for being suspicious
At last - some intrigue, some mind games - though my sister's two year old eventually gave them up
But my last husband -- he was a gem
veritable master at covering his tracks
poured over his phone records, intercepted his credit card bills, had him followed on countless occasions - and never found a single shred of evidence
It wasn't until he died that  found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress
But the real master, have to say -- is me
Three husbands -- countless boyfriends, and  haven't been caught yet
-  - Anna  Ben's hand as they stride down the hallway to his office
Anna is trying to suppress a smile
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Ben smoothly  his hand from Anna's
He nods to as they pass
It was all you, babe
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god

Ben smiles at Anna, as they round the corner of the corridor to his office
He goes in, and she follows
'  - Ben deftly shuts and locks the door behind them
This is really good news
cannot believe this
He liked my demo
Did you hear what he said
When he said it was hauntingly beautiful
Did you hear that part
Yep
was sitting right there
Ben smiles, and pulls Anna to him
Thank you
Thank you so much
With that, they start to
It gets heated '
They make their way over to the
How is it that every time  see your body, 'm shocked at how beautiful it is
Anna smiles at the compliment
She starts to work on his shirt when:

Can  get a few minutes
Ben continues to remove his shirt as he talks
(
) It's not Dana
Literally freezes on top of Anna

He goes to the door of the office
Shit
told Dana to get this lock fixed
One sec
Why do you even lock it
Ben re-buttons his shirt, gives the office a once over
'd never get anything done if  didn't
Finally, Ben opens the door, and Janine is standing there, smiling
Can  come in
Of course
She makes a show of
(') What are you doing
Sit down
Ben goes to sit behind his desk, confused
Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at his desk chair
Her skirt is way too long to do this, so she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt
Ben glances over at the closet
(') Janine, what are you doing
don't know
just thought - maybe we could, you know, relight the fire

Honey, did you hear what  just said gotta get this offering statement out
Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up
Look,  am trying here
Do you want to save our marriage or don't you
Janine looks at Ben
Ben is

'm always on 8 through 10
Been working here 18 months doing 8 through 10
Right
Luis you take 4 through 6
The staff looks at each other - perplexed
Dude
Luis quit like 10 months ago
Alex rifles through his papers, not sure what he's looking for
He slams his clipboard on the bar

Do we even need to have this meeting
Seriously
Does this serve any purpose
The group voice their opinions - a resounding ""
(') Good
Great
Get to work
The group disperses, Alex heads around the bar
He sees Kelli Ann walking away and calls after her
(') Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me
Since you asked me 11 minutes ago
No, not a lot of phone traffic
Kelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his cell phone, look at it, then put it down
He grabs a beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again - staring at it, willing it to ring
He puts it down again

What
It's happened to you
What has happened to me
What's her name
Who

You can't hide it man
know strung out and you are strung - out
Please - This is amazing
Can't focus, right
Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your email 100 times a day
Wishing you could write songs
Feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations
Alex stops at the office door
(') It's always the same
And it has happened to you, my friend
Trust me
Alex looks at Kelli Ann, her words settling in
Shit
Kelli Ann smiles, and as she walks away - Welcome to my world asshole
Alex takes this in,  '
'  - Janine, now fully dressed, hovers by the door
Ben is back at his desk, eyes on his computer
You sure  can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli

As soon as she's gone, Ben gets up, shuts the office door - and goes to the closet - when the door -

What was  supposed to do when she - You make me sick to my stomach
You are a disgusting excuse for a man - Anna pulls her clothes back on in a
didn't want to do it, Anna
You know that it's you  want to be with - He puts out a hand to try to touch her
She
Are you kidding me
You will never lay a hand on me again

And 'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're game
Yes
Sure
Why not
She puts on a smile

She writes out a , leaves it on the counter
She looks to the living room, where Maya sleeps on the couch
She watches her for a second, struggling with a blanket, before heading over to her
She crouches next to the couch, helps her adjust the blanket
'm gonna go
left the check on the counter
It should at least get you through this month
Maya opens her eyes and looks up at her, smiling
Thanks sweetie
don't know what would do without you
Maya closes her eyes again
Anna sits there, watching her
Anna's eyes start to fill with tears - quietly, she begins crying
Maya finally notices

Maya struggles to sit up and hug her
Anna sits next to her on the couch, still trying to get it together

Because you can take back the check if - No, it's not that
mean - yes, 'm broke - but it's not that
It's just - (tearing up again) 'm just so lost mom
've been seeing this guy - who is exciting and amazing and thoroughly unavailable
thought he was - the one - but he turned out to be such an asshole
Maya nods, almost smiling
(') And then there's - Conor - Yeah
Who 'm so horrible to
But he takes it
And he's - there
Waiting
But  just don't want to -  don't know - Settle
Like you think  did
Anna looks at her mother, guilty
(') Well, your father and  had a glorious life together
Are you kidding
All you talk about are the things you didn't do, the people you wish you could have been with, the Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had
Maya looks at her daughter
Those are just dreams Anna
Anna tries to process this
(') Now true -  did not like your father at all when we met

But let me tell you this - life with him was a hell of a lot better than life is without him
Maya stands, walks slowly toward the kitchen

Like what
Like wishing you had
Anna considers this

The doorbell , Anna gets up to answer it
Almost as soon as she turns the knob, Conor is standing in the middle of her studio apartment
He is all amped up
Hey, sweetie
She reaches up to give him a hug, he doesn't go for it
See, why did you call me sweetie
Anna looks confused
Because we always call each other that
Why
Anna doesn't have an answer for that

Maybe it's my fault
Maybe  haven't been clear about what want
So let me be clear
love hanging out, but  am so attracted to you, and  just -  want both
want to make love to you
know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth -  just freaked myself out, too - but it's true

The guys are annoyed that she blocks their view
Could you -- Did anyone have time to run to the store
Nah, we're good

Beth, annoyed, goes into the kitchen
She puts down the dishes in shock
The kitchen is
She looks to the sink and sees the back of a man, doing the last of the dishes

As she approaches the house, she stops in her tracks She whips out her cell phone and dials
Javier - does this mean what  think it means
So when you say "done" - you don't mean "we still need plumbing in the upstairs bathrooms done" - you mean "done done"
Wow - you're amazing
'll call when  see it
Bye
She hangs up the phone, steels herself, and walks inside

as Janine walks from room to room - amazed
Where there once were plastic sheets there are now walls with vintage wall paper
All the floors are immaculate, the chandeliers sparkle - it's all perfect
She walks down halls and up staircases, past end tables and mantles -
Nice and tasteful
She ends her tour in the master suite - it's
And though full of furniture, the longer she stands there, the more empty it begins to seem
Her face transitions, from delight to loneliness, within a matter of seconds
She takes out her cell phone, hesitates, then dials

She sits on the edge of the bed, looking around the room, not sure what to do with herself
She notices a pair of pants and jacket thrown over a chair - goes to tidy it up
She picks up the jacket, checks the pockets, they're empty
She grabs the pants, takes them both to the walk-in closet
She hangs up the jacket
And as she folds the pants over - she She looks down to find - Her face pales
She stares at it - immobile
Her face tightens, her eyes well up

- She hurtles down the stairs, throwing armfuls of clothes into the foyer
Then, she surveys the scene and, not satisfied, rushes back up the stairs
- As she flies back into the bedroom, she sees herself in the   hanging in the hallway
Without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and on the ground
She stands over it, breathing heavily, looking at the shattered glass

It's been a while since 've been here

Oh no
No, it's no problem

You're what  want

(') Our life together is what  want
Your love is what  want
Did you see those guys my sisters are married to
You are a better husband to me - without being married - than any of those real husbands will ever be
And that's enough for me
And you'd really be  if we take the marriage thing off the table
If you promise to love me and be committed to me - 106 7/20/7                                                107

My mom would use this as her 'desk'

It was always covered with her little coupons and stuff

Well, the open house is tomorrow

Conor looks at her, struggling, and suddenly sees it in her face
The answer he's been looking for
It all dawns on him in an instant
You don't want it with me

Conor takes this in

Okay
Is it too late to dial it back to before - and just keep sleeping together

You're very welcome

Okay, okay

Well, a wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl, he will make it happen
No matter what
True
Hmmm
Because when  was hurling my body onto yours - you did not seem to want to "make it happen
" Here's the thing about that
You were right
