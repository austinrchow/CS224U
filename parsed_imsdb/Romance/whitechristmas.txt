In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen and artillery rumbles are heard
The battered terrain shows the effects of battle
In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage
Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and the ground
camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is nearby
- We can   and  from the men as a jeep with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation area
is at the wheel, an  beside him, and in the rear are   and
- As it jounces along
General Waverly is weather-beaten and weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long wear
General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean and fresh from the Pentagon
He is staring off at the recreation area
(To Adjutant) What's this all about, Colonel
(Turning) little entertainment for the men, sir
Tonight's Christmas Eve
These men are moving up tonight
They should be lined up for full inspection
The jeep has come to a halt
(Eyeing him) You're absolutely right
(To Adjutant) There's no Christmas in the Army, Colonel
Yes, sir
Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep
(To Carlton) There's always a slip-up or two during a change in command
The men get a little loose
But  know 'm leaving them in good hands
(Stiffly) Thank you
(To Driver) Sergeant, take me to headquarters immediately
We'll have those men turned out on the double
The Sergeant looks at General Waverly
Goodbye, Sergeant
Take the short cut
Yes, sir
The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle
The Adjutant makes a gesture, as if to stop it
The General stops him
- The Adjutant turns to him
That's not the way to headquarters
Joe, you know that, and  know that, but the new General doesn't know it
Or he won't for about an hour and a half
That Sergeant'll be a private tomorrow
Yes
isn't he lucky
He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the recreation area
- ( ) is wearing a makeshift beard and Santa Claus hat and    ( ') is in combat clothes
They are doing a number to entertain the soldiers, During introduction, we : 5A
- just starting to take seats, off to one side where they are not noticed by the performers
5B
-  6 seated in audience
They look off, see General, start to rise
5C
- The General notices them - motions for them to sit down again, indicating he doesn't want attention called to himself
5D
- The number concludes to applause
Bob holds up his hand for silence
He removes his beard
Thanks, fellows
guess by now you know the Old Man's being replaced by a new Commanding General fresh out of the Pentagon
this divisions's been awfully lucky so far, but tonight they're running a special on St
Christophers at the
The Old Man's heading back to the rear - he's never moved in that direction in his life
All  can say is, we owe so much to General Waverly and the way -- ' ( bellow) Automatically, Bob stiffens
Phil does the same
- Every man is at attention and every head has turned to where General Waverly has taken up a position near the front of the platform
Captain Wallace, button your shirt
You're out of uniform
(Bob, grinning, hastily buttons his shirt) This division is now under the command of General Harold
Carlton, and don't want anyone to forget it -- not that he'll let you
He's tough -- just what this sloppy outfit needs
You'll be standing inspection night and day -- you may even learn how to march
And if you don't give him everything you got,  may come back and fight for the enemy
Merry Christmas
The boys respond with "Merry Christmas"
(Embarrassed) Well --  guess that's about it - uh - uh -- Bob, covering his embarrassment: Perhaps  can help you out, sir
He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat
They play , which is sung by the entire outfit
The General stands at attention through the first chorus, visibly moved
During the second chorus he starts up the aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is bandaged to the knee
The Adjutant puts out his arm to help
Waverly refuses
Toward the finish of the song, he turns, faces the men and salutes them
The men return the salute
(This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the enlisted men as a deliberate gesture
)  There is a Red Cross ambulance standing by
: - () - to reveal a hand lighting a candle on a tiny makeshift Christmas tree
We reveal a number of enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including Bob and Phil
One of the men looks at his wristwatch
Now another does
- The hand is approaching midnight
- He is looking at his wristwatch
- The second hand is pointing to the hour
This is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing Phil accompanies him on a harmonica
Toward the end of the song, an enemy barrage  out the music shell  in the vicinity
- Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel burst
This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which he thinks is unnecessary
Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, brightly continues with   from where the song left off
Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him
: - () to the sky as brilliant fireworks explosion lights up the screen
Over scene : 12-
- Headline reads: "-
" As     headline, we  the fireworks display and the headline covers the whole screen
: 12-
-   - () Bells are ringing for celebration of - Day mouth of one bell, blacking out the screen
: - () featuring names and pictures of Bob and Phil to a   of the picture,  for a second, then suddenly the picture comes to life and we are on the stage of the theatre where Bob and Phil are doing the production number ""
-
- Perhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant
They're warm
One woman has a fan, some use programs
They are enjoying the show, however
There are some vacant seats apparent
This theatre is a modern traveling tent show, such as have been playing in Florida in recent years, and beyond the sides we see palm trees, characteristic of Florida
- the conclusion of the number
- The curtain is down, the boys come off, the curtain goes up on the next number, which is dancing
Phil and Bob are met by , the Company Manager
, a luscious Latin type, and some of the remaining chorus girls and other players ad lib, "Couldn't be cuter
"  "Great
" "Very funny
" (To Bob and Phil) New York's on the telephone
Bob and Phil, with Cooke, go to the backstage telephone
(Into phone) Hello
(He listens
To Bob and Cooke) Oscar
-
' This is the business office of Bob and Phil
is their representative and manager, not their employer
He is sixty and looks competent
He refers to a telegram in his hand
Pictures of the boys adorn the desk, and Wallace and Davis sheets of previous shows are on the wall
It must be evident from their billing that the boys are important stars in New York
Listen,  just heard what you're doing -- giving the cast a week off with pay for Christmas
You don't know how touched  am
'm all choked up
Between sobs,  managed to book you on the Ed Harrison show this week to take up the slack
It'll be stealing money
17A
- Phil is holding the receiver up to Bob
Oscar's  can be plainly heard
(Into phone) We'll have to go to New York -- four days and four nights of rehearsals -- that's stealing money
17B
- As he speaks into the telephone It is for me  --  get ten percent
(He listens for a moment) Next time you guys make a charitable gesture, find out if you got with what to make it
See you Wednesday
He hangs up
- , Bob hangs up the phone
Well
while the cast takes it easy we'll be slaving over a hot kinnie
What train do you want
There's a one-thirty this morning but you have to sit up all night
Let's get out tonight
Okay
The boys walk to their dressing room
group of the chorines come flying by, toward the dressing rooms, with squealing
They make quite a picture from the rear, bouncing and all
What are we going to do until one- thirty
We'll eat dinner
(Looking at the retreating bouncing) Eat, eat  All you think of is your stomach
Rita shows up in front of Phil
(Eagerly) You said you had something to rehearse with me after the show
What is it
Phil evidently was trying to hide this from Bob and is self- conscious at being caught
It's a kind of new dance number
(Eagerly) 'm ready
(Taking Phil by the arm) He isn't
Some business has come up
See you in a week
(He pulls Phil away) Come on, Romeo, dinner
(Tempting him) Lamb chops, lamb chops
(Pretending that he is letting himself be pulled while he is still anxious to go in the other direction) 'm looking at them
We're going in the wrong direction
: -   -    - () The boys are now finishing their dinner
Bob is facing the orchestra, Phil would have to turn to see it
The plays, the boys eat
The table is close to the bar
On two stools sit  and
Betty is wearing her glasses and examining some railroad tickets that have just been handed her by the bartender
Phil is not paying attention to his eating, he is entranced with Judy's pretty legs draped over the bar stool
Bob cannot see the girls and is not even interested enough to turn around
- On her part, Judy is not absorbed in the tickets, but is unobtrusively sizing up Phil
(Checking the tickets) We'll have to rush to get the 1:30 train
- Bob notices Phil's absorption
Have you ever considered laying off the female sex for awhile
What other kind is there
(He picks up the card which announces the performers names and reads) 'The Stewart Sisters
'  Sister act
(He smacks his lips
He doesn't realize that these two girls are the Stewart Sisters) Down, Rover, down
Remember, we have an agreement--you chase no new tidbits during the season
You were man enough to give me your hand on it
You were sneaky enough to take it
- Betty looks from the tickets and sees that Judy is covertly eyeing Phil
She leans forward
(Quietly) Ahem
(Judy's eyes are toward Phil
little louder) Ahem
All right dear, relax
He's awful cute
So was the one in Kansas City, and the one in Canton, Ohio, and the one in Waco, Texas
(Mock seriousness) Canton, Ohio wasn't so much
One of these days you're going to meet somebody extra cute and the next performance 'll be doing a single
(Sincerely) Nobody'll ever be cute enough to break up this sister act
-  - Phil is still fingering the card
haven't much luck with sister acts
They're all alike
Shall  tell you what these two are like
Shoot
Four feet two inches tall
Pudgy
Round races
Have big bows in their hair
Always smiling
(He parodies a smile) Lots of teeth
Sister acts have more teeth than anybody else
Two, three hundred teeth at a time
The American Dental Association is investigating it
There is a drum roll from the orchestra
Betty takes off her glasses and puts them in their case, on the bar
The bandleader's voice announces: Ladies and gentleman, the Stewart Sisters
The audience applauds politely while the girls start toward the platform,  Phil reacts in surprise to the new development
23-
- Betty and Judy do their number: ""
As they take their bows -- - Phil pretends to recognize Judy
Say, Dolores
That's Dolores
Who
Remember that girl  told you about who got sick in St
Paul
That's her
The girl in the oxygen tent
told you about her
The road company of "Student Prince
"  The whole company went to church and prayed for her
It was the most touching thing 've ever seen in show business
(
) 'll bring her over
He goes, Bob watching, disgusted
, the owner of the Waterfront Inn, comes up
- Novello evidently knows Bob
Didn't you get your dessert yet, Mr
Wallace
'm not having any, but  think my partner's lining up some pastries now
Sure wish  could afford to book you boys here
Call our agent - we've got half an hour between trains
Phil enters the shot with Judy and Betty
Hello, Mister Novello
Good evening, Mister Davis
- Novello pulls out the table to permit the girls to be seated
(Burlesque formality) Miss Stewart, Mister Wallace
Miss Stewart, Mister Wallace
How do you do
(Rising) How do you do
Phil gets Betty next to Bob, he sits next to Judy
See you later, folks
'Bye
(He leaves) We saw your show at the matinee, and we liked it very much
Thank you, ma'am
The orchestra has gone into
Where are you going to be for Christmas
We're booked in Vermont
Vermont
What's there
Snow
We spent last Christmas in South Carolina, the year before in Hawaii
They didn't seem like Christmases
There ought to be snow
This one's going to be real white
Well, it's the way you've been raised
If you saw a lot of snow when you were a kid you miss it more around Christmas
There's a lot of snow around St
Paul
Is that where you come from - St
Paul
It dawns on him, slowly
He shows no emotion
No
You come from St
Paul
come from Canton, Ohio
(Just for the record he knows) 'd like to ask you something
Were you ever in an oxygen tent
Oxygen tent
Oh no
Were you ever in a road company of "Student Prince
" No
Why
Bob looks at Phil
The rules are clear between them
Bob puts his hand out
Phil takes it
They shake
Very good
Thank you
What  admire are the details, the invention, the little lies all around the big one
It takes talent
Oh, it's nothing
Don't say that
Don't belittle yourself
Credit where credit is due
You did it fine
Private conversation
Little game we play
(To Judy) May  have this dance
'd love to
(Helping her up) 'm not going to keep calling you Miss Stewart
The name is Judy
(To Bob) What a pretty name
(They're off) Nicer than Dolores
'm Betty
'm low man
Bob
(He takes her arm, indicating Phil and Judy) Follow that couple
Why
They move toward the dance floor
Want to make sure they keep dancing
Stop worrying
He won't get any place with her
You sure
'm positive
trained her myself
She's in the ring with the champ, though
You've heard of Alcoholics Anonymous
(She nods; he indicates Phil) Women Anonymous
Their biggest case
Keeps falling off the wagon
Well, you keep an eye on him, and 'll keep an eye on her
Fine
We can make out the probation report together
The orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song
(To be decided upon
)  The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy and Phil, individually
Toward the end of the vocal Phil dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water
This blends into their dance
The staging of the number should reunite the four principals by the end of the number
The audience applauds and they all go back to their booth
- They are a half dozen steps ahead of the boys
They're both very cute, aren't they
(Hiding her real interest) Both
Uh huh
Which one do you like best
like them both
You can't have both
There's a law
Oh, we'll never meet them again, what does it matter
The men are now up to them and help them into the booth
-  - Bob does not sit
Judy, you made even him look good
(Pleased) You're very flattering, but he was doing all the leading
(Fair) You dance very well together
If say it
(Sitting) Lightest girl  ever saw
Floats like a bubble
One big bubble
All right, bubble lover, stand up
What for
just sat down
La train
At one-thirty, and we have to pack
Train
You know, choo choo
Goes on tracks
(Train whistle noise) Wo woo
Oh no
Oh yes
Can't we go tomorrow
The train goes tonight
(Phil looks disconsolately at Judy) Say goodbye to the lady bubble, because we're going to have to run for it now
Lady bubble,  have an idea we're going to meet up again sometime
We might, we're on the same train
No
Yes
(Pulling Phil away) No
As they start off, Novello enters to the girls, agitated
The sheriff is here
He's in my office
The sheriff
He's got a warrant to arrest you
Bob has stopped
He looks at Phil, suspiciously
thought we watched you every minute
Phil holds up his hand in "Scout's honor
" Never stopped dancing
Bob turns back to the table
(To the girls) Can we help
(Fearful) 've never been arrested
There's nothing to it
Don't get panicky
Yes, don't get excited, you still have to give your show
(Apologetically) He's not going to arrest them until after the show
That's considerate
How'd you arrange that
'm a taxpayer here
You better go in and change, girls
You haven't much time
The girls start off, confused
Novello, Bob and Phil follow
May  enquire what you are being arrested for
The owner of the hotel we were at says we dropped a cigarette on his rug and burned it
We couldn't have dropped a cigarette because we don't smoke
He wants two hundred dollars, but it's just plain stealing
We left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed
Then we dropped the bags out the window and checked them at the depot
What are we going to do now
You have to give another show
He leaves them, as Bob and Phil look unpleasantly after him
They have reached the wings
- is setting up a record on a record-playing mechanism backstage, as the group passes by heading for the dressing rooms
The old burned rug routine
Kind of old fashioned, isn't it
thought that went out with the Cherry Sisters
We'll have to do something
(Hopefully) Got a flash
glimmer
Have to stir it around a little
The girls have opened the door to their dressing room
We wouldn't want you boys to get into any trouble
- As they all enter
Why not
Maybe we'll all wind up in the same cell
As they close the door, : '  - Novello is with the  and the
The Sheriff is a husky fellow
At the moment he's eating an eclair and coffee, from Novello's desk
The Landlord glares at him
That's the second dessert you've had, Sheriff
Real good, too
haven't got all night to wait here while you eat free food
You've got your warrant, arrest those girls
(Displeased) Now, we agreed to let them finish their show first
didn't agree
(To Novello) That was his idea
've got some rights, too
You don't get those girls until after they've done their number
Well, how long is it going to take
Novello puts his hand up, listening
Wait a minute
That's their music
He gets up, opens the office door, and we  their entrance music, as before, and the Orchestra Leader's voice, "The Stewart Sisters
" - Bob and Phil stand with their backs to the audience
They turn, face front, and we realize they are mouthing to a record
-  - We identify that the music is coming from this spinning record player we have previously established
34-
- Bob and Phil do the number
- They  at end of number
-
' We faintly  the applause
They're clapping
It's over
Arrest them
The Sheriff gets up
: - The boys bow themselves off, and run toward their dressing room
- They hurry down the corridor, passing the office door
Get out of these clothes
Toot sweet
Ma, unhook my bra
The office door opens behind them, which they do not see
The Sheriff steps out, followed by the Landlord and Novello
(Calm) Just a second, folks
'll handle this
(He walks to the dressing room door) - There is a plaque attached to the key in the lock
The Sheriff smilingly turns the key in the lock
He puts the key in his pocket
(Winking) You stay here
Let them try to go through the window
The landlord is delighted
If they make a break for it, shoot 'em
: -
- () - The Sheriff walks around the corner of the cafe, and a police car awaits, with cop at the wheel
Just a minute, Hank, couple of customers coming up
Okay, boss
The Sheriff continues to the window of our dressing room
- It opens
The Sheriff watches it
Out comes Phil's legs, meaning to get out backwards
The Sheriff applies both hands and pushes back
Back you go, boys
He pushes Phil in
Nimbly, he raises himself in
- The Sheriff is in the room
He looks coolly at the boys, who are now in their own clothes
He stares at them
They stare at him
Recognition comes all at once
Pete
Phil
Bob
Pete
They all throw their arms around each other, pounding violently
'No
Wow
You dirty skunk
You grave robber
' (Unbelieving) Are you the Sheriff here
You bet  am
How'd you get in this line of work
After  got out of the army  sat down and figured it out
Who never got in trouble in the army
The 's
They were the ones who arrested you
So  came back here and ran for Sheriff
civilian
If the fellows ever saw you now
They'd skin you alive
You ever see any of them
Whitey Harris and Jack Ross have a filling station near here
Jack Ross
Will you ever forget the party he threw in Naples
In a captured brewery
Very sensible, giving a party in a brewery
Cuts out the middleman
Do you remember when Danny Beasly climbed up - (As he says 'Danny Beasly' he recalls Danny is dead) - the tower of the City Hall and rang the bell by swinging on the clapper
He couldn't hear anything for two days
Danny Beasly
Too bad he didn't make it
Not everybody was lucky
We were lucky in one thing - the old man
You can say that again
Say 'm supposed to arrest a couple of dames
fellow swore out a warrant
He's a crook
Burned a hole in a rug and is trying to hold up two kids
You don't say
(At his watch) We got to get our bags and be at the station in ten minutes
We'll never make it
Just a moment
(He goes to the window) Hank
-   - Hank looks up enquiringly
Yes, sir
Take my friends where they want to go
Yes, sir
Hurry up
(Going out the window) Thanks, Pete
- Hank has thrown the door open
Do you think we can make it
This thing goes over a hundred an hour
Hold on
He starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming, and tires grinding
- The Sheriff watches them go, pleased
pounding on the door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns
He strides to the door, takes out his key and opens it
- The Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the departing police car, the noise having distracted them from the door pounding
The siren is still heard, retreating
The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet
They turn to him, faces alight
They escaped
We're pursuing 'em
Escaped
(Pointing) What do you mean smoking on theatrical premises
That's not mine
wasn't smoking
What's that burning
lollypop
(He grabs him by the shoulder, not too gently, and starts him out) Come on
He protests, 'What -
' 'But
'  Novello is openmouthed
: - () The train is already moving as the police car arrives
The girls are on the observation platform
The police car screams to a stop
The boys fly out, with bags, and just make the train, the girls pulling them aboard
(Seriously) You didn't steal the police car
No, no
Friend of ours
They go toward the lounge car
-
- They all take seats in the lounge car, happy to have accomplished their escape
Well, we'll be together as far as New York
Maybe it'll snow in New York for Christmas
If it doesn't, we'll mail you a snowball from Vermont
haven't been on ice skates in years
Ice
You mean the stuff in a Scotch and soda
(Suddenly) Bob, how about snow for Christmas
You'll only thaw it out
Come on, Bob, we could have a great week up in Vermont
Bob looks from him to Judy, whose expression is almost pleading
see what you mean
But Wednesday we've got to be back in New York
All right -- so it's just for a couple of days
Don't you want me to enjoy the winter sports
You enjoy them all year round
(He looks to Betty) We won't get in your way, will we
As long as your friend doesn't try to take my sister for a sleigh ride
If he tries it, 'll smash his flexible flyer
(To Phil) It's all set
(Really pleased) The thing  like about you, Bob, is you're not only kind and generous, you're handsome
We're going to have to sit up all night
Let's get some shut eye
: -
- () The rhythm of the wheels and the engine funnel, underscored musically
- All but Phil are half dozing
One or two other people are seen in the background, asleep
There is an air of peace and quiet in the car, as the music underscoring continues
Their faces are occasionally streaked with light flashes emanating from the surrounding countryside
Phil turns to the side of the car and sees a bill poster showing a copy of a winter scene from the Grandma Moses collection, advertising Vermont
scene, the music swells and we to a similar landscape in stylized concept
This is the   production number
At the end of the fantasy we hear the Conductor's voice, "Pine Tree
Pine Tree, Vermont
" -   - () They are bundling themselves up, coat collars tight, expecting to enter the snow country
- Pine Tree Station, all green, no snow
Four hotel busses await, one marked 'Columbia Inn Bus
' -    - ( ) Our foursome is just getting off the train
They are the only ones
They are looking about, puzzled
Are you sure this is the right Vermont
This isn't a southern Vermont
don't understand it
There has to be snow
This place is advertised as America's Snow Playground
Well, if you say so
(Gesturing to the waiting Columbia Inn bus driver) Driver, your sleigh and reindeer
The other three bus drivers are disappointed
: - The bus goes by an incongruous skating rink, with water instead of ice
Signs indicate the direction of the sun scorched toboggan slide
: - The bus winds around another turn in the beautiful green surroundings and we pass a ski lift and a ski jumping platform
: - Still another turn of the bus, and in the distance we see a of the Columbia Inn
- , a sixty year old spinsterish woman, good of heart, forbidding exterior, is occupied at the desk
The door opens and a pretty fifteen year old, , carrying the mail, walks toward her
Mail, Martha
She puts the mail on the desk
(As she shuffles through it) What's the weather forecast down at the Post Office
Awful
Fair and warmer
If we don't get snow soon we can turn this hotel into a haunted house
We haven't had a guest for three weeks
(As Martha keeps searching through the mail) What are you looking for
(Not finding it) Your grandfather's written Washington asking if he can get back in active service
think he wants to fly jets
think he could do it
He says older men have been called, and besides, he misses the food tell you, Susan, he tried to make it a casual letter, with little jokes, but it came out just begging
Through the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see the figure of a man in overalls, bending over an incinerator, shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow
His back is to
(Moved) Oh, Martha
What are we going to do
(Blowing her nose) don't know
Don't let on we know he's written
He'll start in 'm only his housekeeper and that  found out through some chicanery or something
(Soothing her) How did you find out
Like any housekeeper --   read the carbon paper
(She hands the mail to Susan) Bring him the mail
Susan starts out as    to window
After a moment, Susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls
He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General Waverly
He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast, shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work
: 58-59 -
- () The bus comes to a stop and our principals get out, Phil staying with the driver for the luggage
The others enter the inn
- Martha at the desk, and her eyes widen in surprise
(Happily) Welcome to Columbia Inn
How do you do
How do you do
(Offering pen) What kind of accommodations would you like
We can give you a fairly wide choice--any room in the Inn, including mine
We're not here as guests
We're the Stewart sisters
(Disappointed) Oh
My friend and  are guests
We've come down for the snow
Where are you keeping it
We take it in during the day
(Looking around) What are your rates here
Make us an offer
(To the girls) 'm afraid we won't be able to use you
We'll pay you the half salary for canceling
Oh, no
Are things that bad
We're using the ski-tow to hang the wash on
(To Bob) You're not going to stay either, are you
(Shaking his head) 'm afraid not, ma'am
Through the door comes Waverly, carrying a load of wood in one arm, and a bucket of coke in the other hand
Susan follows carrying an armful of kindling
Bob turns away
'll tell Phil to leave the luggage - (It hits him, he comes to a stop, and then to attention) General Waverly
Sir
(Easy, simple) At ease
How are you, Captain
'm fine, sir
(But he looks around questioningly, bewildered) (Smiling) We just try to keep the General part quiet
Why
(Reminding himself) Begging your pardon, sir
Well, to put it in one sentence, people don't expect major generals to carry firewood
Through the door comes Phil, fast, talking: Bob,  was thinking we ought to - Phil has his arm out indicating the direction of the door, when he sees Waverly
He freezes
He brings his hand up to a salute, from that position
At ease
Oh, sir
(Horrified) janitor
Never thought 'd make it, he
Matter of fact, it's worse than that
own this hotel
He got it in a shrewd business move
(To Bob) Was everybody in your outfit
We seem to run into them all over the country
The Draft Board didn't know when to stop
If  start the introductions, can get to meet these young ladies
(Indicating them) My housekeeper, Miss Martha Allen, my granddaughter, Susan Waverly
'm Bob Wallace -- this is Phil Davis -- We're the Stewart sisters
Your floor show
(To Waverly) Don't worry -- 've already told them we'd have to cancel
Why
We have a floor, haven't we
Last time  looked
But who are they going to sing to
Even if it's only to you and me, it will be well worth it
Besides, there will be six inches of snow tonight and we'll be full up tomorrow
(Happily) Is that the weather forecast
No
But if there was one thing learned in the army it was to be positive -- especially when you don't know what you're talking about
You'll excuse me, gentlemen, 'm on
Phil and Bob stiffen automatically
Yes, sir
(To Betty and Judy) And you two charming ladies,  want you to know 'm looking forward to your show this evening
Whatever your audience lacks in numbers, it will make up for in enthusiasm -- (He glares at Martha) or 'll know the reason why
He smiles at the girls, and exits, dignified
(Utterly charmed) Gee
no wonder we won the war
: - () -
- They are doing the number, , on the floor to reveal the scene
There is a scant audience distributed at several tables, totaling not more than fourteen in number
Not far from the kitchen entrance Bob and Phil are sitting at one table
Martha is seen doing general overseeing, principally acting as hostess
Susan doubles between the cashier's desk and helping out at table
- They are admiring the performance
Phil indicates for Bob to look in this direction
Bob does
- The General is seating a table
- Bob shakes his head, unhappy at this condition
They look at each other
think well stay a little longer than we planned
- They finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically, but the few people in the audience don't make for much clatter
One set of hands seems to be applauding loudest and clearest
- He is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding
He walks toward the boys, still applauding
They applaud too
The girls enter the scene, to sit with the boys
Martha is only applauding politely, until Waverly glares at her
Then her enthusiasm is boundless
Excellent
enjoyed it very much
Thank you
It was nice, if you like music
waitress brings food, which Martha helps distribute
(After a look that the waitress is not in a position to hear) Mister Waverly, we'd like to make you a proposition
(Smiling) Well, for heaven's sake
You've been very nice not canceling, we'd like to make a gesture
Until it snows, and you have guests, we'll take half salary
(Appreciative) That's really nice of you
(She takes out pencil and her order book) Now let's get that in writing
(Pushing it aside) Never heard of anything so ridiculous
(Gets up) Your next performance is tomorrow night, after dinner
Be here, or 'll sue
He dignifiedly walks in the direction of some departing guests, and proceeds to show them to the door
(Annoyed) Light-Horse Harry
Advance, advance, never retreat
He's advancing right into bankruptcy
That's just the way he was in the army
Always thinking of the other fellow
We ate and then he ate
We slept, and then he slept
Then he woke up, and nobody slept for the next forty-eight hours
happen to know he's sunk his life's savings into this place
read the carbon paper
Gee,  wish there were something we could do to help
Maybe there is
You got a flash
glimmer
Have to stir it around a bit
(To the girls) Shhh
(Indicating Bob, tapping his forehead) Ticking away madly
Wheels within wheels
This is the brain that, in darkest Italy, devised a formula to make food out of -Ration
Shhhhhh
As he regards Bob with something akin to awe, we : -
- () The last of the supper audience is leaving
We see into a room which adjoins the reservation desk and Bob is on the phone
- Phil is sitting on the desk while Bob talks
(Into phone) Relax
didn't ask you how much it'll cost us
(We hear an excited high voice on the phone) Easy, easy, remember your blood pressure
don't care how much it'll cost us
That's better
Have everybody on the train first thing in the morning
The whole Troupe, and the scenery, and the costumes
You'll have to cancel us off the Ed Harrison Show
Oscar, remember your blood pressure
Incidentally, how much will this cost
(He hears some figure
- It obviously is a very large number) Good night, Oscar
(He hangs up) There you are
Incidentally, how much will this cost
(Clears his throat) We are coming out - even
You mean flat
That's the same as even
Wheels within wheels
It's nice how you take care of the money for both of us because you're older and so level headed
wonder where 'd be now if hadn't saved your life
Do you want me to cancel the troupe coming
(Getting off the desk) No, no
Let's go through the gesture
If you had been on the Titanic when it went down, you wouldn't've been satisfied just to sink into the ocean
(Gesturing) You'd have done a swan dive into it
With me on your back
: -    - () The scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying preparations for the show
The little stage has been enlarged - the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall pushed back a little farther
There is hammering and painting going on in various parts of the room
Trunks have been unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks arrive
Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around, do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness of the previous scene
through all the activity, taking in our group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls standing nearby
Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity
can't believe it
You mean you brought the whole show up here
When you hired the Stewart sisters you also hired a New York show
It was in the small print
And you can't get out of it
We've got lawyers
can't thank you enough, but  wonder if Gramp'll let you do it
Why not
His pride
When he decides he's going into bankruptcy he likes to go
Now just a second
We're not doing this for him
Oh no
We're bringing the show down here to rehearse
The company's been getting a little ragged
We'd appreciate the use of the hall
Of course we don't expect it free
We'll pay a little, but not much
- You see, the audience will be guinea- pigs -- and for us, that's quite an improvement
This has not fooled Susan
She throws her arms around Bob and then Phil
don't know what to say
She cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and runs out
There is a moment of silence
hope this is not an indication of advancing age, getting kissed out of gratitude
You didn't expect a girl that pretty to kiss you because she wanted to
body keeps hoping
Betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack
Bob is quite surprised
(Sincerely) That was the nicest thing  ever saw anybody do
It was still gratitude
(To Judy) 'm his partner
'm entitled to half the credit
(Judy steps up to him and just pecks him on the cheek, then joins her sister in rehearsal) She's not as grateful as her sister
They look off through the exit and see a moving van unloading scenery, as the General arrives in his buggy
He steps down and looks with amazement at the scenery passing by
: - () -
- , Waverly is looking interestedly at the goings on, but is puzzled
The boys exchange a glance
(Finally) 'm not clear about some of it
Explain it again
(Not too good a job) Well, sir
We have this show, and we laid off for the holidays
You see, business was bad
know about business being bad
Go on
Yes sir
Well, so we figured as long as we had the opportunity we'd do a little rehearsing
Right here
Why here
(There is a hint here of the General) Phil looks to Bob for help as they move toward the lobby
The troupe is busy transporting the costumes, etc
, from the moving van to the dining room auditorium as the above scene is played
Well, sir, this nice empty room
The minute we looked at it we said it was ideal
Didn't we
That's what we said
Ideal
And then we'll have an audience to play to
You see, sir, you need an audience on which to try out your new material
Where are you going to get the audience
Oh, what guests there are in the other hotels
They're pretty bored here without snow, and a New York show's kind of a novelty in Vermont
would think so
(He thinks) How will they know you're here
Oh, word gets around
Yes sir, and we also took the girls twice around the town for a little run
They were stiff from the train
In their practice clothes
Makes the blood circulate, (Hers no dope) Hmm
Whose blood
Yes sir
Apparently there must be a lot about show business  don't understand
It'll come to you, sir
It just takes time
We wouldn't be any good as generals
You weren't any good as privates
(Pointing to Bob) He was an officer, sir
Only to confuse the enemy
He turns away and goes to his quarters
: -
- () The company is rehearsing as Bob and Phil enter
That's all for today, kids
People break off what they were doing and begin to drift out
Bob and Phil have gone toward Betty and Judy
Get a little rest before tonight's performance
(To Judy) 'll walk you over
Phil
(He takes a sheet of music out of his inside pocket) Look this over,  want to try something
(To Judy) See you later
The girls go
Phil goes toward the piano, Bob goes toward Martha, who is on the phone, accepting reservations
- Bob takes Martha by the arm and seats her in the middle of the room as an audience of one
Phil looks up from the piano, puzzled
The sunset is visible through the window and there is a mood of quiet
Guinea pig
(Nodding) That's the idea
Want you to hear a song  just wrote
If it's a love song, don't get too close
It isn't
Just tell me how you think the Old Man would feel about this one
He leaves her and goes to the piano and they do , solely for Martha
Toward the end of the song -- - Unseen by the others he is standing by the door listening to the song
- The boys finish the number
Martha applauds and Bob bows
(Very moved) think it's just wonderful -- -  - She is standing there, drying her eyes with her apron
think so, too
-  - 'm afraid  disagree
The song is funny, but there is one thing wrong with it
' What's that, sir
It's true
'd rather you didn't
- Bob and Phil exchange a quick glance
Yes, sir
The General turns and exits toward the lobby, with him, a lonely figure walking through the lobby, the   on a poster advertising tonight's performance
: -
- () It is fairly-well filled
Bob, Phil, Betty, Judy and the ensemble are performing a  which is a routine done to lyrics and music
Bob and Phil are end men, Betty is interlocutor, and Judy is later introduced as Mandy
This takes Judy and Phil into a dance to the song
This entire number is done in white-face with stylized costumes and set
During the applause and bows, we  : - Waverly, flanked by Susan and Martha, is at a large table
The other occupants are local hotel owners and their wives
Great show, Waverly
Thank you
We needed something like this had six checkouts, and when they heard about this they decided to stay
Same here
(Big smile) Much obliged
Glad to help
Martha and Susan beam; all is well
: -
- () It is empty and most of the lights are out
At a considerable distance from  Martha extinguishes the last light, except for a small work light which is servicing Bob, who is fingering the piano keys and writing music notes, hard at work
- ' In the background we see the boys' bungalow
-
' Betty and Judy are in twin beds, the light is coming in from the moon
The girls are seen in profile
(Talkative) The moon
can't get over the moon up here
The size of it
(In a quiet mood) Same one they have all over
They'll never prove it to me
And everything smells so beautiful
(She breathes) What is it - pine or fir
(Small sniff) We're near the bakery
(Friendly, not realizing the stab) You know your trouble, Betty
You're not romantic
Betty turns and looks toward her
Since Judy does not see her, Betty's expression is a true reflection of how she feels
Everything's so wonderful here, so pretty, so exciting,  can't understand how you stay frozen up
Let yourself go, go, like me
(Afraid to ask) Which one is it
What do you mean
Bob or Phil
Neither
You mean both
(Smiling) It's the same
No one is going to break up our act
Isn't there one you prefer over the other
The way Phil dances, and he's funny
It's easy to see yourself married to him
(An effort) And Bob
He's different, deeper, and he's funny, too
It'd be nice to be married to both of them
Good thing they're not a quartette
(Oblivious) If  was Catherine the Great, that's what 'd do
Phil in the daytime, Bob at night
Or should it be the other way around
- Betty
Is it possible our Betty has a suspicion of a tear
Phil'd be more fun in a night club, but eventually a girl wants a pipe and slipper fellow
That's Bob, smoking a pipe and petting a cocker spaniel
Still, Phil could learn to smoke a pipe
Breaking a fellow in to suit you is something every girl should go through
hear it's half the fun
Which one do you like better
Betty
(No answer
) Betty
(Softer) Are you asleep
(No answer
Judy turns over and closes her eyes) Music has underscored this scene
Betty is wide awake
She is looking toward the window
As the curtains billow outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence, putting out his pipe
This is followed by an equally diffused figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, and joining Bob
Bob takes her in his arms
At this point we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter
This causes the diffusion to vanish, and Betty gets out of bed and puts on her robe
: -
- () We  Betty to the refrigerator door, which she opens
' Tuna fish, on the lower shelf
Betty whirls around
- We see Bob is having a snack of his own
Oh
What are you doing
Sleep-walking
couldn't sleep
Little young for that, aren't you
He gets up and goes to the refrigerator
His preoccupation with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience of her regard for Bob,  since their significance must escape him
What shall  make you
Anything'll do
If you tell me what you want to dream about 'll know what to make you
(Amused) How's that
Different foods make for different dreams
've got a whole theory about it
It's called "The Wallace Way of Wishful Wooing
"  You'll find it in the American Medical Journal under ''
Ham and Swiss cheese, for instance, you get a cool, thin, blonde girl
Turkey sandwich, you get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy though
Now a liverwurst sandwich - (He shakes his head) you get both girls at once
Bad night
What do you dream on tuna
Darndest thing,  dream about me
(Evenly) Then 'll have a tuna sandwich
Bob doesn't get the significance of what she has said
Now that's very flattering
Tuna coming up
(He is occupied at the frigidaire while she watches him yearningly) Let me make you some warm milk
That'll help the insomnia
(Meaningly) No it won't
(Looking straight at his back) Warm milk won't do it
Whatever you've got on your mind isn't worth staying awake for
think it is
He smiles at her, oblivious to the meaning behind her lines
Would you like to know how  handle a situation like that
Tell me, Doctor
Bob begins to sing   , as he prepares the warm milk and hands it to her
She drinks it down
As he reaches the second chorus, he starts to dim the lamp on the table,  Betty, pretending to be sleepy, leans her head toward Bob
He takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between her head and her chair
She waits, eyes closed, expectantly
But Bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the door and exits, closing it softly behind him
After a moment, Betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor, and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awake
: -
- () Various members of the company are in rehearsal clothes and sitting around the room
The orchestra is playing the introduction to Phil's number, which will employ a line of six girls who are just coming on the floor
Bob is on stage supervising the rehearsal
Judy is standing across from the piano
Betty is seated on the sidelines with her legs stretched over two chairs
She is knitting a loud colored argyle sock
Phil, standing close by, has just finished rolling up a ball of yarn
He looks at Betty's knitting, then at his feet
Don't make them too tight
wear size 12
All right kids
Places
Let's get going
Phil, you're on
Phil reacts
Bob crosses to his stage manager station, which is a desk and high chair, where Albert is seated, not far from his wife, Sylvia, who is sipping a glass of water
Albert holds a stop watch and evidently helps in the administration
(To Albert) How long are we so far
An hour and ten minutes
Something has to come out
From his position, Phil, in a series of leaps and turns, reaches center floor and begins his solo
- She continues knitting while watching Phil dancing
As Phil comes to a portion where he speeds up his steps she unconsciously speeds up her knitting, Bob has seen her, and he looks from her knitting and her look of admiration, which he mistakes for affection, and then looks from the socks to Phil's feet
At the end of the number, which is applauded by the witnesses, Judy runs to Phil and hugs and kisses him, at this distance
Bob, looking at Betty, mistakenly sees her disappointment
All right, places for the next number
(He turns to Sylvia) You're next, Sylvia
(Sylvia and Albert exchange peculiar glances,  Bob senses it) What's the trouble
Mr
Wallace - (He is embarrassed to go on) Come on, out with it
don't think Sylvia ought to go on, unless you cut out the high kicks and let her do some easy waltzes
Very easy waltzes
Bob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness indicates pregnancy
You're kidding
We don't want anyone else to know
Please don't mention it
(The orchestra starts to play Sylvia and Albert are startled) For heaven's sake
How did they know
The girls start crowding around
(Ad libbing) You wouldn't tell us, would you
We had to find out ourselves, etc
(Phil and Judy are among the group) (Formally) There will be a celebration of the forthcoming event tonight after the show
(Everyone approves) - , Phil puts his arm around Albert
Obviously you're going to call the boy after me
After you
hired Sylvia
The baby'll be named after me
've been dancing with her
That's more important
The baby'll be named after me
The hiring was more important
After me
The dancing was more important
After me
'm her husband
(Small pause) The baby'll be named after me
Well, we're going to need another dancer
How about Judy, she knows all the routines, she could pick it up in no time
They walk to the table where the coffee is, and the group now includes Betty
On the other hand, it's all right if we lose a number, we're running too long now
We have to cut somewhere
Wouldn't it be better if you cut my solo number
've never felt right in it anyway
(Indicating Phil) The show needs every bit of his dancing
(Interpreting this as mere selflessness for love) Well - There you are - painless
She turns away rather abruptly, since she is becoming emotional
Bob shakes his head, impressed with what he thinks is her devotion
- Bob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after Betty
He looks at Phil and shakes his head
Greater love hath no woman than to give up a solo number
Old Chinese saying
(All this is beyond him) What are you talking about
Drink your coffee
: -   - () This is the party later that evening
Some people are dancing
Others are grouped about, and there is a general home party atmosphere
The General, Martha and Susan are seen helping everyone to feel at home
The       and , passing Sylvia, where ad lib comments about the impending baby are sketchily
The toward the piano, where Bob and Betty are examining the music sheet of
Betty looks up and the   her look to Phil, who is dancing with Rita
Rita nestles up close to Phil
This is seen by Bob and Betty
Bob smiles
- On closer view, we can see that Rita is the aggressor
(Referring to the grip) Don't you want me to breathe
Not especially
What's gotten into you
You were chasing me in Florida
And you were running
What made you stop
You're interested in Judy, aren't you
That's it, eh
Unless it belongs to someone else, a girl doesn't - Ouch
(Evidently Rita has deliberately stepped on his instep) ' Betty is walking over to the dancing couple and deliberately cuts in on Rita, who is displeased, but can do nothing but yield
Bob's reaction still implies that this is understandable since Betty loves Phil
He turns back toward the piano, and other couples are between him and Betty and Phil
Still at the same camera distance, we see Betty turning Phil over to Judy
- Judy is a little cool
What's the matter
Nothing is the matter
This isn't the way you dance
Some people dance closer than others
Phil is delighted that she is jealous
Yes, that's true
'm one of the close ones
That's my type
He holds her closely, by force, dancing, smiling and pleased with himself
- The dance music stops
The people disperse
- Harry, the piano player, is playing the last half of Bob and Betty are leaning over the piano, Bob humming the melody
Betty pantomimes to the others to quiet down
Bob starts to sing the lyric
In the second chorus, he is joined in the singing by Betty
During this chorus we   show various reactions of the group, and end on Phil, sitting close to Judy, holding her hand
- We  Bob and Betty, off scene, continuing to the end of the second chorus, on which Phil, sotto voce, sings the last four bars
(Singing; looking at Judy) And once you've caught him, don't ever let him go
follows the song
Phil gets up
Ladies and gentlemen,  would like to make an announcement
- Everyone quiets, waiting to hear the announcement
It is my pleasure to identify the man who has been doing the chasing
am him
- Or he
- Or it
Anyway, Judy has caught me
What 'm trying to say is, we're engaged
He looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is going to marry her
He hugs her amidst a general reaction of congratulations
- He is flabbergasted
- Phil and Judy are separated by the congratulators
Betty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm
hope you realize that you're getting he most wonderful girl in the world
Bob sees her emotion through the speech
Betty notices Judy upset, shaking off the people around her and running through the doorway to the kitchen
Betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her, as the orchestra goes into
- Judy is crying into her hands as Betty enters
Darling, don't cry
(Turning to her) didn't know he was going to make that announcement,  swear  didn't
Betty puts one arm around her
know you didn't
He had no right to do that
You do love him, don't you
That doesn't matter
Nothing else matters
We're not going to break up our act
Phil enters the kitchen
've been looking for you, Judy
Excuse me
She goes through the corridor toward the living room
-   ' In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry getting some drinks for the guests
He is not seen by Betty who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few tears
Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the corridor from the living room
Don't take this too much to heart
Phil is a great kid but constancy isn't his long suit
'm not the least bit worried
(Phil and Judy enter from the kitchen) Frankly, this couldn't come at a better time
They want me to come back to The Carousel again -  used to sing there before Judy and  teamed up - and  had to turn it down because they can only use a single
(Not too well) So - this couldn't be more convenient
You stay with the show and 'll go back to The Carousel
When did you get this offer
Just today, as a matter of fact got a telegram
Why didn't you mention it before
didn't want to hurt your feelings
Where is the telegram
threw it away
What is this, a third degree
You don't think made it up
Yes,  do
There is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each one, speaks
Well now,  wouldn't bet any large sum of money on that, since  took the message over the telephone, and had to deliver the telegram
(To take the tension off) And she didn't tip me, either
Betty looks at him gratefully
Oh, Betty
(She throws her arms around her) 'm sorry
misunderstood
Now, baby
It's all right
Well, everything's fine now
Happy, he beams at Judy
- Something bothers Bob about this story
He looks searchingly at Betty, puzzled
He does not notice Waverly, who watches him watching Betty
: -   - Train about to leave
The General is in the foreground sitting in the buggy
Betty is saying goodbye to him
Bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage
(Shouting over noise of train) Where are you going to be
The Carousel
The General looks at her, questioningly
(Whispering, during a lull in the noise) sent them a telegram this morning
The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses to the train, starting up the steps
The notion behind this scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam
The manner of playing, though, indicates the sentiment
To emphasize it: Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, consciously, her affection
We hear Betty: Take care of my little sister
She can take care of herself
Worry about the menfolk
Now don't forget to write
'll send you picture postcards
Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching the scene with a whimsical look
He, as does the audience, realizes Bob's true feelings
As the train starts to leave, Betty and Bob shake hands
She holds his handshake a little longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with the train
Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after the train, puzzled
is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight
Betty wipes away a tear
In the background we see the General in the buggy noticing this
- Bob is in the foreground, the General in the background
Bob joins the General at the buggy
From Waverly's expression we can see that he has decided on a plan of action
Must be interesting to be a woman
The idea's never occurred to me, sir
Well, think about it
(Bob is thinking about it) Well
Not interested
man like you must be an expert on women
It's a little immodest to say so, but  consider myself an authority on the fair sex,  've made a study of the subject
They're simple creatures
They couldn't fool you
'm single
'Pride goeth before a fall
' 'Who knows his own strength is twice armed
' It's always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field
Tell me, why do you think Betty went to New York
(Not willing to admit it) She has a job in The Carousel
Expert, you're wrong
She went to New York because she's so in love with someone here she just couldn't stand it
Phil
( mixture of resentment and frustration) 'm darned if  can figure out why
thought you were an expert on women
(To the horse) Come on, Delilah
: -    - from the ceiling and we see that is being decorated for Christmas Eve
Everybody is so engaged, except those actively helping Phil and Judy rehearse
The attitude is slightly cool on Judy's part, but it is lover's coolness
(Fitting the action) Good, Judy
(During the dancing) Now the same as the middle part
They make a nice couple, with his arm around her waist, dancing as one
- He enters the room, and watches
He looks intently at Phil
Phil and Judy dance closer to Bob
They see him
They continue dancing, talking as they do
Betty get off all right
(Slightly belligerent) Certainly
Betty left something for you
She said to give it to you after she left
It's on the piano
Bob hears, nods, but keeps staring at Phil
Phil becomes conscious of the staring
What's the matter
don't get it
Don't get what
just don't see it
You' re skinny, you got a big nose, and you squint
Who
Me
Yes, you
Nothing personal though
No, of course not
'm just trying to figure out what anyone sees in you
Well, stop worrying about it
When ask you for a date just turn me down
Come on, Judy
They dance away
Bob crosses to the piano and picks up the package Betty left for him
He opens it up and it is a single knitted sock, the one she knitted on previously
He looks through the box for its mate
There is none
The    to Bob, puzzled
: -  - () Painted at the top is the legend: At the moment a hand is completing, in chalk: "No Snow" After a moment, the hand returns and draws two lines through the "" so that it now reads, "No $now" to reveal we are on: - Bob comes out of the Post Office and mounts a bicycle
He cycles down the street, whistling
: -    -
- () There is a group of elderly men, among them the hotel owners, pitching horseshoes
Waverly is sitting on a bench, ruefully looking at the sign
(Starting a new game) How about it, Waverly, want to play
(Looking at him a moment) 'm too young for that sort of thing
First Owner laughs goodnaturedly and continues playing
Bob rides into the scene and dismounts
- Bob sits into the shot
Kind of warm for that kind of exercise, isn't it
(Trying to help) It isn't very warm
(He looks to the sky) think the weatherman's wrong about his forecast
Those look like snow clouds to me
(Without looking up) They're cumulus clouds, at an elevation of seven thousand feet
Yes, sir
(Still trying) Still, weather's a funny thing
It could snow - overnight
(He thinks a moment) 'll tell you something  haven't told my family
'm going back in the Army
Really, sir
That's great news
Yes
miss the Army
Where are you going to be sent, sir
Well, 'm not sure yet
've always been a combat officer, but  got an idea they're going to try and palm off one of the training commands on me
They'd better not
They just better not
(He's worked up now) 'm not ready for pitching horseshoes yet
(He smiles) Now nothing to the women folk about this
No, sir
Let's mosey over to the post office, 'm expecting a letter any day
(Remembering) Oh,  beg your pardon, sir
(He pulls the letter out of his pocket) That's what  came over to give you, it slipped my mind
The General takes the letter, he looks at it front and back
(Solemn) This is the one
(He opens it,  He squints
He looks to Bob) My glasses are in my room
'd like to read it by myself, but 'm a little anxious
(He smiles at his own predicament) Read it, son
Slowly
(Reading) Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old - (He stops) (Pleased) Skip that word
Yes, sir
(Continuing) It certainly was a surprise hearing from you
Your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine
Of course you've got plenty of time to be amusing, sitting on that porch, rocking away, while we put in a full day's work
You always were a lucky stiff, and  envy you
few years more,  was saying to Emmy the other evening, and 'm going to be able to take it easy like old Tom
(Just repeats) Old Tom
Oh, well, some people have all the luck
Everyone in the family is fine here
Carol had the mumps, which is no joke at eleven years of age - The rest of the letter is about the family
(Bob looks at him, and then glances at the rest to see if it is so) He's telling me they have nothing for me, we're not fooling each other
(He holds has hand out) Thank you
(Bob gives him his letter
There is a pause
An attempt at being light) Say, it couldn't be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes
Now could it
(Trapped, unhappy for him) No sir
(His nerve up) Begging your pardon, sir, there's a lot to be said for leisure
You're not used to it, you've always been active, but in time - He stops, seeing Waverly's expression
Waverly winks at him
(Quietly) Never kid a kidder
Go on back to the hotel
Yes sir
Waverly gets up to join the horseshoe players after all
Bob watches this reflectively as we : - () -
- Bob is packing his valise, Phil helping him
Judy thinks my eyes are soulful
Do you think my eyes are soulful
One of them is
You have no poetry in you
It's about time you went in for girls, too
After all, you haven't many years left for that sort of thing
Bob, his back turned to Phil, comes across the sock Betty knitted for him; he hastily shoves it into the bottom of has bag
(Over above) 'm the quiet type
Little do you know what's aged me
Wheels within wheels, eh
Well, live it up, Pops
Eat, drink and be merry -- is that why you're leaving for New York
told you what 'm seein' Ed Harrison about
That's all
Business, business
Glad to be rid of you
You're not in the girly mood
(Easily annoyed at the moment) What do you know about girls
You wouldn't know what to do with a girl if she fell on you
Well, 'd know enough not to get up
There is a  at the door and Martha sticks her head in
Mr
Wallace -- gonna miss your train
(To Bob) For her 'd get up
As Bob slams his suitcase shut, : 114A
-
- () poster outside advertises the appearance of Betty Stewart
is heard emanating from the club
: -
- () rehearsal is in progress in the deserted club
The chairs are up on the tables, musicians in their shirt sleeves, as Betty  a chorus of ,  '
As she finishes, the orchestra  turns to her
Betty - You really live that number
The story of my life
Shall we try it over again
(Meaningly) wish  could
: -
- () It is alive with customers; couples are dancing on the floor, as a number ends
Bob enters, and is conducted to a ringside table by a maitre d'
'm expecting Ed Harrison
' Very well, Mr
Wallace
116A
- Betty is standing at the microphone ready to sing
She sees Bob
The Leader raises his baton
(Stopping him, sotto) Let's not do the new number
What
Play "Blue Skies" -- anything
Relax
Just do it the way you sang it this afternoon -- you'll be great
He gives the downbeat, and Betty has no choice but to sing ,  '
She is assisted in the second chorus by a vocal group
- as Bob watches her
When she finishes the number, Betty steps down from the platform and joins Bob
(As Bob holds the chair) Well, surprise
What brought you to the big city
And don't say 'a train
' (Forced gaiety, hiding her tension) never heard you sing that well
That's a good number for you
(Her own significance) Some numbers suit you better than others
What are you doing here
Business, business
Meeting a fellow here
Judy all right
She's fine
Couldn't be better
(Carefully) Playing footsie with Phil
That's nice
think they like each other
do, too
(Eyeing her) They're kind of suited, in a lot of ways
Some people are
Thanks for the knitted sock
Don't mention it
thought it was for Phil
(Evenly) If the sock fits, wear it
(Unsure of her meaning) It started out for Phil
It just started out as a sock
Every line of the sock exchange should have the meaning of the love implications
You're a very odd girl
You're a very odd fellow
Bob is close to declaring himself, if he was only sure of his ground
Two feet, one sock
must be
'll get around to the other one, eventually
You mean to do any knitting in the near future
The feeling comes and goes
Think if the model hung around for a while
the feeling might be more permanent
Maybe
Bob leans over and takes her hand
What's this maybe, shmaybe, comes and goes
Friends tell me  don't have many years left for this sort of thing
ought to know right now if -- He is interrupted by  , who has been brought to the table by the maitre d'
Bob
How are you
Hiya, Ed
(He knows Betty) Betty
She nods, as Ed sits down
(To Bob) Now what's this big deal you wanted to discuss
shouldn't even talk to you after canceling out on my show
(Carefully) Ed,  saw the old man
Waverly
Where, in the Pentagon
Pentagon, nothing
He owns a little hotel in a winter resort in Vermont
Our old man
Nobody even knows who he is
He's too proud to let them know he's General Waverly
Ed looks at her, surprised
(To Bob, indicating Betty) Was she in our outfit, too
Vermont branch
What are we going to do about it
You got a flash
glimmer
Got to stir it around a little
All stirred
Remember how Old Flintbottom always used to find a way to keep our morale up
without telling us
It's about time we returned the favor
Let's surprise him with a real big bang-up reunion
Now you're talking
How do we spread the word
Bob takes a piece of paper out of his inside pocket and hands it to Ed
You're gonna read this little speech on your television show
People look at it, don't they
(Scanning the paper) Now's as good a time as any to find out
As he continues to read the piece of paper, we : -
- - () Phil is excited
Bob, just leave it to me
He won't get near a set if  have to break a leg
Goodbye, Bob
He opens the door of the booth and hurries across the lobby toward Susan, who is at the desk, and  on the bell, which is on the counter
Martha comes running from the kitchen
(Excitedly) Now everybody pay close attention
: -
- () Ed is about to go on the air
Bob is opposite him, out of camera range,  The technical crew are watching the hand of the dial approaching 60
hope Phil has been able to keep the old man away from a television set
He has
In anything involving something crooked he's dependable
- Seated around the television set are Waverly, Martha and Susan
Martha and Susan look at their watches and each other, nervously
Waverly also looks at his watch
Ed Harrison will be on in a half minute
like him
never miss him
The women are becoming very nervous
Suddenly we  off scene the most tremendous clatter dorm the stairway and Phil's shouting
Ow
Ow
Ow
(Jumping up) What's that
He runs toward the stairs
Martha and Susan breathe a sigh of relief and follow Waverly
- Waverly runs to the tangled Phil
My leg is broken
Ow, ow
Take it easy, boy
(He starts feeling his leg) Ow
Ow
It's broken
No it isn't
You may have a bad sprain, but no bones are busted
It's broken, sir
can feel it
Let me help you
- The technician indicates for Ed Harrison to start as the second hand hits straight up
would like to address all former officers, enlisted men, Wacs and nurses who were under the command of General Tom Waverly -- -
' Waverly and Martha are helping Phil through the door
Ow
Ow
It's broken in two or three places
That's just the impression you have
tell you it's only shock
into the office as they lay him out on the couch
(Laying him out) Take it easy, boy
Don't leave me
Everything is going round and round
Nobody's leaving you
Martha, get me a cold towel
- The objective is Pine Tree, Vermont --- Synchronize watches for Operation Waverly
- Phil has his eyes closed
Things still going around
Now they're going sideways
Waverly takes the wet towel from Martha
Now they're going in and out
Waverly slaps the towel on his face
This'll bring him out of it
(Sitting up) Where am
He's all right
Judy bursts into the room
Phil, what's happened to you
Phil assumes a pain-stricken face again and Judy throws her arms around him
Phil smiles over her shoulder at Waverly
: -  - Silhouette of busses, Station in background, if desirable
- Two men, with
armbands, slow up the busses
One is revealed to be Phil
All quiet, folks
Entering the town
The Old Man's asleep
Let's keep him that way
The busses move on
: -  - Bob and Betty tiptoe through the entrance to the inn
In the semidarkness of the lobby we hear a "sst - ", and Susan and Martha are revealed having been waiting for them
We've been waiting for you
How is everything going
Just fine
They are bedded down in all the hotels
Martha blows her nose
His old outfit
If  wasn't such a mean old biddy, 'd probably break right down and cry
(She cries) There's nothing to cry about, is there
He looks to Susan and she begins to bawl
(Through the crying) Thank you so much
Bob looks to Betty for support
Can't you do something
They're just affected by the gesture
She can't hold it back either, and now the three women are crying
That's fine
(Through her tears) Where are Judy and Phil
Probably in their rooms, crying
They start out
: -
- As Bob and Betty turn around the corner, they see Phil and Judy, locked in an embrace
Bob has been in front, but he steps back quickly, not wanting to embarrass the lovers
Who is it
General Waverly
The lovers
(To Bob) We can't just stand here
We have to get some sleep
She walks into sight, Bob following
Phil and Judy break, embarrassed
We were rehearsing for the show tomorrow night
Is it going to be that kind of a show
We'll be raided
What are you doing here
What happened at The Carousel
'm helping out here tomorrow
Hi, Bob
Everything's under control
(Fluster) mean with the show
We've got a lot of new material
You both are going to have to do a lot of rehearsing
(Flustered again) mean the other kind of rehearsing - mean - rehearsing  Well, good night, Judy
And he holds his hand out, and they shake hands, still flustered
Good night, Phil
Good night, Bob
(To both) Good night
Flustered, the boys open the door to the girls' bungalow, thinking it is their own
Let's get out of here before the gossip starts
They all laugh
The girls enter their bungalow and put on the light
The boys head toward their bungalow
Phil enters in a gay mood
Bob stops at the door, turns around and looks toward the window of the girls' bungalow
: -
'  - Judy is getting into bed
Betty, in her dressing gown, is looking out of the window toward the boys' bungalow
Bob is still pacing up and down on the porch
think 'll go out and see what's bothering him
That's how  started in Canton, Ohio
This is Vermont
Nothing can happen here
Keep your guard up
That ain't Coolidge out on that porch
Betty throws her a look, and exits
'  - Bob stands on the porch, in robe and slippers, thoughtfully puffing at his pipe
Betty comes into scene
What are you doing
Sleep walking
(Turning) Couldn't sleep
Betty comes up on the porch
Whatever you've got on your mind isn't worth staying awake for
Where have  heard that
Tell you how  handle a situation like this, Doctor
She starts to sing,
At the conclusion, she walks away, leaving him standing there
: -       - () This sign announces the show opening
People are streaming into the inn
-
' The General is in his dressing gown, furious
Martha and Susan are playing a part
How could you send all my suits to the cleaners
You've only got two
Why can't you wear your uniform
won't appear in uniform
Please, Gramp
Absolutely not
Very well
'll explain to Bob and Phil that you didn't care to come to the show tonight
'll have you court-martialed
You don't mind being ungrateful, you just don't like being told you are
(Follows it up) If you think you don't owe them anything, you're not obliged to go
They haven't done much for you
Hardly anything
You do what you think is right
(Angrily) Martha, 'll make my own decisions
got along very well in the army without you
It took 15,000 men to take my place
She stalks out
: -   - () It is slowly filling up
One of the guiding officials turns out to be the Sheriff we have previously seen
(Seating a party) Right this way
-
- They are getting into their old uniforms, which are slightly misfit
(At the trousers) This thing's shrunk
(Looking at the bulge) Pants always shrink in closets
can't breathe in this
What am going to do
know what 'm going to do
(Showing him) 'm going to take one big deep breath, and that's going to be it for the next three hours
Bob takes a deep breath and gets the top button buttoned
-   - () General Waverly comes down the stairs, cutting quite a figure in his uniform and decorations
Martha and Susan, waiting for him at the bottom, look him over, admiringly
(Gruffly) Well,  couldn't come down in my bathrobe
- The spotlight prepared, pinpoints the General as he enters the room, and the music starts
The audience rises and applauds
He can't believe it
He reaches his table, decorated with flowers, and recognizes he is the guest of honor
From the lobby we hear the outfit  the opening strains of
All eyes turn to the lobby entrance, through which the old outfit marches, and continues to the stage, and then back to their respective tables as the song finishes
- He is profoundly moved and walks to the stage
The audience is seated
Waverly looks at the assembled crowd with great affection
The people begin to shout, "Speech
Speech
" Martha and Susan sit
The crowd quiets, waiting for the speech
(He must have had a blood transfusion from a sergeant at some time) am not satisfied with the conduct of this division
Some of you men are under the impression that having been at Anzio entitles you not to wear neckties
You are wrong
Neckties will be worn in this area
have also noticed a deterioration in the quality of saluting
This is to be improved
have also had complaints from the commanding officer of the rest area in Naples
He informs me that the non-fraternization rule is constantly being broken by men of this division
In fact, this division is outstanding in its violations of non-fraternization
You all know the rules
The non- fraternization ban expressly declares you are not to talk to women
( slightly different tone) Don't talk to them
That is all
They howl and cheer
He makes has way toward his own table, greeting old friends on the way
- As they step to the front of the stage
(To the audience) Doesn't that bring back memories
Remember those terrible, trying days in Italy
when we had to beat the women off with chocolate bars
And wasn't it awful the way they kept bothering us for American cigarettes
Why,  must have taught fifty girls how to smoke
For a month's pay all we got was 950 million lira
Nine hundred and fifty two
was forced to hire a caddy for my loose change
Fore
'm glad 'm well out of it
Phil looks at him
Who are we kidding
This is the cue for the orchestra to start the production number,
At end of number - - As they applaud and cheer
The old outfit is happy
In the exultation, General Waverly places two fingers to his lips and blows a whistle of sheer pleasure and approval
We underscore with  indicating another number is taking place on stage, although we do not see it
- Ed Harrison crosses to General Waverly and whispers to him
Long distance call for you, sir
Waverly looks surprised, but rises and starts out
Bob, visible in b
g
, has been watching
He and Harrison exchange knowing glances
- The lobby is empty;  in b
g
are the doors to the dining room, where the show is in progress
The telephone lies on the counter
Waverly enters and crosses to it
He is a little annoyed at being forced to leave the entertainment
(Into phone, gruffly) Hurry up, hurry up, 'm busy
Yes, this is General Waverly
He suddenly snaps to attention, the old soldier
(Quietly) And a Merry Christmas to you, Mr
President
Yes, practically the whole outfit is here
little paunchy, but they're here
It certainly was a surprise -- more like a frameup
As usual, my Intelligence was not functioning efficiently
Yes
(Long pause) That's very nice of you, Mr
President
any time you want me, just say the word
but may  add this
It isn't always necessary to take a job
sometimes it's enough just to know it's there
Through the window behind the General we have seen it begin to
The General notices it for the first time, and his face brightens
If you ever take it into your mind to grab a little rest from all that work  wish you'd drop in on us here -- can't promise you any golf but -- (As he looks at the falling snow) -- we can certainly give you plenty of snow, Mr, President
Yes, Mr
President
What
(Smiles) Thanks, Ike
He hangs up the phone, and proudly, head erect, he walks through the lobby, smiling, eyes wet
He lifts the bell on the desk with a loud bang
Martha hurries in, startled
You frightened me to death
That bell hasn't been used for three months
Get this area policed up
No telling who might be dropping in
Martha salutes
Yes, sir
She and the General gaze at the snow falling beyond the lobby door which is blown open by the wind
Underneath all this we have been hearing the introductory music to  , which is the number now in progress on the stage
Waverly now turns and walks into the dining room
- Waverly on his entrance
As he passes Susan, we see she is reacting to something on the stage
Waverly and moves to: -   - Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas tree
Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe, etc
Bob and Betty are seen singing
Throughout action of this number Phil and Judy dance
In addition there is staged movement by the ensemble
Bob and Betty are on each side of the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating with one hand behind the cutout tree
Bob and Betty as their movement takes them behind the tree
It is now that we see very clearly that the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has opened; in b
g
we see the Vermont countryside being covered by the falling snow
Also, we see pine trees in the snow that are decorated
Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock she gave him in scene 110
Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe and the sock, and smiles at Betty
She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is wearing the other sock
They laugh and embrace
- The cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real trees and falling snow in b
g
are completely visible
One by one, the trees are lighted
- Martha and Susan are standing happily beside the General, each holding one of his arms
