Would you like something to read
Do you have anything light
Elaine hands her a small piece of paper
How about this leaflet: 'Famous Jewish Sports Legends
' (taking pamphlet) Yes
Thank you
Elaine turns and is shocked to see Striker approaching his seat
Ted, what are you doing here
Elaine, 've got to talk to you
You
you shouldn't have come
don't have time now
Oh, stewardess
Excuse me
Striker sits down
No wonder you're upset
She's lovely
And a darling figure
Supple, pouting breasts
Firm thighs
It's a shame you're not getting along
Yes,  know
Things used to be different
remember when we first met
It was during the war
: - Striker is seated at bar in a smoke-filled room
An assortment of unsavory characters are hanging around the bar
(v
o
) was in the Air Force, stationed in Drambuie, on the Barbary Coast
used to hang out in the Magumba Bar
Shapely female legs walking on bar stop in front of Striker
shapely female in tight fitting dress
She is playing the sleazy trombone music
(v
o
) It was a rough place
You would count on a fight breaking out almost every night
Two   are slugging it out old Western style -- breaking tables and chairs
-   - An unsavory  puts a quarter in the jukebox
One Girl Scout bashes the other against the jukebox buttons
- "-5 " plays
Girl Scout is bashed against jukebox again
- "-17 " Girl Scout bashes again
- "-12 " The unsavory Character nods approvingly at selections
- Patrons are dancing a la John Travolta
(v
o
) didn't go there that night to fall in love,  just dropped in for a couple of drinks
He turns to look toward dance floor
(v
o
) But suddenly there she was
' Elaine dancing with grizzly looking cutthroat
(v
o
) was captivated, entranced
(v
o
) It hit me like a thunderbolt
had to ask the guy next to me to pinch me to make sure  wasn't dreaming
Striker asks the burly  next to him to to pinch him
Longshoreman gives him a look and moves away cautiously
(v
o
) was afraid to approach her, but that night, fate was on my side
Elaine's dancing partner is stabbed in the back and falls to the grould
No one notices but Striker who eagerly fills in
They make a perfect disco couple
The other dancers make a circle around them
They begin with fancy disco steps, move on to flips and seemingly impossible acrobatics, finally ending with incredible stunts: Striker, jumping through flaming hoops and Elaine, hanging from a chandelier by her teeth and twirling
: - Bar is closing, chairs on tables, bartender sweeping floor, Elaine and Striker dancing slowly in center of room
One final Girl Scout flies into  and falls in a lifeless heap at their feet
: - We laughed, we talked, we danced,  never wanted it to end and  guess  still don't
But enough about me
hope this hasn't been boring for you
to reveal Mrs
Elderly's legs dangling next to him
She has hung herself
It's just that when  start to talk about Elaine,  get so carried away --  lose all track of time -- not unlike Oliver in 'Jesus: the Man
' -   - Milton, carrying a tray with two cups of coffee, approaches Bernice

Would you like to order dinner now

Well,  think that the pilots are too busy flying the plane for that, Joey
Aw, gee whiz

Gee
That'd be swell
Elaine moves on to the two Black Dudes
Would you gentlemen care to order your dinners

-   - Elaine is replacing a magazine and catches sight of Striker
'  - Boring another passenger
She moves into the alcove and begins to pour coffee of Elaine
: - Striker and Elaine are running
She falls down at the water's edge, exhausted
Striker drops to his knees and they embrace passionately
huge wave washes over them covering them completely
When the wave recedes, they're still locked in the same embrace
They are covered with seaweed
Fish are flopping around in the sand
Oh, Ted,  never knew  could be so happy
These past few months have been wonderful
Tomorrow why don't we drive up the coast to that little seafood place and
Striker frowns
What's the matter
My orders came through
My squadron ships out tomorrow
'll be leading a very important mission
Oh, Ted, please be careful
worry about you so much
love you, Elaine
love you
They embrace
Another huge wave washes in and covers them completely
: - Elaine comes back to reality
- In level flight
- (v
o
) Flight two-zero-niner, this is Denver Flight Control
You're approaching some rough weather
Please climb to forty-two thousand feet
Roger, Denver
There is a  on the cockpit door
Elaine and Joey enter
We have a visitor
Hello
Hi
This is Captain Oveur
Mister Murdock and Mister Johnson
This is Joey Hammen
Come on up here
You can see better
Joey, here's something we give our special visitors
Would you like to have it
He gives Joey a small toy airplane and puts his arm around him
Thank you
Thanks a lot
Have you ever been in a cockpit before
No, sir
've never been up in a plane before
Have you ever seen a grown man naked
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence
(looking at Joey) No, why don't you take care ot it
We'd better get back now
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to
Could
Okay, if you don't get in the way
Elaine exits
Murdock picks up phone
Flight two-zero-niner to Denver radio
Climbing to cruise at forty-two thousand
Will report again over Lincoln
Over and out
Joey has been paying very close attention to Murdock, and suddenly recognizes him
Wait a minute
know you
You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar
You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers
'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else
My name is Roger Murdock
'm the co-pilot
He turns to Basta
Ah, Victor, why don't you get the coordinates on the altitude vector and find out the ratio of direct velocity over engine speed
Victor is puzzled
You are Kareem
've seen you play
My Dad's got season tickets
think you should go back to your seat now, Joey
Right, Clarence
No, he's not bothering anyone
Let him stay up here
All right
But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock
He points to his nametag
'm an airline pilot
(to Oveur) Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies
think you're the greatest
But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense
(into microphone) Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner
and that lots of times you don't even run down court
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner
and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs
The hell  don't
'm out there busting my buns every night
Murdock realizes he has given himself away
He quickly looks to see if Oveur is listening
Oveur is busy checking instruments
Murdock grabs Joey by the collar and whispers angrily
Listen, kid, 've been hearing that crap ever since  was at
Tell your old man to drag Unseld and Lanier up and down the court for forty-eight minutes
(into mike) Ah
Denver Control, this is Flight two- zero-niner continuing on a heading two- niner-niner
niner, ah
niner

- Elaine is seated next to Striker
Elaine, just hear me out
know things haven't been right for a long time
But it will be different
like it was in the beginning
Remember
remember everything
All  have are memories
Soft  begins
Mostly  remember
the nights when we were together
remember how you used to hold me
and how  used to sit on your face and wriggle
and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up
When it did, it was almost like
like each new day was created
only for us
That's the way 've always wanted it to be, Elaine
But it won't be
Not as long as you insist on living in the past
Elaine leaves, teary-eyed

Isn't that good news

Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid

Finally, everyone is smiling sweetly at each other
- Murdock and Oveur smile sweetly at each other

In the silence  listened to the voices inside me, and they told me again and again

connection tube from Lisa's arm
The

No one else notices
'And it flows through you, and it flows through me
There is only one people, we are one and the same

Davis on the head
& 'We are all one spirit on Earth, one name
' - &  (v
o
) 'We are the Father, we are the son, and in the Dawn of Creation we are one
' - Elaine enters with dinners
Hey, we've been waiting for you
little bit late tonight
Who wants to be first
Go ahead, Clarence,  got it
Oveur removes his headset, Elaine puts tray down
How's the weather
Not so good
We've got some heavy stuff ahead of us
It might get rough again unless we can climb on top
But our airspeed is holding steady at six hundred ten knots
That's great
By the way, Joey Hammen asked me if you would autograph this basketball
Murdock autographs it reluctantly
- , dressed in World War  uniform, is now seated next to Striker
After the war,  just wanted to get as far away from things as possible
So Elaine and  joined the Peace Corps
We were assigned to an isolated tribe, the Molombos
: - Striker and Elaine are being escorted to the chief's hut by two
We hear Jungle Animal
The chief is standing in front of his hut surrounded by several who are making the jungle animal sounds
(v
o
) They had never seen Americans before
When Striker and Elaine arrive, the  holds up his hands and the sounds stop
(v
o
) At first, they didn't know what to think of us; but soon we gained their trust
The Chief extends his right hand for conventional handshake
Striker shows him power grip
When the Chief is pleased, Striker gives him five
The Chief pauses then decks Striker
(v
o
) It really was a challenge during the year introducing them to our Western culture
: -   - Elaine is having a Supperware party for native women
Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar
This two quart "Seals--Rite" container with a special "Close--Tite" lid keeps hotdog buns fresh for days and prevents sugared cereals from sticking
She scoops a ladle of corn mush from a carved wooden bowl into a Supperware container
Meat and dairy products are protected against unwanted refrigerator odors when sealed in this non-slip pastel colored "Freez-o-leer"
When she burps the lid, the Supperware makes a human burp -   - Striker nailing crude basketball rim and net to tree
(v
o
) You must understand that these people had been completely isolated from civilization
Striker demonstrates a two-handed set shot to natives
He misses
(v
o
) No one had ever outlined a physical fitness program for them and they had no athletic equipment
Native examines basketball for first time
After two slow dribbles, he gracefully feints lefts, then, dribbling through his legs, sinks a two-hand, over-the-head, reverse dunk shot
(v
o
) We also emphasized nutrition and taught them to watch their diets
Another native hits a long jump shot
(v
o
) The exercise improved their physical fitness and condition
One shot after another swishes through the basketball rim
(v
o
) My working with them seemed to reinforce our objectives of group cooperation and controlled-competitive activity
Striker approaches Elaine who is standing on the sideline
As they talk, the natives are passing the ball around and shooting baskets Harlem Globetrotter fashion
think they're getting the hang of it
When we re-enlist 'll teach them baseball
Ted,  don't want to stay here
It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war
lot of people made plans before the war
Like George Zipp
Elaine walks away, dejectedly
with Striker as he pours Gator-Ade into a glass
(v
o
) guess it was at that moment that  first realized Elaine had doubts about our relationship
And that as much as anything else led to my drinking problem
Striker has a problem drinking
He raises his glass of Gator-Ade, then suddenly pours it on his forehead
: - We did come back to the States
tried a number of jobs
Well,  could go on for hours, but 'd probably start to bore you
The Japanese General is kneeling on the seat committing Hari Kari
You know,  really couldn't blame Elaine
She wanted a career
was offered a job at Boeing but  couldn't bring myself to take it
- The businessman waiting in Striker's cab checks his watch
- and lightning
- Shirley is ill and holding her stomach in pain
Oh,  can't stand it
What is it
Elaine approaches
Yes
My, stomach
haven't felt this awful since we saw that Lina Wertmuller film
'll see if  can find some Dramamine
Elaine exits
-   - Elaine is on the phone
Captain, one of the women passengers is very sick
- Joey enters to retrieve basketball
Murdock is wearing goggles
Airsick
think so, but 've never seen it so acute
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can
Oveur hangs up phone
Joey, have you ever been in a Turkish prison
-   - (nauseous) Oooh,  shouldn't have had that second cup of coffee
He grabs for motion sickness bag
to  of Mrs
Hammen
'  (v
o
) Jim never vomits at home
and lightning
- Elaine is speaking to couple
'm sorry  had to wake you
'm just looking for a doctor
There's nothing to worry about
Middle-aged lady,
, having overheard this conversation, beckons to Elaine
Stewardess,  think the man next to me is a doctor
The  next to her is wearing a surgical cap with mask
Hanging around his neck is a stethoscope
He's sleeping
Sir
Excuse me, sir
'm sorry to have to wake you
Are you a doctor
That's right
We have some passengers who are very sick
Could you come and take a look at them
Yes
Yes, of course
Rumack picks up bag and exits with Elaine
-   - Rumack and Elaine enter
Rumack stoops over to Shirley, and surgical instrument is slapped into his hand from o
s
He pokes her stomach with his hand
Pain there
She winces and nods
May  see your tongue, please
She sticks her tongue out
Rumack pulls on it until it is obviously too long
He continues to pull, and the tongue becomes multi-colored magician's scarves
Then he pulls out a bouquet of flowers followed by a white dove
'll be back in a minute
Rumack takes Elaine aside
You'd better tell the Captain
We've got to land as soon as we can
This woman has to be gotten to a hospital
hospital
What is it
It's a big building with patients
But that's not important right now
Tell the Captain  must speak to him
Certainly
-    - - (into mike) Thank you, Omaha
Two-zero-niner out
(to Basta) Victor, we're running into a heavy storm, can you
Oveur turns to see Basta slumped over the console
Dramatic
Victor
Roger, take over
Oveur lifts Basta onto ground
- and lightning
- Murdock, flying the plane alone, wipes his brow and appears ill
-    - Captain, how soon can we land
can't tell
You can tell me
'm a doctor
No
mean 'm just not sure
Can't you take a guess
Well
not for another two hours
You can't take a guess for another two hours
No,  mean we can't land for another two hours
Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains
We've got to go through to Chicago
Suddenly, the plane rocks violently
Rumack and Oveur lose balance
- and lightning -- plane is flying erratically
- Murdock, unconscious, is slumped over controls
Oveur and Rumack burst into cockpit
Oveur gets into pilot's seat
Elaine enters
(excitedly) Get him out of there
- Altitude is fluctuating
- Oveur struggles with controls
They extricate Murdock from behind the wheel
He is wearing shorts, kneepads, and basketball shoes
- climbing and diving
- Passengers are being tossed about
woman, applying lipstick, smears it over her face
- -- cigarette with line slashed through, and couple copulating with line slashed through
- Randy loses her balance and shoves dinner into a passenger's face
-  - struggling with controls, finally regains level flight
- and lightning -- plane levels off
- The St
Christopher statue is holding a motion discomtort bag to its mouth
What is it, Doctor
What's happening
'm not sure
haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival
Rumack and Elaine are now standing face-to-face
Oveur, in the f
g
, is at controls
What was it we had for dinner tonight
Well, we had a choice
Steak or fish
Yes, yes,  remember
had lasagna
He points to Johnson
What did he have
He had fish
Randy enters cockpit
We have two more sick people, and the rest of the passengers are worried
'll take care of the passengers
Elaine, find out what the two sick people had for dinner
(into
) This is Captain Oveur speaking
- Passengers are listening to
(v
o
) It's been a little bumpy up here but we'll be past it in a few minutes
Randy and Elaine drag Murodck and Basta down center aisle
(v
o
) couple points of interest: we're just now passing over the Hoover Dam and later on, our course will take us just south of the Grand Canyon
- Meanwhile, relax and enjoy the rest of your flight
Okay
Okay
He hangs up phone and turns to Rumack
That should do it
- Absolute pandemonium
Passengers are yelling, screaming, tearing their hair out, climbing about
- (into microphone) Chicago, this is flight two-zero-niner
We're in trouble
'   -  -  - to reveal  typing Oveur's message
(v
o
) We've got to have all altitudes below us cleared and priority approach and landing in Chicago
Over
We read you
Stand by, two-zero-niner
When he tries to remove paper from typewriter, it rips in half
- and lightning
- Randy approaches Hammens
Mr
Hammen is sick
Yes
Oh, Stewardess
My husband is very sick
Can you do something, please
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment
One thing: do you know what he had for dinner
Yes, of course
We both had fish
Why
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about
We'll get back to you very quickly
She turns to walk toward  with horrified expression
- Elaine enters, turns to face Rumack
Oveur is at controls in f
g
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish
And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too
Let's see now
The co-pilot had fish
What did the navigator eat
He had fish, too
Oveur is picking up on the conversation
All right, now we know what we're up against
Every passenger on this plane who ate fish for dinner will become violently ill within the next half hour
Oveur looks down at his dinner tray and sees skeleton of the fish he just ate
Just how serious is it, doctor
Extremely serious
It starts with a slight fever
Oveur experiences what the doctor is describing
Then a dryness in the throat
As the virus penetrates the red blood cells the victim becomes dizzy and begins to experience a rash and itching
From there the poison works its way into the central nervous system causing severe muscle spasms, followed by the inevitable drooling
At this point, the entire digestive system is rendered useless, causing the complete collapse of the lower bowels, accompanied by uncontrollable flatulence
until finally the poor bastard is reduced to a quivering, wasted piece of jelly
Oveur passes out and pitches forward onto the controls
Rumack and Elaine lose balance as plane dives
- and lightning as plane is diving
- Passengers are being tossed about
woman, applying rouge, smears it all over her face
-   -  - wiggling
to braless woman whose breasts are wiggling
- As they finally untangle Oveur from the wheel, he gains semi-consciousness
(gasping) Turn

Oveur passes out
Uh, automatic pilot

There it is

- -'  - of rushing air as instantly inflatable balloon pilot takes shape in seat with hands on wheel
His uniform and cap are painted on, and he has an alert "leave the driving to us" expression on his face
The plane immediately regains level flight, and Elaine and Rumack sigh in relief
'll get back to the passengers
Rumack exits
McCROSKEY (v
o
) (over radio) Come in two-zero-niner
This is Chicago
Flight two-zero-niner, come in, please
Elaine picks up mike while still standing
This is Elaine Dickinson

Just hold on
We'll be back to you in a minute
to reveal dispatch is a beehive of activity
The Chief Dispatcher,  McCROSKEY, is barking orders to   #1
McCROSKEY Hold all takeoffs
don't want another plane in the air
When the 508 reports, bring it straight in
Air Controller #1 exits quickly
McCroskey picks up phone
McCROSKEY Put out a general bulletin to suspend all meal service on flights out of Los Angeles
He hangs up phone and talks to   #2
McCROSKEY Tell all dispatchers to remain at their posts
It's going to be a long night
Air Controller #2 exits
McCroskey notices he is out of coffee and turns to
McCROSKEY And how about some coffee, Johnny
No thanks
#3 enters
McCROSKEY want the weather on every landing field on this side of the Rockies, no matter what the size
Air Controller #3 exits
#4 enters
McCROSKEY Do you understand
Air Controller #4 exits
#5 enters
McCROSKEY Any place where there's a chance to land this plane
Air Controller #5 exits

McCROSKEY Stan, go upstairs to the tower and get a runway diagram
Terry, check down on the field for emergency equipment
Siamese Twins leave
In the b
g
we see them trying to walk in opposite directions
Air Controller #1 enters
#1 Chief, there's fog down to the deck everywhere east of the Rockies
There's no possible place they can land
They'll have to come through to Chicago
McCROSKEY Looks like  picked the wrong week to quit smoking
He lights up a cigarette
McCroskey walks toward a table and leans on his hands
McCROSKEY want the best available man on this man who knows this plane inside and out and won't crack under pressure
How about Sal Mineo
McCROSKEY Get me Rex Kramer
- Lightning and
- Elaine is in the pilot's seat and the inflated automatic pilot is in co-pilot's seat
McCROSKEY (v
o
) Now, Elaine, right next to the throttle is the air speed gauge
What speed does it indicate
Three hundred twenty miles per hour
- We see, but Elaine does not notice, the automatic pilot very slowly beginning to deflate
McCROSKEY (v
o
) Good
Now check your altitude
That's the dial just below and to the right of the air speed indicator
Thirty-five thousand feet
- Altitude is dropping
No, wait
Now it says thirty-four thousand feet
It's dropping
It's dropping fast
Why is it doing that
By now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is quite deflated
It is staring at her with a half smile
Elaine notices it
Oh, my God
The automatic pilot
It's deflating
McCROSKEY (v
o
) All right, Elaine, don't worry
We have an auxiliary inflation system
Just follow my instructions
Okay, but please hurry
We're dropping fast
- Passengers are being tossed about
Rumack is examining a female patient
What the hell's going on up there
Rumack starts toward cockpit
- McCROSKEY (v
o
) Now, Elaine, don't panic
On the belt line of the automatie pilot there is a hollow tube
Can you see that
Yes
Yes,  can see it
McCROSKEY (v
o
) Good
Now that's the manual inflation nozzle
Pull it out and blow it up like a balloon
Elaine kneels over automatic pilot's crotch, puts tube in her mouth and blows
Automatic pilot inflates
Rumack bursts into cockpit
' Back of automatic pilot with Elaine kneeling over its crotch

- with a big smile on its face
-   - Passengers are relieved as plane regains level flight
-    - Elaine and automatic pilot are relaxed in their seats
Both are smoking cigarettes
- and lightning
- Rumack enters
Elaine, you're a member of this crew
Can you face some unpleasant facts
No
All right
Unless  can get all these people to a hospital quickly,  can't even be sure of saving their lives
Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane
Well
- Striker, struggling with drinking problem, pours drink between his cheek and ear
- No
No one that  know of
think you ought to know what our chances are
The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner
into  of Elaine's face as she realizes the severity of the situation
- and lightning
- Passengers are listening to
(v
o
) Ladies and gentlemen, this is your stewardess speaking
We regret any inconvenience the sudden cabin movement might have caused
Randy drags unconscious pilot, Oveur, down center aisle
(v
o
) This is due to periodic air pockets we encounter
There is no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you enjoy the rest of your flight
By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane
Absolute pandemonium
Passengers are yelling, screaming, tearing their hair out and climbing around

Sister Mary is choking a Krishna
Two passengers are dueling with swords
Spanish-speaking lady waits for her husband to translate the announcement, then panics

Hello, 'm Paul Carey from the airline
'm here to pick up Captain Kramer
Oh, yes
Come in, Paul
Rex will be right out
'  - When Carey enters, a big dog jumps on him with its paws on his chest
Shep, sit
sit
So,  understand you've got a real emergency down there
(holding off dog) Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details
Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer
Something about a plane with no pilot
Carey begins to lose battle with the dog, while trying to remain polite
Yeah, something like that, but as  say, they didn't have time to tell me very much
Shep, no
'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there
Shep is growling and Carey's arm is locked firmly in his Jaws
Well
the airline business
does have
its moments
Shep pins Carey against the wall, ripping his sleeve
but after
awhile
you begin to
(gasp) get used to it
Shep, no
He gets so excited when new people are here
We hear a  and loud growling
Are you a pilot yourself

All right, let's get out of here

The Indian is dousing himself with a can of gasoline
In b

Randy is talking to passengers
In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep since just the day before the only one we had broke down -- it had a bad axle
The Indian lights a match to immolate himself
Randy approaches
Excuse me, sir
There's been a little problem in the cockpit and  was wondering
The cockpit
What is it
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit
But that's not important right now
The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio
Do you know anything about planes
The Indian holds the match, awaiting the outcome
Well,  flew in the war, but that was a long time ago
wouldn't know anything about it
Would you go up, please
He has a moment of indecision
The Indian encourages Striker with an adamant nod
Striker gets up to leave
The Indian, relieved, blows out the match

He pulls a flask from his coat pocket and takes a swig
She eyes him disapprovingly
Would ya like a little whiskey, ma'am
(insulted) Certainly not
She inserts a two inch straw in her nose and snorts a couple lines of cocaine off a piece of glass
- Striker enters
(to Rumack and Randy) The stewardess said
' Empty pilot's seat and inflated automatic pilot
Both pilots
Can you fly this airplane and land it
Surely you can't be serious
am serious, and don't call me Shirley
What flying experience have you had
Well,  flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines
It's an entirely different kind of flying
all together
/ (all together) It's an entirely different kind of flying
Besides,  haven't touched any kind of plane in six years
Mister Striker
know nothing about flying
All  know is this: you're the only person on this plane who can possibly fly it
You're the only chance we've got

McCROSKEY We'll need a pre-landing flight check
Tell 'em 'm in the dispatch office and want it here fast

want the dog fed, the yard watered, and the gate locked
And get a note to the milkman -- no more cheese
He slams dowm the phone
He leans his hands on the desk
McCROSKEY Where the hell is Kramer
On the wall behind him there is a picture of McCroskey leaning his hands on a desk
- Kramer and a mutilated Carey are en route to airport
Kramer is at the wheel
Through rear window is obvious of passing road
(into phone) No, we can't do that; the risk of a flameout is too great
Keep him 24,000
No, feet
He hangs up phone
One of the passengers is going to land that plane
Is that possible
Possible, but it's a hundred to one shot
Thousand to one
know this guy
You do
Who is it
We hear
shows he has run oyer a bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger
His name is Ted Striker
flew with him during the war
And that won't make my job any easier tonight
to obvious
Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up to a point
But he was one of those men who, well, let's just say he felt too much inside
Maybe you know the kind
Now   indicates car is turning and then weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel
It takes a certain type to perform under pressure
Striker didn't have it
By now   is cowboys and Indians on horseback chasing and shooting at Kramer's car
Ate his heart out over every name on the casualty lists
The upshot of it is that he went all to pieces on one particular mission
Let's just hope it doesn't happen again tonight
- and lightning
- Striker is in pilot's seat
Rumack is standing behind him
Let's see, altitude twenty-four thousand feet, level flight, air speed four hundred sixty knots, course zero niner zero, trim, mixture, landing gear, balance
Elaine enters
Ted
What are you doing
You can't fly this plane
That's what 've been trying to tell these people
Elaine,  haven't time to put this gently, so 'll be very direct
Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation
Mister Striker is the only hope we've got
Let's see
Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights
He flips a switch
The plane dives
- The plane is diving

He is jolted back and forth against the walls

McCROSKEY (surprised) Mayday

It's the Russian New Year
We'll have a parade
They'll serve hot hors d'oeuvres

- Level flight
- McCROSKEY (v

Yeah,  was just trying out the landing lights
Elaine and Rumack exchange glances
- 've got to get out of here
can't stand it
've got to get out of here
Randy pushes up and shakes Mrs
Hammen by the shoulders
Calm down
Get hold of yourself
Stewardess, let me handle this
Randy leaves, Jack shakes Mrs
Hammen by the shoulders
Get hold of yourself
Get hold of yourself
(to Jack) Get back to your seat; 'll take care of this
Jack leaves; Rumack shakes Mrs
Hammen by the shoulders
Calm down
Calm down
Get hold of yourself
Sister Angelina taps Rumack on the shoulder
(to Rumack) Doctor, you're wanted on the phone
Sister Angelina starts shaking Mrs

He'll be a menace to himself and everything else in the air
(he pauses to listen) Yes, birds too
Kramer enters, picks up clipboard, and reads it
McCROSKEY (into phone) Okay, okay
He's a terrible risk, but what other choice have we got
McCroskey hangs up phone
McCROSKEY Well, that's the whole story, Rex, everything we know
All right, Steve, let's face a few facts
Kramer whips off his sunglasses
Underneath is another pair of sunglasses
As you know,  flew with this man, Striker, during the war
He'll have enough on his mind without remembering those days when -- well, when things weren't so good
McCROSKEY Well, right now things aren't so good
And while we're talking there are a hundred and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a decision
Let me tell you something, Steve
Striker was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long time ago
spear slams into the wall behind Kramer
but my feeling is that when the going gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's gonna fold up
McCROSKEY Look, Rex --  want you to get on the horn and talk this guy down
You're going to have to let him get the feel of this airplane on the way; you'll have to talk him onto the approach; and so help me, you'll have to talk him right down to the ground
watermelon falls from   , splattering on the table
Very well then
Put Striker on the speaker
McCROSKEY Okay, you can use the radio over there
Looks like  picked the wrong week to quit drinking
He pulls a flask trom the drawer and takes a swig
- Kramer at dispatch radio
He picks up mike
Striker, Striker, this is Captain Rex Kramer speaking
McCroskey joins Kramer at dispatch radio
- as we see Striker's ominous look of recognition
(dramatically) Yes, Captain Kramer
Read you loud and clear
- Kramer sits at the mike
An Air Controller is standing next to him, but only his mid-section is in
All right
It's obvious you remember me
The Air Controller is scratching his behind
So what do you say you and  just forget about everything except what we have to do now
The Air Controller is now scratching his crotch
You and  are going to bring this plane in together
The Air Controller's hand is now inside his pants straightening out his underwear
Before we start, 'd like to say something
know that right now things must look pretty rough up there
The Air Controller is now hopping around with both hands inside his pants
But if you do what  tell you, when  tell you to do it, there's no reason you can't bring that plane in
- Let's not kid each other, Kramer
You know 've never flown a bucket like this
'm going to need all the luck there is
- Stand by, Striker
(to McCroskey) The one hope we have is to build this man up
've got to give him all the confidence  can
(into microphone) All right, Striker, have you ever flown a multi-engine plane before
(v
o
) No
Never
Shit
- Striker over hears conversation on radio
(v
o
) This is a goddamn waste of time
There's no way he can land this plane
Route 'em into Lake Michigan and at least avoid killing innocent people
- McCROSKEY Grab hold of yourself
You've got to talk them down
You're the only chance they've got
Kramer lights cigarette
(into mike) All right, Striker, now you listen to me and you listen close
Flying is no different than riding a bicycle
it just happens to be a lot harder to put baseball cards in the spokes
Now, if you just follow my instructions
- Two vultures are sitting on back of Striker's seat
(v
o
) there's no reason why you shouldn't have complete confidence in your chances to come out of this thing alive and in one piece
- First,  want you to familiarize yourself with the controls
Later we'll run through the landing procedure
Kramer takes a last drag on his cigarette and tosses it out the window
McCroskey plugs his ears with his fingers and ducks as though Kramer had thrown a grenade
There is an All right
Now 'd like you to disengage the automatic pilot
But watch any violent movement of the controls, like you used to make in Spitfires and Phantoms
- (into microphone) Okay, 'm going to unlock the automatic pilot
Striker switches off automatic pilot button
Automatic pilot shoots upward out of the seat
Elaine is thrown to the floor
Striker struggles desperately to control the plane
- flying erratically
- (v
o
) (matter of factly) Just remember, the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter
Striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is drifting in his way
Finally, he throws the autopilot to the rear of the cockpit
(v
o
) Don't worry about that
It's perfectly normal
You must watch your airspeed closely
Don't let it fall below 520
Both your rudder pedals and elevator trim will have additional play due to increased drag, but you can compensate by lowering manifold pressure below 154
Now there's one other thing
Have you someone up there who can work the radio and leave you free for flying
Yes
The stewardess is here with me
Elaine rises
The autopilot is on her back, its hands clinging to her breasts
She removes it and seats it at engineer's console
(v
o
) Have her take the co-pilot's seat
Elaine takes her seat as Striker regains control of the plane
He hands Elaine the mike
The radio's all yours now
And keep an eye on that number three engine
It's running a little hot
- is blinking
- (v
o
) Striker, what kind of weather are you in up there
(into microphone) Rain
And a little ice
And a little ice
(v
o
) How's it handling
Sluggish
Like a wet sponge
(into microphone) Sluggish
Like a wet sponge
(v
o
) (patronizing) All right, Striker, you're doing just fine
(to Elaine) It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much  hate his guts
(into microphone) It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts

Oooooooh
Randy approaches

Oh, stewardess,  can speak jive
He said he's in great pain and wants to know if you can help him

Randy exits

Oh Jack, 'm so warm

He reaches up and opens the overhead air nozzle
Air rushes out with hurricane force
As Jack struggles to turn off nozzle, Shirley is blown about, an adjacent passenger's papers go flying from a briefcase, a Hari Krishna's toga flies up revealing polka dot boxer shorts
An extra's toupe flies off
- After my wife died,  felt like a fifth wheel
You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair
When Ethel passed away,  was lost
couldn't function socially and couldn't function in business
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to
But  think it's time we stopped talking about me
woman like you -- why haven't you ever married
Well, 'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer
know the answer -- Career
smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage
wish  could fool myself into believing that that's the reason
The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy
and we don't even know each other's names
full names mean
Mine's Eleanor
Eleanor Schiff
That's a lovely name
Mine's Milton
Milt Ettenhenim
But my friends call me 'Bubbles

Schiff
Would you care for a soft drink

Randy hands a large bottle of Coca Cola wrapped in a baby blanket to Ms
Schiff, who cradles it in her arms
Ooooh, such a nice soft drink

(v

) National Weather Service reporting Omaha fogged in
Visibility zero
The Dispatcher attempts to remove the message, but it is stuck in the cartridge
He yanks on it, but the paper stretches out like rubber
The scene now becomes like a cartoon
He lodges his feet against the typewriter and pulls until the paper stretches to his face
He grumbles in Donald Duck voice
The typewriter snaps back and hits him
- McCROSKEY (to Air Controller #2) Macias, get me Captain Oveur's wife on the phone
We'd better let her know what's going on
Air Controller #1 rushes in holding a piece of paper and hands it to McCroskey
#1 Steve, this weather bulletin just came off the wire
McCroskey frowns and hands it to Hinshaw
McCROSKEY Johnny, what can you make out of this
This
Why,  could make a hat or a broach
McCroskey grabs the note from him

Ed) Did you finish
Was  good
Oh, you're all so concerned about performance

Would you care for another drink
No, thank you, 'm still nursing this one
She is bottle feeding the Coke bottle

- (to Rumack) What's going on
We have a right to know the truth
(to passengers) All right
'm going to level with you
The most important thing now is that you should all be calm, because there's no reason to panic
Rumack's nose elongates slightly
Now, it is true that one of the flight crew has been taken ill
slightly ill
His nose is getting longer
But the other two pilots are just fine and at the controls flying the plane
Rumack's nose is a foot long
The weather in Chicago is clear as a bell, and there's no reason that we won't land on schedule
Passengers listening
His nose grows

Air Controller #2 enters and hands McCroskey a note
Hands holding microphones are thrust   in front of McCroskey
One hand is holding an ice cream cone

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy
As he starts toward the door, the room caves in on him
- McCroskey and Kramer are at watercooler
McCroskey is filling cup while Kramer drinks
McCROSKEY Rex, 've decided that the best thing to do is to foam the runway -- let him do a wheels-up landing
It'd be a lot simpler
Kramer throws cup into wastebasket
McCroskey drinks
(filling up another cup) No, the risk of fire is too great
If she starts burning, you write off all those people who can't get out of there on their own power
McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket
Kramer drinks
McCROSKEY (filling up another cup) Well that's better than writing them all off
Are you going to play God with a hundred and 38 lives
Kramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks
(filling up another cup) No
belly landing isn't all that simple
It takes a good pilot to keep from smearin' himself all over the runway
McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket as Kramer drinks
McCROSKEY (filling up another cup) If Striker has the guts to try this, he deserves the best shot we can give him
We've gotta foam that runway
Kramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks

've seen foam tear a man's guts out

The cockpit shakes
Engine number three is flaming out

What happened, Ted
What went wrong
Oil pressure
forgot to check the oil pressure
When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan
-  -  - The shit hits it
to include: told him to watch that oil temperature
What the hell's he doing up there
He picks up the mike
Striker, that plane can't land itself
It takes a pilot who can handle pressure
McCROSKEY Ease up, Rex
He hasn't flown for years
It's not his fault
It could happen to any pilot
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck
- He's right
can't take the pressure was crazy to think  could land this plane
But Ted, you're the only
don't care
just don't have what it takes
They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before
As Striker leaves he puts autopilot into pilot's seat
Elaine is on the verge of tears

The fog's getting thicker
And Liz Taylor is getting larger

Maybe, if we hold them off for a bit we'll get a break in the weather
All right, but let's wait until they reach the control area

Striker fills a cup from drinking fountain then pours it on his head
He sits down dejectedly on stewardess' fold-out seat

Rumack sits
No
haven't a thing to say
You've done the best you could
You really have
The best you could
guess we can't expect to win 'em all
want to tell you something 've kept to myself for years
was in the war myself -- the Medical Corps
was on duty late one night when a badly wounded pilot was brought in from a raid
He could barely talk, but he looked at me and he said, "Doc
The odds were against us up there but we went in anyway, and 'm glad we did
The captain made the right decision
" The pilot's name was George Zipp
Striker looks up
Notre Dame Fight Song is heard in b
g
George Zipp said that
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper
don't know where 'll be then, Doc," he said, "but  won't smell too good
That's for sure
" (rejuvinated) Excuse me, Doc, 've got a plane to land
Striker boldly starts toward cockpit

Elaine, unaware of his return, is listening to Kramer on the radio

Listen to me, Kramer
Doctor Rumack says the sick people are in critical condition and every minute counts
We've got to land now

You know what a landing like this means
You more than anybody
'm ordering you to stay up there
No dice, Chicago
'm giving the orders, and we're coming in
guess the foot's on the other hand now, isn't it, Kramer
- McCROSKEY He'll never bring it down in this soup
Never
Not one chance in a million

But it's his ship now, his command; he's in charge, he's the boss, the head man, the top dog, the big cheese, the head honcho
Air Controller #2 rushes up to McCroskey and Kramer, carrying a newspaper
#2 Chief, look at this
Kramer grabs newspaper

Gunderson
Yes, Captain
Did you decide on a runway yet
Runway niner
It's the longest, and directly into the wind

- woman, applying facial makeup, smears it all over her face
He's all over the place
Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet
What an asshole
- Watch your altitude, Striker
It's too erratic
You can't come straight in
You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying
You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather
Striker reaches for microphone
'll take it, Elaine
(into mike) Listen, Kramer, 'm coming in
Do you hear me
'm coming in right now
We have people up here who will die in less than an hour, never mind two
may bend your precious airplane, but 'll get it down
Now get on with the landing check

No

Just in case  don't have a chance to say goodbye,  want you to know that  haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years
That's a very nice compliment, and 'd like to say that
you've done the same for me

Rumack pokes his head in the door

There's a slight crosswind from the right, so be ready for it
Mrs
Oveur is clutching Kramer's arm with both hands
If you land too fast, use your emergency brakes
The red handle is right in front of you
Now Mrs
Oveur, still watching the sky, has both arms around Kramer's waist, massaging his chest with her hands
If that doesn't stop you
Kramer is suddenly aware of what Mrs
Oveur is doing
He gives her a look and she removes her hands
