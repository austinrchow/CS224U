modern apartment, all cool and glass
is preparing breakfast, laying the table for two
He is 51, dark- haired, saturnine
He is doing everything with deliberate quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom to check he's not making too much noise
He is boiling an egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a sparkling clean plate
puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can, turns on the tap to run water
The bedroom door opens, and comes out, naked
She's attractive, younger
The credits end
You didn't wake me
You were sleeping
You let me sleep because you can't bear to have breakfast with me
It's half-serious
doesn't react
Nothing could be further from the truth

'd hardly have boiled you an egg if  didn't want to see you
Tea or coffee

She's still half-serious
Does any woman ever stay long enough to find out what the hell goes on in your head
smiles to himself
What are you doing tonight

'm seeing my daughter
Your daughter
You've kept very quiet about her
Have
She's been abroad for a year
Did you say tea

She reappears with a bucket of water to sluice down the pavement
She wipes his face down with a wet cloth
Then she fills another bucket

sunny day in March
's bed has been moved beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun
He is sitting up, working on his stamp collection
is moving round behind him, tidying the room
How are you feeling
Better
By the way,  meant to tell you, the day  got ill

She helped you
Yes
She brought me home
Do you have her address
is standing holding a small bunch of flowers
He is looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only
The woodyard is busy
come out of the building
& comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay - green linoleum and faded red paint
The sound of a sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment
Inside,  is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red flowers
Her hair is fastened in a clip
She looks at him a moment
Come in
6
' The flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs
There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the room
carries on ironing
brought you these flowers
To say thank you
Put them down there
puts them beside the sink
has a blanket and a cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and puts it over one of the chairs
would have come earlier, but 've been in bed for three months
You're better now
Thank you
Have you always been weak
Oh no
'd never been ill before
It's incredibly boring
There's nothing to do
couldn't even be bothered to read
carries on ironing
He is becoming as comfortable with the silence as she is
She starts ironing a pair of knickers
He watches her bare arms moving back and forth
She looks broad-planed, strong
She is at peace with being watched
She puts one pair of knickers down, then does another
Then she upends the iron
have to go to work
'll walk with you
Wait in the hall while change
goes out into the hall
The kitchen door is slightly open
takes off her smock and stands in a green slip
Her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair
7
She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and knee, then attaches it to her suspender
She reaches for the other
The flesh is bare between her legs
watches, riveted
seems oblivious
But as she is about to put the second stocking on, she looks at him
She drops her dress, and straightens, holding her stare
In response, he blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat
The door slams
runs down the stairs in terror and shame, and out the front door
The  look up, curious, as  flies by, slamming the outer door
is lying in bed
He looks up at the sound of a tram going by outside
The tram making its way along the quiet street
gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed
, reading a book, watches unobserved, fascinated as collects tickets
She calls out the name of the next stop
She doesn't see him as she works
is standing on the other side   of the street from ' courtyard
He is in two minds   about whether to go in
The  are loading a van
He   waits for them to finish before he slips in through the   archway, making his way to the stairs
' is sitting on the steps of the first landing
Then, as if from nowhere,  is suddenly standing behind him, in uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the other
She looks tired but not surprised to see him
8
There are two more buckets downstairs
You can fill them and bring them up
walks straight past him
For a moment he tenses as if there might be some contact
But she goes by
opens the door
He turns on a dim light
There is a flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke, poured in from the street
He goes down to the bottom, and picks up a bucket
He digs in to the coke, and at once it comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust
' is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk
She has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie
comes in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy
She roars with laughter, full-throated
You look ridiculous, look at you, kid
sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen
You can't go home like that
Give me your clothes, 'll run you a bath
opens the tap
There's a boiler, and steaming hot water comes out
takes off his sweater, then stops
What, do you always take a bath in your trousers
takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door
He undresses
She puts his sweater on the balcony rail
It's all right,  won't look
On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him
is naked
takes his clothes from the chair
He gets into the bath
She goes to the balcony
In the bath, he submerges himself
goes out and shakes his clothes out in the open air
9
When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his clothes back on the chair
She picks up the shampoo and hands it to him
Wash your hair, 'll get you a towel
washes his hair, then submerges again
When he comes back up,  is holding out a large towel
He gets out, turning away to hide his erection
From behind, she wraps his body and rubs him dry
Then she lets the towel fall
She puts her body against his back, and he realises she's naked
He turns and faces her
So
That's why you came back
looks at her, awed
You're so incredibly beautiful
Now, kid, you know that's not true
At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss goes down onto the floor,  on top of him
All the time, she's staring into his eyes
He can't take it
He closes his eyes and, about to come, begins to scream
She puts her hand over his mouth to smother the noise
The family is half-way through their meal
is sitting watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with
You've inconvenienced your mother
How many more times
've said 'm sorry
You scared her
It's hardly my fault,  got lost, that's all
That's why  was late
Can  have some more
He reaches for more stew
goes on eating, a look of contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this
10
How can anyone get lost in their own home town
The doctor told me  had to take walks
So
meant to head for the castle, ended up at the sports-field
They're in opposite directions
It's none of your business
He's lying
He's not lying
Michael never lies
smiles benignly
knows she's right
They all eat on for a few moments
Dad, 've decided,  want to go back to school tomorrow
The doctor says you need another three weeks
Well 'm going
Peter
If he wants to go back, then he must
can't breathe, as if some decisive moment in his life has been reached
is looking at him, seeming to know what's going on

The whole  is coming out, but  is first, in a desperate hurry, waving goodbye to his friends and running quickly away
& comes quickly up the stairs
The door of ' apartment is ajar
He pushes it open

He drops his trousers and lifts her onto the sink
He comes in about twenty seconds
He stands sweating
All right, kid, it's not just about you
' They are on the bed
He is lying underneath her
leads his hands to her face, then down her body
She begins to move, and in response, he moves too
He watches awed as she comes
' has fallen asleep on ' chest
He is awake, looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder
The sound of the wood yard below
He kisses the birthmark
She stirs
What's your name
She opens her eyes
look of suspicion

Your name
Why do you want to know

You haven't told me your name

Next to him, his friend
Across the way,
The notion of secrecy is central to Western literature
You may say the whole idea of character in fiction is defined by people holding specific information which for various reasons - sometimes perverse, sometimes noble - they are determined not to disclose

The bell goes
The  come pouring out cheerfully into the corridor and head to the next classroom

He starts to read
"Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy

Why should be
welcome obstacles, because they'll be like mountains  can fly over to be in your arms
The more suffer, the more 'll love
& Seen from outside, a shop full of stamps
and a with white hair and a moustache
is offering his pyramid stamp, his gestures becoming desperate as the shakes his head, clearly not giving him as much as he hopes
22
Then  concedes, the  concedes, and a bunch of notes are handed across
runs exhilarated out into the street
' "Danger will only increase my love, it will sharpen it, it will give it spice
'll be the only angel you need
On this arm, Luise, you will go dancing through life

He gets into his black Mercedes

He lies down on the bed

Just his head, like a seal's, at one end, just out of the water, quite still

The sun slants, and for a few seconds the water dazzles
He slips his head under

Mr Berg
It is eight o'clock
Your daughter
Thank you
He gets up

She is a sympathetic young woman of around 23 approaches
When she sees him, she gets up

Julia
They're uneasy
She looks a moment, then they sit down
Welcome back
Later
They have eaten
They both have big glasses of red wine
It's more relaxed
So how will you decide
don't know
'm happy back in Berlin,  suppose
You've seen your mother

There was nothing more to it
It was Paris, but it could have been anywhere
Away from your parents

It's silly isn't it
It is silly
Thank you for dinner

Good night, Dad

Tomorrow, maybe

Those of you for the special seminar group on The Legal System in the Third Reich, please stay on in this room
Professor Rohl will be here in a moment
Nearly all the  leave, talking among themselves
Just eight are left, dotted around the huge room

There is a lull
looks round at the group of oddballs, then finds , distinguished, greying, is already in front of them
Well, we seem to be quite a small group
small group and a select one
Clearly, this is going to be a unique seminar
Let me start by thanking those of you who've chosen to take part
Good for you reading list, gentlemen

The door of his extremely modest student digs is open

He looks up
So this is where you are
Yes
Come in
But neither of them move
just smiles from the door
You take work seriously
Oh  don't know
You're rather a serious boy
shrugs slightly
It's how  was brought up
What about you
Are you serious
You're sure you want to work tonight
Well  do
But  won't work every night

The defendants, please
From being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent
The first thing 'm going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants' lawyers

Hanna Schmitz
There is a row of six
The fifth woman is , her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle distance, not looking towards the
She is wearing a grey dress with short sleeves
They all sit, sideways to the gallery

The words seem to come very quietly, across a great distance
Your name is Hanna Schmitz
Yes
It is only when the  repeats the name that  looks up, hearing it for the first time
Can you speak louder please
My name is Hanna Schmitz

Thank you
You were born on October 21st, 1922

Yes
At Hermannstadt
And you're now 43 years old
Yes
You joined the  in 1943
Yes
What was your reason
What was your reason for joining

You were working at the Siemens factory at the time
Yes
You'd recently been offered a promotion
Why did you prefer to join the

But the  forestalls him
'll re-phrase my question
'm trying to ascertain if she joined the  freely
Of her own free will
Everyone waits
Well
heard there were jobs
Go on
39
was working at Siemens when heard the  was recruiting
Did you know the kind of work you'd be expected to do
They were looking for guards applied for a job

And you worked first at Auschwitz
Yes
Until 1944
Then you were moved to a smaller camp near Cracow
Yes

Are you
'm fine
You then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches

moves to sit opposite him
So what did you think
40
don't know
It wasn't quite what expecting
Wasn't it
In what way
What were you expecting
is looking at him
doesn't answer
thought it was exciting
Exciting
Yes
Why
Why did you think it exciting
Because it's justice
The train hurtles through the German countryside
student party, in a candle-lit room
is singing to a guitar
It's been going on for hours - the  are on the floor with beer and cigarettes
The front door is open
, beer in hand, looks out to the balcony where he can see  bent away from them, all by himself
, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out into the night
His eye lands on a student room in which a couple are making love
The small   is now rattling around informally in the big lecture room
need to correct an impression
Dieter said yesterday this was about justice
But is it
() 41
(cont'd) If it were about justice you might ask why has it taken so long
The war ended twenty years ago
Remember, there've been no significant trials between Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz trials a couple of years ago
That's a long gap
What's the reason for the gap
waits a moment for a  to answer
'd have thought it was obvious
Say
Cowardice
It's cowardice, isn't it
It's bad conscience
It's the big cover-up
Go on
After the war
The German people didn't want to look at what they'd done
Is that right
Because they had too much to hide
All our parents are liars
All right, mine are
So it's left to us, isn't it
How so
Because we're not implicated
Aren't you
Good
So that's all right then
Everyone laughs
42
No, but seriously, Dieter's right
My parents,  can't even talk to them
don't love them
How could How could anyone love them
Because they've told themselves so many lies, they can't remember the truth, let alone admit it
Isn't that why we signed up for this seminar
don't know
You tell me
Speaking for myself
Michael
'm not sure any more
is staring at him thoughtfully
What did your father do, Dieter
If you want to know, he was in the Waffen
There are some smiles, but  rides over the reaction
That's what  mean, that's what 'm saying
So were a million other Germans
That's exactly my point
That's why it's better not to pretend this is about justice
Forgive me, nor is it about getting into an emotional state
It has no purpose if it's just the young giving their parents a bad time
There's a silence
That's clearly why some of them are there
So what is it about
What do you think
43
Societies think they operate by something called morality
But they don't
They operate by something called law
You're not guilty of anything merely by working at Auschwitz
8,000 people worked at Auschwitz
Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 for murder
To prove murder you have to prove intent
That's the law
Remember, the question is never `Was it wrong
' but `Was it legal
' And not by our laws, no, by the laws at the time
frowns, unhappy
But isn't that
What
Narrow
Yes
The law is narrow
looks unapologetic
On the other hand,  suspect people who kill other people tend to be aware that it's wrong
is leaning forward, attentive
is standing, opposite the , who holds up a book called  & :
Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with this book
Yes
Parts of it have already been read out in court
() 44
(cont'd) It's an American publication, which has been translated
It's by a survivor, a prisoner who survived, Ilana Mather
Yes  know
know Ilana Mather
She was in the camp, wasn't she, when she was a child
She was with her mother
The judge waits
seems arrogant, defiant
In the book, she describes a selection process
At the end of the month's labour, every month, sixty inmates were selected
They were picked out to be sent from the satellite camp back to Auschwitz
That's right, isn't it
Yes, it's right
And so far, each of your fellow defendants has specifically denied being part of that process
Now 'm going to ask you
Were you part of it
Yes
There is a stir among the other  and in the court
They start talking to their
So you helped make the selection
Yes
You admit that
Then tell me, how did that selection happen
shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious
45
There were six guards, so we decided we'd choose ten people each
That's how we did it - every month
We'd all choose ten
Are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process
We all did
Even though they've denied it
But you admit it
You're saying you took part in the process
The other  stir with animosity, but the  is intent, following his own line
Did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths
He waits
nods slightly
Yes but there were new arrivals, new women were arriving all the time, so of course we had to move some of the old ones on
'm not sure you understand
We couldn't keep everyone
There wasn't room
The  frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem to understand his point
No, but what 'm saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying `You you and you have to be sent back to be killed
' 46
Well, what would you have done
is looking at the  - a perfectly straight question
smiles slightly, proud of her
Everyone in the court waits for the  to answer
Silence
is impassive
But  follows her own thoughts
She quietly asks herself a question
So should  never have signed up at Siemens
is alone, smoking
On a bench, side by side, are two women
One is very small, dark, in her sixties
The other is composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties
and They look up, catching 's eye
Then a leans in to the younger woman
Ms
Mather, they're ready for you now
The two women go into the court
The door closes
& is alone in the now-deserted lobby, unwilling to go back
Then he goes to the door
He opens it a little
The sound of the trial
He opens the door fully
can see that it is  who is testifying
The court is conspicuously packed
Large black-and-white photographs of the labour camp now dominate the room
comes quietly into the back of the room as the trial goes on
has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near who is sitting in the body of the court
He looks across to the
, a large older woman, is one of a couple who isn't bothering to listen
In your book you describe the process of selection
Yes
You were made to work and then, when you were no longer any use to them, then they sent you back to Auschwitz to be killed
47
Are there people here today who made that selection
Yes
need you to identify them
Can you please point them out

watches, but does not react
Each of the guards would choose a certain number of women
Hanna Schmitz chose differently
In what way differently
She had favourites
Girls, mostly young
We all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep
In the evening, she asked them to join her
We all thought - well, you can imagine what we thought
stares back, impassive
watches
Then we found out - she was making these women read aloud to her
They were reading to her
At first we thought this guard, this guard is more sensitive, she's more human, she's kinder
Often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost
But then she dispatched them
Is that kinder
looks back, not apologizing
48
sits alone, head in hands, in despair
Now  is testifying
The court is quiet, focused
want to move on now to the march
As  understand it, you and your daughter were marched for many months
Yes
It was the winter of 1944
Our camp was closed down, we were told we had to move on
But the plan kept changing every day
Women were dying all around us in the snow
Half of us died on the march
My daughter says in the book, less a death march, more a death gallop
looks along the row to where  is now sitting
Please tell us about the night in the church
watches as  looks across to
stares back at her
watches the exchange as  nods, as if accepting she must go ahead and speak
That night we actually thought we were lucky because we had a roof over our heads
We'd arrived in a village, as always, the guards took the best quarters, they took the priest's house
But they let us sleep in a church
There was a bombing raid
In the middle of the night
At first we could only hear the fire, it was in the steeple
Then we could see burning beams, and they began to crash to the floor
Everyone rushed, rushed to the doors
But the doors had been locked on the outside
49
The church burned down
Nobody came to open the doors
Is that right
Nobody
Even though you were all burning to death
nods
How many people were killed
Everyone was killed
How did you survive
needed to get away from the other women
Because they were panicking, they were screaming
couldn't stand it
couldn't stand their screaming
was more frightened of the other women than  was of the fire
So  too my daughter and led her to the upper floor
can't defend what  did
It's impossible to defend
took Ilana in my arms and  led her towards the fire
There was a small gallery at the side of the church on the upper level
It saved our lives
The gallery didn't burn
turns, in tears, to look at
Thank you
want to thank you for coming to this country today to testify
The group is back in the big hall
But the atmosphere is grim
It's a while before  speaks
50
don't know
don't know what we're doing any more
Don't you
You keep telling us to think like lawyers, but there's something disgusting about this
is very still, like an analyst who is finally leading his patient to the heart of things
How so
This didn't happen to the Germans
It happened to the Jews
Everyone is shocked at his violent passion
What are we trying to do
We're trying to understand
Six women locked    three hundred Jews in a church, and    let them burn
What is there to    understand
Tell me, 'm asking :    what is there to understand
can't answer
gets up, outraged now
started out believing in this trial,  thought it was great, now think it's just a diversion
Yes
Diversion from what
You choose six women, you put them on trial, you say `They were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones'
Brilliant
() 51
(cont'd) Because one of the victims happened to write a book
That's why they're on trial and nobody else
Do you know how many camps there were in Europe
turns, furious
People go on about how much did everyone know
`Who knew
' `What did they know
' That isn't the question
The question is `How could you let it happen
' And - better - `Why didn't you kill yourself when you found out
' One of the group walks out
Thousands
That's how many
There were thousands of camps
Everyone knew
' passion is so great that everyone is shaken
Look at that woman
Which woman
The woman you're always staring at
'm sorry but you are

The atmosphere is electric

You know what 'd do

Inside one of the huts,  is by himself staring at a line of empty beds
He moves on, overwhelmed, lost
He passes through the showers
Then he comes to a room with vast metal cages on either side
In the cages, the countless dusty shoes of the exterminated

He walks past them
Then he stands beside them, his head down

He waits

Why did you not unlock the doors

Two of the victims are in this court
They deserve an answer

Here, this is the  report
You all have copies
There is a flurry of paperwork among the  and as they turn to their copies

This is the report which was written, approved and signed by all of you immediately after the event
In the written report, you all claim you didn't even know about the fire until after it happened
But that isn't true, is it
The  waits
Well
It isn't true
don't know what you're asking
The first thing 'm asking is, why didn't you unlock the doors
takes a look to the other
For the first time her poise is crumbling
Obviously
For the obvious reason
We couldn't
Why
Why couldn't you
We were guards
Our job was to guard the prisoners
We couldn't just let them escape
see
And if they escaped, then you'd be blamed, you'd be charged, you might even be executed
No
Well then
The  waits
If we opened the doors, then there would have been chaos
How could we have restored order
() 54
(cont'd) It happened so fast
It was snowing
The bombs - There were flames all over the village
Then the screaming began
It got worse and worse
And if they'd all come rushing out, we couldn't just let them escape
We couldn't
We were responsible for them
So you did know what was happening
You did know
You made a choice
You let them die rather than risk letting them escape
can't answer - she has no answer
The other defendants have made an allegation against you
Have you heard this allegation
does not reply
They say you were in charge
It isn't true
was just one of the guards
The other  interrupt to call out `She was in charge'
Did you write the report
No
No
We all discussed what to say
We all wrote it together
She wrote it
She wrote the report
She was in charge
Is that true
No
And  didn't write the report
Does it matter who did
has called out from her place
The  looks at  a moment
55
need to see a sample of your handwriting
My handwriting
Yes
need to establish who wrote the report
At once '  rises
' 'm sorry, but  really don't see how that's appropriate
Nearly twenty years have gone by
Somebody take her this piece of paper
' Are you really going to compare handwriting of twenty years ago, with handwriting of today
Give her the paper
Counsel, approach the bench

Her  moves to the bench
stares, first at her, then at the pen and paper, an apprehension rising in him
& thinks back, to  in her bedroom saying `No you read', to her looking puzzled at the menu on the bicycle trip, and to her throwing a book away in the apartment
At this moment,  realises she is illiterate
Back in the courtroom,  looks up to the  to stop the conference
There's no need

walks straight past him
You've been skipping seminars
comes into the room and sits down, smoking a cigarette
waits
So
looks at him
have a piece of information
Concerning one of the defendants
Something they're not admitting
What information
stubs out his cigarette
You don't need me to tell you
It's perfectly clear you have a moral obligation to disclose it to the court
It happens this information is favourable to the defendant
It can help her case
It may even affect the outcome, certainly the sentencing
So
There's a problem
The defendant herself is determined to keep this information secret
57
Two  come in for the seminar

Please
Chastened, they leave
What are her reasons
Because she's ashamed
Ashamed
Ashamed of what

Have you spoken to her
Of course not
Why of course not

Nobody is coming

She is working at her desk
He smiles and closes the door
You've taken your time

She starts to pull his clothes off
He lets her
He makes no move to undress her
She takes all his clothes off until he is naked, and she remains clothed
He looks at her a moment, then takes her in his arms and they go down on the bed

There is a small, inadequate mirror in which she checks her dress - a black suit, a white blouse and black tie
She looks very formal

The court finds guilty the defendants Rita Beckhart, Karolina Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela Zieber, Andrea Luhmann jointly aiding and abetting murder in three hundred cases
The court finds the defendant Hanna Schmitz guilty of murder in three hundred cases
There are tears in 's eyes as he watches
The court sentences the accused as follows
Rita Beckhart, Karolina Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela Zieber, and Andrea Luhmann, you will each serve a total sentence in prison of four years and three months

Hanna Schmitz, in view of your own admissions and your special role, you are in a different category
The court sentences the accused Schmitz to imprisonment for life

Gertrud and are getting a divorce

You didn't come for your father's funeral, but you come for this
You know, it's not easy for me to visit this town
Were you really so unhappy
That's not what 'm saying
It's not what  meant
Well then
looks at him hard
You mustn't worry about Gertrud
'm going to look after her

He runs his fingers along the spines, as  once did
He takes out a paperback of the Odyssey
He looks at it a moment, then he starts to read to himself
"Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy
He sits back
65
' is in her cell, folding her blanket
She is 53, a new austerity, a greyness about her
Her cell is modern, but without decoration
comes along the corridor, calling out `Mail'
She leans into Hanna's cell to tell her she has mail
is obviously surprised
reports to the mail room where she is given a big parcel, which she is told to open
Inside, a huge batch of casette tapes and a tape machine
is opening the box, taking out the tapes
' gets out a tape machine
In her cell  takes out the machine
' holds the microphone
Testing
Testing
1-2-3
puts a cassette into the machine
' The Odyssey by Homer
In panic, she turns it off
' presses the recording button and speaks into the machine

The Odyssey by Homer
"Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy
Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, Many pains he suffered, heartsick at the open sea, Fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home
' Later
is now walking up and down, in his shorts and -shirt, microphone in hand, still reading
"Ah, how shameless - the way these mortals blame the gods
From us alone, they say, come all their miseries
Middle of the night
is lying on his back, still reading
"Who are you
Where are you from
Your city
Your parents
'm wonderstruck - you drank my drugs, you're not bewitched
" takes a cassette and puts it into a white box
He writes on the side  6
Then he reaches up to put it on a shelf next to boxes separately marked  1,2,3,4,5
Then he takes out a small notebook and cross-references the new tape in a handwritten list
It's dark
is lying on the bed
' Zeus from the very start, the thunder king Has hated the race of Atreus with a vengeance - () 67
'  (cont'd) His trustiest weapon women's twisted wiles
smiles with pleasure at his reading
&
& montage of  reading and  listening
is reading different books
He is animated now, excited
There are extracts from The Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway) ; Anatol (Schnitzler) ; The World of Yesterday (Zweig) and Doctor Zhivago (Pasternak)
catching fire with excitement with what he is doing
collecting the tapes from the mail room and organizing on her shelves - her library growing
is lying in bed listening to a new tape
The Lady with the Little   Dog, by Anton Chekhov
"The talk   was that a new face had appeared on   the promenade, a lady with a   little dog
" is walking round with other , in sequence
Suddenly she stops dead, an idea hitting her
The library is right next to the mail room
walks past the mail room and goes to the library counter
want to take out a book
Which book
Do you have The Lady with the Little Dog
What's your name
Hanna Schmitz
68
The  goes to get it
stands, waiting and looks at the stacks of books, for the first time seeing possibility
is back in the cell
She puts down a new parcel and a book
She puts the parcel to one side, then opens the book
She then winds back the tape which is already in the recorder
' The Lady with the Little Dog, a story by Anton Chekhov
The talk was
She turns off the tape
She runs her finger along the title `The Lady with the Little Dog'
She gets down a small decorated metal tin, and takes a pencil from it
She starts making the sounds
`The', `the', `the'
, , , etc
is working now, circling the word `the' each time it comes in the book
The book is covered in marks
&
' 1981
is coming down a busy Kreuzberg street
He is 37
He goes into his block
He opens the door : the place is much more lived-in
He picks up his mail
Thumbing through it, he sees a letter in childish handwriting
frowns, opening it and taking out a piece of paper
' is holding a letter
He looks down at the writing : `Thanks for the latest, kid
really liked it
' He stares, then puts it down and steps back stunned
stands with a new package
She opens it excitedly
She takes out tapes
She looks for writing, a letter
There is none
She turns the packing paper over and over, but there's nothing
She stands, desolate
effortfully writing various letters - just a single message on each
The pen working agonizingly across the paper
First : 69
, Next: ' continuing to read to her on the machine
still writing
Then finally, many attempts at the same sentence, written many times : , ' is reading the latest letter from
He looks at it
"Do you receive my letters
Write to me, kid
" opens a drawer in a file box on the floor
There is a stack of her letters inside
He puts the latest on top of the pile and closes the drawer
stands at her window, in despair
' 1988
, 44, is at his desk, with the phone in his hand, with a typed letter in front of him
(  ) You're Michael Berg
' Yes
(  ) You got my letter
have it here
() As  say, Hanna Schmitz is coming up for release very soon
70
fingers the letter a moment
' is sitting at her desk in a simple, modern office
Hanna has been in prison for over twenty years
She has no family
She has no friends
You're her only contact
And 'm told you don't visit her
' is sitting quite still
No
don't
' When she gets out, she's going to need a job
She's going to need somewhere to live
You can't imagine how frightening the modern world will seem to her
There is a silence
Yes
'm still here
' have no-one else to ask
If you don't take responsibility for her, then Hanna has no future at all
It's kind of you
Thank you for letting me know
puts the phone down
He looks as if he has just been handed a sentence
He gets up and stares at the wall which is now stacked with all the books he has read
Then he goes to his balcony
&
' stands looking out over Berlin from his balcony
71
walks along the road by the prison wall, then goes to the guichet to sign in
is waiting in a small barred waiting area as walks across the yard to open the gate and let in
You're Michael Berg
Yes
Louisa Brenner
We were expecting you earlier
&
& is walking  up the steps towards the prison canteen
They pass  and
should warn you: for a long time Hanna held herself together
She was very purposeful
In the last few years she's different
She's let herself go
leads  to the door of the canteen
They're in the canteen
They're just finishing lunch
sees an   who is sitting at a table
Her blue dress is stretched too tight across her heavy body
Her hair is grey
She has a book in her lap, but she's not reading it
few  are finishing their meal
It takes  a moment to realise the   is
Then  becomes aware of being watched
She turns and looks round
At once her face lights up
smiles back, but as he approaches her, he fixes onto her inquiring look and sees the light go out of her eyes, as if she has looked at him and been disappointed
He sits down opposite her
She smiles, weary
72
You've grown up, kid
She takes his hand
There is a long silence,  unable to think of anything to say
He withdraws his hand
've got a friend who's a tailor, he makes my suits
He'll give you a job
And 've found you somewhere to live
It's a nice place
Quite small but nice
think you'll like it
Thank you
There's a moment's silence
There are various social programmes, cultural stuff  can sign you up for
And there's a public library very close
nods slightly
You read a lot
prefer being read to
There is a short silence
That's over now, isn't it
doesn't answer
Did you get married
did
Yes  did
We have a daughter
'm not seeing as much of her as  would like
'd like to see a great deal more of her
After a few moments, he concedes
The marriage didn't last
73
There is a silence
Have you spent a lot of time thinking about the past
You mean, with you
No
No,  didn't mean with me
Before the trial  never thought about the past
never had to
And now
What do you feel now
looks a moment, a haunting look, searching him
It doesn't matter what  think
It doesn't matter what  feel
The dead are still dead
There's a silence
wasn't sure what you'd learnt
have learnt, kid
've learnt to read
stares, devastated
'll pick you up next week,
That sounds a good plan
Good
Quietly, or shall we make a big fuss
Quietly
Quietly
74
They look at each other
The other  have already gone
They stand up
She scans his face again, searching for his thoughts
He takes her in his arms, a little awkward
Take care, kid
You too
They walk side by side, back towards the door
Then by way of saying goodbye, she takes his hand
See you next week
She stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand, then vanishes inside
walks on alone
comes out of the main entrance
He stands a moment, looking round at the evening
walks to his car
' The room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the other
It is all furnished with simple functional furniture
The end of a hard day's work
hangs a picture over the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went cycling
The job is done
He looks round, grimly content
is lying on her bed, fully dressed
She gets up and gets some books down from the shelf
She puts them, one by one, in a pile on the table
Then she takes off her shoes
She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table
Her bare feet on the books
Then she reaches up
& gets out of the car
He is carrying a bunch of flowers
He walks towards the prison
He leans in to the who is in a modern office
From the far end of the corridor,  is seen sitting on a bench
comes out of her office and murmurs in his ear
is seen nodding, ashen
75
& The two of them come together down the corridor
They stop at the open door of the cell
The body has been removed
The books are still on the floor
goes in
bare table, a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the door
There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins
She didn't pack
She never intended to leave
looks at him in confirmation
looks at the two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the cassette machine
Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees
One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours kneels on the bed to look at them
There are quotations, articles, recipes, even sayings in ' childish handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through the air' is one
Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the young   receiving a prize from the school principal
The headline `Michael Berg receives school literature prize
' reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf
Then she sits next to  on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet of paper from her suit pocket
She left me a message, a sort of will
'll read out the bit that concerns you
looks at the effortful handwriting on the page
"There is money in the old tea tin
Give it to Michael Berg
He should send it, alongside the 7,000 marks in the bank, to the daughter who wrote the book
It's for her
She should decide what to do with it
And tell Michael  said hello
Tell him to get on with his life
" looks at him
Do you want to see her
76
shakes his head
rides in a taxi into Manhattan
view of the familiar skyline
' taxi comes up Fifth Avenue
It draws up outside an expensive apartment block
gets out and goes in, the Manhattan skyline opening up behind him
' superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art
has taken his coat off
appears, elegant, well-dressed - on the surface, the spirit of prosperous New York
She is now in her early fifties
Ms Mather
Yes
You're Michael Berg
was expecting you
So you must tell me: what exactly brings you to the United States
was already here
was at a conference in Boston
You're a lawyer
Yes
was intrigued by your letter but can't say  wholly understood it
You attended the trial
Yes
Almost twenty years ago
was a law student
remember you, remember your mother very clearly
77
My mother died in Israel - a good many years ago
'm sorry
hesitates for a moment
Go on, please
Perhaps you heard
Hanna Schmitz recently died
She killed herself
shakes her head
She was a friend of yours
kind of friend
It's as simple as this
Hanna was illiterate for the greater part of her life
Is that an explanation of her behaviour
No
Or an excuse
shakes his head
No
No
She taught herself to read when she was in prison
sent her tapes
She'd always liked being read to
shifts slightly
Why don't you start by being honest with me
At least start that way
What was the nature of your friendship
78
When  was young  had an affair with Hanna
looks at him for a moment
'm not sure  can help you, Mr
Berg
Or rather, even if  could 'm not willing to
was almost sixteen when  took up with her
The affair only lasted a summer
But
But what
just looks at her
see
And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge the effect she'd had on your life
stares back, understood for the first time
She'd done much worse to other people
've never told anyone
People ask all the time what learned in the camps
But the camps weren't therapy
What do you think these places were
Universities
We didn't go there to learn
One becomes very clear about these things
looks at him, unrelenting
What are you asking for
Forgiveness for her
Or do you just want to feel better yourself
My advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis
Please
Go to literature
Don't go to the camps
Nothing comes out of the camps
Nothing
79
looks at him, unrelenting
What she wanted
what she wanted was to leave you her money
have with me
To do what
As you think fit
reaches for his briefcase
He takes out the lavender tea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of
Here
lifts the tin
When  was a little girl,  had a tea-tin for my treasures
Not quite like this
It had Cyrillic lettering
took it with me to the camp, but it got stolen
What was in it
Oh
Sentimental things
piece of hair from our dog
Some tickets to operas my father had taken me to
It wasn't stolen for its contents
It was the tin itself which was valuable, what you could do with it
She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin
There's nothing  can do with this money
If  give it to anything associated with the extermination of the Jews, then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something 'm neither willing nor in a position to grant
nods slightly
80
was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy
Good
There's a silence
Good
Do you know if there's a Jewish organization
'll be surprised if there isn't
There's a Jewish organisation for everything
Not that illiteracy is a very Jewish problem
There is the shadow of a smile
Why don't you find out
Send them the money
Shall  do it in Hanna's name
As you think fit
smiles slightly
She puts her hand on top of the tin
'll keep the tin
' is standing at the window watching down to the street where  is walking away
She has the tin in her hand
When he's vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom
There on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of with her mother in Germany before the war
She sets the tin down beside the photo
& 1995
is driving  in the big Mercedes through the German countryside
He is tense, silent
takes a sideways look at him, but he does not respond
81
Where are we going
thought you liked surprises
do
do like surprises
They draw up at a church
It is the same one he and passed on their bicycles years before
and  get out and walk towards the graveyard at the side
&  stand at a deserted grave-side
The whole cemetery is seen
stoops down and uncovers a simple stone :   1923-1988
watching, says her name
Hanna Schmitz
waits a moment
Who was she
That's what  wanted to tell you
That's why we're here
looks, waiting
looks for a moment as if he will not go on
So tell me
There is a moment, then they turn to stroll,  talking, starting to tell the story
was 15,  was coming home from school,  was ill
They walk away among the trees
