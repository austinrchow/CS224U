' by Ronald Bass First Draft Screenplay -------------------------------------------------------------- ,   - Dim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated, the congenitally impatient
Everyone in this queue holds a reservation at least an hour overdue
Tourists can't even make the line
ahead to
the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant service
Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving by far the most lavish service of all
Captains hover, presenting delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose person they screen from our view
We can see, however
the honored guest's companion
Ignored, bemused, across the table
This is  , 36, darkly attractive
Kind eyes, an intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and conservative chalk-stripe suit
He is gay, but you wouldn't guess it
Loyal and wise and generous, and you might
He watches with a quiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us
their most unlikely icon
, almost 28, wears her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled together in fifteen seconds
She is unkempt, quick, volatile, scattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an original beauty
Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender expressive fingers, which point to
variation on our squid ink risotto
Trace of Moselle, to sweeten the stock
She doesn't like that idea at all
Shoots him a sharp look of doubt that makes him smile
Murmur
Don't kill us on this one, it's a long shot
Places the moist lump of black rice before her
She takes a surprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue
Makes dead flat eye contact with Digger
And nods, it's actually quite nice
The Captain breathes with relief
She turns her dark eyes to him
The tone says they're pals
'm writing it up as inventive and confident
Which it is
Off the record, 'll need an extra boat of the ink
Or a salt shaker
'll toss a coin
As the Captain splits, Digger looks around at the other tables, which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note
She glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn nearby
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity
've adjusted, and thanks for asking
She leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who put in
It's who  leave out
Which is everyone you couldn't get in
Plus some guys whose food  don't like
Pushes the risotte across to him
He lifts a fork
This fellow from Newsday ever call
She shrugs
Pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag
'll buzz my machine
Inventive and confident, yeh
She dials
He tastes
Needs salt
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w
don't send you men, anymore
You don't know what to do with them
She's punching in her code
Sometimes  do
Like for two months
weeks
Over the phone, we hear her answering machine
'  (
, soft) Hey
It's Michael
And her face changes
Warms
Just to hear the guileless voice
(
) God, it must be, what, months, huh
can't wait to talk to you
'm in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton
She looks impressed and surprised
Fancy place for this guy
(
) Call me four in the morning, whatever, we gotta talk
As she hangs up
She still has that look in her eye
Digger has never seen that, and he likes it very much
Who called
The man of the moment
She smiles
sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too
The Bohemian sophisticate has vanished
No, no, the opposite
That's my best friend, Michael 'Neal
He sounds desperate to talk
The wandering sportswriter
He pushes the risotto back her way
didn't know you two had a past
Her gaze sharpens
Hmmn
The look in your eye
She blushes
Shakes her head, no way
Sophomore year at Yale we had this one hot month
And, you know me,  got restless
He knows her
She got restless
So  get up the nerve to break his heart
tell him there's this dreamy exchange student from Pakistan who wants to, you know
He knows
And he gets this
look
He says, " knew  couldn't hold your interest", which, of course, makes me feel like the shallow bitch 've always been
He nods, yeah
Then he says, "But what makes me want to cry
Is 'm losing the best friend  ever had
" Hears the feeling
In her voice
And when he said it,  knew
felt the same
Silence now
She covers with a smile
So  cried
For maybe the third time in my life
And  kissed him
And we've been best friends ever since
Ever since
Fingers turning her wine glass
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything
Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers
travelled all over, we've had the best times
The best times of my life, maybe
Just drinking and talking
Even over a phone
Kindred spirits
No, he's nothing like me
He's like you
Only straight
No offense taken
He's the salt of the earth
Kind and loyal and generous
The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there
He's still in love with you
That stops her
She has to say
Maybe
But it never gets in the way
Something she probably hasn't confessed out loud before
Digger understands
Well, he has a true friend in you
He wants her to know he sees that
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast  am, he always makes me sound boring
Solid and genuine is not boring
Michael can be completely insane
young waiter arrives
Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her plate
There was this one night in Tucson, like six years ago
we got amazingly drunk,  mean, Keith Richards time
The kid tops off her glass of meursault
Looking at her
God,  haven't thought of this in so long
The waiter hanging now
Openly listening
can even believe we did this
Digger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes
So she looks up
Could you give us a minute
The kid stunned, speechless
People lose jobs for a lot less
You won't miss much,  promise there was no sex
He reddens and disappears
've lost interest
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me
She places the tips of her index fingers together
Blood oath
He says, "Swear
When we're both 28, if we've never been married
we marry each other
" And laughs again
Can you believe that
But Digger isn't smiling
She wonders why
Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto
See, he figured that would be a sign from God, or someone of comparable authority, that we'd misunderstood our destinies
He still has this real serious look
She's still spooning ink
We never talked about it again don't know what made me think of
(quietly) do
And everything
Stops
She lifts her spoon, mesmerized by the gravity of his tone
You'll be 28 in three weeks
How old is he
Holy
Fucking
Shit
It hits her like a ton of lead bricks
She shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth, without looking
You think
Desperate
To talk
She shovels in more drippy black goop
It is really disgusting
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way 'm buying one word of th
Then why are you compulsively eating
If you're not hysterical
More goes in
Her lips and mouth completely black
Like a circus clown
He can't do that to me
We're about to find out
Ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down her face
She absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from reaching her sweater
When  turn him down
She realizes the full weight of the truth
We'll never be the same
have a suggestion
'll have to kill myself before call him
Staring in each other's eyes
(sadly) That was it
'  - Julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush
Gray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball jersey she wears as a nightshirt
In the mirror, her troubled eyes dwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on the closed toilet lid
She spits, sticks her tongue way out
Incredibly black
Great
Depressed, terrified, and disfigured for life
She snatches up the hated phone, and wanders aimlessly into
her bedroom
West Village view
Defiantly jumbled, aggres- sively eclectic
Traces of wonderful taste mixed with -like-it- you-got-a-problem-with-that
She stumbles around, rehearsing
This is awkward timing, Michael, just joined this convent, and they never give your deposit ba
Stops
Full-length mirror
She straightens her hair, to look her best
Michael, 'm married
Not enough
and  have two weeks to live
Changes tone
Michael, 'm trying to be gay, don't confuse me
She turns to continue pacing, and walks straight  a dresser
Stuns her, momentarily
Enough, already
She punches up the number, primping absently in the mirror
When it connects
was calling Michael 'Neal, but seeing it's so late,  could just leave a mes
No such luck
Cut off
Waits
And then
(soft) Good evening, sir
You've been enrolled in the Obscene Call Of The Month Club, and th

) Hey
God, it's so good to hear your voice
She forgets herself
Because it's good to hear his, too
(
) 've been calling for days
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages
tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally
(
, urgent) Look,  have to ask you something
She swallows
(
) Something so incredibly important, that if you turn me down,  don't know what 'll d
(bright) just have to tell you this one thing first, okay
mean this will hand you the biggest laugh of your adult life
Silence
Come on girl, suck it up
was thinking about you, and remembered this unbelievably insane night we spent together in Tucson, like a thousand years ago
More silence
Really quiet
mean, there's no way you could possibly remember the
(
, soft) Are you kidding
Stops her
Like a brick wall
The sweetness in his voice
(
) think about that night all the time
She's going to have a heart attack
(
) But it's not why  called
She blinks
It's not
And just as a tsunami of relief begins to sweep away
(
) called because  met someone
And her smiles breaks off
Like a spine snapping
Because there is something in his voice
Well, that's great
You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee
(
) You don't understand
've never felt this way about anybody
Never
She sits down, hard
Right on the floor
(
) And she's all wrong for me
Well, somet
(
) mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old
Like when  first met you
Like when
Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry
(
) And her dad is like this billionaire who owns the White Sox and some cable empire, and you know how 've always been miserably awkward around those kinda stuffed suits
She's finally making her mouth work
Well, sure
(
) But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people
You've met her parents
(
, quiet) Well
Sure
Wow
(
) See
We're getting married
This Sunday
There's a knife in her heart
She can scarcely breathe
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su
(
) Actually, it all starts tomorrow
It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such
(incredibly lame) Aren't you
working this weekend
mean, is that responsible
(
) Well, the Sox are at home
's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt
That's Frank
(barely audible) Thomas, yeh
She's staring at herself in the mirror
(
) Jules
'm scared
straw to lunge at
Well, maybe we should talk ab
(
) need you
So heartfelt
lifetime of emotion welling in her eyes
(
) If you can't come
And hold my hand
'll never get through this
Oh
(
) Please come, please
(
) can't wait for you to meet her
Julianne
Staring in the mirror
Like watching the end of her life
- The closet, the armoire, all the drawers are wide open
Two huge suitcases open on the bed, into which Julianne is flinging clothes, as she fumbles to smoke and dial at the same time
Over the phone, now
(
, machine) You've reached Digger and George
Brevity will be appreciated
(in a rage) '  ,  ' up a tiny, clingy, sexy dress
Pouts at it
,   ,  ' She holds the dress against her body
It's hot
, ,
' , '
She clicks
Checks the dress in the mirror
Raises the short skirt a little higher
' ,   - Digger driving the open-air Cherokee up the ramp to United Airlines departures
Julianne, wind-whipped, trying to light a fresh cigarette from the butt of the last one
He glances over
Hates to see this
You can't get lung cancer and die in four days
Go to Plan
She sucks deep
Really deep
You have no appropriate sense of emergency
My best friend is ruining his life
No, he's ruining yours
Same difference
If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves
You have a real philosophy of life
It's called the Law of Love, asshole
She is tight enough to snap
And at the edge of tears
Staring out at the skycaps, clinging to her cigarette, as he eases to the curb
(gently) Why don't we have a drink
You could catch a later fl
'm a busy girl
've got four days to break up a wedding, and steal the bride's fella
She finally looks at him
He doesn't say anything
He's adored me for nine goddamn years
can see why
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois
He's not
So her voice softens
Which shows the hurt
And don't go feeling sorry for me, you don't know me that well
We're only friends
(softly) stand corrected
Tears now
Stand in her eyes
'm making a big mistake, huh
(shrugs) Maybe you'll learn something
He wraps his hand over hers
She looks down at it
'm gonna bring him back, man
Against all odds, y'know
Cos if  don't
She wraps her fingers around his
gotta live with it forever
Looks in his eyes
And at my wedding
'll be the only bride with her own best man
And she kisses his cheek
Jumps out of his car
Before she cries
Yanks her bags from the back
Brave smile
They trade small salutes
And then she's gone
' ,  - The jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony called 'Hare
Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull fly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl, looking all around, and
there he is
is tall and square-shouldered, a boyish grin, an unruly shock of hair
He looks gorgeous, sweet, and just dangerous enough to be irresistible
Worthwhile stakes
His face lights to see her, and she
to his arms, shedding bags along the way, slamming off heedless civilians, to be
the earth in strong arms, spun around, laughing like crazy, their cheeks tight together
When he sets her down
he kisses her nose
His arms are still around her
(murmurs) Can you believe it
Can you believe 'm actually gonna do this
(lost in his eyes) Not hardly
He beams
Turns
She follows his gaze, and
there she is
is 20, small and slender, but it is a body to die for
The face is striking, not at all perky and vapid, but lovely and interesting
Worst of all, intelligent
She walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in her fiancee's arms
At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne and Kimmy
her arms around the startled visitor
her tight, with such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back
As Michael beams
This just makes everything so perfect
Her arms stay around the slightly dazed Julianne
The younger girl leans close, confides
All 've heard, from the day met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that
Well, we're
think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you
Pale gray eyes
Alive with joy and intimacy
've never had a sister
'  - Kimmy  down the throughway in her Mercedes 500 , a dashing, confident driver
Julianne riding shotgun, hair flying, a total wreck, in the open convertible
Michael is happily crouched on the little platform behind their seats, hugging his knees
The roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them
My heart's in my throat, here
Right off,  have to ask this monstrous favor
You need a few dollars
Kim glances over
At eighty miles an hour
bittersweet look
Dry
Just like he said
Her eyes at once admiring and regretful
Excuse me
can be quick
can even be funny
Shakes her head
An endearing youngster
But  can't be dry
Can you watch the road
See
Dry
It's in the delivery
She looks back to the highway
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav
you want a menage on your wedding night
(straight back) No, that wouldn't be burdensome
Julianne studying the delicate, angular profile
Hard not to like this kid
My classmate Angelique shattered her pelvis line dancing in Abeline on Spring Break
Looks over
The sweetest smile
Be my maid of honor
Julianne just blinks
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp
Uh
How about promoting a bridesmaid
Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes
We   a huge  who  his horn
Kimmy fearless, oblivious, and analytical
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty
Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts
With amazing bodies
Which was the disqualifying factor
The twin part
like to remain impartial in my contempt
Sees the off-ramp, and  across   of speeding bullets in a heart-stopping nanosecond
This kid could drive for Penske
Julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started
Looks back to see if Michael fell out
he is absurdly wind-blown
Gives her a beautiful grinning thumbs-up
Loves this stuff
This means  have four days to make you my new best friend
Brings Julianne's eyes back
And since  already know everything about you
Including intimate facts 'm mortified to have heard, but too envious to forget
It's time for you to learn about me
Easing off the freeway
She meets Julianne's glance
Force yourself
To get personal
(smiles) Sounds like a plan
,    - The place is stunning
High-ceiling, soft light, large rococo mirrors, Louis Quatorze sofas and chairs
Michael wanders rest- lessly, fish out of water among designer displays and stylish female patrons
Takes a look at his watch
- period sitting room, ringed with mirrors along its tapestried walls
Kimmy sits on a Louis Treize loveseat next to a stack of costly gowns
Watching with an expertise beyond her years, as
Julianne stands on a platform
seamstress fitting her into a sleek pale daffodil-colored gown
There are pins everywhere, as the seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit
Continuously looking to Kim for approval
If you'd rather the lilac
Julianne shakes her head
This one is beautiful
thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress
Not you
You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive
Julianne glances over
What else did he tell you
you hate weddings, you never go
Oh
Well, yeah
You're not up for anything conventional, or popularly assumed to be female priorities
Including marriage
Or romance
Or even
And she stops
Not wanting to offend
(quietly) not even love
The look holds
The seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf
That's why Michael and  were the wrong fit
Right from the start
He said that, too
She stands up
Walks to the platform
Smooths her hand over the fabric down Julianne's back, along her hips
Communicating to the seamstress with her irritated expression
Well,  thought  was like you
And proud to be
Until  met rumpled, smelly old Michael
Pins start to come out
Kimmy points, these, too
And then  found  was just a sentimental schmuck
Like all those flighty nitwits 'd always pitied
She leans forward
So they can look at each other
Funny world, huh
Julianne swallows
It is that
need a smoke
And before anyone can breathe, she steps  the platform the living shit out of the gown, right down the side
The seam- stress' eyes   in abject horror
Julianne, a deer in headlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw-up in six different mirrors
Kimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear
It's mostly the seam
Let's get this to Carlos
And  Julianne down the back
In her rush to step out, Julianne ,  but her arms are pinned by the pulled-down dress and she just
like a felled oak,  on her face, the gown some more, the seamstress  like an idiot
Then
Silence
Julianne looking up helplessly, a trussed hog, bound in her dress
(firm) Just
Don't
Move
Like you talk to a three-year-old
Deftly, Kimmy pulls the dress free, leaving Julianne in her underwear
Signals to the seamstress, let's go
Don't you have to be somewh
just my bridal shower
And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game
Opens the door
Other than that
Closed
Gone
- Julianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties, lighting one cigarette from the butt of another
Suddenly, she hears
an  outside the door
Strains to listen
It does sound like Michael and Kim
We can't make out the words
She jumps up, dashes for the door,  her toe on the platform,
, falls heavily  the door with a  that makes her wince, and
the argument stops
Damn
She opens the door a crack
Sees nothing
Opens it wider to reveal
a teenaged  looking right at her
He sends a true shit- eating grin and she  the door hard enough to  walls
She  furiously, helplessly, arms around her half-naked self, until
soft knock
The door opens a crack, and her daffodil gown comes through it
Come in, and shut the
Stops
Because it's Michael who has entered
With the dress
door
So he does
She flushes and  up her own clothes, which were characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to untangle them enough to cover herself
He is amazed and amused by her embarrassment
(laughing) Should  turn around, or someth
Michael, 'm in my underwear
She's  at her clothes, only making more of a mess
We've seen each other a lot more naked than this
She seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them from her hands
She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily untangles them
mean, we were skinny-dipping in Greece, just as pals, less than two years ago
She  the clothes and covers the front of herself
Looking at him with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out
Things are different now
He looks in her eyes
And nods, a little sadly
Guess they are
(softly) Well
leave with two thoughts in my mind
He walks to the door
Puts his hand on the latch
Looks back
(even softer) You're still a very pretty girl
The look holds
And holds
There is such feeling on both sides, she doesn't know what to make of it
She swallows
What's the sec
Mirrors
And he's gone
She looks around at six different  of her uncovered backside
Hmm

These girls must be late for something, the way they're jumping out of the car

most sentimental schmucks pity want a honeymoon after their wedding
Just to top it off
The valet gives Kimmy her ticket

They're walking fast toward the garage elevators

So your honeymoon is exactly where
Well
It depends
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there
Or Phoenix
Or depending on Indiana- Clevel

Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit
At the elevator

Kimmy  the penthouse button
Looks at her calmly
Go on
Well
You've been introduced to the symphonic range of
his snoring, yeah
He says it's worse than ever
That snaffle one
Julianne imitates an incredibly annoying high-pitched
Three times
Kimmy nods
Well now it has this sorta phlegm rattle behind it
Stopped at the lobby
family of four gets in
Oblivious, Kimmy the phlegm rattle
Really gets into it
As the family watches, Julianne tries her own version
Like that
No
More like this
The family is looking at each other
Guess what
Earplugs work
Oh
How about
cigars in bed
broke him on that
But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times
Sucks in a breath
loves action movies, subscribes to Playboy for godsake, reads over my shoulder, can't keep track of the checks he writes
Ninth floor
The family gets out
The door closes
He sucks soup through his front teeth
trademark move, don't touch it
But he sure can kiss
It's been awhile
'll take your word
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults,  made a command decision that changed my life
She  the   button
We  to a halt
threw the list away
Shakes her head
He's not a balance sheet, so many wonderful qualities, so many faults
He's Michael
From her heart
And loving him means loving all of this
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces
So it's sweet of you to be protective
Let me rephrase that
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa
except one
Julianne's face
Stops
Oh, yeah
Kimmy nods
Confides

You'll always be there
In his mind

No
And the answer was so simple
was gonna predict that
You win
Julianne blinks
Excuse me
You're enshrined in his heart and memory
Unassailable
Which works out great
've missed a step
He has you on a pedestal
And me in his arms
Oh
Julianne smiles

Ju
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating
Begins  random buttons, out of control
Kimmy watching this
Julianne looks  up
There's a panel up there, you could boost me
off her platform shoes
You know how little air is in these things
've seen statistics
Once you're trapped between floors
Kimmy taps her
Points to the lighted panel
It says , they've reached the Penthouse
God
Then the door is jammed
Takes a heavy platform and begins  the metal door with all her strength, sending resounding  throughout the area, as Kimmy reaches and
presses
The metal doors part, opening directly onto the banquet room, just as a mighty blow comes down, and the platform from Julianne's hand straight
two identical stunning  , serving as twin hostesses for the shower
beat of mutually-stupefied looks, and we hear the shoe  somewhere, to a small spattering of

We came in complementary colors

The girls cast identical blank looks at Kimberly

All eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely 40
She has her daughter's hair and eyes and slender form
But the bearing rules half an empire
Fonda would envy
'm Isabelle Wallace, and my handsome new son scarcely did you justice, girl
She takes both of Julianne's hands, and our heroine is sort of magically charmed
As if touched by Glinda the Good Witch of the North
Now, my husband says to scoot you over to the ballpark, so you can hang with Michael
But first, you have to meet a lot of really old women
Looking warmly in her eyes
That is, if you've absorbed enough profanity
Flicks a glance at the twins
Leads Julianne off

Watched by Michael, three groomsmen his age, two middle-aged men, and one bodyguard
Suddenly, a dull  at the door
It keeps up
They finally all look over
The bodyguard gets the door, revealing

One single tray
Holding fourteen beers
Balancing on one hand

(sweetly) Michael
You'll unwittingly imply that 'm clumsy
He stops in his tracks
The guys whistle
Think of that
And as well as know you
She goes first to the bodyguard
Sorry, ma'am, 'm on duty
(lovely smile) It's Miss
And thanks
That leaves two for me
Heads down the row
Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Gerry from , and you know Daniel
She's nodding, flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter of the tray, keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center
Michael is flat dumbstruck
Next, a tall patrician gentleman with rolled-up sleeves on his hand-stitched silk shirt
Oh
This is my father-in-law, Walter
Once again, she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished father-in-law
How are you doing this
You're on drugs
Sets them down
The man has a smile wonderful in its ease
Murmurs
If he gives you grief, 'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show
guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question
Under the circumstances
Charmed to know you, Jules
Nice meeting you, too, Walt
nod between equals
She moves on
And, this guy, you know
She sure does, and effortlessly balancing her one-hand load, she dips to kiss a porky, balding guy with big-time shoulders
Straight on the lips
Papa Joe
They go way back
He is uncomfortable at this rich man's wedding, even as gracious as everyone has been
His watering eyes twinkle at her, and the voice has a trace of Boston
You gonna be my boy's best man
Despite  from the others
Best everything, Joe
But 'm going to dance with you
Dance
You don't dance
You learn to dance
Her innocent smile
Moves
You've never seen
reaction from the guys, as she heads toward Michael with the last of the beers, not looking down at the '  which lies right in her path, and as his lips part to scream a warning, she skips
neatly  it
He's in shock
You're an impostor
What have you done with my best friend
As he takes away the remaining beers
And how was the hot dog
Hot dog
His eyes fix on her left breast
mustard stain
She can't believe it
Cheap and unnecessary
We were looking anyway
- Michael and Julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury box roof
The game, the stadium, spread out beneath them
Yet they are alone in the world
She dangles her legs, and we can hear her kicking the glass below
just admire your maturity, that's all
mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring
Day after day, year after year
see, that's what  thought at first
How can you like someone that perfect
No potential for long-range livability
Drinking their beers
Side by side
Both stare only at the game
Luckily
The closer  watched, the more the fault came into focus
Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability
Such as
She's too genuine
Hate that
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust
What's next
Keep sipping
Never look at each other
No matter how many times leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down
Endearingly absent-minded
My very point
Here's another one
Shakes his head
This one really gets him
Every day
She makes the bed
Quite the little eccentric
At first,  thought it was a gag, but she's always done it
This is not the ammunition Julianne was hoping for
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh
She admires
Tommy Lasorda
Waiter
Check, please
She finds him "personable
" Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically
She looks over now
And Michael is looking back
Smiling the most wonderful smile
Her reaction shows that she thinks it's for her, until
Then again
She has a few good traits
Hating herself for asking, but seeing no way out
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list
First girl  ever knew
Who lets me give her a bath
The look in his eyes
She can hardly bear it
And when  hug her, even in public
don't have to let go right away
She lets me hold her as long as  want
He seems so deeply in love
Nice kid, don't you think
beat
slow nod
quiet
Looks like, from here
- slender black woman sings a  Gospel number, backed by three ladies who could each solo in any church choir
It is mesmerizing, stirring, transcendent
The unseen audience in rhythm,  support
now
every face is black
We aren't in church at all, but a venerable blue club
One of those places you'd swear everybody's played, from Robert Johnson to Bessie Smith and back again
As the song ends, there is , some  on tables with their knuckles or their drunks
We keep  to a far corner
Three faces
Julianne leans across her beer to Kimmy
How'd you find this pl
Kim shaking her head
Looks admiringly to Michael
Lived here my whole life, never heard of it
Until our first date
She reaches slender fingers
Traces one back along his hair
He finds all these spots, everywhere he goes, it's a mystical gift
(shy) Jesus, one d-back from the Bears knows a place
It's not just clubs
This guy always knows the best everything
The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the

The best dim sum, the best camping stuff

best valley in New Zealand, best
women's shoes

When you weren't looking
Now he's grinning at Julianne
And she likes that a lot
Where was that, Florence, huh
Firenze
Together in the memory
As Kimmy watches
The Vespa
Me hanging on behind in the rain all night
Till the gas ran out
And, the first sniff of left-out
love Florence
Julianne's eyes flicker
Could this be a teensy opening
Keeps her eyes, her easy smile, and her killer instincts trained on Michael
Take her there
He nods, okay
mean, now
She's perky, she deserves a honeymoon
He draws a breath
heard
If San Antone sweeps Sacramento
What is this shit
You gotta get off the road by September anyway, when does Fall Quarter start
And the happy couple look at each other
They are awkward
Julianne's heart soar like eagle
Uh
'm not coming back
For senior year
Could this be
The Mother Lode
Don't architects find a degree, sort of
an asset
The couple still staring in each other's eyes
Well, the school will be here
Architecture will still be around
Right now
travel every week
College ball, motor sports, training camps
The most important thing
Is being together
And she smiles
Beautifully
'm just a baby
've got all
the time
in the world
- Michael putting Kim in the back of a cab
As Julianne watches
Because  could come
To the twins' soiree
So they can paw you and drool
(calls out, helpful) They're gonna drool anyway
Kim smiles
He kisses her, tenderly, through the open window
She waves past him at Julianne
(to both) Enjoy each other
And drives off
As he watches after, Julianne comes up behind him
Slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle
Starts giving a little massage
Should  whistle down a cab
Hey, cabs are expensive
'm cheap, remember
Turns his head, to see her
She's still rubbing his shoulder
Sometimes
About the dumbest things
Share a smile
As always, it covers a lot of years
The El's right down the street
Unless you're afraid of the neighborhood
She looks around
It is an issue
But she remembers
No
'm always safe with you
She means that
He takes her by the hand
They begin walking
Pretty amazing girl, you've got
Make that kind of sacrifice
What, leaving school
all of it
She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows
She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers
(quietly) In her way
All to follow you in this dumb job, where you travel 52 weeks a year to College Station, Texas, and such
It's not a job for a grown man, Michael, Peter Pan never married
He's let go of her hand now
Looking down at the pavement before him, fists in his jacket pockets
(softly) don't think she's naturally the
submissive type
Aren't you afraid she's gonna choke on this stand-by-your-man shit after awhi
(real quiet) No
Hit a nerve
This is promising

She would never
Never
Even think of that
Paydirt
Julianne's Geiger Counter is going berserk

That would be deceitful
manipulative

He looks over at her
No smile on his face
An edge we haven't seen
She shrugs
Still
All's fair in love and w
That would be a girl
don't even know
They've reached the stairs to the El
rickety train above them
As they start up, she slips her arm around his waist
(murmurs) Forgive me, okay
was talkin' crazy
He slides his arm around her shoulder
Pals
They climb out of frame
- on a shallow pool of water in a bathroom sink
Green powder pouring in, a hand  it around, until
(
) It's Albanian,  think
Or Mongolian
Or Canadian
One of those
bought it downstairs
it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud
(
) figure, what the hell
Can it make me look worse
Follow the hand up as it  the shit across her face in great green dripping gobs
She's juggling the wall phone, trying to keep it mudless, as she assures Digger
Dig, of course
Of course, of course, of course, of course have a plan
Certainment
More green slime
The Julianne we know disappears
How
ask myself, what would Lucy Ricardo do in this situa
Desecrates three hotel towels, wiping her hand
Well, one worked, once
them in the bathtub
Fastidiousness a short suit
Ricky wouldn't let her in the show
Reaches for her toothbrush, absently
All her attention is on the conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror
recall it differently, but we digress
Without looking, picks up a tube of hotel shampoo
So in the version, you're Ethel, with better fashion instincts
Squeezes it all over the toothbrush
This puts you in charge of Plan , the unprincipled and insanely dangerous back-up plan
Lifts it toward her mouth, liquid shampoo dripping from the bristles
In case simple lying doesn't work
At the last second
She stops
We don't know why, because she's still never looked at the brush
Question
What happens if you brush your teeth with shampoo
Turns on the tap
Tries to scrub the toothbrush clean, and the phone into the green swamp, which  all over her front
Euucch
She's stymied, agitated, circling the sink, leaning down to it
'
She sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit
Decides to on the phone's cord, and the receiver  out, her in the face
She's so filthy at this point, she just wipes it clean on her nightshirt
Tells Digger
You okay
This is one of those problem phones
Lifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit
Right
Your role
You know guys from Sports Illustrated, yes mean, you can walk right in there
Squeezes on the paste, lifts the brush to her mouth
You could get access to letterhead, for example
it in her mouth, brushing as
(mouthful) or even, maybe, their fax
Stops
The funniest look on her face
Down to the toothpaste tube
Which says
Oh
' - Julianne and Kimmy cruise the stately display cases
Everywhere, the Tiffany logo, the silent, watchful staff in morning coats
As they browse, Julianne takes a blueberry Danish from a paper sack, and begins to eat
The staff notices
So does Kim
It's an homage thing
Hmm
Awkward girls grow up on Audrey Hepburn movies
You wouldn't understand
Kimmy doesn't
But wipes a blue glob from Julianne's face
Anyway,  think you're wrong
Wrong
What you were saying before
Before
About Michael's job
Oh, that
forgot  even said th
just think you're wrong, is all
Probably am
Forget  brought it up
Points to some jade pins
Kimmy wrinkles her nose
mean, he loves his job
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food
Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four
Smiles
What's not to love
None of this is lost on Kimmy
She's wondered the same
But he always says
whatever is manly and independent
Kim nods slowly
Way ahead of her
Why would he trade that for running, say, a big piece of the  at a powerful, complex, challenging conglomerate like your dad's
Kim stares back
strange look
That's just the sort of thing my father and  discussed
Julianne just blinks
Amazed
'm not stupid
Say, how about this
Pointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case
Kim so absorbed by the main topic, she has to force herself to focus on
For the twins
What in the world is th
Gold nose hair clippers
Points to the tiny hand-lettered sign
Indeed
Kimmy shrugs, not quite it
So you don't think Michael's as happy with his job as
Julianne points to a matched pair of large
Gold dog collars
They don't have dogs
Hello
Kim nods, oh
But can't keep her mind off
You think he'd accept
Hmm
Michael
job like that
Oh, well
By any yardstick that involves sanity, it would be the greatest thing that ever happened to him
Present company excepted
Kimmy nodding slowly
Her yearing achingly apparent
On the other hand, he's proud
Last thing a man wants to admit, is being trapped in a dispiriting dead-end job that can never support a family
very sweet smile
Throw a man a life preserver
He'll say, "Thanks, anyway, 'd rather drown
" Kim nods again
Right
They are so bonded at this moment
So
one almost has to
Exactly
Exactly what
What you said
Make it appear that he's doing you the favor
Kimmy bites her lip
Her eyes go down
Self-conscious to admit
couldn't really
do that
After, you know
Her voice trails off
(kind, but wise) lying
All the time
That brings the gray eyes up
Julianne bats her dark ones
Oh, darling, my pitiful desires and ambitions are dirt beneath the manly boots of your priorities
Kimmy has to smile small
self-awe gal
(pouring it on) Two hundred seedy motels a year
Dinners out of vending machines
Waiting for you in vermin-infested corridors of dark crotch-rot locker rooms
This stuff makes me hot
The very words 've used
Julianne 'thinks it over
' Kimmy waits for guidance
We make Dad your co-conspirator
Michael does a favor for Walter
Simple
Walter's reorganizing his public relations, needs a brilliant guy who's close to him, who he can completely trust
Kimmy nodding
Hope overriding reason
So you beg
Michael, please do this for Daddy, please, please, please, blah, blah, blah
it's only for six months
it would mean so much to me to help him out
Turns up her palms
Viola
He'll see right through it
Only
If he wants to
They share a smile
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful
He won't get mad, huh
(
) May  be of any help, whatsoever
Mr
Mooney is the most gracious Brit salesperson ever to offer kindness, intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer
He is large, sixty, with disappearing hair, watering eyes, and a manner that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler
Bridesmaid gifts for two, well, assertive, outspoken, Tennessee debutantes
(still focused) He won't be mad
(to Mooney) Nothing here seems to quite capture their distinctive personalities
Something customized, perhaps
We can fashion most any item from gold
Ah
Julianne nodding
Reflecting
An object that might represent what is closest
To their heart
(under her breath) Don't even think dildo
Julianne digs through her jumbled bag
Could you do this
Tossing an object on the counter
In 24 carat
It is a
gold one
(softly) Bingo
They smile at each other
More bonded than ever
You don't think he'll be mad
beat
Can Julianne even make herself do this
Your call
You can live a lie
In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns
Or you can make one desperate stab at hap
just don't want to freak him out
What do you think
Julianne stares into the soft gray eyes
It's now or never
The smile of a dear sister
How mad could he get
- Julianne enters with a really nervous Kimberly in tow
Approaches the maitre d'
We  to hear
' Oh, Mr
Wallace and his guests have retired to the humidor
Points to an escalator, leading to the mezzanine
Behind a glass wall, what looks like a British men's club
Thirty guys and a billion cigars
As Julianne starts toward it
' Oh
Mademoiselle
She turns back
Loves this shit
' It's unofficial, of course
But, traditionally, the humidor is for gentlemen, only
Great
've got this girlfriend at the Justice Department
With all this time on her hands
Her look is every bit as hard as his
He gestures to the escalator
She takes Kimmy's hand, and up they go
We can see Walter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie
Kimmy licks her lips
They enter
Every head turns
nice range of reactions, from offended to attracted and points in between
(murmurs) Piece of cake
'll hang, and think happy thoughts
Kimmy nods
Heads over toward her father
Julianne walks, confidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of cigars
Every eye in the place is on her butt
She runs her fingers over a few contenders
Plucks one out, examines it, puts it back
Walks a little farther
Selects another, big and black
Rolls it expertly in her fingers
Sniffs along its length
guy comes over
Could be 40, successful, a broker's pin-stripe
Nearly as attractive as he thinks he is
Know what you're looking for, little lady
Little lady, huh
She glances at his coven of buddies, who pretend not to notice
Then, straight to the guy's blue eyes
Yeah
Do you
asked first
Ah
Wit
She holds up her cigar
like 'em long and hard
Kind of
big around
Runs it under her nose
Smell is important, 'm a believer in that
Takes a match from a cut crystal bowl
But you never know what you've got
Till you run your tongue over it
And she does
Moistening the full length of the cigar
The boys are laughing openly
She  the match
As she lights up
meant
What you're looking for in a man
She glances at his wedding ring
Then, straight into his eyes
Actually, 'm partial to married gentlemen
The way she says that
The guy swallows
We can see some of the air has been sucked from the room
Why is that
It's so much time
When  phone the wives
Explosive  from the peanut gallery
As she jams the big Clemente Churchill into her mouth, she sees Kimmy waving her over from across the room
Without even looking at the guy she's just put away
she crosses the room, Walter stands politely, looking very dapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable interest
He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather hassock
(simply) Your idea
She can't read this guy
Maybe that's how he built an empire
She nods, yeah
You're a woman of insight
He sits on the arm of his chair
Close enough to speak quietly
My wife and  love this marriage, and deplore its circumstances
He puffs his cigar
Julianne puffs her
Kimmy looks on, a kid watching the grown-ups
As you guessed, my daughter is unhappy about giving up her life
And, in my opinion, cowardly in avoiding the necessary confrontation
Then he stops
As if reading Julianne's eyes
Mike has a world of ability
'd do anything to have him in my company
One more puff
Except ask him
Julianne is a little stunned
Kimmy looks helpless
He'd resent it
And me
And, most important, Kim
No smile on his lips
Straight talk
He's a great kid, but he's still a kid
Instead of recognizing that his resistance comes from insecurity, he'd turn it to anger
To protect himself
Spreads his hands
from realizing that he's ignoring my daughter's needs, despite how very much he loves her
He looks to his daughter now
They both have some growing up to do
But they're good people, they're starting with love
They've got time
(softly) think you're making a mistake, sir
His eyes come back to her
little sharply
And that interests me
How someone who knows him so well could be so wrong
formidable guy
She meets his gaze
See,  love him, too, as much as anyone here
And for a whole lot longer
From her heart
think  know best what would make him happy
- Julianne, fully dressed, sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat
The stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut
Her cellular phone pressed to her ear, she is listening angrily, smoking ferociously, every call in her body running at red-line
Okay, okay, okay, okay,  hear you, all right
She closes her eyes
It is stupid, dishonest, desperate beyond belief, and can't possibly ever work
It can only end in humiliation and disgrace
Now can say two words
Deep drag on the cigarette
For strength
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
She's striped her gears
horribly
All right, twelve words
- Julianne exits the stall
To face three
Just staring at her
(supportive) You do it, girl
Julianne nods to the kids
They nod back
Damn straight
She exits the restroom, into
glaring sunlight
We are in the middle of the
And sitting on a bench, eating popcorn from a bag
Wow
What was going on in there
She shudders
Some crazy person
- Michael and Julianne walking together
He's eating his popcorn
She carries a cardboard container with nachos, a gooey fudge waffle cone, and a large drink
You're not eating
never eat when 'm serene
You never eat when you're despondent
switched that around when you weren't looking
She swirls a single nacho chip in cheese
But her heart isn't in it
Last zoo we were in was
Beijing, yeah
Sure
The rhinos were fucking
Boy, those were the days
And when she looks over
His eyes are waiting
(softly) Yeah, they were
They're passing the hippo pen
But they don't notice
That was nice
The way you said that
So was that
He's feeling restless, something
Doesn't know quite what to say
It's weird being the groom
All these things Kimmy has to take care of
You need a baby-sitter
That's what 'm here for
He holds her eyes
Then looks down
Awkward
And the way he's doing it begins to excite her
Say it
He looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is about to
into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts
We have followed him as she is  from frame
His face from shock
to amusement
Now, there's my girl
to tenderness
back to see her wearing everything from her cardboard container
Nachos, fudge sauce, Diet Coke, the works
It is really awful
Kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly
Her eyes fill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it
See,  can only do it with beer
He takes out his handkerchief
And with that and his hands, gently scoops the worst of the mess off her
The fact that he's touching her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice
She laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't know why
Such an odd, raw, confusing moment
To the world looking on, they are lovers
(murmurs) See, better already
And he kisses her face
Not quite her lips
But only an inch away
We can feel her heart pounding
He strips off his shirt, only a tank top underneath
We'll go back to the bathroom, you'll put this on
Okay
She sniffles, okay
Swallows
Bet you're glad 'm here to take care of you
He puts his arm around her
Bet  am
Holds her close, as they start toward the restroom
Hope that crazy person's not still there
We're on their backs
(
) She doesn't scare me
,   - Julianne in -shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling beach club
Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene
the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party
Young folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people
We with her to find a crowd around
a three-on-three volleyball game
Kimmy and two groomsmen on one side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs
The twins wear spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as predictably uninhabited
As the next point begins, Kimmy serves
Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for Michael's vicious  straight  his best man's hapless defense
The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives him a savage
of congratulation, that any  linebacker would be proud of
It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt
Laughter, applause
The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react
Kim plays good sport
Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then
dashes off
Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been set up
Manned by beach club staff and family alike
Michael's pop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg
Kim's mom, Isabelle, is coordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table
Julianne races across the sand to
a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs, clearly enjoying himself
Julianne runs up to him, says something into his ear
He looks at her
Then turns his station over to a club steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside
now
As they stroll together, she's a little breathless
He's watching her profile, curious, silent
At the water's edge
(whispers) Is anybody watching
hope so
This is all too mysterious to waste on just me
She reaches into her big bag
Pulls out a single folded sheet of paper
picked up Michael's messages for him, at our hotel
stole one
His face darkens
The easy smile fades
He holds up his palms
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something
Sir, this is important
Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right
His smile returns
Just a little
Matter of fact, that's how  got married
The look holds
She thrusts the paper out
He still doesn't take it
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss
(quickly) know Ben
She opens the paper
"Mike
We still have no answer to our -mail of Wednesday
Which option do you select
don't mean to rush you, but Personnel needs to tie up the loose ends
" He takes the paper
We see it now
Looks authentic
think he's been fired
It doesn't say th
He's said some things over the past few weeks
Look, this is why came up with the idea of you offering him a job
He looks up
He's listening
Closely
And why  couldn't say anything before in front of Kim
She bites her lip
Seems so earnest
just think of how
desperate he must be feeling
He's marrying a rich man's daughter, and he's about to become destitute
You know the kind of job market he'll be facing
He does
And you think he's kept this to himself
He's too proud to beg for help
And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity
Completely humiliating
He's staring at her
But his mind is working behind his eyes
If you do it now, it's like he's helping you
He can accept with dignity
He taps the paper with the back of his knuckles
This fax could mean
any number of things
She nods
She knows that
(softly) Maybe
should call Ben
Then it could all come out, sooner or later
Nobody should be in on this
Just you and me
Or, more correctly,
She takes the paper back
What if, what if  could find that -mail
The long straight look
Maybe he's hooked
never noticed
Kimmy has your eyes
,    - Tall, gangly, young
Lank hair, pimples
He looks up, beams to see
Hello, again
She's flirting her ass off
You still haven't straightened that tie
And she reaches across the desk with her lovely, slender hands
Does it for him
Her fingers brush his chest on the way back
We can assume a woody
You know, my friend, the one whose message  picked up
He does
His eyes flick toward his stately female , helping another guest across the way
Well, he's still with the wedding party
And he asked me to get something he needs real badly from his room
The boy swallows hard
He's in 1526
If you could just let me ha
See that woman
Not only does Julianne see her
The woman is looking back, while she's talking to her customer
Not a pleasant look
She said, if  ever pull a stunt like that again
You'll lose your job
tear my pecker off
Is what she said
- An elevator , revealing Julianne, carrying a gym bag
She looks down the long hallway, sees a maid's cart
Heads the other way, briskly, to
a small
Opens the gym bag, pulling out a bath towel
Begins to yank her top up  her head
the young  now pushing her cart down the hall, wheels , and from nowhere
Julianne  into her path, barely covered by the towel held tight across her, she is grinning, blushing
Help me
The maid can only blink
locked myself out, 1526, please hurry
And looks frantically up the hall, mortified that any moment a stranger could happen upon her predicament
Her eyes dart back to the maid
The maid just stares
Stares
Uno-cinco-does-ses
Oh
'  - Julianne alone in his room, looking around frantically
No worries about this guy making his bed every day, stuff, clothes, strewn everywhere, the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated
She's tramping through a bachelor's debris, wearing only her towel, looking, looking
There it is
The corner of his  sticking out from beneath a discarded bedspread
She  it up,  it, sets it on the cluttered desk, and
stops
There are wallet-sized  of Kimmy
Some alone
Some as a little girl
Some with Michael
And next to them
the plastic fold-out wallet inset
That he has not yet quite rearranged
So she picks it up
Leafs through, until she finds what she was praying would be there
Julianne grinning
Michael's arm around her
On the deck of a boat
They have drinks in their hands
Happiness in their eyes
And she stares at it
Jesus, God, how long has he carried this around
She flips through further, all the rest have her in them
Maybe half a dozen
Her heart is throbbing
Her eyes are damp
Back to the one on the boat
She slips it from the plastic window
Holds it
Then, gently
puts it back where it belongs
up the goddamn laptop
This is it, girl
Do or die
(murmurs) You wouldn't change your password, would you
You never change anything
Those words make her bite her lip
Damn, 'm becoming a senti- mental slob
in
(murmurs) Shoeless
Joe
Yes
We're in
Punching keys
Letters flying across the screen
Okay, we're ready
Types
(reads as she types) Mike
hate this downsizing shit as much as you do
But know this can't become as a complete surprise
- Through the window, the wedding party barbecue has extended into night
Lanterns, music, lots more food, lots more drinks
In the distance, on the sand, Michael is slowdancing with Kimmy
Some- where nearby, the soft  of keys
We   to see
a small clubby room
Books, leather, polished woods
Only two people here
Walter, looking on stony-faced, as a determined Julianne grimly "struggles" to "find" what she's looking for in Michael's laptop
And then
she stops typing
Looks at the text on the screen
Her eyes sharpen as she "reads" what Walter can't see
It's an Oscar performance for our desperate girl
She turns the screen around
(reads) Mike
hate this downsizing
He reads
Reads
Reads
All the air comes out of him
(softly) And Kimmy doesn't know
She shakes her head
Nope
No way
(signs) 'll tell her 've reconsidered
She nods, gravely
Right
He looks in her eyes
You're a smart girl, Jules
She forces up a fleeting smile of gratitude
But Walter isn't smiling at all
Wish my daughter
Bad your guts
'  - The hot saloon in Chinatown
Upscale, downscale, jammed, Michael and Kimmy at a small table in a far corner
on them
Sure you're okay
She looks really scared
Turns her drink in her hand
Looking down at it
It's not just a gag, huh
No, it's, uh
a real big favor
He takes her hand, tenderly
wish you'd just
come out with it
mean why are we waiting for Jules
She smiles up at him
The best she can
Moral support
She loves him so much, and she is sick with worry
What's good of having a big sister, if she
Stops
Gestures with her eyes
Because her big sister has just entered
looking fabulous
Julianne wears a long sleek sarong, slightly see-through
Her hair is bound up with silver pins
As she moves through the room toward us, we can see that, for once, her make-up is flawless, understated
When she arrives at the table
Michael is beaming, admiringly
He stands up
(softly) Wow and wow
You have a date, after this
Never can tell
He holds her chair
She exchanges an intimate smile with the anxious Kim
You make me think of that song, we used to
And he starts humming
The song is, "The Way You Look Tonight
" (singing) Someday
When 'm awfully low
They sit
He looks from Julianne to his bride
Okay, kid
You're on
Kim's eyes flick to Julianne, who nods, supportively
The kid takes a breath
It's really my father
Who needs the favor
His face sort of comes to a stop
Nothing she can read, yet
He nods, yeah
He's
he's reorganizing some of the divisions of the company
His eyes flick to Julianne
She looks down
(quiet) He never mentioned that
Neither did y
(blurting) and public relations is a big problem area for him
She can see it now
In his eyes
She just can't tell how bad
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust
Like family, huh
So quiet
So cold
She is terrified
It would only be, maybe, six months
Or three or four
It would mean so much to him
To him
She swallows
Straightens her spine
And to m
(sharp, to Julianne) and you knew about this
Real quiet
Against the noise of this place
think you ought to listen to her, Michael
This is her life, too
Just the thing
To bring that anger near the surface
He turns to Kim
Well, which is it
demand
Sharp
Accusing
She doesn't like that
You gonna tell me Daddy thought this one up
All of a sudden, 'm the only jerk alive who can help him deal with the press
She's trapped
Angry, scared
deer in headlights
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec
Michael
(near tears) am honest
Silence
All of a sudden, 'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans  had for my life
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans
He can't even believe he's hearing this
'm sure glad 'm hearing all this now, before it's too late
What is that sup
And what am  supposed to do with my life, huh
am 28 years old
work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately,  happen to fucking love
How inconvenient
Shrugs
No problem
little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, 'm a lap dog in high society
(softly) Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun
(whips around) Does it, really
How come you never took some sell-out establishment job
You had plenty of chances
Glares in her eyes
'll tell you why
Because that isn't you
And it isn't me, either
We're the same person
Back to Kim
What a sweet little picture
Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch
Well, if that's the way you f
Damn straight, it's how  feel
What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"
Or do  have to change my name to "Binky"
She's crying now
Real tears on her face
Great
Tears
The big equalizer
You wait till two days before the wedding to drop this on me, and 'm just supposed to roll over and drool
She is sobbing now
She can't help herself
Which makes him totally crazy
He jumps up
Fine
'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m
wrenching cry from her heart
It stops him cold
And before Julianne's astonished eyes, Kimmy reaches out a trembling hand
Michael, you are so
Choking back the sobs
so right
And  am so very wrong
Michael blinks
Julianne blinks
For different reasons
We can't go down two roads
And still be together
Her fingers stretch, beckoning
Uh, Kimmy
(ignores her) We settled this
And  reneged
That wasn't fair
Please, please, take my hand
You have to forgive me, and forget this ever happened
People are watching, staring
These two see only each other
or 'll die
frozen, forever moment
He steps to her
her up in his arms
Into the deepest, most heartfelt And as she clings to him, people begins to , and whistle, and laugh
Julianne
In her pretty dress
Closes her eyes
'   - Julianne in her nightshirt, her back to us, sobbing into her cellular as she paces the room
see that's what  never counted on
never heard of a brilliant moron before
We  as she  around, startling us with her grotesque day- glo  face mask
The green was better
mean, the little twerp Losing it
We know the drill
Clutching the phone
Michael and  are the same person
Self-absorbed and imperfect and vaguely loveable
We deserve each other
Tears are flowing
Which, over this mask, is not a pretty sight
'm out of hope, 'm out of sneaky ideas, 'm at the end of my rapidly-fraying hysterical little rope
Help m
She  over an open suitcase, and  from frame
The is slightly alarming
(
) God,  hate this hotel
On nothing is particular
(
) And  hate talking to your machine
'  - of Julianne asleep on the floor, sunlight streaming in
soft knocking on a door, somewhere nearby
She barely stirs
The knock becomes a strong , and she fights for conscious- ness
Her back still to us, she
rises,  to the door, which is now pulsing with an insistent , and  it , as we  to

Digger, watching impassively at the high-strung In the silence that follows
You stole my line
He touches his face, and she realizes
Oh, shit
Starts  at the overripe mask, but he grabs her wrists
Chill
We don't want your face coming off with it
Chill
Since when do you say ch
When 'm talking to children
She looks in his eyes
Realizing at last
You flew all the way h
noticed
'm on the noon back
We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons
(soft) You're butting in
He still holds her wrists
She brings one of his hands to her lips
Kisses his knuckles
(softer) really resent this
- Julianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as Digger gently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask paleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact
By the side of the half-filled sink, rests her plugged-in curling iron
What  mean, when  say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection
It is vulnerable and endearing
And that is annoying as shit
You like her
If  didn't have to hate her, 'd adore her
She looks up at him and , as the movement makes him scrape her face
He's sorry
Last night, she was crying, these big, real tears, when she thought she'd lost him
It was like there was a knife in her heart
Looking in his eyes
Needs him to hear
and  put it there
hated myself,  grieved for her, couldn't enjoy one second of it
And then, when it didn't work
Can you believe this
was devastated
(softly) Go figure you
Because  realized
When  see him say " do," that knife will be in my heart
And it will be there every
She holds his wrists now
To stop him
To plead for understanding
Forgiveness
every time  think of him, forever, which could be a lot
She almost choked on that last part
So she composes herself
You watch a guy caress his girlfriend's butt
You see an Old Spice commercial
Sentimental moments are everywhere, when you're in the right frame of mind
She swallows hard
Fights for a grip on her determination
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years
You've been working on this, huh
and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times
She sets her jaw
This is my whole life's happiness
have to be ruthless
(quietly) And you believe that
(unconvincing) Sure
His eyes are gentle and merciless at once
No way she gets off this hook
He was in love with me every day for nine years
can make him happier than she can
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about
(proudly) don't know the meaning of the word guilt
Impressive
am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor
She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus
The man you love
Beyond reason
The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts
Someday she'll thank you
Let's not get carried away
And the defenses drain from her clay-ravaged features
The real Julianne is glimpsed
'd settle for
Someday, 'll forgive myself
For
For doing this terrible thing
Her eyes tear up
Which, by the way,  can't figure out how to do
As the tears fall, he wipes at them, discovering

You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m
Oh
Guess what  brushed my teeth with last night
He thinks about this
Following her eyes to the toiletries kit, he browses for a moment
Zit cream

Neosporin
Try less appropriate

That was Thursday
He stops on that note
Elmer's Glue

can't even say it
Now
He's curious

The first word is "Preparation
" Then comes a letter of the alphabet, perilously close to
She reaches to test her curling iron,  her finger,
the appliance into the half-filled sink
She  for it, and a terrified Digger  her arm
Considering the circumstances, 'm not wholly against suicide
Huh
Just not by electrocution in front of me
Oh
've got this noon flight
He reaches to pull the plug from the wall, and now she  to grab his arm, slipping, her face falling forward, stopping an inch above the sink
How do you know you can touch that plug
Are you a licensed contractor
What do you suggest
She looks from the plug down the cord, to the submerged curling iron
And back
Maybe they just seal off this room
They have others
He's staring at her
Sweet, but intense
didn't mean about that
Oh
Again
If  hear the words "tell the truth," or any paraphrase thereof, dive into the sink and pull you with me
Looking at her
Looking at her
Let's go meet Michael
'll wait downstairs
- Julianne has cleaned up pretty good
She sits with Digger on a fashion-fabric sofa
They are side-by-side, studying something with equal concentration
And slight concern
suppose it's too late to start over
It's too late to start over
to reveal Michael in his wedding tux, submitting to a final fitting from a stylish fitter
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out
Like  said, dazzling
Is she going to dress you every day
Michael smiles over
Digger smiles back
They live each other
Yeah, it's in the contract
(softly) Well, then, 'll take it up with her
Michael motions, okay, c'mon over
Digger rises, goes to Michael, the fitter steps back as Digger shows him
The cut here, here
this line
Fingers lightly traveling over the lapel, the side-stitching, the cloth straight down the spine
trouser width, this is all classic
Which means safe, something 'd wear
should look different
You should look like you dressed yourself
Yes
Michael's grin is back
Playful and friendly
And 'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker
(quiet smile) Something like that
Julianne loves that the boy are getting on
(means this) Long trip
Pretty nice of you to come
Well, 'm close to her
wanted to meet the one that got away
Said so naturally
That embarrasses Michael, who looks down, his smile suddenly awkward
What
'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective
Steals a glance at Julianne
She rolls her eyes
What a goofball, my outrageous friend
(to Digger) Stay, huh
honestly wish  could
'll call George's parents
Tell them  need a best man who actually looks after me
Julianne comes over
(softly) They'd say that's my job
She runs her hands over his jacket, smoothing it everywhere
With tenderness that approaches transparency
Glances back at Digger
'll take it home from here
Pinches Michael's ear
Looks in his eyes
Two words
Major
Dish
Manicure
She looks down
Michael's nails are unclipped, with layers of impacted dirt
She touches his fingertips, a little more softly than she may have intended
Fly
Everyone looks down
She  Michael up
(to Digger) You don't miss much
Part of being a New Yorker
- Cutting edge salon
Loud,
Digger and Michael in adjacent chairs, heads back, each smoking impressive cigars as their hair is styled
Digger's stylist is a hot trashy female
Michael's is a tall, flamboyant male in a day-glo vest
Each man has one hand soaking, the other being worked on by a manicurist, so Julianne goes from one to the other, removing their cigars so they can exhale
seraglio feel to the way she does this
Now she's arguing with Michael's stork-like stylist
We can't hear over the music, but she keeps tugging on Michael's hair, pretty passionate about her point of view
Suddenly, she  the scissors to do it herself, and Michael
out of the chair
'  - Skycaps, guests of impatient travelers, a bus offloading forty Japanese tourists
taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb
Out jumps
Michael
Opening the door for Digger and Julianne
Digger says something, Michael gives him a strong
Julianne raises one finger to Michael, back in a second
Leads Digger off by the hand
on them now
Alone in the throng
Bye, handsome
Digger just stares at her
Those maddening judgemental eyes
You're going to say it, aren't you
Tell him you love him
With all your heart
'm taking my next book to Viking
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it
'm moving this book to Viking
Tell him you're afraid of love
Afraid of needing
Needing
To belong to someone
He touches her hair
We all do, beautiful
'm sorry about that
Staring in her eyes
Even Julianne has run out of words
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him
But there it is, and he has to choose
And what will he do
Digger isn't smiling
His voice low, beneath the crowd
He'll choose Kim
You'll stand by her at her wedding
You'll kiss him good-bye
And you'll go home
He holds up one finger
Almost touching her nose
This is what you've come to do
Now do it
Wow
She looks frightened and moved, all at the same time
She kisses him on the lips
And walks away
He watches her go through the crowd
Take Michael's hand
Lead him back toward the taxi
- The skyline of Chicago moves past us
Slowly
The  Tower, Cityfront Center
(
) Big weddings are so strange
(
) You keep saying that
Up ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer
(
) Kim has all this stuff to do, hardly see her
(
) Well, you've got the rest of your lives
they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down the Chicago River
Wind-blown
Close together
Getting your bed made
Every day
They smile at each other
Seem so comfortable together
You miss her, huh
No
've got you
She nods
That you have
Staring in her eyes
Don't you throw up on boat
If you like
And she  over the railing, emitting a  of incredibly disgusting sounds, her feet  in mid-air
He laughs, as he pulls her back down to the deck
Of course, it was all a joke
He brushes back her hair
Sighs
Stares
've been thinking a lot the last couple days
About us, actually
(casual) Have you
He has
Well
There's a lot of memories to choose from
It's more than that
That tightens her throat pretty good
When she tries to speak, out comes a dry  that makes him laugh again
Softer, this time
mean, it's embarrassing to say it this way, but
He stops
Her eyes  in a burlesque of anticipation
So he smiles
She knows how to put him at ease
You've sort of been
y'know, the woman in my life
(straight back) You've been the man in mine
Passing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge
No one knows quite what to say
And  was thinking this could be our last time
Alone
Together
You know
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year
Except for that
She's smiling so easily
Who would guess her stomach is double- knotted
can hardly wait for your wedding
Me either
She watches his surprise
Boy,  never thought 'd hear you say that
Can  come
She holds herself together
Real soft with
couldn't have it without you
He's glad to hear that
And then
It's normal to have
second thoughts, huh
To be scared
Is this a change of direction
Or is it the direction she's been praying for
wouldn't know
never had that many first thoughts
mean, you commit to a wedding
And then it seems like
this
momentum, you know
You forget you
chose it
She nods
Understands
You and
mean, in all our relationships with other people
We didn't use the word "love" a lot, did we
We didn't
Kimmy says
When you love someone
You say it, you say it out loud
Right now
Or the moment
Long beat
passes you by, yeah
She's a smart girl
Off in distance, the Centennial Fountain  an eight-foot of water across the river
For Michael and Julianne it goes unnoticed
We don't have a song
Hmm
Kimmy and
We don't have a song
Is that a bad sign
All Julianne can do is shrug
Then
(sings, softly) Someday, when 'm awfully low
And the world is cold
She doesn't want to cry
So she puts all the strength she has into fighting it back
(sings) will feel a glow just Thinking of you
And the way you look
Tonight
He stops
Smiles that sweet, boyish smile
Dance card filled
'll check
have it on powerbook, these days
He holds up his arms
And she moves into them
He begins to dance with her, turning so slowly
And, yes, people are watching
(sings in her ear) With each word, your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart
She holds him closer
Bites her lip
(sings) And that laugh That wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart
He stops
He looks at her
She's still in his arms
Where did we first hear th
(straight back) The night we met
Right to his eyes
The night we fell in love
He doesn't know what to do with that
So we heard it
like, right that
that first
We danced to it
Just like this
Just like this
long beat
And he has to say
won't lose you, will
Her eyes close
Then open
Utterly lost in his
No
Because  won't let you
- Julianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress shirt
Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through the Saturday-deserted office space
Desks, cubicles, monitors, silent
row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for the custodian
Turning a corner, we hear
life, at the end of the hallway
grand conference room with a glass wall
Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting for five
, his personal secretary, clicking every word into her laptop at warp speed
Walter sees Julianne through the glass
comic take of pleased surprise
He comes out to greet her
thought Michael was picking me up
told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring
'll collect the inconsequentials
Meaning, you
They smile at each other
Then
Kim said, when he turned down the job, there was no friction
Julianne thinks back
Friction
No
He smiles at her line reading
But his mind is always probing
haven't caused
a problem, have
Nobody has
So far
Her bright grin
His eyes linger on it
Well, you're a little early
need to make some calls
Could  use
your office
'  - Julianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city
Closes the door, quietly, behind her
So anxious, she is practically hyperventilating
She goes, slowly to the vacant cherrywood desk
Its computer and monitor standing silent
She is stalking it, like a deadly animal
And then
She is there
Talking to herself, her own desperate support network
(softly) You can do this
Sacred, filled with doubt and conflict
Her hands clutch at each other
Then, one flicks out
And the computer goes
The screen
Waits for her
Her mouth is sand, her stomach water
She pulls the paper from her pocket
looks at it
Looks to the monitor
And begins
To type
(mumbling to herself) -mail address
To Ben Isaacson, Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated, from
Walter Wallace
And stops
Her heart is thumping
See, you can do it
It's easy
Doesn't look easy
Licks her lips
You do it fast, it's over
Like it never happened
She sits
And recites as she types

To his own detriment, as well as ours, Michael will not accept our offer
While he works for you
She stands up
Stares at the screen
Walks away
Walks back
Still standing, types

The screen goes
The computer asks She tells the computer
Are you crazy
Get him fired
Types
The computer asks
And she types
Just till tonight when  bring him back
To look for
She glances to her huge bag
Rummages through, pulling out a manila folder
Lays it by the blank computer
Fans out a few pages in a natural, disorderly way
Takes a step back
And stares
Struck to her gut
But when she has done
- Walter alone with Deidre now, signing a stack of documents, as she efficiently places one after another before him
When he glances up, he sees Julianne wandering the halls
Stands, tells his secretary
(going through stack) Off to rehearsal
Send out this, and this, not this, this, and
that's it
Slips on his coat
Oh
and by the way
'm holding four or five -mails wrote over lunch
On his way through the door
Send 'em out
,    - Julianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic , pastel light slanting in through stained glass windows
We now see the full effect of her outfit, a man's-style chalk stripe , tailored to fit her body, set off by a bold silk tie
Solid dynamite
She hangs back, while Walter proceeds down the vaulted nave toward
Michael, Kimmy, Isabelle and Joe, who stand casually joking by the altar
Scattered around are assorted groomsmen, ushers, an obvious flowergirl
Coming toward us, up the aisle
the , early 40s, lean and quite attractive
Mandy is on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk, murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear
He's a really good sport, and really uncomfortable
Sammy is walking backwards, right in front of them,  her bag, and  to retrieve it, as if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display
Julianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice, until
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor
Mr
Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen
Today, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower
The minister extends his hand
Billy Dyer, Julianne
And love the suit
She shakes his hand, smiles graciously, but her eyes flick to Michael, now approaching up the aisle
The girls lead the minister away
Michael arrives
Looks her up and down
(softly) Takes me back
Well
She smiles
One that glows a little
You sang the song
Least could do was wear the outfit
He nods
Except now you're better- looking
Oh, yeah
Yes, ma'am
As she loses herself in his eyes
got the ring
He pulls the box from his pocket
Somewhere, an  sounds
And as he is about to hand her the box
/ (sing) Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow
Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot
Such exquisite two-part harmony, Michael stops to watch
/ (sing) Comin', to car-ryyy Me ho-o-o-me
It is amazing
Soulful vengeful sluts
He is enthralled
Julianne simply impatient
She wants his attention
No accents today
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act
Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard
She takes the box from his hand
Opens it, as the singing throughout
The ring is delicate hammered gold
One of a kind
Will she like it
(whisper) Yes
She's staring at the ring
(
) My groom-person
Your family needs you
His master's voice
He gives Julianne a smile
And goes
She's left with the box
Gazes at the ring
Lifts it out
/ (
, singing) Well,  look over yon-der, And what did  see-ee-ee
Slips it on her left hand
Ring finger
/ (
, singing) Comin too car-ryyy
Me ho-o-ome
Touches it
Turns it on her finger
So many emotions
/ (
, singing) It was a hand
Of a-a-angels
Coming' for me-e-ee
Tries to pull it off
/ (
, singing) Comin' for to carry me home
It won't come
Not even close
- on a bowl filled with squares of butter
the butt of conversation from a rowdy, friendly joint
Julianne's right hand to the bowl, fingers trace the rim innocently, then
the bowl into Julianne's lap beneath the table
Her right hand  all the butter into a gooey revolving mess
We can pick out familiar voices now, family in distance, the twins closer
As, hidden from view, Julianne brings
her left hand from her pocket
Yep
The ring is still there
The finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it off
And as  surrounds us, Julianne
her ring finger into the morass of grease, frantically at the ring, butter  on her pants, everywhere, as we   to see
the long table covered with butcher paper, the family at the far end, the twins down here with us, a mug of beer for each place, as team of waiters with heaping platters of , which they
across the butcher paper, as  continues from everyone but Julianne, who still struggles secretly
As the waiters set huge wooden  in front of each guest, Joe 'Neal rises, the table with his mallet for attention
Like to welcome ever'body to our little rehearsal supper
He , unaccustomed to public speaking
Walter and Isabelle clap and call out support
So Joe lifts his mallet
Okay, everyone stand up
And everyone does
With one exception
Trapped
She  her left hand in her coat pocket,  her right palm sort of clean on the underside of the table,  her mallet and
To the bride, uh, goes the honor
of cracking the first crab
Everyone applauses by banging their mallets
Joe  his high
Everybody imitates
But first, a toast
And everybody  up their beers with their left hands, as Julianne  her mallet with a  , grabbing her beer, looking up to
(on the spot) 'm right-handed
hugely embarrassing half-second
Bailed out by
To our host, my cuddly Papa Joe
All turns
Who taught me to play "Blue Hawaii
" On my nose
With a look at Julianne, Kim sets down her mallet gently, and performs a nasal  of the tropical standard, strikingly her nostril repeatedly for vibrato
It is charming, and everybody watches
- on an actual, living, if geriatric,
He blinks from his cage, bored as hell
the surrounding noise, chatter, Sinatra music, of a very large party
to see
and overdecorated , in dim and dramatic lighting, dripping with the trappings of
The mingling guests are the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party, most of them older women
They are served by wandering well-built in Roman togas or gladiator costumes
Julianne, still in her suit, hiding by a table piled with a carload of grapes
Her left hand still buried in her pocket
The eyes of a hunted animal
From nowhere
/ (
) Boo
She  a foot, both hands  , left one awkwardly slamming back into its pocket
The girls have snuck up behind her
They have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons wrapped around their bodies
know why you're scared of our party
It's too hip
Sinatra singing "Stranger In The Night
" Hugely-muscled, half-naked black and white studs, serving enchanted blue-haired ladies
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill
Walter supplied the decorative touches
(points out the jokes) Nose tackle from the Bears
power forward from the Bulls
defenseman from the Black Hawks
my personal favorite, the designated hitter
'm partial to the tight end
This is  Prime, largely available, beef
With no notice- able competition, present company excepted
Now they stare at her
With identical, really odd, smiles
And yet here you are
All celibate and reclusive
With those big, dark, haunted eyes
As if you were harborin' some
unspeakably
guilty
secret
Oh
Well, 'm worried about something
Something
Their expressions are deliciously, identically expectant
Oh
left this really important file in Walter's office
have to send my editor some
Some
figures
On territorial sales
To close my book deal
Uh-huh
So Kim gave me the key
And Michael's on his way, to drive me down to Wal
Oh
We thought it was the ring
Julianne blinks
Ring
The one you better get the fuck off your third finger left hand
Ah
That ring
Well
See
That was a
reflex to see if it would
(helpful) look good on Kimberly
Right
And then it didn't want to come off
Exactly
Maybe it's happy there
Oh the way out of the crab house
We asked Michael if we could see the ring
He said you told him
It'd be safer with you
An so it is
Julianne for once is speechless
To our amazement, the girls wear identical smiles of kindness and support
Shut up, sugar, he's on his way
Let's get to work
- Huge gleaming chaotic kitchen
Cooks, waiters, working at top speed
The three women  in, look around frantically, half the guys stop to ogle the twins
and industrial-sized jar of peanut butter
Julianne's hand in, halfway to the rolled-up sleeve at her elbow it around, real good
to reveal
she is surrounded by the twins and six guys, all conflicting instructions
Julianne  off the excess
Tugs for all she's worth
Nada
It won't budge
sous chef  her hand with a towel, a janitor  a tool kit onto the counter
it open, pulls out
a spray can of -40
Instantly, her hand is
The guy
No movement
He can't believe it
It's mental, lady, you ain't trying
Sammy is rummaging through her handbag, pulling out
There is nothing so tight, this can't help it
a tube of jelly
The letter -
Julianne just gives her a look
Mandy pushes through with a butcher's
saw this on Hard Copy
People cut off body parts and the hospital sew 'em back o
The look has turned toward her
(cold) saw the show
well, maybe it works on fingers, too
(
) Aunt Mandy
Everybody turns
The little girl in the doorway
Southern accent
Mr
Michael's here
Everything gets real quiet
Mandy takes charge
She rolls down Julianne's left sleeve,  the hem out of the cuff, so that it flaps down over her hand, covering the ring
Sammy wipes the black stuff from Julianne's fingers
Don't worry, baby
You could pick your nose with that finger and Michael would never notice
He's a man
The twins lead her off
We're on their backs for
(
) Personally,  think Mr
Michael's marrying the wrong girl
(
) You're much more his type
- through a heavy glass door of the empty, dimly-lit lobby
to see Julianne, just as she
the shit out of the glass
Almost breaks her foot
can't believe this
farther to see Michael still trying keys from a large key ring in the heavy lock
Sign over the door says
Traffic hustles by, oblivious to her suffering
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s
'
' ' And she  her whole  against the glass, making it rattle ominously
' She looks around wildly, hysterical
What is the big deal about getting this file tonight
good question
She needs a good answer
promised Digger 'd -mail him those figures
From his face, that wasn't it
They are very important figures
Apparently
He's just staring at her
'm up against a deadline
Me, too
'm getting married tomorrow
That's my point
Now
He really doesn't get it
mean, tomorrow
we'll all be busy with more important things
So
So
tonight's my last chance
He sighs
forgot how cute you look
When you get impossible
It's just
up there
right in front of Walter's
y'know, computer
If memory serves
Helpless
We could use
his computer, to
just -mail those suckers right ou
Tomorrow is Sunday
Nobody's doing business
Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there
Her eyes fill with tears
He is mystified
Smiles tenderly
(softly) Give it up, kid
Touches her hair
You can't win 'em all
And slowly, he takes her hand
Leads her way
She takes one backward glance at the locked door
Her last dream dies
,   - Michael and a disconsolate Julianne board the elevator
He presses 15, she pushes 11
Michael carries a handful of messages slips and an envelope
As the car starts up, she folds her arms across her chest, at the edge of tears
He doesn't know what to do
(gently) Listen up, huh
Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be
(voice nearly cracking) You're right
Easy come, easy go
He's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset
(softly) Jules
She won't look at him
She wants to die
The bell , the doors open to her floor
She just walks out
And he follows
They stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip trembling
She can't believe how close she is to losing it
This thing means that much to y
It means a lot
He nods
Okay
'll call the house, Walter's probably not even asleep
Her mouth drops
She can't believe this
'll drive you out there, we'll get the key, we'll go back to the office
She  her arms around his,  him so hard, so close
He laughs, she is so weird
She pulls back, beaming, glowing
Come on, we'll call from your room
She claps his hand
As they head down the hall
If  fall asleep on the altar tomorrow
He's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand
you better be there to
funny, these are all from Ben
She's at her door, turning the key
He looks at the envelope
The fax is from Ben, too
Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone
(entering her room) maybe it's congratulations
He follows her in, opening the envelope
Stops
Reads
And his face suddenly
freezes
To stone
(turning to him) Michael
What ha
(reading) Mike
can't believe 'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding
But  think you need and deserve to know
And he looks up to her
what you're marrying into
He hands it toward her
She takes it, hesitantly, and he walks past
Toward the phone
(reading) received the following -mail this afternoon
"Ben,  need a favor
My daughter's every happiness
" Her eyes   of her head
Holy shit
We can hear him  the phone
She keeps reading, it's all there
How did this happen
(
) Isabelle
need to talk to Kim
(reading) "Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down
" (
) 'm just tired
Please put her on
Thanks
(reading) "Maybe you should take the job
And dump the girl
" And when she turns
Jules
Could you give me a minute
He looks more sick than angry
As if the heart has just been cut out of him
She doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands, staring dumbly
Please
She nods, stumbles out of her room, closing the door behind her
Now she's in the empty corridor, clutching her big jumbled bag, sinking down to sit on the carpet, her back against the door
She doesn't look elated
She seems frightened, distraught, and most of all, confused
Because she can't understand why
She digs absently through her bag
Cigarettes
Box of matches
She lights up
Draws deeply
Somehow, she seems near tears, and laughs bitterly at that
Shakes her head at how fucked-up she finds herself
Squeaking wheels approach, but she is too lost to hear them
Miss, are you locked out, or something
She looks up
small, wiry man of nearly 60, in a slightly faded but neatly-kept uniform
On his cart, a ton of bags
No,  just stepped out, because
it's a non-smoking room
And inhales deeply
Leans back against the door, to look up at him more comfortably
(politely) Well, it's non-smoking floor, too
Maybe you could go to the
(seriously) Why don't you have me arrested
That wasn't sarcastic
He doesn't know what to say
mean that
Arrested, convicted, put in solitary
Another puff
See, 'm a dangerous, criminal person
do bad things to honest people
This, see, this smoking
Tip of the iceberg
Waves her hand
Make a citizen's arrest,  won't struggle
It'll be like getting Al Capone on tax evasion
Now she seems angry
But not at him
Her eyes fill with tears
Can
Can  help you, miss
She squints at his nameplate
Do you smoke, Richard
Yes, ma'am,  do, but it's
a non-smoking floor, yeah
Well, you know what
And she takes the cigarette from her lips
Turns it around, holds it out to him
Go ahead
He doesn't move
Please
And so
he reaches down, takes the cigarette from her hand
Staring in her eyes, he takes a deep drag
Savors an expert nostril-inhale of his exhaled smoke
Hands the cigarette back to her
My grandmother always said, "This, too, shall pass
" She swallows
Wipes at her eyes
Finds a smile
Thanks, Richard
If you weren't on duty, 'd buy you a drink
He just nods
She waves
He waves back, pushes his cart down the hall
As she watches him go, the door behind her suddenly , and she
through it, flat on her back at Michael's feet
Staring up at him, seeing that he looks as bad as she feels, she takes raw, deep drag
What happened
(softly) It's over
And crouches down
Close beside her
The cigarette drops from her hand, unnoticed on the carpet
So he lifts it, crushes it on the heel of his shoe
want you to quit this shit, it'll kill you
She just nods, obediently
Okay,  will
She denied it
Said  was crazy and paranoid
bad combination
He tries to smile
It's really hard
There's this big brunch tomorrow morning
At her place
He lets the air out
Slow
So he won't cry
She said "How can  call everything off, what do  tell everybody
" Shakes his head
Can you imagine that
Michael
No, it's for the best, it really is
We were so wrong for each other
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway
She couldn't have lived with it know that now
Julianne nods
Maybe that part is right
Maybe it would have ended anyway
Maybe she can pretend she's not a monster
And she's right, 'm crazy to fall for someone
hardly knew
Looks deep in her eyes
He's so glad she's there
Hey
You still got that ring
She holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away
The ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw
tried it on
But it won't come off
He smiles at that
sad smile of friendship
Then takes her finger gently
into his mouth
It is something like a kiss
And when he removes her moistened finger
he pulls the ring
Nothing to it
She blinks
It's mental, you know
He doesn't understand that
Should we take a walk
Or maybe some food sent up, or something
just want to be alone
Is that okay
She nods, sure
He kisses her cheek
Stands up
Maybe 'll go back to New York
Hang with you for awhile, huh
Ben'll understand
She nods again
Whatever you say
He steps into the open doorway
Or we'll go somewhere
If you have the time
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento
They smiles at each other
For real
've never been to Texas
Imagine that
The look holds
Just above a whisper
Thanks for coming to my wedding
And then he's gone
'  - Julianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror, eyeing her image with evident dissatisfaction, as she listens to the receiver (
) Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning
Brevity is even more in order than usual
Hey, handsome
Brevity this
Her eyes find the pack of cigarettes
Next to her toiletries kit
(softly) won
Her fingers touch the pack
As if an object of significance
Takes it up
Amazing, huh
didn't do things quite your way
But
got it down
Cradling the phone against her shoulder, she carefully tears the top of the pack completely open
And forty years and nine grand- children later, when  sit with Michael on some rustic porch, slogging through our sweet swamp of nostalgic memories
Reaches the pack toward the toilet
No one is going to sweet the details
Turns it upside down, emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john
Of one weekend in Chicago
Drops the lid with a
Hits the
Talk about celebration
She lifts a tube from her toiletries kit
Stares at it, real close
'm gonna brush my teeth with actual toothpaste
Turns it over, reads all the writing
Yep
guess 'm too exhausted to feel the elation  so richly undeserve
Squeezes some paste onto her brush
Carefully
So 'm gonna hold calls at the desk
while  get my
Start brushing
(around, her mouthful) God, it is toothpaste, they should sell this stuff commercially
Anyway, a girl does need her
Squints at her image
Laughs, spewing a little foam
well, we're a bit past worrying about beauty sleep
Let's just settle for not frightening small animals
She
Tells Digger's machine
Anyway,  couldn't have done it without you
Even though did, if you follow that
Wipes her mouth
Stares off
The eyes a little dreamy
Three words:  Happily
Ever
Well, you know
: - Julianne sprawled all over the bed, mouth open like a carp, sleeping mask against the daylight
sudden  at the door, and she
sits
Utterly disoriented, until she pulls off the mask
Stumbles out of bed, walking toward the firm , when
it stops
message slip  beneath her door
She lifts it, barely conscious
This wakes her up
In one
(to the slip) You're going where
- Julianne climbs from her taxi
Only slightly in awe, she sets off past the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone and timber
It's a hike today, because the circular drives is clogged deep with Bentleys, Mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance trucks, catering and florist and food vans
- Julianne escorted into an enormous room, where brunch is in progress for more than a hundred
She looks from the vaulted ceilings, to the frescoed walls, the inlaid floors, the massive pipe organ above the stone staircase, the oil portraits of Scottish ancestors and their favorite dogs
Isabelle has risen from the main table, and comes to her
All smiles
Julianne is in the Twilight Zone
What are these people laughing about
Do they still think there's a wedding
Jules
We're so glad you slept in
Takes her arm graciously
This woman would make Anne Bancroft look coarse
As they walk
Now, you have a choice
The idea is bride and groom shouldn't see each other on the magic day
Julianne looking all around
Magic day it seems to be
Where the bell is a bride or a groom
So Michael stays put in the garden
Kimmy stays in here
Pointing
she is, obscured by a cluster of the appropriately fawning
She has the same hunted eyes and false, slightly manic smile Julianne wore yesterday
This, at least, makes sense
(
) and the guests go back and forth
Where will you start
on Julianne
Watching the brave, frightened bride
She looks tense
(
, calmly) Nerves
would never have guessed
- steward leads Julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden, altogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic tables, where nearly a hundred guests casually dine, served by rolling carts
There, at the head table, Michael staring at us
He looks like a poor attempt to cover a hard night
She locks onto his eyes
What the hell is going on
He looks helpless, miserable
She gestures with her head, follow me
Stalks off
- Bronze abstract pieces, some quite large, face a huge set of children's swings, regulation playground size
Julianne sits in one, moving slightly back and forth
Trying to hold on to her temper and her sanity
In the distance, trucks are winding their way to and from the pond, where crews are setting up tents, lights, heaters for tonight
The circus has come to town
When she looks back
Michael approaches
Before he can draw a breath
had the craziest dream last night
Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to
Look,  came down here to face everybody
didn't want to slink away like some coward
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch
She hasn't told anybody, what am  supposed to do
Get married, apparently
She comes  the swing,  him back two feet
What the hell are you thinking of, the goddamn wedding is '
He swallows hard
Trapped
This is her family and her fault
And your point
(ten years old) Well
How come she didn't
' , He just blinks
Hey
This is a serious matter
Thank you
She  his chest, punctuating
'll be right back
- modern take on the Medieval castle kitchen, towering ceilings, dark wood, copper pots hanging, a series of walk-in coolers and freezers
The place is a madhouse of activity, as prep cooks slice, chop, sort, every kind of food imaginable, and delivery teams bring more
The girls walk through
Alone together in the eye of the hurricane
Kim choked with excess sentiment
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk
Kimmy's lip trembles
This is not how she thought of her wedding
The din is so horrific, Kimmy leads them into a walk-in meat locker
Even here, two  are dressing Eastern-fresh corn- fed carcasses
You guys want to give us a minute
The men blink at each other
We'd like to be alone with our pork
On that basis
They leave
Kimmy sits on a stack of packaged frozen fowl parts
Stares up with big, sweet, wet eyes
How's he doing
Julianne cannot believe this
Who
The jerk who's running your life
This must be
very, very, hard on him
What with the psychosis and all, yeah
Leans in
Listen
When are you gonna come clean with your folks
Don't you see
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man
", that's considered poor form
that this is all my fault
Stops Julianne cold
Your fault
Whatever delusions  drove him to, there is truth at the heart of it
want him to work for my father
want to stay in school
want a life of my own
Harder and harder for Julianne to push
Her mouth is dry
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat
love him
Fragile and strong at once
plea
Tell him it's my fault and that  love him
long beat
'll be right back
- The court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's
There are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all directions, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread across the top of the court's chain-link fence
Michael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a prisoner, as Julianne comes through the gate
From somewhere, we hear high, squeaky, alien voice-like
Incongruous against
How is she
Julianne absorbs this
As the bizarre  continue, she around
We now see three   , who have been filling the endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court
Clearly, they've been inhaling their working materials
(Minnie Mouse) ,
Nazi salute
When she turns back
asked you
She admits it's her fault
He absorbs that
And then
Do you think she still loves me
We watch the struggle inside her
Her voice drops
Sure, she does
She's crazy about you
Now tears stand in both their eyes
The stoners are doing their Alvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the
, singing in castrato harmony
But our two don't notice
keep asking, how can  explain what happened
And  keep getting that same answer all night long
Which is
can't
And it doesn't matter
drove her to it, because want things my way
And even if she did something tricky and unfair
she was blinded by love, okay
Julianne swallows
For obvious reasons
Does that make it right
Love doesn't have to be right
It just has to be love
The stoner are now helium-crooning "Bridge Over Troubled Waters
" Actually, they're getting better
She's giving up half her life for me, and 'm bitching because it hurts her
(singing) Sail on silver girl Sail on by
She's a saint
And 'm a worthless ingrate
(singing) Your time has come to shine, All your dreams are on their way
Tell her
'll marry her at six o'clock, if she'll still have me
The stoners blend on the high note
It's pretty moving
'll be right back
- along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents
Nearly twelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the diners in the Great Room, extending al the way to
an organ loft
Alone, above the noise of the party, Julianne and Kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase
Trapped between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth organ
Dwarfed by their surroundings, Kimmy draws the hardest breath of her life
(whispers) So
What did he say
Julianne's eyes move over the young girl's face
He said
Marry me
Kimmy  in her ecstasy,  herself against Julianne, and they go  full length across the organ's pedals,  the room with a   of china-rattling volume and horrifying disharmony
As grown men and women  in spontaneous terror below, Kimmy begins to
And  and hug her new sister
And holds her tight
- Julianne and Michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking , ringed with  that dig heavy branches to the water's surface
He is relieved, reflective
Head down, he never notices that she is
dangerously freaked
Too petrified even to hyperventilate, we're lucky she's breathing at all
We watch her life unraveling before her glassy eyes
(never looks up) Thank God you were here
(mumbles to herself) Oh, yeah
was so confused, so conflicted, so
unstable
Well, it happens
They pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking area
Family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans
Everything that couldn't fit on the circular front driveway
might have thrown away
Searching for the right words
your one chance for true happiness
yeah, that
You never want to do that, see, that's always a
costly turnover
As they say in the sport biz
There's a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice
He hears that now, and looks at her
Maybe he can't tell she's frightened
But he can tell she's something
(softly) Are you okay
She stops walking
She can't look at him, so she looks around
Across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly- colored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and chairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be strung
At the center of it all
a huge topiary White Sox batter, just completing a murderous swing
He's maybe fifteen feet tall
She points to it
The Big Hurt, huh
Nellie Fox
Walter likes the past
And he likes the little guys
So Julianne nods
Because she does too
Squints up at Michael
Got a minute
He nods, you bet
Worried for her
What is this
She looks in another direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached
a stage that's been set up for the band
Chairs, music stands, sound equipment
gleaming dance floor, already in place over the lawn
Next to it, a shimmering white
Like the centerpiece of a wedding cake
Why is the dance floor by the gazebo
She takes his hand
They walk toward it
Kimmy's idea
She thought it would be such a romantic place
For our wedding dance
Looking down at her
What's up
Shhh
Up the white steps now
Together
The gazebo floor has been covered with hardwood
The perfect place
For a wedding dance
And Julianne
turns, suddenly
He almost runs into her
She is staring up at him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart
He is caught, transfixed by the intensity in her eyes
have to say this quick, okay, or 'll have this massive coronary and you'll never have to hear it
Which you need to
Does that make any sense at all
The coronary part does
We can feel her heart beating from here
Jules, what's wrong
This is the dumbest thing  will ever do
So dumb, in fact, that can't
don't think
And then, she does
She puts her hands flat on his chest
Looks in his eyes
Michael,  love you
heartbeat passes
've loved you for nine years, but  was too arrogant and scared to realize it
Now 'm just scared
He stares at her, dumbstruck
She moves even closer
know this comes at an inopportune time, but  have to ask this one really gigantic favor, okay
Holds her breath
And
Choose me
Marry me
Let me make you happy
And in a half beat of excruciating silence
know
It sounds like three favors
His eyes are loving
They care for her
She swallows, lost in them
But when you think about it
Slides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth
to his
The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer
All of her heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body
a  rips the world to pieces
They whirl to see
, halfway up the path
Her hands across her mouth, as if to stem the horror that pours forth as she  from her soul, and
runs
Back Down the path
Michael  after her, her name
frozen moment, and
Julianne   after him
All three running, their various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop to watch from neighboring countries
Kimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead
into her convertible and  , just  up the gravel as she  out of sight
No way to catch her
Still
Michael is racing for the cars
Julianne, sprinting her guts out, losing ground with every stride
Michael  into a Cherokee
, ', ' He  the gears
She keeps
His engine
He
She keeps going
Gasping for air, clutching her side, she's dying here
Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit
Next, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus
(to the world at large) ' Up ahead, Michael has  the Cherokee
She still has a chance, to the next van
, a handsome rendering of a rat above the   warning  the door open
Stumbles in
Keys
(
) ,
Michael  away
She  the ratmobile in gear
off
,   - Julianne tearing through traffic, desperately struggling to keep Michael's Cherokee in view, while she shrieks into her cellular
Down the block, Michael  around a corner
We follow suit to see his destination dead ahead
Union Station
The intrudes
(
) Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie, how we cookin' on that Skokiie infestation
Now she's steering the car, tearing at the radio controls, and screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder
(
) Copy, dispatcher
(
) Uh, what happens if you got that methyl-ethyl shit on your hands
Michael  into the train station's parking lot
We around a taxi,   Harley,  into the lot
(
) Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds before you're sterile
For God's sake don't touch yourself, or anything
Up ahead, Michael is  of his jeep and running
She  on the brakes,  herself against the wheel
(
) Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra
It wasn't bees in the gal's wall, it was cats
She  the door open
(
) She says gas 'em, anyway, she'll pay cash
Uh
how do  pay this
Julianne now,  through the lot, Michael vanishes the Station, she  in after him,  off bystanders, apologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion, threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk, catching a lucky glimpse as he heads
a staircase to the
My God, what's he doing second wind, fueled by panic, and she  after him,  down the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the concourse to see him, running for
Track 29, a train already , ready to pull out, she after him
He  behind the train, she , skids, springs up, pushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train But he's just standing there
His back to us
Watching it go
Her body nearly collapses with relief
She pushes herself on, but her legs aren't working right in their maxed-out fatigue, and she lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him
He's still lost in thought, staring after the train
She tries to speak, but there's no breath
So she puts her hands on her knees and just  for air like a dog
Wheezing, panting, trying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually turns and
out of his skin
heart attack seeing her
(croaks) Don't speak
He just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure
Uh
saw that moving
'
both her hands across his mouth
frozen beat
He nods, okay
Cautiously, she takes her hands away
At least she has made him smile, in spite of everything
At least she's done that
have to make a confession
Another confession
Besides that  love you
This is even worse
This
He's waiting to hear
The -mail
You thought Walter sent your boss
wrote that
You
Synapse overload
You're not saying you actually
you're saying that y
(stricken with remorse) wrote it, yeah
'm the bad guy
She nods her head wildly, hair flopping
Bigger nodding
Shakes her head, like a two-year-old
(pacing in circles) mean, do you realize what you've
well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing,  mean
mean
how could you do that
didn't know it would get sent
just wanted you to
get mad at Kimmy
and
And watching
As this begins to sink in
've done nothing but slimy, underhanded, despicable, not even terribly imaginative, things
Ever since  got here
Trying to
Staring in his eyes
Eyes she can't read at this point
to win you
To win you back
Tears in her own eyes now
Big ones
And  was blinded by love
Like you said
Shaking her head
But that doesn't excuse any part of it
am pond scum
No
Actually
Lower
am the fungus that feeds on pond scum
Lower
The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung
Lower
(agreeing) Lower
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus
And to her amazement
The trace of a smile
(softly) On the other hand, thank you
She blinks at that
Which squeezes out a tear
For loving me that much, that way
He shrugs
Just above a whisper
It's pretty flattering
Except it makes me fungus
Well, that part  knew
She's never loved him more
So you have to marry Kim
Because she will actually make you happy
, in contrast, am a shallow, neurotic psychopath, with relatively little to offer
Okay
Kim
Nod your head
Do as you're told
He nods his head, still smiling
Her tears are running now
Maybe she doesn't notice
Just promise you'll never tell me who you would have chosen
If  hadn't confessed
She chokes back a sob
Cos if you would have chosen me
Then  threw away a perfectly good life
Just to be a decent person
Which is a questionable trade-off
Right
He nods, slowly
Because he's supposed to
And if you would have chosen some 20-year-old punk over me
'd have to kill myself
Ah
His smile keeps getting smaller
More loving
More wonderful
(whispers) 'll take it to my grave
Good
She looks around
'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before
came here, looking for her
For her
The words leave a silence
Why would she come here
This is where  proposed
Stares deep in her eyes
She needs to hear this
had to cover a game in Milwaukee
She saw me off
And when the train started to leave
jumped up on the step,  help the handle, and without
He grins
Has to admit
without a thought in my head
shouted, "Marry me
" did
Now her eyes tear up again
And she doesn't know why
And she gasped, and covered her mouth, and the train was pulling out, and suddenly she screamed Just once
And blew me a kiss
What a girl
never forgot that
It's two weeks
Almost three
That is so romantic
Which makes him reach and touch her hair
just wonder if you know why
Do you
It's because romance isn't mystery, and tricks, and doubts, and halting, unspoken longings
That's not the real romance
Tears in his eyes now
First time
The real romance is saying yes
Does she know that now
He looks at his watch
(sighs) Woulda been a nice wedding
Oh
That
(urgently) You can't believe you've lost her
Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, 'd hate to be you at six o'clock
(beat) You've got a lot of explaining to
'm just thinking of how she's hurting
Lost
Alone
Like her life is over
That's little egotistical
He glares at her
But, undoubtedly accurate
She claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency
Okay, we'll split up
You go to every romantic place you guys have, 'll go
someplace brilliant, and the first one who
If you find her
Strange tone
gentle warning
The kiss
May be hard
For you to explain
(beat) Because the only fear she really has, is
me, yeah
And she likes Tommy Lasorda
Case closed
Looks at her own watch
Shit
But if you do get to her first
She looks up
There is something you are authorized to say
- Julianne sits on the fender of this guy's taxi
The driver smokes, paces, while she waits for a connection on her cellular
Then
(
) Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you
(
) Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey
Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty
shallow laugh
(
) Or crying in her nachos, down at Comskey Park
Julianne's face  to alert
Ex-cuse me
(
) had this crank call
From some guy who thinks he saw her
said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding
You are so right
What a nerve on that guy
Bring my dress to church, huh
Signals the driver, let's
want to pick up a little something for the ceremony
,   - Game in progress
Julianne and the bodyguard stand in the doorway of the deserted skybox
Everyone Walter knows is going to a wedding
The box is empty except for one cardboard container of nachos, extra cheese, sitting alone before a pulled-back chair
She wouldn't confide in me, so  called the house
He sighs
Feels terrible about all this
Luckily,  got her cousin
Julianne nods
Yeah, big break, there
Going to the john, she said
Could be there awhile
'  - Julianne  into the enormous chaotic restroom
Looks around wildly, no sign of Kim
Everybody stops
Pays attention
Silence
From the long line of stalls
(
, sobbing) In here, you bitch
Now everybody's really interested
Julianne ignores them, strides to the stall
, like it's a door
No answer
Let me in, baby, or 'll rip this damn thing off its non- code-compliant hinges
(
) '
Some scattered
From down the line
(
, still sobbing) Over here, nitwit
Oh
Scattered laughter
Julianne moves down the line
Stares at the door
We hear the soft, muted crying from within
Slowly, Julianne
drops to her knees
Bends her head low
under the door
What she sees, prompts a sad warning
Incoming
And she crawls  the door, on her belly
We go  her to see
Kim fully dressed, perched on the closed toilet lid, her knees drawn up, her arms around them
Pitiful
And pulls herself up to her knees
Kimmy tries to glare, but it just isn't in her
Haven't you done enough
The world gets real quiet
An entire bathroom is listening
Julianne cocks her head to one side
In one minute
You are going to feel so foolish
' Have you ever heard of
Irony
Irony
Kimmy sniffles
threw my arms around your husband
And kissed him with all my heart
Because  was so happy
For you
Nitwit
And leans close
As Kimmy flinches
(whispers) He's going to take
(big grin) The job
stunned pole-axed moment
And Kimmy's eyes  open
You mean
(beaming) With your dad, yeah
Can you guess why
Bitch
Everything inside Kimmy  free in a torrent of tears
And , sobbing, into Julianne's arms
beat, for Julianne to reflect, and then she strokes her tenderly
Well, of course, he loves you
Kisses the top of Kimmy's head
(very soft) Hell, even  love you
Kimmy holds her tight
From her heart
never want to go through this again
That's entirely understandable
outside the stall
Julianne's feet sticking out under the door
(
) Shit
The two  out of the stall, hand-in-hand, at a desperate past us
them  out the door, and
five stalls
Women exit, crying
- taxi pulls up in front of an ivy-covered , fronted by nearly a hundred souls, milling about in attitude ranging from overstimulated curiosity to clinical hyperanxiety
Our girls  out of the cab, and half the crowd starts running toward us, twins in the lead
Whatever hap
(cutting this short) We were bonding, we lost track, we're officially sorry, now let's put it behind us
Kim  at her mom by the chapel entrance
And takes Julianne's hand for support
Believe me, we got a bride who's worth waiting for, yes
Everybody nods
Out of our way
- White
Pure blinding white
Across  floats more white, this gauzy and ethereal
It settles, its roots planting deeply in the bride's hair
to
the face of the woman who placed it there
Julianne's eyes, appraising this bride we cannot see
And so softly
Don't worry, sugar
Don't worry
When he looks at you, it will be as if
The words stronger
Because there is no smile
he's never seen a woman before
the white until we are
on the bride's perfect slippers
And
- Begins to slowly    the length of an exquisite gown
We can tell from the organ, the nearby thrum of expectant voices, that we are nearing the moment
We reach
Kimmy's hand
Firmly clasping Walter's
Keep , the bodice, the lace, her throat, and finally, we are  on
the face of the bride
Now we understand the word radiant
We also understand scared senseless
Our perfect, unflappable Kimmy is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic seamlessly blend
The organ's noddling stops
Kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small animal bearing a predator approach her thicket
Suddenly, the The Wedding March from Wagner's Lohengrin
Here
Comes
The bride
And we
Kim and Walter
This is it
(whispers) Left foot
Kim's , the chapel, every pew packed, every neck craning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to where
Michael waits
Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness
From which he attempts a smile
Not comforting
Kim's    the groomsmen, the twins,   on Julianne, standing strong and beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress
She sends her little sister a  across the trackless miles of aisle
You can do this, kid
So
Kimmy does
On her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the world's intrusive admiration
One step at a time
The most beautiful she will ever be
She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw up at the same time
And she's there
At his side
She glances back to her maid of honor, just to make sure she's not working without a net
So Julianne
her eyes
Which lets the kid smile and finally take a breath
Have a little fun, huh
Kim nods, got it, turns to
The Minister
Who stands before them with a calming presence
Thank God someone has done this before
The crowd has hushed
The Minister's eyes are only for two
His words are for all
Michael and Kimmy wrote these words
She asked me to confide, mostly Michael
ripple of laughter
Gentle and fine
They are setting in
So he gets to say them
surprise
pleasant one
The crowd adjust in its seats
As Michael begins
Why do people get married anymore
And on these words
We  to Julianne
Share her interest in the bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning
(
) Why not live together amicably, with no sense of obligation beyond the moment
Her eyes
She's listening
(
) As long as the sex is good
As long as no one more interesting has wandered into view
As long as the thousand conflicts of two individual wills remain comfortably compromised
now
Other faces
Isabelle
Proud to the bone
(
) And when one feels the urge to move on, to explore the new
No guilt, no disgrace, no promise broken
Walter
His eyes damp
Against our expectation
(
) No agony of having dishonored a time
When our hearts
And the world were different
Joe nods, as he hears
(
) Marriage is a lot to put up with
Julianne once more
No breath
Rapt
(
) The answer must be
That there is some need basic to the human heart
That embracing
the obligation of commitment
fulfills
Her eyes have clouded
As if Michael is talking to her
(
) Some need to belong to one another in a way which rages against the notion
that all is impermanent
Against the notion of mortality
And suddenly,  the feeling rises in her throat
(
) Our love is bigger
And longer
Than life itself
And the tears come
They come freely, unhidden, unnoticed
As if they were needed
Michael now
Looking at his bride
That's what we want
And marriage
Is what we do about it
Kimmy smiles at him
With love bigger than life itself
We are fools in this
Thank God Almighty
He is done
There is a silence
Boy, that was good
People
The Minister holds up a sheet of paper
For the crowd to see
Mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink
Michael and Kim also edited what they want me to say
More laughter
The idea was, we're only marrying once
We have to remember it forever
Let's keep to the good stuff
(squints at the sheet) You may kiss the bride
Bigger
The Minister waves this off, his little joke
Turns to the best man, pantomimes the ring
As the hammered gold circle is handed to Michael, Julianne absently scratches her still- swollen finger
Mandy taps Julianne on the arm, and produces
a matching ring
Take it
Gives it to her
So Julianne steps forward
Places the second ring into Kimmy's waiting hand
Their eyes meet, and hold throughout
(
) If anyone here can show just cause why this man and woman should not be married, speak now
Or forever hold your peace
Julianne  her throat
Kimmy's heart flutters
In the silence
Julianne's wonderful smile
Just kidding
Michael reaches for Kim's hand, turns her gently to him
Places his ring on her finger
Holds her hands
Kimberly
promise to love
And respect and comfort you
To hear your voice and your heart
Until we are parted by death
She swallows
Smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile
Fumbles slightly, putting the ring on his finger
Michael
promise to love and respect and comfort you
To hear your voice and your heart
Until we are parted by death
Staring in each other's eyes
moment so fragile, the Minister waits an extra beat
For the record, you each agree to marry the other
(quickly) do
(smiling) do
The Minister joins their right hands
We haven't said much about God this evening,  know
But He is here
And He is happy
To bless His wonderful children
now on Julianne
For the inevitable moment
(
) In that Michael and Kimberly have given themselves to each other by solemn vows, and the exchanging of rings
Unnoticed by the world
Her eyes are close
(
) pronounce them husband and wife
Those whom God has joined together, let no one put asunder
The eyes open
Wet, brave, ready for
(
) Now
Kiss the bride
Julianne watching
As Michael does
- This is what all the preparation was for
Tables, lights, balloons, the guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo
The bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy
Two who are one
the stage, the band playing
Julianne conferring with the twins and the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions
Then, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone
it, for silence
The band stops
The dancers follow
All eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor
She looks to the couple
Just below her
Then, to the crowd
'm a writer, too, not as good as Michael
But  do steal from quality
She raises her glass
Everyone at the table does the same
This is to my best friend
On the occasion of his wedding
Shouts of support, a few whistles
Silence
She tells Michael
If  have truly come to know your bride as my new sister
This is in her heart
She has to stop
Swallows
Because she will not let herself cry
"Understand
'll slip quietly away from the noisy crowd when see the pale stars rising, blooming, over the oaks
" Deep breath
Looks in his eyes
"'ll pursue solitary pathways through the pale twilit meadows, with only this one dream: You come too
" hush
applause
From four hundred hands
But not from his
He is too moved
Too understanding of what he has heard
don't have a wedding gift
But this is on loan
Until you two find your song
And with that the band begins
The opening phrases of a song we have come to know
Michael seems overwhelmed
Julianne nods toward the gazebo
Michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into his arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to applaud an unscheduled wedding dance
/ (singing) Someday, when 'm awfully low, And the world is cold, will feel a glow just thinking of you, And the way you look tonight
Soft two-part harmony
As perfect as the words
/ (singing) You're lovely
With your smile so warm, And your cheeks so soft, There is nothing for me but to love you, Just the way you look tonight
Julianne can cry now
Because she's tied with half the place
/ (singing) With each word, your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart
And the laugh that wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart
Julianne begins to sing
Unheard
Unseen
Even by the man she's singing to
// (singing) You're lovely, please don't ever change, Keep that breathless charm, Darling, please arrange it, cos  love you
Just the way you look tonight
The band keeps playing
The dance goes on
Two people lost in each other
The way it's supposed to be
- Bedlam
Julianne caught in the middle of the throng
young couple, dressed for travel, appear at the top of the staircase
The  are deafening
The bride has her bouquet
she spots Julianne far below
it her way, Julianne reflexively
not a fucking chance
The twins nearly  her in the stampede, Mandy  the prize from Sammy's grasp
Everyone , and then the couple is
down the stairs,  through the crowd with a protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door, for freedom
Julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple, struggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty that she will never see him before
And then, he's
He has Julianne in his arms
Holding her so tight
An embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad from the confusion alone
Against the din, he murmurs in her ear
Wherever  go
However far
She sobs
Holds him
Deep, deep breath
You win a few, you lose a few
Some get rained out
And to her surprise
(
, very softly) You have a good time
To her greater surprise
There are a few tears left, after all
did what  came to do
(
, even softer) Good girl
She just can't speak now
So she doesn't
(
) was thinking
Maybe you might visit us for awhile
We've got the room made up
This fucking guy
God, she loves him
'll think about it
'm okay
(
) Oh, you're more than okay
Just above a whisper
You, too
And with the last of her strength
If the sun comes up, 'll see you tomorrow, huh
chuckle
At the other end
(
) 'll play those odds
You have sweet dreams
We hear the
She turns her back on the stars
Shoulders straight
Chin up
She walks from frame
