Written by Gustin Nash July 13, 2007 comes the sound of deep
Moist accompaniment
Someone is beating off
pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine
The beating off resumes at a quickened pace
The  of bed springs joins in
Another page is turned
Feverish  until a lets out a quiet
The breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a relieved sigh of finality
(
) My name
is Nick
, 16, stares up at the ceiling
He's glassy eyed from the exertion
'  - sprawled on the bed, trousers around his ankles, a well thumbed issue of Penthouse covers his privates
(
) My last name, which  loath, is Twisp
Nick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed
He pulls the drawer under his mattress out
(
) The next thing you should know about me is that  am obsessed with sex
view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly filed issues of Penthouse and Hustler
He puts the most recently utilized magazine in its place
(
) Lately,  have become morbidly aware of my penis
Nick posing in front of the mirror, pants around his ankles again
He looks at himself from various angles
(
) Once a remote region accessed indifferently for micturition, it has developed overnight into a gaudy Las Vegas of the body
We  , and where Nick's crotch is supposed to be, there is a hole in the screen leading us to
2
The pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: '
We fly inside where we find a star-studded floor show
Drunken  make out with leaps through a burning  on stage
'  - Nick typing on an obsolete
(
) am entering the tenth grade at St
Vitus Academy, which,  am told, is the most rigorous prep school in the East Bay
Hopefully will be invited to join Miss Satron's English Literature class
view of the books and CDs on his shelf
(
) am a voracious reader and listen to Frank Sinatra
So needless to say,  am still a virgin
Follow the curser on the monitor as he types the words - He pauses in thought, then continues
(
) have yet to hold hands with a girl, let alone have my winkie up her wendell
(35,000 ) - down an airplane aisle, past  sleeping and chatting
(
) am an only child except for my big sister Joanie, who has left the bosom of her family to sling hash at 35,000 feet
We reach the end of the aisle, where a buxom twenty- something,   serves a beverage
'  - Liver frying in a pan
, 43, cooks and puffs on a cigarette at the same time
3
(
) Mom gives driver's tests at the Department of Motor Vehicles
Nick sits at the kitchen table reading the paper
He watches with nausea as Estelle piles liver onto his plate
(
) She used to keep Dad up to date on all the motor statutes he was violating
This is one of the reasons they got divorced
, early 40's, saunters in wearing a shirt and boxers
His gut hangs over the elastic, but he is completely devoid of an ass
(
) Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long distance trucker, though his ultimate ambition is to be on state disability
Jerry absently smacks Estelle's butt
Waddles over to the breakfast table
He snatches the Funnies from the paper in Nick's hands
(
) 've been struggling to think of a commendable thing to say about Jerry
Jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon
Nick glares
(
) No luck
His grey matter registers at cretin and the needle doesn't budge
'  - , 41, scruffy and greying, waters the foliage outside the house with a high powered hose
(
) Dad is a copywriter for agricultural magazines
In the drive, Nick slaves over the duty of washing the rims of his dad's  325i
(
) He'd like to own a more prestigious model of , but, as he often reminds me, he is burdened with crippling child support payments
4
Nick glances up and spots , 20, coming up the drive toward him in a weensy bikini
Her body has more outcroppings than the coastline of Albania
She continues past him and embraces George
(
) Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette
She is twenty and a recently minted alumna of Stanfort
Super:          (Stanfort Institute of Cosmetology) George and Lacey exchange saliva shamelessly
Nick turns his attention back to the Beamer
As the making out becomes heated groping, George's grip on the hose slackens
Nick gets blindsided by the jet of water
'  - We're back with Nick as he types on his computer
He looks down at the tent in his boxers
: He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection
' of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing
His eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room
(
) My mother is the one who painted my room to look like Dolly Parton's boudoir
She read this color was used in hospitals to calm mental patients
Nick closes his eyes, his right arm moving rhythmically
(
) 'll tell you what  told her
am not mentally ill
The masturbation reaches its feverous climax
Then the long moan and sigh of relief
(
) 'm just a teenager
And as Frank Sinatra's begins, we go to
5
'  - Nick regards Jerry from across the dining room table
There is the off-screen sound of a cretin slurping Cheerios
Reveal Jerry reading Sports Illustrated, scratching his balls with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other
Estelle is washing dishes when she spies something out the window
Jerry
Where did that car come from
Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive
It's a '62 Lincoln convertible
Like the one Kennedy was shot in
Except his was black and yours is white
And dirty
See that
was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast
But now  guess it'll just be her and me
You have your smart mouth to thank for that
Damn it
guess 'll just have to hang out all alone at the book depository
The what
Jerry,  don't understand
What happened to the Chevy-Nova
Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air Base
man should never own a car for more than three months, Estelle
That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile
Jerry smiles with cretin pride
Nick looks to his mother and disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner savvy
6
'  - Nick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for Jerry to open the passenger door for her
(
) After spending twelve years with Dad, Mom has had a string of lovers, none of whom she has asked me to approve
Jerry fails to notice Estelle waiting and instead just climbs in and chugs his beer
Estelle appears mildly disappointed before opening the door herself
(
) 'm starting to think her boyfriends are like
Presidents
As Jerry pulls out, he tosses his beer bottle in the direction of the trash can at the end of the drive
(
) Just when you think they can't get any worse
He misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement, but Jerry drives off anyway
(
) she manages to find God's Perfect Asshole
'  - Nick cycles through TiVo and finds the late night he recorded
'  - From the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the jingle jangle of a belt buckle
Then the - of the front doorbell
The jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second time, the orgy gets muted
Nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers
/
'  - The door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed standing on the stoop
7
Their eyes drift to Nick's mid-section
Nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to fasten out of haste
He returns his gaze to the sailors as he wrangles the belt
#1 Is Jerry here
He just left
What's up
#1 What's up is that hunk of shit Chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up
#2 And we found evidence of a banana in the transmission
The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a plastic bag
Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job
is rummaging through the boxes in the open garage
He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can
Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop
#1 So he owes us nine hundred dollars
Well,  think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln
He's giving my mom a joyride in it now
But he'll be back this afternoon, so  would come back then
He's pretty stubborn
You might have to beat it out of him
#1 That can be arranged
In the meantime we're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway
With a note
Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor finishes painting the hood with the words:
like it
Very to the point
Well
See you guys this afternoon
The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor
As they turn to go and Nick closes the door
8
(
) might have to kill myself
- In the clearing, a   stands behind his , kissing her neck and removing her clothes
(
) hope you have a good reason
Reveal Nick and his friend , 16, belly down in the grass overlooking the clearing
Lefty watches the copulating couple with a pair of binoculars
My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding hands with some college guy
dunno, Lefty
think your sister is just waging psychological warfare
Well it's working
What am  gonna do, Nick
'm obsessed
think about Millie so much my balls ache
Maybe your just not wacking off enough
As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants
As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance
The couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air
(
) So, 've been taping my pecker to my right leg at night
(
) In case you haven't heard, Lefty's erect member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft
9
(
) Then  look at this issue of Better Homes and Gardens that has a girl that looks just like Millie until it gets good and hard
think it's starting to straighten out
Why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor
(
) Are you kidding
It would kill them to know that  even get hard-ons
Still, you might want to get it fixed before asking Millie out
(
) True
What if  shove it up the wrong hole
Nick gives a dubious glance in Lefty's direction
(
) Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous; he imagines there are orifices galore down there
'  - Nick, you little shit, get down here
Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the window
Nick calmly joins them from upstairs
Nick, do you know anything about this
She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood
Oh, yeah
Those sailors came by
They want their money back
guess there was a banana in the transmission
You tell them when  was coming back
10
Now why would  do that
Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence
What are you going to do, Jerry
think 'll go get the Lincoln washed
You're leaving
What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars
Just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee
Thirty days or thirty feet
Whichever comes first
'm in the right
And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door
They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps
Oh, look
The sailors are here
Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another, searching for a hiding space as he hisses
Get rid of them
And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in
Jerry flees
chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in
Jerry bolts up the stairs
Jerry, where are you going
Just tell them you are in the right
'  - They manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the stairs
Jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a sound not unlike
when the flashlight hit him in the cornfield
The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets
11
#1 Sixty-three lousy dollars
That's my life savings
One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he whimpers
Don't hurt him
Nick, call 911
#1 Touch that phone, kid, and you lose your left nut
Nick raises his hands
"You don't have to tell me twice
" Please
Please don't hurt me
It's all  got, guys
swear
Take the Lincoln
#1 don't want the Lincoln
want my nine-hundred dollars
'm taking the sixty-three, which means you owe me another eight hundred and thirty
Eight hundred and thirty seven, actually
#1 Exactly
Have it by tomorrow or you'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the Bay
And with that they release him and Jerry crumples to the floor like an abandoned marionette
'  - The three of them watch the fleet pile into a Navy van that reads
The moment they pull out, Jerry dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed
Wow, those guys are even dumber than  thought
They actually think 'm stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying
12
Jerry, what are you talking about
We need to call the police
'm not some tattle-tale like your son
Nick rolls his eyes
Then for God's sake, Jerry, just sell the Lincoln and pay them
Can't
It's in The Code
What code
The vehicular code
Code of the streets, Babe
Code of the streets
Then what are you planning to do
Jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts The Thinker pose
He strokes his chin as Nick and Estelle await his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation
/
- (
) We are going to Ukiah for a last minute vacation
Jerry's got on a hat made from Coors beer cans
He's behind the wheel of his Lincoln convertible
(
) Jerry says we'll be staying in a cabin on Clear Lake that's owned by a friend of his
Estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk
Her halter top looks like an advertisement for Droop City
Nick's in the back
Estelle waves at the neighbors like she's Miss Corn Dog of 1954
Goodbye, everyone
We're going on vacation
Let's blow
13
She hops up front with Jerry
He fires up the Lincoln and the radio roars to life with
(
) 'm not sure how this is the solution to his problem
But 've decided to go along with it, seeing as 'm not rooting for him anyway
As they pull out, Jerry tosses his beer bottle at the garbage can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and shatters on the street behind them
- The Lincoln makes it's way upstate, and dips into the mist covered hills of Ukiah
- They've pulled to a stop
Estelle stares in horror
Jerry
You said it was a cabin
In the back, Nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long, green, turd of a trailer
Some concrete dwarves in the grass
dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio
decrepit picket fence with a sign that reads:
Estelle looks as if she's about to cry
Jerry puts his arm around her
'mon Estelle
It's real cute on the inside
- Substitute cluttered for cute
The three of them are crammed around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray table
3- religious art hangs on the wall above them
say the kid does the dishes and we retire to the master bedroom
Jerry pushes out and disappears into the back
Nick watches him with loathing
Estelle smiles apologetically
Mom
Do you really like Jerry
Her smile fades
14
Nick, how   many men do you think there are   who'd be interested in a forty-one   year old woman with two brats, no   money, and stretch marks
And with that she excuses herself, leaving Nick to ponder
(
) Mom is a realist about everything
Except her age
She's forty-three
- Nick washes dishes in the toilet-like sink
The trailer shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the back
- An old crone,
, makes her way up the walk
She gets to the door of My Green Haven and bangs on the screen
- Nick sleeps on a pull out cot
He bolts upright at the banging, his hair going in all directions
(
) It's your neighbor, Mrs
Saunders
Church services begin at seven fifteen prompt
Donuts will be served
Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers
Mrs
Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen door and takes off
- Nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe, toiletries in one hand, towel in the other
He heads off down the wooded path
- The serene melodies of rousing  float from the well- attended congregation in the meeting hall
across the trees as Nick makes his way down the path
He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy overhead
He glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop
grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the blue of Clear Lake
chestnut haired   stands facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in her hands
The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath
15
Light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor like something out of a Francois Boucher painting
(
) The moment  see her  know the Gods, while having cruelly endowed me with imperfect posture and pussy postponing pimples, had put me here for a purpose
My heart palpitates
My mind races
get an instant Super:                (Thundering Erection) Sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder at him
Nick just stares
She gives an amused smile, almost flirtatious
Nick grins back
Your robe is open
Nick looks down
He pulls the robe closed, scowls, and goes into a flustered march down the path
- An austere   cement shed with three dripping shower heads and no privacy   walls
Nick lathers up under the spray
Jerry appears in   the foreground and removes his robe
He goes to the shower   head next to Nick and turns it on
Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing himself off
Jerry gurgles water and spits
He starts warbling rock lyrics
- Nick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence
Estelle and Sheeni squat on the patio steps
Hel-lo, Excitable Boy
Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders
Hello
Sheeni needs to go to the grocery store
've offered her your help in carrying her bags
Nick regards Sheeni and her mischievous smirk
16
Thanks a pantsful
- dusty road
Nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag
He watches as Sheeni works on a Popsicle
Full lips that cry out to be kissed
You don't have to go to services
No
Much to the consternation of my fanatical parents  have converted to atheism
Fortunately my brother, Paul, paved the way for such transgressions
Paul is an atheist too
Buddhist,  believe, though we have not seen him in some time
myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage
Likewise
Well, your mother seems very nice, though your father  think might be rather dim
Jerry and  share no blood links of any kind
As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of  in chorus
Sounds rather zealous
Yes, even though  am no longer a believer  always found the services wonderfully aerobic
You could say the same thing about sex
Sheeni stops
She looks at Nick intently
17
Nick, are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures
hardly ever think about sex
Really
think about it all the time
It's the hormones at work, you know
She resumes walking
Nick follows her with confusion
'   - They regard the two story Pacemaker mobile home
Wow
second floor
Yes
Father bought it so that he could look down upon the world
For him, Christian humility has always been a struggle
Sheeni relieves him of the watermelon
Well, it was nice to meet you, Nick
She trudges down the slate path to the home
Sheeni
Do you want to come to the beach with me
She turns around
Gives a little smirk
What a thoughtful invitation
'd love to, Nick
Wait for me in the living room
'   - lot more space than My Green Haven
Dark paneling and somewhat more tasteful religious art
Back in a moment
18
Nick watches her bound up the stairs
He wanders into the musty living area
Moves down the mantel examining the trinkets
Stops to regard the reproduction of Massaccio's Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden on the wall
He scrutinizes the image, his eyes falling to the privates of Adam and Eve
(
) understand you have invited my daughter to the beach
Nick spins around to see
reclining in his armchair
He is an immense, florid-faced, verdant eye-browed ogre in a rumpled blue suit
Er, yes, Mr
Saunders
Aha
Then  trust, sir, you are aware that in doing so you have entered into an oral contract to perform in loco parentis, i
e
to provide for the safety and well- being of aforementioned minor female
(
) Oh, Father, do shut up
Sheeni descends the stairs
Jean cut-offs over a knockout yellow swimsuit that shows off her flowing nubility
Mr
Saunders grumbles
Sheeni grabs up a straw beach bag and pushes Nick out the door
Let's go, Nick
Bye, Father
Vaya con Dios
- Sheeni and Nick lay on their backs on the blue beach blanket, reading their respective books
Nick watches her turning pages and making notes in the margins
She hands him her tanning lotion
Would you mind applying this to my exposed areas
Not at all
19
She rolls over onto her stomach, exposing her exquisite back
Nick straddles her, hands shaking as he smooths sweet oils into her tanned flesh
Flashing super:          Thundering Erection My, you get turned on easily
Nick's hands freeze
Oh, don't stop, Nick
We all have our hormones to deal with
Girls are fortunate in that it doesn't show
For all the world knows, my vagina could be moist with desire as we speak
Is it
That's none of your business, 'm sure
Shall you do my front too
'm up for it
She rolls over onto her back, her young breasts straining up against the yellow spandex
hope you don't find it too stimulating, Nick
'm coping
He starts in on her flawless legs, gliding on the oil all the way within a finger's reach of her sweet apex
With each daring pass, he comes closer to that final split
Finally the hand swerves too late, and lightly grazes the softly yielding vee
Uh, Nick
Maybe you better do the top now
Nick moves up, lubricating her arms, shoulders and neck
He smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills
Thanks, Nick
20
She rolls back onto her stomach with finality and goes back to her book
Nick hovers above her a moment, then painfully returns to his own reading
- They make their way down the path
Nick totes the beach bag
Breathless is one of my favorite films, though it might be eclipsed by Rebel Without a Cause
often wonder what American cinema would be like today had Dean done more than three
Nick nods, and for a beat they trek on in silence
He glances down at her hand and fumbles for it with his own
Oh, Nick
You seem very nice
But in fairness,  should tell you that have a boyfriend
Nick becomes sickeningly pale
What's his name
Trent Preston
What's he like
Seventeen years of age, six-two, fluent in French, plays the piano, a champion swimmer, and writes Futurist Percussive poetry
They stop at the gate to the Saunders' home
'm not familiar with Futurist Percussive poems
could recite one of Trent's if you'd like
Please do
She takes a dramatic pause
21
RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down/ Safety net/ Hot
Hot
Hot
/ Void
She gives a slightly amused smile at Nick's blank expression
(
) If that's poetry, 'm a turkey scrotum
- of Nick thrashing about in bed
During this montage there is the constant ticking of a clock
(
) Here is an hour by hour account of the worst night of my life
Nick flipping through a Penthouse under the covers
(
) 1
decide it is just a case of puppy love and look forward to the interesting women  shall meet in the future
- light comes on in the window
- Nick at the dining table, writing a note
(
) 2
conclude the only way out is suicide
begin to pen a poignant suicide note
Sheeni will see Trent for the shallow pedant he is and always treasure my memory
(
) Turn off the damn light
- Nick paces about back and forth in the yard
(
) 3
decide  am too chicken for any of the manly, violent means of suicide
shall swallow sleeping pills
Where to get them, though
22
- Nick is in bed jerking off
The trailer shakes despite his best efforts
(
) 4
can not die an inviolate virgin
Either  find a way to get laid soon or suicide gets postponed until after high school
(
) You wanna beat your meat, go outside
- Nick in the shower going to town on his
(
) 5
It will be too painful to see Sheeni again
shall ask Mom if we can cut our vacation short and return to Oakland
- Nick rolls over on the cot and looks up with the gaze of a manic insomniac
(
) 6
Violent panic
have to see Sheeni again
'   - The door opens to reveal Nick standing outside in shorts, an ' , '  shirt, and tennis shoes
Sheeni stands in the door
Sleep-fogged eyes
Good morning
Nick
God what time is it
Seven o'clock
How about breakfast
(smiling with endearment) Come back in two hours
'm going on a hike
You can join me if you'd like
She closes the door
23
Super:     One hour fifty seven minutes later knock on the door
Sheeni opens it to reveal
Nick, dressed the same
Sheeni wears Khakis, red bandanna neckerchief, and an Australian bush hat
She looks like the world's most desirable Girl Scout
She examines Nick's attire
Nick, where are your hiking boots, water bottle, provisions, survey maps and compass
Like John Muir  enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder
Okay, but  have no plans to baby any slackers
- Sheeni leads the way up hill
Nick clutches his cramped stomach with one hand, his journal in the other
He watches the rhythmic movements of her ass through her hiking shorts
- Nick and Sheeni peer over the edge of the cliff
The waters of Clear Lake churn below
Quite a drop
Yes
Not to be morbid, but this sight has been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides
Huh
Quite a hike just to end your life
Well, there is a road
But  agree
Adolescents have a tendency toward the over-dramatic
Sheeni backs away
Nick stays, staring over the edge
24
- Nick's eyes roll back as he relieves himself against a tree
He shakes off the last of it and zips up
- He emerges from the woods only to find Sheeni reading his journal
She looks up at his and smiles
The brazen sneak isn't even embarrassed
That's my journal
Don't get so upset Nick
Though your handwriting is egregious, you have a fairly decent vocabulary
Although, Trent is not an "affected twit
" Nick snatches the journal out of her hands
Those are my private thoughts and are none of your business
Nick
What
The lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart, the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me
(taking a sensual breath) It all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast
Nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if posing for a centerfold
Did you mean it, Nickie
beat as he is lost in the ocean of her gaze before he manages to gain his senses
How would you like it if  read your journal
You can read it if you'd like
25
She hands it over
Nick squints at the writing
It's in French
necessity for a child in a household with prying Christian parents
What does it say
Wouldn't you like to know
That last passage would be of particular interest to you
Nick leaps on top of her, grabbing her thin wrists
She squeals and giggles
Spill it
demand full disclosure
Never
They wrestle, perspiring, squirming bodies brushing together
Flashing super:        Thundering Erection They pause
He's got her arms pinned
She's on her back
He hovers above her
(softly chanting) Nickie's got a hard-on
Nick considers her expression
You're still a virgin,  can tell
Maybe that's why  like you
beat
She looks at him expectantly
Nick is at a loss
Kiss me, you wienie
Nick tentatively approaches her luscious mouth
Their noses dodge successfully and their lips meet
After a long moment, they break it off
Staring into each other's eyes
Sheeni jumps up
26
Okay, lover
Break's over
Let's go
Nick lays in the grass a moment, watching after her
'   - Nick walks Sheeni to the gate
She turns around to face him
When can  see you again
Get up early tomorrow and you can shower with me in the ladies room
Five minutes to six
If you dare
Nick grins with excitement
- Nick dines at the tray table with Jerry and Estelle
So what's this Sheeni girl like
She's the Encyclopedia Britannica
She's got a nice rack
Jerry
Jerry chuckles
Nick stares at him, perhaps resolving to murder the trucker in his sleep
- Nick lies below us on the cot, unable to sleep with the anticipation of the imminent loss of his virginity
- / Another perfect California summer dawn, a pale moon lingering in the blue morning sky
Nick emerges from My Green Haven in his robe
He starts off down the path
- The trailer park is relatively silent save for birds and the distant sound of dogs barking
27
- Nick approaches the shower building
As he nears, the sound of water running can be heard from the ladies' side
(' ) - The women's side has real stalls and privacy doors
Nick spots the chamber at the end where Sheeni's naked form showers, obscured by tacky stained glass
He kicks off his slippers
Hangs his robe on a hook
He approaches the stall
Flashing super:       Thundering Erection He opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray
He embraces her
Pendulous breasts, sagging skin, a patch of white hair under a drooping belly, wrinkles
It's Mrs
Saunders
She looks up startled
Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream
Mrs
Saunders starts screaming too, the sound of a pig being slaughtered
She hurls a bar of soap
The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his footing on the slippery tile
He goes down, taking Mrs
Saunders with him
They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape
Suddenly the door opens
It's Sheeni in her robe
She reaches out and pulls Nick up
Get out quick
Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her mother
Nick grabs his robe and retreats
- Nick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as he brings his coffee to his lips
He hears the door open and looks up, but instead of the cops finds Sheeni
She joins him at the table
Should  go to the sheriff's now
No
managed to convince Mother you were retarded and couldn't read the sign
28
Nick nods thankfully
Say, where were you anyway
We said five minutes to six
'm sorry
But, Nick, women are always discreetly late
It's expected of us
Swell
And the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape
Don't complain
At least you got to shower with a naked woman
(licking donut powder off her fingers) What are your plans today
My parents want to go to Middletown
Jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave
should like to come with you, Nick
The more time we spend together the better
fear when you leave we might never see each other again
Nick nods glumly
Clearly a devastating thought
() - Sheeni's in back with Nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind tunnel
She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks
Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of his thigh
As they round a curve at 60, she yanks Nick's sunglasses off and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake
'  - Estelle, Jerry, Nick, and a toothless old  whose gut rivals Jerry's, all stare at a rusty  that looks like it might not make the trip back
In the background, Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard
29
What's your cash price
said in the ad
Thousand dollars firm
Thousand, huh
That must be with a guarantee
As is, where she is
don't know
Those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard
The roof probably needs work
couldn't go above eight hundred
The geezer ponders the bad news
Estelle shakes her head and goes inside the  to inspect
(
) There are mouse droppings in all the closets, Jerry
might take nine fifty
Nine hundred
Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight
They all turn their attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming She brings one of them over
Look, Nick
She shows him the ugly little pug
Short droopy ears, a tiny, batlike face
Great
(to the geezer) How much
Ten dollars
Sheeni turns to Nick pleadingly
Nick fishes through his wallet
30
All  have is a Subway card with four stickers
Sold
No doubt close to the dog's actual value
Oh, thank you, Nickie
She plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her attention to the dog, who licks her face affectionately
Nick looks on with appropriate jealousy
'm going to name him Albert
(pronounced Al-bear) That don't sound like any kind of name for a dog
(scowling defensively) 'll have you know 've named him after the deceased French writer, Albert Camus
Author of 'Etranger and other works of existential brilliance
The geezer looks to Nick with an expression of " stand corrected
" Nick returns with a nod that says "You have no idea
" () - The Lincoln now tows the rusty  behind it
Nick watches Sheeni continue to fawn over Albert
- Nick and Sheeni dine over coffee and a plate of donuts
Nick watches her play with Albert in her lap
Sheeni,  think  love you
Well, your hormones certainly do
And oddly enough, my hormones like you too
31
Sheeni releases Albert and the mutt paws at her legs
Her eyes well up with tears, a few theatrical sniffles
Sheeni
It's
It's okay
We can visit each other when  get a drivers license
hope that's true, but
It's not that
It's
What
It's my parents
They're
fear they will never allow me to keep Albert
Oh
Nick tries to hide his hurt
Picks up the paper with annoyance
() Nick, honey
Why don't you take Albert
He could be our love child
No way
At least you could consider it, honey
For me
've never asked you for anything before
Maybe  could take him, but 'd have certain conditions
would have to be the only dad on the scene
(matter of fact) Trent would have to go
That's asking a lot
Trent worships the ground  walk on
It's your choice
Life with me and the dog you love
Or a pet-free existence with a shallow, egotistical poet
32
Sheeni ponders this
, Nick,  guess  don't have any choice
'll break up with Trent
But if he kills himself it's on your conscience
accept full responsibility
Well, good, that's settled
Not quite, darling
want one more thing
What
What do you think
beat
Sheeni looks pensive
It fades to amusement
Do you have a condom
Nick lifts his eyebrows
Now we're getting somewhere
It has to be in a safe place nice comfortable bed
With no threat of interruptions
And for relaxation and mood setting some good red wine, preferably French want a new condom
Not one that's been riding around in your wallet for years
Consumers rated them a while back
suggest you get their top-rated brand
This may take some research in the library
'd appreciate a photocopy of the article
Plus, for supplementary protection,  want a name brand spermicide
How about  have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side
(matter of fact) Well, Nick, that, of course, is up to you
33
Nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didn't register
- Jerry hitches the trailer to the back of the Lincoln
Estelle loads up the trunk
Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni
It's time to hit the road
Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert
He looks less than enthused at the thought of sloppy-seconds
Finally Sheeni hands Nick the dog
Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat
Sheeni leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek
(whispering in his ear) Don't forget, darling
Red wine and Consumer Reports
She smiles
They're the sexiest words Nick's ever heard
He grabs her and kisses her deeply
Jerry  the horn and they break off
- Nick gets into the back seat with Albert
The dog whimpers
Sheeni stands off to the side, waving at them both
Okay
Back to civilization
He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust
Albert slobbers all over Nick
Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror, waving in the road
(
) have a tall mountain to climb, with many treacherous glaciers still to cross, but finally,  have obtained a stamped entry visa to the paradise that lay beyond
Sheeni watches the Lincoln and trailer recede toward the horizon
(
) In short
have a very real prospect for getting laid
34
'  - The Lincoln and  slow to a stop outside the home
/
- They all stare at the empty space where the Chevy-Nova used to be
Jerry gets a smirk of satisfaction
You see that, Babe
They caved
'  - Jerry backs the  into the drive as Nick helps his mother with her belongings and they enter the house
The  scrapes its way through a few overhanging tree branches before Jerry decides it's parked
There comes a woman's scream from inside the house
'   - Jerry joins Nick and Estelle in the doorway
There in the living room, surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly against the walls, is Jerry's camouflaged Chevy
guess they didn't cave after all
Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle
Boy, everything's complete
There's even water in the windshield washer
How did they ever get it in here
My front door can't be more than three feet wide
Looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it
But it would take an army of mechanics to do all that
Jerry slams down the hood
Or a navy, Babe
Or a navy
35
'  - cab pulls up in front of the house and Nick's sister, Joanie gets out of the back
She tips the driver, and as she crosses the front yard, gawks at the  sitting in the drive
'  -  - Nick's door is ajar
Nick pulls up his trousers and comes into the hall
He listens to the voices downstairs
- He comes down the first few steps and is met with the sight of his mother and sister staring up at him
Nick, your sister came all the way from  for a weekend visit
Nick and Joanie meet eyes
She lifts a quizzical eyebrow
Stellar
'   - Albert chews on Jerry's sock under the table
Can someone do something about the mutt
The family dines over take-out fried chicken
Jerry kicks Albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor
don't know, Jerry
Can someone do something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room
Yeah,  noticed that
What's the story
Jerry tried to outsmart a few sailors
It's been an amusing saga
Jerry contemplates smacking Nick upside the head, but decides against it when he discerns Estelle is probably in her son's corner
, Babe,  guess when  come back from my next haul 'll just have to take it apart piece by piece
36
Estelle takes a deep breath and tries to let the matter rest
Up to anything scandalous these days, Nick
was going to ask you the same thing
What do you mean
Nick puffs out his chest
Joanie looks down at her boob-job
Not that it's any of your business, but 've taken a class to improve my posture
Nick rolls his eyes
think Joanie looks very nice
And she has a new boyfriend too
Did you meet him in posture class
Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah
Really now
Are you on each others' Myspace pages
Hardly
Sheeni believes the internet will be the end of literacy
So it's to be a torturous snail mail exchange, huh
More like the occassional collect call
Collect calls
And just who do you expect to pay for that
Jerry kicks the dog away from his sock
Albert growls and prepares for another charge
37
Hey, Nick
Want to learn how a car is put together
No, thanks
Auto mechanics doesn't interest me
See, Estelle,  told you the kid was queer-eeAAAAHHHHH
Jerry lurches backward in the chair and lands on the floor, revealing that Albert's teeth have a firm grasp on Jerry's sack
The dog shakes the scrotum in his jaws
Damn it
The dog
He tries to swipe Albert with his beer bottle, but the dog retreats into the house, leaving Jerry rolling around on the floor
Joanie and Nick exchange a smile
The phone rings
Estelle gets up to answer it
Nick, put the dog in the basement
- Nick stoops to secure the leash around the piping
He regards the little pug
Albert  and cocks his head
The door at the top of the stairs opens and Estelle descends the first few steps
Nick, that was your father on the phone
He lost his job
How unlike him
Watch your smart mouth
This means the end of child support
Which means
You'll have to start going to
() Oakland Public School
In Nick's eyes the fear of a sentence worse than death
38
'  -  - Morning comes through the drapes
The phone on the side table is ringing
Nick emerges from his room and picks it up
Hello
(
) Will you accept a collect call from Sheeni Saunders
Absolutely
Nick looks around, opens the door to the linen closet and darts inside
- Then Nick pulls the cord and the naked bulb kicks on
(
) Nick
Sheeni
How are you
(
) 'm well, Nickie
And how is Trent
Not too suicidal hope
'   - Sheeni relaxes on a love seat, cradling the phone with her shoulder as she eats grapes from a bowl
Of course, he was disconsolate, but we talked all day and he's come to see this as an opportunity for growth
Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill will
Nor  him
wish him all the best
His parents are sending him to a French speaking boarding school this year
He's sure to get along there
So how is my darling Albert
39
Well, though he's taken a disliking to Jerry
And you, Nickie
How are you
regret, Love of My Life, my father has lost his job and  will now be forced to go to public school
How unfortunate
What did he do
He's a writer - sort of
He writes advertising copy
Really
(pensive beat) Nick,  suggest we look at your father's firing as a blessing in disguise
How so
propose we get your father a job here in Ukiah and you can come and live with him
Brilliant
Not that 'm fond of Ukiah, but 'd live in a drainage culvert to be with you
Oh, Nickie
Now,  happen to know Progressive Plywood is looking for an assistant editor
It would be perfect for your father
Nick furrows his brow with skepticism
had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines
The owner is the father of a friend of mine
40
Anyone  know
Okay, it's Trent's father
So what
So why would Trent want to help my father move to Ukiah
told you, darling
Trent harbors you no ill will
will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter
Very well, but  don't see how  am to live with him
My mother values my indentured servitude
You must influence her to send you away
feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part
What do you want me to do
propose you rent the film Rebel Without a Cause as soon as possible
You must emulate James Dean
her
You must be bad, Nickie
Be very, very bad
glint of resolve in Nick's eyes
will, darling
will
And in pre-lap comes the   of the doorbell
'   - Joanie and Nick sit in the Chevy Nova watching Rebel Without a Cause through the windshield
41
Estelle enters the living room with tears streaming down her face and a police officer,  , 45, with a flattop, watery red eyes, and assorted guns, flashlights, and billy clubs
Kids
This is Officer Lance Wescott
He has some bad news
After a beat, Nick rolls down the window
Your mother's friend Jerry had a heart attack in a bar in Dallas
He's dead
Estelle sobs, but isn't joined by her children
She turns to Lance
Will they be sending his belongings
Uh
'm afraid they've already been sent
To his wife
Beat
Nick looks to Joanie
They both look to their mother
His
His wife
She bursts into tears and collapses into Officer Lance Wescott's arms
There, there, Ma'am
It's going to be okay
Nick watches his mother sobbing against the cop's chest for a beat before he rolls up the window and he and Joanie resume watching the movie
Estelle's cries of despair become
'  - the cries of ecstasy coming through the wall along with the repeated exclamation of Lance's name
Nick rolls over in bed
Bloodshot eyes
He hauls himself out of bed
(
) have decided to create a supplementary persona named Francois
42
- He stands in front of the mirror and leans in
(
) Like a Parisian James Dean, he will be bold, reckless, contemptuous of authority, and irresistible to women
on his reflection, as a moustache appears
Then a beret and black and white striped shirt
Then a cigarette holder and Thompson machine-gun
And  is born
Hello, Francois
think you'll do nicely
Oui,  am ze perfect match pour une Francophile for ze likes of Sheeni Saunders
have ze calculating intelligence
the itchy trigger finger
Francois cocks the machine-gun
and cojone grandes
and cojone grandes
- Nick opens the door
Lance and Estelle shower behind the frosted glass
Damn
Those hippos are taking a shower together
How repulsive
He slams the door
- Nick comes down the stairs
He reaches the water heater and starts spinning the knob
- The forms of Estelle and Lance in the shower can be made out
They both start screaming as they are blasted with cold water
The blobs of their bodies press up against the glass
43
- Albert looks up at Nick and lets out a
Nick smiles and bends down to undo his leash
'  -  - Lance bursts from the bathroom in his boxers, looking for blood
He hears the sound of paws climbing the stairs
Albert comes hurtling around he corner, almost losing his footing on the hardwood floor
' as we lunge at Lance's crotch
'  - rises up from the home
'  - Estelle hands Lance an ice-pack and he applies it to his injury
Nick wanders in and takes his seat at the table
Where's Joanie
She's sleeping in
No doubt
don't think anyone got a wink last night with all that racket
Lance looks at him, seething inwardly
He glances to Estelle
thought there were laws in this city against illicit cohabitation
Or are they just another big policeman's joke
Kid, you are asking for trouble
What are you going to do
Shoot me with your gun
Lance lunges across the table
No, Lance
Nickie, go to your room
Nick flings down his napkin and heads for the front door
44
Where do you think you're going
Out
The screen door slams behind him
- The garage door rattles upward, illuminating the cardboard box of paint supplies
Nick bends down and picks up a can of aerosol spray-paint
He shakes it
'  - Nick sprays the trailer in wide sweeping motions
'  - Joanie and Nick sun bathe in the lawn chairs
Estelle stands over them
What the in God's name has gotten into you
Jerry paid good money for that trailer
And just what makes you so sure it was me
Who the hell else would write such a thing
Estelle gestures to the trailer, which we can see has been defaced with the words '
And just how do you explain this
She holds up a semi-nude Polaroid of Lacey
That's Lacey
And just who the hell is Lacey
Dad's girlfriend
Estelle stares at the photo, face contorted by revulsion and envy
45
His girlfriend
What are you doing with a picture like this of your father's girlfriend
'mon, Mom, all boys his age have pictures like that to
When  want your opinion on raising my child, 'll ask for it
(to Nick; morbidly ) And what's this Lacey tart like
Well, she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad
Super:             (True) She likes to sit on Dad's lap while he eats and blow in his ear
Super:           (Not true) And she calls him "Thunder Rod" and he calls her "Sugar Puss
" Super:       (True; believe it or not) At this point Estelle has turned bright red
You are confined to your room until school starts, you sick pervert
She stalks off
Joanie glances over at Nick with amusement
wish  was leaving with you tonight
Your day will come
never thought mine would, but it did
Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made up
wish
Did you really take a posture class
46
Implants
wanted them all my life
'  - knock on the door
Lefty enters the room and Nick pulls the headphones off his ears
Hey, Lefty
What's with your mom, Nick
She gave me the third degree just to come up here
vandalized Jerry's trailer and she found my picture of Lacey
Well, good thing  stole this from the bookstore then
Lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound volume titled Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets
was reading it all last night
Boy, having sex is a lot more complicated than  thought
Did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole
You lie
No way, man
Here,  got the page marked
Lefty flops down on the sofa next to Nick and the two of them flip through the manual
Yeah, but 'm not sure  should try this on Sheeni
think this book is for people who've been married so long they're disgusted by the sight of each other
They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in various states of foreplay
47
Are we really supposed to be that
uh
big
think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis
Maybe we should compare
Perhaps we should
Just for the sake of research
Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each other like a pair of duelists
They simultaneously undo their belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet
They straighten
Lefty's eyes fall to Nick's crotch
He gets a hint of concern in his expression
Nick stares at Lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for the curvature
The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nick's lunch
She lets out a scream
The boys turn to face her, pants around their ankles
She hurls the tray of food at them
Lefty bolts
Nick hastily tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way
'
'  -  - Lefty emerges from the room and takes off
You won't get away
'm calling your parents
Nick bursts from the room, desperately trying to buckle his pants
Estelle is hot on his heels, wielding the hardbound sex manual as they round the bannister
In my house
How dare you
She catches up to Nick at the top of the stairs and cracks him upside the head
48
He loses his balance and goes tumbling down the staircase, letting out a moan that stutters as his head hits each step
He comes crashing into the foyer, landing on the slate
'  - Nick watches out the window
Estelle can be seen animatedly describing the events to '
Lefty glances up at Nick and gives a pained expression
'  - Nick lays on his belly reading No Exit
He looks up when he hears the sound of footsteps in the hall
Shadows appear beneath the crack in the door
Estelle opens the door and looks down at him
Nick,  just want you to know that 've thought about it, and 've accepted that you are gay
Thanks a pantsful, but 'm not gay
If you're really concerned though, suggest you get me a room at the Ukiah Motel 6
If anyone can straighten me out, it's Sheeni
She looks at him dubiously and hands out the phone
That sounds more like a job for your father
Here, he wants to talk to you
Nick takes the phone from her hands and she closes the door
(into phone) Hello
'  - So what's this  hear about you being gay
George sprawls on the couch, cradling the phone with one hand, and holding a beer on his stomach with the other 49
What's this  hear about you being unemployed
Yes, but my condition is only temporary
can change it
hope you do
We need the money
Nick, there are more important things in life than money
know, Dad
Like getting a good education
And being able to respect your parents
've got two words for you
Safe sex
Thanks, Dad
He hangs up the phone
- Intimidating
School bus doors fold open and Nick steps off
The  pounds from the boom box resting on the hood of the Mustang  where a pack of  follow Nick with their eyes
Nick walks past them, glancing over at the assembly of glaring at him from their perch on the wall
-  - Nick pushes past a fight where two kids throw each other against the lockers
He smiles at a pair of
One of them flips him off
Nick heads into
- And as Nick steps into the bathroom, we follow his eyes
a  selling a bag of dope to a
a   vandalizing the wall with the words a pack of  as one of them gives the others a butterfly knife show-and-tell
50
-  - down the corridor where Nick dials at a pay phone
(
) Office of Child Welfare
Hello, uh
My name is Nick
Nick Twisp
My father's name is George Twisp
(
) Has he hit you, Nick
Not lately
But he's missed several child support payments, and is not looking for work
So now 'm going to public school in Oakland
(
) Not the Oakland schools
Yes
And he's had an offer from a respectable publication in Ukiah
(
) Don't you worry, young man
'll get right on this
Don't worry
We'll light a fire under that deadbeat
- Nick walks Albert down the sidewalk
Lefty crosses the street to him and they walk together
Hey, Lefty
How's it hangin'
You'll never believe who called me, Nick
Millie Filbert
What
Why
dunno
She just called and asked if  wanted to hang out tonight didn't want to ask why
need to find someplace for us to get it on
Albert squats to poop in someone's yard
The boys pause to wait for him
51
You can use my house if you want
Really
Sure
My Mom and Lance are going to a movie and 'm planning on stealing Jerry's trailer and torching it in a parking lot, so you'll have the whole house to yourself
Right on
Albert finishes his business and they resume walking
So where you headed anyway
Dr
Browerly's office
My parents are making me see a shrink now
He asking lots of weird questions
You bet your left nut he is
He asked if  had any lustful thoughts toward my sister
What did you tell him
told him about beating off once with her brassiere
What did you tell him that for
You don't know what it's like think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth
Sounds like a professional
He must be very expensive
wouldn't know
The bill goes to your house
52
My mom is paying for your therapy
guess so
It was your cyclops was staring at
Yes, but it was your idea
That's true
Gee, maybe  am gay
Don't be retarded
We were doing research for our girlfriends
Oh, right
forgot
That's a relief
So you'll leave the door open
Yeah, just don't blow your load on my sheets
Thanks a pantsful, Nick
Don't mention it
See ya, Lefty
'  - Nick hunches over his desk doing homework, headphones over his ears
Estelle knocks and enters
Nick pulls the headphones down around his neck
Lance and  are walking down to the movie theater
There's  dinners in the freezer
Oh, and Nick - your father got a job in Ukiah
Mom
Do you think it might be a good idea if  moved in with him
Nick, that just wouldn't work depend on that child support money to eat
But shouldn't you depend on the child support money for, you know
child support
53
Watch your smart mouth
She slams the door
'  - (
) The plan is simple
Nick places two full cannisters of gasoline into the trunk of the Lincoln
Nick's behind the wheel, backing up the car
(
) Tow Jerry's trailer to a remote parking lot in Berkeley and burn it to the ground
The hitch ball grinds under the trailer socket
(
) Thus evicting myself from my mother's clutches and into the arms of My One And Only Love
Nick fires up the -8 engine and shifts into drive, pulling forward
He cuts across the lawn
(
) Francois wanted to torch the trailer where it sits, but 've convinced him a parking lot will reduce the risk of collateral damage
The trailer clips the corner of the house
Chunks of stucco fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes, collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of the home
Nick guns it, and with a lurch the trailer splinters free
He dodges the birch tree, but plows over the smaller Asian pear
The Lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street, the trailer weaving back and forth, smashing parked cars
() - Nick cruises along sedately
He plays with the radio and settles on the Sex Pistols
He looks up just in time to see the red light and slams on the brakes, nearly jack-knifing the trailer
The light turns green and the car lumbers up the long hill
54
- Nick hits the bump in the road right before the stop sign
The car bottoms out
The trailer bounces up, coming unhitched
/
() - Nick hits the gas and the Lincoln suddenly surges forward, released from the great weight
Nick smiles
Behind him, through the rear window, the trailer can be seen receding into the distance
He glances into the mirror and spots the trailer plunging down the hill
Then he crashes into the Fiat parked in front of him at the intersection
The gas tank on the Fiat cracks, spurting fuel onto the pavement
- Nick leaps from the Lincoln and watches open-mouthed as the vehicular ballet unfolds
Down the hill - the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery van and goes into a spin
The  sipping espresso at the outdoor cafe look up to see the words ' bearing down on them
The delivery van veers out of control
The Bohemians scatter
The truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way through the patio furniture and into the cafe
geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood
The trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy cross street below
Nick turns to see the still-restive Lincoln part from the Fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner
Oh no
forgot to set the brake
The     bolts after the accelerating Lincoln, but as he realizes the futility, slows to a jog
The driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake, and desperately rolls out of the way of the Fiat
slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer crosses four lanes of traffic
It jumps the curb crashing into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop
cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection, just in time to get clipped by the Lincoln
The cop car goes into a tail spin, smashing into a chicken transport
The flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom
55
The Lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom run, thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked building like a runaway express train
The gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop explodes, the trailer's two propane tanks going off like bombs
The Fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts apart, sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down on the spectators
The blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill, ending at Nick's feet
Nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of smoke billow into the sky, the geyser of water, the storm of dazed chickens
He turns around and does his best to inconspicuously walk
'  - Nick as he comes through the front door and is met with the sight of his mother and Lance staring at him from the kitchen table
The Berkeley fire rages on the television
Hey, Mom
How was the movie
You little shit
You stole your mother's dead ex-boyfriend's trailer and set a five million dollar fire
/ refuse to stand for such allegations
Nick
They have a description of the arsonist
Lance flips through his notebook and reads
white teenage male, about five- seven
hundred and twenty five pounds, dark hair, spotted complexion
That could be anyone
56
He was also wearing a tee shirt with the words: 'm single, let's mingle
Nick glances down at the lettering on his shirt
Oops
Estelle bursts into tears
What am  going to do
My only son will be sent to prison
Lance takes Estelle in his arms and smirks at Nick
Oh, Lance, can't something be done
Tell you what, Estelle
'll make out that Nick reported the car and trailer stolen before the fire
It'll be less suspicious
But could take some serious heat for this
Oh, Lance
You're wonderful
How can  possibly repay you
'll think of something, Estelle
He gives her ass a playful squeeze
She lets out a giggle
Now the kid better not be here when the detectives start coming around
'd send him away for a while long while
He can go make his father's life miserable
Nick suddenly brightens
But  like it here
You're going, buster
She snatches up the phone and dials
George's groggy voice can be heard answering
Estelle screams into the phone
57
You're son just burned down half of Berkeley
Come and get the little brat
Wait a minute, Estelle, aren't you going to punish him
'd say he deserves a good hiding
(cupping the squawking ) He's too much for me anymore
Can you do it, Lance, darling
Lance gives Nick another smirk
'  - Nick let's out a yelp of pain as Lance brings a broken tree limb against his bare bottom
(
) don't scream much
am making a painful sacrifice for The Woman Of My Dreams
My suffering possesses a beauty which elevates it above this sordid scene
With the final blow the tree limb cracks in half
Nick looks over his shoulder
Are you through
Lance looks around the room
Picks up an umbrella and considers it in his hand
Nick hangs his head
'  - We find Nick waiting in the drive with a pile of suitcases beside him
(
) Psst
Nick
Nick finds Lefty lurking in the shrubs that divide his mother's lawn from the neighbor's
He limps to his friend
was wondering what happened to you
Did you get to blow your wad
No
did not get to blow my wad
58
Did you get interrupted
No
Worse
What's worse than being interrupted
Millie is a lesbian
The only reason she wanted to hang out with me is because she heard that  showed you my slinky and thought  was gay too
Sorry, man
didn't have a great night either
Well,  dunno what you're gonna do, but 'm giving suicide serious consideration this time
Or you could just fake it and then hide out in Ukiah with me
Then later come back and maybe Millie Filbert will boink you out of pity
Hey, that's not a bad idea
Thanks a pantsful, Nick
pair of headlights swing into the drive and Lefty ducks out of sight
The headlights turn out to belong to George Twisp's The driver's side window rolls down to reveal Nick's dad
Lacey leans over George's seat to wave at Nick through the window and show him some of her cleavage
Hiya, Nick
Hi, Lacey
Hi, Dad
The trunk pops open
59
Is there any way  could sit up front with Lacey, Dad
Mom's boyfriend beat me pretty badly
Sorry, Nick
In this car, faggots get the back seat
/
325I () - Nick is in the back, crowded in by his belongings and Albert
They ride in tense silence until they pass the sight of the fire, where   sift through the ash
My God
Look what you've done
Lacey turns to look at Nick over the seat
They share a smile
-  - Morning peers over the distant hills
'   - The  pulls into the drive of the house - a plywood rectangle perched on cement blocks
Aluminum windows
swamp cooler on the shallow-pitched roof
They all emerge from the car
Go ahead and bring your stuff inside
Lacey and  need a nap
'mon, Sugar Puss
Nick watches longingly as George leads Lacey into the home
As he places his hand on Lacey's ass, he looks back over his shoulder and throws a smug look in Nick's direction
(
) What a competitive asshole
'   - Nick reaches the door and gently knocks
But it's Sheeni's ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at Nick sternly
Uhm, hello
Is Sheeni available
She most certainly is not
As a matter of fact, we've banned you from her life, Nick Twisp
60
Excuse me
Trent Preston informed us that not only were you moving here to pursue my daughter, but that you're not even mentally-handicapped, and thus molested my wife in the shower of sound mind and body
That rat-fink-fuck
You watch your language
This is a Christian home
We're sending Sheeni to Les Ecole des Arts and Literatures in Santa Cruz
Santa Cruz
But she'll be miserable without me
We're in love
The ogre snorts in condescending amusement
Then  guess it's a good thing Trent is going there too
She'll have someone to console her
And with that, Mr
Saunders slams the door so hard in Nick's face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and forth
- Nick makes his way past the arbor, crestfallen
Sheeni emerges from the shadows in a hooded sweatshirt over a lavender dress
Nick
Oh, Nick
Nick lights up at the sight of her and they embrace
They kiss passionately
He works his way to her neck and starts to reach under the sweatshirt
had to sneak away just to see you
That's okay
had to burn down half of Berkley
61
That was you
Nick, are you out of your mind
felt a grand gesture was required, darling
Sheeni's expression indicates that she is touched, but it turns to troubled
Nick, Trent betrayed us
Francois will kill him later
Who's Francois
Nevermind
The point is we must elope
Sheeni takes a step back at the notion
don't know, Nick
do love you, but  don't want to spend the rest of our lives on the run
It's a small price to pay
She takes another step back
can't, Nick
What
But, Sheeni
just don't get it
'm here
Albert's here too
know, Nick, and 've been longing for you so
But we'll just have to find another way
The car is already packed
Nick nods glumly and Sheeni seems overcome with remorse
Nick Twisp,  will not allow you to accept defeat so easily
() 62
(cont'd) When the time is right, you must make your way to Santa Cruz
And then we will make love
Nick lifts his gaze with renewed determination
Or we could consummate here in the woods
Did you bring the consumer reports
Nick just blinks blankly
Then it will have to be Santa Cruz
really must go now, darling
Well
Goodbye, Sheeni
love you
love you too
Squeeze darling Albert for me
She pulls her hood over her head
Nick watches wistfully as she slips away into the forest

This is a daunting thought if you think about it
down the row of other students, starting with a The row seems to descend in weight class, until we reach Nick at the very end
: Nick does his best to not be pinned by  , who out-weighs him by at least 40 pounds
63
- Nick rinses off
Dwayne steps up to the shower head next to his
Nick glances his way and quickly recoils at the repelling landscape of rolling pink flab
Sorry `bout wompin' ya
'm Dwayne
Nick
Nick Twisp
Say, Nick
Why do you suppose guys got only two testicles when we got ten fingers and toes
could not begin to speculate
Nick turns off his shower and slinks away
'   - Nick comes up the dusty road toting his backpack
On the porch of the Saunders' home, a handsome but somewhat unkempt  , mid-twenties, blows cool jazz on a beat-up trumpet
Hey, Nick
'm Paul, Sheeni's brother
Nick comes up the path to meet him
Hello, Paul
How did you know my name
We've met
No we haven't
In a previous life
Oh
Paul begins rolling a joint
Nice fire in Berkeley
64
Did Sheeni tell you that was me
She didn't have to
Why
Was  an arsonist in a previous life
No
But Sheeni was
My God
What did she burn
Men
Men and boys
Paul hands the joint out to Nick
He regards it dubiously
'   - An empty hallway
plays
Nick comes around the corner, literally floating down the hall
He breaststrokes through the air toward us
'  - He passes just under the door frame and comes down, feet touching carpet
He looks into the mirror and finds Francois lounging on the bed behind him
My God, Francois
What was Paul smoking
Shut up and go with it
Nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing Lacey's lingerie
Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs
He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging
He removes a -cup bra and holds it high
He uses the elastic straps to fasten the bra onto his head
He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys rendition of  in his head
Waving arms
Bicycling leg movements
65
As he backs up we can see that George is watching him from the doorway, a Safeway bag in his arms
Lacey peers over his shoulder
The  halts abruptly
What the
What the hell
Nick gives a startled jump
Is
Is that my bra
'   - Nick sits at the table, considerably more clothed and sober
George works on a jug of zin
We're calling that fruitcake display strike one
Two more strikes and it's back to Oakland
Nick nods
The front door opens and
enters with Safeway bags of her own
Dwayne follows close behind her
Hey, Nick
Albert barks and jumps at Dwayne's feet
Uh
Hi, Dwayne
What are you doing here
Ain't ya heard
We're gonna be roommates
Ain't that zinky
Nick looks to his father in horror as Dwayne goes chasing after the dog
Dwayne, get yer dumb ass back here and take yer sleepin' pill
You must be Nick
Wash yer hands, boy
don't serve two shifts
Uh
Dad
What's going on
Mrs
Crampton's our new housekeeper
'm renting out the spare room to her seeing as her camper has been deemed unfit for human habitation
66
What about Dwayne
He's bunking with you
Dad
You working on strike two
Nick leans back and glares in silent protest as everyone takes their seats at the table
'  - Nick tries to shut out the sound of Dwayne getting into the creaky bed behind him
Say, Nick
You wanna sleep in bed with me
It'll be tons warmer
No thank you, Dwayne
knock at the door
Lacey enters
This came for you, Nick
Nick sits up in bed to receive the letter
As Lacey leaves, he tears through the wax seal and unfolds its contents
Is it a love letter, Nick
don't know, it's in French
Say, why does your mother give you sleeping pills
`Cuz otherwise 'd stay up all night playin' Nintendo Wii
Say, Nick, can  walk Albert
don't know
Dogs don't grow on trees
Pleeease, Nick
67
Okay
But it will cost you one sleeping pill per walk
Whatchu want them pills for, Nick
You never know when sedatives will come in handy
'   - Nick emerges from the home
He makes his way down the road
- He stops at the familiar sight of My Green Haven
He gets an amused smile and sighs with nostalgia
The front door of the trailer opens and Lefty emerges
Nick furrows his brow in confusion as Lefty locks the door and comes down the path
Lefty
Oh
Hey, Nick
Lefty, what are you doing here
live here
The guy's only charging me fifty in cash a month
mean, what are you doing in town
did what you told me, Nick threw my backpack off the pier and reported my own suicide
even left a note
Wow, Lefty, 'm kinda impressed
Faking your suicide is pretty ballsy
Lefty joins Nick in his walk down the road
So where you headed
68
Redwood High School
Can  come
Why would you want to go to school if you didn't have to
It's weird, Nick, but school seems like a pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and homework
can see this stunt really has liberated your mind
'm telling you, Nick: killing myself was the best thing that ever happened to me
- rowdy cafeteria
Lefty and Nick dine in the corner
Nick has an open French textbook as he tries to decipher Sheeni's letter
An Indian boy,  , 16, makes his way to them
May  sit at your table
Sure
'm Lefty and this is Nick
am Vijay Joshi
Vijay sits and shakes their hands
see you both have been rejected by the socially elite of our school
Ukiah is a cultural wasteland compared to India
Though some of the girls are very attractive
Do you have a girlfriend
Not at the moment
But  am optimistic
How about you
69
Yes, but she transferred
You don't mean Sheeni Saunders heard she was interested in some brilliant fellow in the Bay Area
Hey, that's you, Nick
'm surprised
You are not at all what  imagined
Nick narrows his eyes
So how is Sheeni
don't know
She sent me this letter
But it's in French
Shall  translate it for you
You speak French
speak French, English, Hindi, Marathi, and Urdu
That must come in handy
Nick hands over the letter and Vijay starts reading it silently
He chuckles as he reads and Nick squints his eyes at him in annoyance
Vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud
Dear, Nick
'   - In Nick's imagination, Sheeni puts pen to paper at her desk which affords a view of the sun setting on the ocean
(
) am writing you from my room in Santa Cruz
Surprisingly, boarding school has proven to be a welcome liberation as well as
70
'  - (
) a stimulating experience which am now not so quick to change
Sheeni slips into a nightgown as other  walk around scantily clad behind her
Perhaps you should consider learning French and enrolling
That said
-  - Sheeni chats up a gathering of   in the hall
They regard her lustfully
(
) English cannot be spoken on campus even if you are hemorrhaging from an accidental limb amputation
- (
) have made friends with the head of the girls' basketball team
Her name is Heather, and despite her popularity, she is saving herself for college boys
, a slender giantess, poses with the other members of the   for a yearbook photo
'   - (
) have an interesting roommate from New York named Taggarty
, short dark hair, intense green eyes, Manhattan sophistication cloaked in fragile ripeness, snaps a Polaroid of a sleepy
(
) She has already slept with seventeen boys and hopes to rack up fifty before leaving here
Taggarty tacks the picture to a wall covered with Polaroids
She writes the boy's grade (-) beneath his image
- The distant figure on the windsurf board can only be Trent
71
(
) Trent has taken up windsurfing and has been designated target number one by all the girls
am still very angry at him for the betrayal but he claims he wants to mend our friendship
The figure falls into the surf and the crowd of watching -  gasp in horror
(
) guess we shall see
- () All in all, 'm happy and look forward to further growth in this rich, intellectual environment
Vijay sets down the letter
Nick waits a beat, staring in disbelief
That's it
Nothing else about me
Vijay picks up the letter again
Oh yes
Love to you and Albert
(setting down the letter) Who's Albert
Albert is our dog
This is a disaster
What the hell does she mean Trent wants to mend the relationship
don't know, but this Taggarty girl sounds very uninhibited wonder if she's made it with a Hindu yet
Heather sounds like a babe
You think if  grew a beard 'd pass for college age
've got to get to Sheeni as soon as possible
If  don't Trent Preston is going to mindfuck her into thinking she doesn't like me
72
And then he'll probably fuck her in other ways
Did you know you're supposed to put your pinkie in a girl's bumhole, Vijay
Will you shut up and help me out
Sorry, Nick
What should we do
suggest we steal my father's and take a trip to Santa Cruz
Vijay, you'll have to be our translator
But what will we tell our parents
You can tell your father you are staying at Nick's house for the weekend
And visa versa
Good thinking
But what if we are caught
To hell with it, Vijay
It's time to take action
The  as Nick removes his Dad's keys from the bureau
The trunk  closed with the sleeping bags inside
The  of the engine as Vijay's hand turns the key in the ignition
/
325I () - As Vijay drives, Lefty holds up a road map in the back seat
Nick places a  in the stereo and   fills the car
What is this music, Nick
It's Dave Brubeck
(to Vijay) thought a person as cultured as yourself would appreciate it
73
You want culture
will give you culture
Vijay puts in his own  and Ravi Shankar's  blasts from the speakers
Nick gives Vijay a grin of approval
- through the forest to keep up with the Beamer
- The  passes cars on the Golden Gate Bridge
- The Beamer navigates the winding curves of the highway where green hills meet the Pacific Ocean
- The car pulls to a stop in the parking lot, the school looming beyond, slightly obfuscated by a light drizzle
The music cuts out with the engine
-  - The grouping of  part as we move through them
Finally, we reach the center of their attention
Sheeni, Taggarty, and Heather standing together in their coats
Nickie
Nick, Vijay, and Lefty are noticeably shorter than the older boys around them
Hello, Sheeni
(to Taggarty and Heather) Hi, 'm Nick
Oh
So you're Nick
We've heard so much about you
And this is Vijay
And this is Lefty
Lefty goes to
74
And 'm not gay
Nick,  knew you'd come
Sheeni glances over at the disapproving
She leans in close
but you must wait in the car until we can sneak you in
Nick nods in understanding
'  -  - An empty hall
The   of
Sheeni rounds the corner at the far end
As she and Heather sneak the boys down, the other  of the floor giggle in French and dart from door to door in near-undress
'   - cement cubicle just big enough for a bunk bed, two small desks, an army surplus dresser, and a stuffed armchair
Sheeni pulls a nightgown from the dresser
Lefty, should maybe sleep in my room
It's pretty crowded in here
Your roommate won't mind
Oh, Darlene went home for the weekend
Lefty gulps and picks up his grip
He pauses in the hallway
Well, see you guys in the morning
The door closes and Vijay and Nick exchange a knowing glance
Pardon me, everyone
Sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change
Vijay and Nick regard the
' a series of mug shots of sullen-looking
Most of them have been given a grade of - or below
75
There's your competition
distinguished group  would be happy to join
The two boys turn around and watch in hot-blooded bliss as Taggarty searches for her misplaced nightie
'  - The two boys brush their pearlies over the grungy sink
am in a state of sexual frenzy
What is your plan
We drape a blanket over the lower bunk for Sheeni and me
You tackle Taggarty on the top bunk
Here's a condom
slipped two to Lefty, leaving us with four
What if they don't go for it
They'll go for it
You can cut the sexual tension in that room with a knife
'   - Don't be silly, darling
Not with others in the room
(leaning in to whisper) We must wait until everyone falls asleep
Nick tries to appear unconcerned
She gives him a kiss and climbs into her narrow bed
As Nick and Vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor, they watch Taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky
Goodnight boys
Do you need the light on to take off your clothes
No
(flipping off the light) We can find our zippers in the dark
76
beat of
Then a light tap at the door
There is the sound of Sheeni getting out of bed
She cracks the door, letting in just enough light from the hall that a gets cast across the two boys on the floor
Nick squints and tries to hear what Sheeni and the male shadow are whispering to each other
After a beat, Sheeni closes the door and the room plunges into  once again
Nick listens as Sheeni climbs back into bed as if nothing happened
Sheeni
Yes, Nick
Was that the matron
No
Beat
Then who was it
It was Trent
Beat
Did you say it was Trent
Yes
He came to discuss our friendship
told him now was not the time
So where is Trent now
assume he went back to the boys' dorm
Now really, Nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries
Though silence follows, we take a moment to allow Nick's mind to race in the dark
He stands and looks at the mirror above the dresser
Francois can be made out sitting by the window in the moonlight, stroking the Thompson
77
Now is our chance
Chance for what
To confront our nemesis
We must go to the boys' dorm and kill Trent where he sleeps
suppose we should at least get a look at him
To see what we're dealing with
Very well
(stubbing out his ) You see what we are dealing with
and zen  wll deal wiz it
And with that he cocks the Thompson for dramatic flare
'  -  - Nick emerges from the room in nothing but his underwear and a whindbreaker
He creeps down the hall
-  - The school   crawls by in the background, a searchlight sweeping the grounds
The moment it is out of sight, Nick darts from the bushes of the girls' dorm and races across the campus to the boys' dorm
-  - Nick makes his way down the hall, checking the names on the colored paper cut-out shapes that adorn the doors
He stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts the names  and
Nick knocks on the door
It opens inward to reveal a bare-chested, hulking athlete in a pajama pants
This is
Trent
No
Who the hell are you
78
am Nick Twisp
Oh, so you're Nick
Is Trent here
You just missed him, Nick
He just grabbed a couple condoms and left
Did he say where he was going
think he said he was going to Heather's room
But that's where Lefty is
Who are you
Ed
Ed Solomon
Trent's roommate
Oh, so you're Ed
What's that supposed to mean
Nothing
It's just that Sheeni mentioned Trent has a thing for a guy named Ed, and that he touches the guy when he falls asleep
But obviously if that were you, you'd know about it
Must be a different Ed Solomon
Take care now
Nick takes off running and Ed stares after him
-  - The security van continues to make its rounds
We find Nick crouching behind the steps to the boys dorm
He pulls the hood of his windbreaker over his head and takes a deep breath
As the searchlight passes by, he makes a break for it
with Nick as he darts from one form of cover to the next, perhaps accompanied by the imagined sounds of mortar blasts and machine gun turret fire
79
At long last he reaches the girls' dorm undetected
'  -  - Nick bangs on the door
Heather answers in little more than a -string and Nick seems to forget his mission just long enough to appreciate her body
What's up, Nick
Is Trent in there
Not anymore
What happened to Lefty
(
) 'm right here, Nick
Nick peers past Heather where he finds Lefty standing naked in the moonlight
Trent was here, but he left
He only dropped by to lend us a couple more condoms
But  gave Lefty two already
Yes, and that was very generous of you, but the night is young
So what is Trent, the fucking condom faerie
You can have one of ours, Nick
If you need one
The fact that Nick doesn't yet raises his temperament even further
So where did he say he was going
He didn't say, but 'm pretty sure just saw him go into our bathroom down the hall
80
Thanks
Oh, and 'd be careful with those condoms
Trent's roommate Ed said that Trent pokes holes in them so that he can get Sheeni pregnant and be with her forever
And with that piece of disturbing info, he leaves them
'  - There is the  of thunder outside as Nick throws open the door to the girls' bathroom
He looks around with murderous rage
There comes the sound of someone vomiting
Nick kicks in the stall and finds  , 17, a thin platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe
She hurls into the toilet again and turns around to find Nick
Who are you
'm Sheeni's friend, Nick
Sorry to disturb you
That's
It was something  ate
So wait, are you Sheeni's boyfriend
Uh, yeah
My name's Bernice
Bernice Lynch
Not that you asked
Nice to meet you Bernice
Actually, think Trent Preston mentioned you
He said you were frumpy, but now that 've met you,  can see Trent is a lying bastard
Thanks
And Trent can go to hell for all  care
Sheeni too
You don't like Sheeni
81
Personally,  hate her guts
Well, pardon me, Nick
feel like throwing up some more now
You didn't happen to see Trent Preston did you
She waves him away as she bends over the sink to hurl again
Then lifts her face and smiles through the dripping bile
did actually
think he was on his way to Sheeni's room
Nick's eyes widen in alarm
'   - Nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking
Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk
He watches the moon lit forms thumping together
He turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom bunk
He moves toward her
She blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him
Sheeni
Yes, darling
Was Trent here
Yes, Nick
Nick hangs his head
But  sent him away again
Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he finds nothing but adoration
Because  want you, darling
Not even Trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me
82
She smiles
Nick smiles too
She reaches out to pull him into her bed as
The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight
'est que c'est passer ici
Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk
He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of
Trent standing behind the matron
The blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically
'  - The boys come out of the front door of the dormitory, the matron, flanked by   , hot on their heels
The girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves, cheering the boys' escape
Vijay's pants fall to his ankles, tripping him up
Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the Vietnamese Army
They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds
Nick gets in first
Lefty dives through the back window, legs kicking
Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team catches up to them
The authorities bang on the windows as Nick peels out
blares from the car
They speed off into the night
/
325I () - Lefty lets out a holler of joy
did it three times
Two long ones and a quickie
Great
Just great
How about you, Vijay
It was difficult to tell with that condom, Nick
Why did you buy such thick ones
That brand was top-rated by Consumers
83
Well, she's safe
No organism could penetrate those walls
You think the girls are in trouble
They will likely notify their parents
Perhaps even expel them
That's it
Expel them
Then Sheeni will have to come back to Ukiah
The car sputters
Nick's eyes go to the gas gauge
101 -  - The rain is coming down again
Nick shivers in his underwear
Vijay isn't in much more and Lefty's sheet is drenched
What will we do
Well, we can't stay in the car
Sooner or later Highway Patrol is going to come by and ask for our non-existent driver's license
But we have no money
have no shoes
'll catch pneumonia and die a indeterminate proto-quasi-virgin
101 -  - couple coins are inserted into a roadside pay phone
There is ringing on the other end
(
) Hello
(into phone) Mom
It's Nick
'm sorry to wake you, but 'm hoping you'll help your only son
Especially seeing as it would really piss off Dad
long beat
84
(
) Where are you, Nick
101 -  - The three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay phone
The three of them huddle under their only windbreaker
pair of headlights appear in the rain
The headlights flash twice and Nick runs out into the road
Nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie-whities
The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to reveal, the driver, a man named  , a seven foot tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls
He looks down at our three waylaid adventurers
Pardon me
But is one of you Nick Twisp
The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if this is how people go missing
Yeah
'm Nick
'm Wally
'm a friend of your mom's
Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being sent on a midnight mission
So, uhm, uh
Your mom says you need a ride
Did  mention 'm a friend
Nick breaks into a smile
Finally the Gods have cut him a break
'  - Wally and Estelle watch the three semi-clothed boys shovel in fried liver with no complaint
Wally was a friend of Jerry's
He came to help me in my time of mourning
85
What happened to Lance
Estelle's face registers "none of your business," but a kind look from Wally and she softens
Lance is busy training to be a detective
He isn't around as much as he used to be
Nick nods and goes back to eating
Mr
Rumpkin is very smart
Ask him a question, Nick
Okay
Mr
Rumpkin, what famous actress was married to Frank Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey Rooney
Whoever she is, she sure gets around
Ava Gardner
Estelle smiles with pride
Nick and the other boys regard the gentle giant with admiration
He bashfully averts his eyes
That's nothing
You should see what he did with the living room
'   - Nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway
Where once the Chevy occupied the space, the living room was now fairly returned to it's normal uncluttered state with all the furniture placed back in the original positions
At some point Wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared by the living and dining areas because the Chevy now occupies that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it has achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall
Estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch
Go ahead, Wally
Show them
Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights come on, giving the living room a warm, flattering glow
86
, , Ooooooh
Wally flips another switch and the car's radio turns on
, , Aaaaaaah
Wally makes a slightly embarrassed gesture of scratching his head before lumbering over to the couch and taking a seat next to Estelle
Nick watches as Wally puts his arm around his mother and they listen to the Chevy play them Elvis'
The two adults snuggle in the glow of the tail lights and it brings an unexpected rush of caring in his expression
- The truck rumbles to a stop and the three boys climb out
Nick looks, over his shoulder at Wally blushing behind the wheel of the truck
Well, uhm
It was nice meeting you, Nick
You too, Mr
Rumpkin
Wally blushes even more
He closes the door and starts to turn the truck around
Nick watches him go
Wally waves goodbye
Nick turns and the three boys make their way down the dusty road
'   - Lacey works up a sweat to Billy Blank
Nick comes through the door
He's still in his underwear
Where's Dad
In the bedroom
wouldn't bother him, Nick
He's in a foul mood
He's on with the police
Apparently someone broke in and stole his Beamer
Lacey gives Nick an amused smile
(
) Lacey
Get in here
87
Lacey rolls her eyes and heads for the bedroom
Nick sits down with Dwayne at the breakfast table
Nick, you got a girlfriend
Yes,  do
If you asked your girlfriend as a favor, would she do it with me
Guys don't share their girlfriends
get ya
You're worried `cause your girlfriend might get knocked up
What if  pull out, Nick
Nick seethes inwardly
There comes a ruckus from the back bedroom and Lacey emerges
It's not my fault, you tight-assed, critical, nonfeeling, sexist drunk
(
) Sticks and stones
It doesn't bother me if you sleep on the couch from now on
Does it bother you that you're a selfish, uptight, boring lover
You forgot lousy driver
George appears in the doorway
That's strike two, jerkoff
Nick hangs his head
George moves about the kitchen chugging from a jug of zin
Lacey picks up the ringing phone
Hello
() Thank you
Lacey hangs up the phone
88
They found your car in Davenport, George
Go pick it up
Look who's wearing the pants this morning
Lacey takes a seat next to Nick and sighs
Nick,  feel for you
It must be tough being a teenager in this house
My mother wasn't any better
Your mom has had a difficult time
She has had a great deal to put up with
'm starting to appreciate that now
Are you by any chance referring to me
If the shoe fits, suck on it
George swills some zin and mumbles ominously
We'll see who's sucking on what soon
- spoke with Taggarty this morning
She requested a wallet sized photo
Nick looks up glumly from his lunch
Lefty has his feet up on the table, his facial growth is almost respectable
Congratulations, Vijay
That makes it official
Welcome to the club
Nick narrows his eyes at the two non-virgins
What grade did you receive
89
+
Which  feel is perfectly satisfactory given the conditions
guess this means they're not being expelled
No, apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent
Are you kidding
She had her flashlight trained on your Hindi boner
beat
Lefty and Vijay seem taken aback by the outburst
No need to be jealous, Nick
Nick stands and collects his lunch tray
(
) If 'm to get Sheeni expelled and sent back to me  will need a partner in crime
-   - Nick enters the computer lab and finds an open machine
(
) Luckily, Francois has a girl on the inside
Nick begins typing and speaking out loud
Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting you this weekend in the bathroom
'  - Bernice reads the letter
(
) just want you to know  now see why you loath Sheeni Saunders so strongly
'  - Sheeni, Taggarty, and Heather sit across from the as the matron describes the events
90
(
) too have come to despise the snooty, pretentious brunette and in all honesty you should probably get her expelled
am happy to help in that regard
'  - (
) have included a number of sleeping pills with this note
Bernice dumps the pills from the envelope
- (
) You must introduce one of these into her breakfast beverage each day
Bernice sits next to Sheeni, despite the fact she's being ignored
Bernice drops a pill into Sheeni's coffee nonchalantly
- Sheeni watches the

) She may be intelligent, but she is not likely to pass her courses when she's falling asleep in class
Sheeni's head slips off her hand as she drifts off
We across the classroom to where Bernice scribbles in her notebook
(
) Since meeting you,  have come to realize my interest in Sheeni was only a transient adolescent infatuation
like you more than can say
Take courage
Together we will outsmart these cake eaters
view of the notebook shows her to be scribbling Nick's name with hearts
She flips through pages of obsession
-   - Nick's fingers fly across the keys
He looks pleased with himself
(
) Affectionately yours, Nick
91
He looks around for observers, looks back at the screen pensively, and resumes typing
(
) Please destroy this note immediately
As Nick deposits his letter
'   - Nick wanders up the drive
him into the house
'   - where he comes upon the sight of Paul giving Lacey a foot message on the couch
Where's Dad
() Daddy is in Davenport
Where you left his car
We saved you some mushrooms, Nick
Nick watches the sensual foot message
He picks up the bag full of mushrooms and considers them
- Nick pukes his guts into the sink
'  - Nick's in bed reading Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets
He glances up at Dwayne playing Nintendo and scowls
There comes the strange warbled sound of a  from the next room, and it is joined by other instruments until we hear The Nutley Brass' rendition of
Nick furrows his eyebrows in confusion
as the nude figures suddenly  , making wonderful love
Nick follows them with his eyes as they float off the page
92
Nick as he follows the nude figures who do acrobatics down
and into
where Lacey watches Paul blow on his trumpet
Nick marvels
The phone rings
Nick
Get the phone
Nick picks up the phone and Paul takes his place at Lacey's feet
(into phone) Hello
/
325I () - George cradles the cell phone
Nick
Is that you
am Nick Twisp
am alive
am a breathing organism
Quit fooling around, Nick
This is your dad
Is everything okay there
Don't be afraid, Dad
Everything will be okay
You deserve to be loved
What the hell is that supposed to mean
Is Lacey there
Lacey is here
Paul is caressing her toes
Paul
Who the hell is Paul
93
Paul is our friend
He makes beautiful music for the acrobats
They're naked
Who's naked
Is Lacey naked
Don't be afraid, Dad
Goodbye
He hangs up the phone and pulls out the cord
He joins Paul in working Lacey's feet
Dad is afraid
He is on the wrong path
have felt that for some time
'  - Nick watches the headlights from the arriving  travel across the walls
They go out
He listens to the front door being keyed followed by his father bellowing
Nick gets up and wanders into
where Paul stands between George and Lacey
Okay, George, just calm down
George lunges and Paul socks him in the eye, dropping him to the floor
You are in serious trouble
You've assaulted me and  know for a fact that you two were having naked orgies with my son
That child is only twelve years old
George gets to his feet
'm sixteen, Dad
94
Shut your pie hole
(turning to Lacey and ) That boy is an underaged minor
'm going to have you arrested and charged with child molesting
Don't be an idiot, George
No one was naked
When you get out of prison, you will both have to register as sex offenders
You will never be able to get a decent job again
've never had a decent job don't think 'd want one
Let's go, Paul
George, 'll pick up the rest of my things tomorrow
Not until you pay me the rest of the money you owe
paid you all your money
Not the extra charges
She gets up in his face
Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges
As Lacey and Paul depart, Nick turns and dreamily wanders back toward his room
(
) Using bad language in front of a minor
The judge will hear about that too
Nick gets back into his room and closes the door behind him
Dwayne playing Nintendo naked
He looks over his shoulder
What's all the ruckus about
95
Dwayne
Please cover yourself
You wanna play Nintendo all night
Of course not
'm tired
Let's go to sleep
Nick unplugs the Nintendo and climbs into bed
Dwayne just sits there on the floor, naked as a clam
'  - (
) strange night
dreamed of wrestling for what seemed like hours with an amorous walrus
Nick squirms with an amorphous blob, they wrestle against the red abstract background
'  - Nick's bleary eyes snap open and wander to the floor, where his pajamas lie in a crumpled pile
(
) There is only one explanation: have been Dwayned
pillow whacks across a blubbery face
Wake up
know what you were doing last night, you disgusting beast
Don't be mad, Nick
like you
Dwayne throws off his sheets
Nick shudders at the sight
which is when Mrs
Crampton barges in
Boys, time to get--
Dwayne
Where's yer pajamas
Nick made me take them off, Mom
He took off his too
You leave my son alone
Don't go co'rupt him with yer nastiness
96
We weren't doing anything, Mrs
Crampton
It was just hot last night
If you get hot, boys, open a window
Don't go takin' off yer pajamas
That's nasty
'   - Nick dials on the phone
Behind him, Dwayne eats breakfast, cheerfully kicking his feet back and forth under the chair
(
) Bonjour
Taggarty
It's Nick
'   - Taggarty's at her desk
Her thick rimmed glasses almost make her look studious
Hey, Nick
suppose you want to talk to Sheeni
If you please
Taggarty crosses to the bunks, where Sheeni is curled up among the sheets as if in some Renaissance portrait
It's your would-be-lover
Sheeni sleepily takes the phone
Nick
Hello, My Beloved
How are you
Not so well
have been afflicted with some kind of chronic fatigue
Perhaps you are home sick
You do sound rather blue
97
'm not home sick, Nick
In fact, 'm not very happy with you
Me
What did  do
You know damn well, Nick
You've been spreading rumors about Trent
And he doesn't deserve it
Doesn't deserve it
'd have to claim he has genital warts to sink to his level
Well, whatever you said to Ed Solomon, it was enough to get him to give Trent a black eye
Sheeni,  just don't get it
This guy has cock-blocked at every turn and you're taking his side
Cock-blocked
() We'll have to resume this another time, Nick
It's been an emotionally exhausting weekend
My parents are in an uproar over Paul
He's moved some floozie in with him up in the studio over the garage
Lacey's not a floozie
Lacey
You know her
Of course
She's my father's ex- girlfriend
think that might make you my stepmother-in-law
Nick
Don't be gross
Sorry
At any rate, 'll let you go
We'll have plenty of time to settle this tomorrow
98
Tomorrow
Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving
'll be coming for dinner, of course
Don't even think it, Nick
You know my parents don't approve of you
'm confident they will learn to love me
After all, 'm practically family
Nick, you must dismiss this Thanksgiving notion from your mind
remain firm on this issue
Goodbye
Nick regards the phone defensively
He puts it down and takes a seat at the table
He glares at Dwayne as they eat breakfast
There comes a knock at the front door
Don't move, blubber boy, 'll get it
/
'   - stands on the steps
Nick goes wide eyed at the sight of him and visibly slumps
Is George Twisp in
Uh, 'm pretty sure he's sleeping off a hangover, Officer
Is he under arrest
Under arrest
No, 'm the officer working the case of his stolen car
Ah
You can tell your pop that the he found in his car is Ravi Shankar
99
Excuse me
Indian music
So we're a checkin' the  files, see if we can get some prints that match
You wouldn't know anyone who might have stolen the car who listens to this crap, would ya, son
No, and 'm not sure  like the implication
Ravi Shankar is beloved by many Caucasian
(
) What about Vijay Joshi
Nick stands stiff as a board
The officer peers around him at Dwayne sitting inside
'm pretty sure he's Injun
The officer makes a note
(to himself) Vijay Joshi
We'll look into it
Thank you, boys
Nick gives a weak smile and closes the door
(
) Mrs
Crampton complained to Dad that  tried to corrupt the fat pervert cohabitating with me
'   - Nick totes boxes of belongings from the house to the Crampton's dilapidated camper
(
) He has deemed it strike three, but is only banishing me as far as Mrs
Crampton's condemned trailer
- view of the thin birch walls
We come to rest on Nick, shivering under an electric blanket
There's a blob of snot on his upper-lip
100
(
) No matter
Tomorrow  will be reunited with My Everlasting Love
And  will not be stopped
Not by an outbreak of the plague, nor by a cruel return of the ice-age
Not even by the Gods themselves
'   - The velvet voices of the Rat Pack come from the home
Nick emerges from the Camper wrapped in the electric blanket
He scurries into the house
- Nick showers
Nick straightens his Garcia tie in the mirror
He applies hair gel
Nick examines the whitehead on his brow
He pinches and a glob of puss smacks the mirror
'   -  - He emerges into the hall and dances with an invisible partner into the
where the phone
He flips off the stereo with the remote and snatches up the phone
Twisp residence
(
) Nick
Oh
Hey, Mom
What's up
(
) Nickie,  have some bad news
Nick sighs
Okay
'm ready
What is it
(
) 'm afraid Lance and Wally got into a terrible row
He tried to arrest Wally and Wally broke Lance's jaw
101
What's the bad news
(
) The Berkeley police know you started the fire
Lance told them where you are
Nick glances up and sees the black and white patrol car pulling up outside
(
) Nick, they're coming to arrest you
He slams down the phone
'   - The window slides open and Nick comes crawling out, leaping to the ground
He takes off running through the woods
- Nick pounds on the door
(
) Nick
Nick turns to find Lefty coming up the path with two bags of groceries under his arms
Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today
Nick, haven't you heard
Vijay's been arrested
Arrested
For grand theft auto
They found his prints in your father's car
That's terrible
Did he go quietly
No
He said you were his accomplice and now the Ukiah police are looking for you
We linger a beat on Nick's blank expression
Then - 102
- We're off and running through the woods, trying to keep up with Nick as he flees
(
) The day has proven to be a disaster
Where did  gone wrong have a decision to make
- The spotlight from the overhead helicopter sweeps over the bridge and continues down the road
(
) could hit the road and spend my life a fugitive with my integrity nearly intact
Nick squats in the shadows
He's holding a bouquet of municipal flowers and dabs the sweat on his head with his tie
(
) It's that or risk incarceration to keep my dinner date
() Obviously the answer is clear
'   - Nick peers through the bushes at the mobile home across the street
squad car crawls past, the rover squawking a terse description of a teenage white male
Nick emerges from the shrubs and approaches the house
He rings the ornate Victorian doorbell
Paul answers in an apron
Hello, Nick
Right on time
Come in
'   - Lacey floats toward him and gives him a hug
Happy Thanksgiving, Lacey
She spots the sad flowers in his hand
103
What interesting flowers, Nick
Who are they for
Uh, Mrs
Saunders
Lacey leads him by the hand into the chintz-bedecked parlor
Sheeni's larger-than-life father and 5,000 year old mother sit cross-legged on the floor, running their hands over the hooked rug
Mr
and Mrs
Saunders, you remember Nick Twisp, don't you
Mrs
Saunders coos and takes the flowers
Her husband squints up at him
You are very, very tall
No he's not, Dad
He just appears tall because you are on the floor
can feel the floor pushing against me
Can you feel it too, tall youth
Nick glances over at Mrs
Saunders who is now eating the flowers
Paul served an appetizer earlier
Yes, it's a recipe  picked up in the Southwest
Stuffed mushrooms
Nick smiles with amusement
(
) Hello, Nick
Taggarty makes her entrance down the stairs, cloaked in a green cape
How is the star-crossed persistent lover
She greets him with a casually intimate kiss
104
Okay,  guess
Where's Sheeni
Upstairs, Nick
She saw you coming and hid in her room
'  - Nick knocks and enters to find Sheeni sprawled on the bed with a book
Dinner is almost ready, My Love
do not intend to be party to my brother's absurdities
He has allowed you in and drugged my parents
think they are deriving some good from the experience
Sheeni finally looks up from her book
What are you doing here, Nick expressly asked you not to come
To hell with that
What do  have to do to prove my love to you
My friends have gotten laid and 'm pretty sure neither one of them was beaten with a tree trunk, raped by a walrus, or had to contend with the likes of Trent Preston
You were raped by a walrus
Sheeni,  have shown restraint, have committed crimes,  have traveled to the lengths of the state and still you won't give me this one little thing
Sex, Nick
Why don't you just say it
That's what you want
You want me to have sex with you
105
() Well
beat as Nick's open admissions makes her consider his point
She sighs and shakes her head
How is my dog
Excellent
He should be coming out of the oven right about now
She tosses the book at him, but he dodges it successfully
hate you, Nickie
She stands up and tries to slap him
He grabs her wrists and pulls her to him
hate you too
They share a long, intense kiss
They break away and she smiles in spite of herself
'   - The Saunders and extended family take their seats at the polished mahogany table crammed with turkey, yams, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce
They all lower their heads and Lacey leads them in prayer
Dear Lord
Mr
Saunders emits a long, low, fog horn of a fart that ends badly
The others exchange glances but he and his wife still have their heads solemnly bowed
Dear Lord, thank you for this bounty
Help us to be tolerant of others - especially the boyfriends and girlfriends of our immediate relations
Amen
Amen
106
They begin eating
helicopter passes by outside, search light briefly coming through the windows
Nick watches Mr
Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes and apply it to his face like war paint
Paul
Your father looks rather strange
Well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel movement
That's no excuse
Another helicopter passes overhead
The food is delicious, Paul
Thank you
() Sister, darling, how long has it been since we all observed the rituals of Thanksgiving
Not long enough, Paul
hope it's the first of many such occasions for me
Sheeni narrows her eyes at him
long beat as they all dine in silence
Then- Mrs
Saunders croaks out in song
Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/ Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright
Paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others accompany her as Mr
Saunders pretends to conduct them with a drumstick
Round yon virgin Mother and Child/ Holy infant so tender and mild/ Sleep in heavenly peace
Sle-eep in heavenly pee-eace
107
And with that, the doorbell rings
Taggarty gets up and opens the door
Oh, Trent, you made it
Nick glances up with a start as   makes his entrance
He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous features and a certain flamboyance
His black eye, courtesy of Ed Solomon, still remains
Hello, Taggarty
Hello, Everyone
Mr
Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the pitcher and pours water into his own lap
Trent, darling, this is Nick
Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes
Nick, at last we meet
Hello, Trent
Have a seat, Trent
'm sorry, Taggarty,  can't stay
have bad news
What is it
Bernice Lynch has tried to commit suicide
Sheeni and Taggarty gasp
Nick swallows hard
She swallowed a number of sleeping pills, and is now in a coma
The poor girl
There's more
Before  left school, searched her room
108
Did you obtain proper authorization from the officials
No, Nick,  acted on my own initiative
In Bernice's closet, found this letter
He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket
In the letter, the writer instructed Bernice to begin sedating Sheeni with drugs he himself supplied
Nick, you didn't
Well, you see
Nick
You could have killed me
Who died
No one yet, Mr
Saunders
Mrs
Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction
can't arrest him
But  have called the Santa Cruz Police
They are on their way here now
Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands
Well,  shall be going now
Please continue without me
Nick,  suggest you remain here and face the consequences like a man
Nick stops in front of Trent
109
Thank you for that unsolicited counsel, Trent
And please, do drop dead
The other guests murmur their shock
Nick stops in the doorway
Goodbye, Sheeni
did it all for you
You are completely contemptible, Nick Twisp
never wish to see you again
With the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears, Nick leaves
- Nick's silhouette figure racing through the trees
(
) Here  am, reviled by friends and family
Relentlessly pursued by three police jurisdictions
Nick stops at the edge of the woods to catch his breath
(
) Froncois suggests we flee the country
But where to go
Mexico
Canada
India, perhaps
He looks up the road which has been blocked off by flashing squad cars
-  - The downtown high-rises protrude from the layer of smog
In pre-lap, someone pushes a door  repeatedly
'  - Joanie opens the door and finds Nick on her doorstep
Uh, Hi, Joanie
How's it going
Nick
110
'  - (
) Since my sister can see through me, 'm obliged to give a relatively candid and thorough review of the events
Joanie listens gravely, shaking her head at the most gruesome parts of the story
Nick finishes, flopping into a chair
Nick, six months ago you were just another brownnosing honor student
What happened
'm not really sure
fell in love with Sheeni
All  want is to be with her
The rest is all a big misunderstanding
Nick, you've stolen, vandalized, trespassed, and burned down Berkeley
All for one girl
If there's a misunderstanding, it's with your insight into females
But
But where did  go wrong
Nick, boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man boy's whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed
So far,  agree
Sooner or later what those boys realize, is that the girls you're chasing base their self-esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him
Nick furrows his brow
Clearly that had not occurred to him
So  guess what you should ask yourself is: How far are you willing to go
111
Nick nods in understanding
An epiphanic smile
All the way, Joanie
'm willing to go all the way
Joanie nods in amusement
You can stay here a couple days, but eventually they'll come looking for you
don't have much money to give you, but here
Nick takes the wad of cash, clearly moved
Thanks, Joanie
Uh
love you
love you too, you little brat
- Nick slaps the cash on the counter and slides it under the window
One ticket to Ukiah, please
'  -  - Lance squats on the toilet in a neck brace
He chuckles over an issue of Penthouse
The phone rings
He picks it up Yeah
(
) Hey, bacon boy, it's Nick
Nick, ya little prick, where are ya
- Nick is crammed into the phone booth
He's wearing shades and a fedora
You're on a need to know basis, gorilla boy
Lance seethes inwardly
112
No matter, they'll get you eventually
Let me make it easy
'll be at Redwood High School tomorrow morning
Round up your donut dipping friends
'm turning myself in
Nick slams down the phone before Lance can respond
/
() - Nick sits by the window, the suitcase on the seat next to him
- And the bus flies past the sign that says
- Nick steps off the bus and finds Lefty loading his belongings underneath
Lefty
Lefty lifts his eyes and sees his friend
Nick
What are you doing here
Everyone and their mother's mother is looking for you
They have me soon enough
Where are you going
Home
'm done being dead, Nick
Heather and  are going back to Oakland for Christmas
You should have heard how glad my parents were that  didn't kill myself
They were even happier when they found out 'm not gay
That's great, Lefty
Yeah, being in love is pretty great
So what's your plan, Nick
113
Nick answers with only pensive silence
'    - Nick is about to knock on the door when Paul opens it in another display of clairvoyance
Welcome back, Nick
We had a feeling you were coming
'    - Nick sits beside Paul and Lacey on the couch as they watch the infamous "chicken scene" in
(
) Paul and Lacey are kind enough to share some leftover fungi to help calm my nerves
That, combined with yet another viewing of James Dean's performance is what gives me my final burst of inspiration
They all watch transfixed as   leaps from his automobile just in time to escape demise
'    - As the   of  play behind them, Lacey fits a bombshell wig on Nick's head and finishes the last touches of make-up that make him
who we will come to know as
Nick regards his female alter-ego in the mirror
(
) Francois of course wants no part of this, and demands that we make a run for the border
But  have decided to veto him
It's time to face the music
325I - Nick turns the key in the ignition and   rises from the speakers
And the music plays over
- where a crowd begins to form in anticipation of Nick's arrival
Nick watches from behind a tree on the ridge
: 114
- where police cars and news crews are pulling up to interview the students
: - The parking lot is now filled with police cruisers and vans, the news crews,   , and an apparently
, 17, speaks into a
This is Tina Manion reporting live at Redwood High in Ukiah where local law enforcement as well as the  awaits the promised arrival of Nick Twisp
There comes a murmur from the crowd and Tina directs the student camera-man to the road on the ridge where
George's  pulls to a stop overlooking the school
Hey
That's my car
The crowd hushes as the door opens and Nick emerges
' of the parking lot below, which looks like the kind of turn out one would expect of a Star Wars prequel
staring up in silence
Estelle, Wally, Vijay, Trent, Dwayne, George, Lacey, Paul
Nick gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity
The parking lot erupts with  of his name
few Berkeley  hold up a sign that reads ' , ' Then - shouts of warning from the megaphones
And as the flashers and sirens come to life, Nick jumps back into his father's car and peels out
/
325I () - Nick glances in the rear view mirror as the cops bear through the cloud kicked up in his wake
115
Nick pops in a  and turns up the Christmas music to drown out the sirens
- He zips across the covered bridge, the train of law enforcement in hot pursuit
/
325I () - He yanks the wheel hard and veers off onto the mountain road
few of the squad cars miss the turn and skid side-long through a picket fence
Nick takes the switchbacks at 60 per, wheels practically sliding off the turns
- The  crests the hill and smashes through the chain link gate
/
325I () - As Nick watches the quickly approaching cliffs edge, he undoes his seat belt
He goes for the door handle, eyes going wide when he finds power lock has engaged
- The  hurtles off the bluff and soars through the air, tires spinning, a plume of snow blowing off the hood
The car descends into a nose dive and flips completely upside- down, hitting the ice covered surface of Clear Lake with a thundering
Police cars swerve to a stop at the edge of the bluff and the crowd of officers and agents peer over the side at the hole in the ice
The  descends toward us in a storm of air bubbles
As it gently touches down at the bottom of the lake, a somber comes in pre-lap and we are
- Where a crowd of family, friends, and fans stand around in mourning garb over the funeral ceremony
116
(
) My only comfort regarding my untimely death is knowing my friends and family will do just fine without me
We move from Lacey and Paul, the latter of which is wailing away on the trumpet, to Lefty, his head hung low
Heather pulls his head to her breasts
(
) As it would turn out Heather's vaginal canal is slightly misshapen
-  - Lefty humping Heather in the grass ala the scene in which we met him
(
) and thus completely compatible with Lefty's otherwise incongruent penis
little to the right
a little
- where we find Vijay glancing over at Taggarty as she smokes a cigarette
(
) Vijay would eventually manage to pin the car theft on me
But had lost the attention of Taggarty forever
Who by the way
'   -  - (
) never would find her perfect
Taggarty at her wall
Ed Solomon lounges in the bed behind her
(
) And would therefore start grading on a curve
With a quick stroke of her pen, she changes Ed's grade from a minus to a  plus
117
- where we find Joanie sniffling
(
) Joanie of course would get to continue to travel the world
(35,000 ) -  - Joanie serves up a beverage in first class
(
) and she and   her breasts would probably go on   to have the wonderful life   that they deserve
The  she is serving looks from her cleavage to her eyes
She gives a little smile
- where we find Estelle weeping quietly against Wally's shoulder
(
) Wally as it turns out
-  - Estelle watches from the audience as Wally scribbles at his podium while   hosts inaudibly
(
) would go on Jeopardy and win, ensuring my mother's blessed rise to a higher economic status
The answer on Wally's screen says
Alex Trebeck shakes his head, leaving Wally with only $1, but enough to best his two competitors
- where we find George puffing on a cigar, Mrs
Crampton behind him, his hand resting on Dwayne's shoulder
(
) my father, no longer burdened with crippling child support payments, would now be able to afford the model  he always wanted
118
/
M6SMG -  -  - Dwayne sticks his head out the window and shouts with glee as his flab flaps in the wind
(
) and would come to find the surrogate son he always wanted in Dwayne, the only organism alive that could possibly appreciate George's driving
As the car accelerates, we see the vanity plate reads (
) Leaving just one last piece of business
- And finally we arrive on Sheeni, expressionless
And as we continue to  we reach
Carlotta standing in the background
The bombshell haircut and thick glasses can barely be made out through her veil
Paul finishes his trumpet solo and there is a moment of silence to observe the open casket and the , ' shirt and shorts that are being buried inside
- Sheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses
She approaches the distant Carlotta
Excuse me
Are you a friend of Nick's
Carlotta looks up, startled
She composes herself and shakes Sheeni's hand
/ terribly old friend
Carlotta Ulanksy
'm sorry for your loss
You shouldn't be, Carlotta
am no doubt culpable for Nick's actions
/ Well, love does compel us to desperate acts
People cannot always act rationally
() 119
/ (cont'd) The greater the love, the stronger the passions, the more reckless the crimes
Sheeni lets go a slight, wistful smile
Yes, Carlotta
Nick had wonderful a way of making me feel worthy of the pursuit
/ My dear, if there's one thing the demise of Nick Twisp has taught me, it's that self worth comes from within
Sheeni gives a pensive nod
Would you like to stay the night, Carlotta
We can reminisce of our departed
/ Oh, my
kind offer, but  really must
It's just
don't think  could bear to be alone tonight
Carlotta does her best not to look conflicted, but it shows
'  - Carlotta hurriedly finishes tucking herself in while Sheeni brushes in the bathroom
Carlotta hastily switches out the light
Sheeni emerges in a few small scraps of flimsy black lace
/ Goodness
What an attractive negligee
Do you like it
bought it in Santa Rosa last fall
had hoped to wear it for Nick
/ Oh, darling, 'm sure he would have found it most
Appealing
Sheeni crawls into bed
She cuddles close
120
like lying here with you, Carlotta
/ You do
can't think of anyone 'd rather lie here with
Carlotta furrows her brow
Except maybe Nick
If Nick were here, what do you suppose he would do to me
/ Make love to you  would think
Then why don't you
/ Pardon
Take off that silly wig and make love to me
Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room
Sheeni
You knew
Of course, Nick
Did you really expect to fool your soul mate with such a disguise
Nick swoons, grasping her gauze-glazed nakedness
Take me darling
And as they engage in a feverish kiss,   surge
The church chorus' joyful song rings Hallelujah
The two lovers are entwined before an abstract Into the '  nightclub where champagne bottles with the ringing in of a new era, and the Leopards , and the stage erupts with fireworks
121
'  - Nick sleeps with a grin on his face
He rouses at the touch of Sheeni's lips on his cheek
My parents are at services
They won't be back for hours
Shall we have breakfast, my love
What a lovely notion, darling
You go ahead downstairs and get things started
Sheeni hauls herself out of bed and grabs the phone off the cradle
What are you doing
Calling Taggarty to report that you are not completely incompetent in the bedroom
Do  get to stay and hear my grade
Not a chance, Mr
Twisp
Such things are reserved for girl talk only
And for good reason
She smiles at him and he smiles back
Very well, Sheeni
Don't be long
'   - Nick prances into the living room in his underwear
He starts to head into the kitchen when he catches sight of the full length mirror out of the corner of his eye
He stops in front of the mirror and flexes his biceps
Admires himself
Francois appears in the mirror behind Nick, Thompson slung over his shoulder
Well, good morning, Francois
What do you think
122
What do  sink
sink now's are chance to run for ze hills
Nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow
What do you mean
Nick, we are young, yes
Is the world not our oyster
Beaucoup des filles
Do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl
do, but
We've come so far
What about Sheeni
Forget Sheeni
Yes, she will always be ze first conquest, but all zis time you saught zis was ze end, ze one and only, when in fact it is only ze beginning
Nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany
In the reflection we can see behind Nick as Albert leaps onto the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens
Nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law enforcement vehicles pull up
Sheeni, the police are here
He ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead
Quick
Maybe  can sneak out the back
(
) don't understand
How do they even know 'm alive
(
) Well,  called them of course
Nick spins to face her
She's standing in the doorway and there's not a hint of wrong-doing in her face
123
Well, thanks a pantsful
But, Nickie, it had to be done
But
but why
can't very well marry a wanted man, honey
Look at it this way, in a few months you'll be a free man and we can be together in Paris
Nick looks to Francois in disbelief
But the Frenchman just rolls his eyes
You might as well break it to her now, Nick
long pensive beat as Nick contemplates telling her he may never see her again
But behind Sheeni's air of control, Nick finally sees the vulnerability he's had in his hands all along
(
) Francois is right of course, but on the other hand, why be cruel
After all, Sheeni had managed to give me hope every step of the way
And if hope is what Sheeni would now need to go on, well then
As always, you are right, my love
Sheeni beams
Francois smacks his forehead with hand
Merd
The Frenchman in the mirror sticks the barrel of the Thompson in his mouth and blows himself    just as
the front door bursts open and the   surround Nick
'   - The agents lead Nick to the caravan of law enforcement parked in the road
124
(
) Arrested
Ha
It may not appear so, but the truth is
've got the world on a string
Sheeni emerges from the home, Albert barking in protest
Nick strains against his cuffs to look over his shoulder at her
Write often, Nickie
will, darling
And don't worry about Albert
He'll be waiting for you too
(
) As Francois would remind me, 'm intelligent, healthy, virile, not violently ugly
On the whole  am splendidly equipped for this great adventure we call the human existence
The  agents shove Nick into the back of their black Saturn
() - Nick watches out the back window as the car pulls away view of Sheeni waving in the road, Albert at her feet
(
) Besides, what jury would convict a teenager who acted out of love
And even if  do get to spend the next few months of my youth getting Dwayned by the inmates of the California Juvenile Correctional System,  did get my thirty two minutes of lovemaking with one of the most outstanding girls of this or any other epoch
Nick turns to face the front while behind him the waving figure gets ever more distant
pensive moment as he actually questions
(
) But was it all worth it
Nick revisits those thirty two minutes in his mind and it brings a smirk to his face
125
(
) You bet your left nut it was
And as Tom Jones' '   kicks in, we
