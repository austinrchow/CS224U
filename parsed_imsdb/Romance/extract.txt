Written by Mike Judge March 2008 : '   - An idyllic American factory
There's a huge, long lawn in front
Reynolds Extract sign in brick with flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance
We see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a company of about 50 - 75 employees
'   - We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line production
It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc
It has a high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big windows overlooking this manufacturing area
We  up to the main office
, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the phone with his friend
(v
o
) You should come by tonight
Half price well drinks while the game's going
You always give me free drinks though
(v
o
) Oh yeah
Well come by anyway
Yeah
Might as well
No action going on at my house, that's for sure
(v
o
) Really
The wife out of town
No
just haven't been laid in a month
2
(v
o
) You guys having problems or something
No
This is pretty much normal these days
As  continue, camera  , back down to the manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down through various stages of assembly line production, then follows several bottles of orange extract moving past , a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties
The camera stops on him
Talking to Hector is , a short, beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and mustache
Step is in his forties
He makes everything he says sound as macho and important as possible
You get this job through Manpower
Yeah
started here with Manpower too
Started out on the line just like you
(-) Only  did better
40 crates a day
Beat
Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about
continues telling his tale in such a way that the only polite reaction would be one of total amazement
(') 'm the best sorter in here
That's why they made me full time with benefits
'll probably be floor manager this year
we see , a stocky indie-rock geek, with too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail, lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of pockets and some kind of gothy -shirt -- a look that ought to be out of style by now
3
Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun
He flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping each box when he's done, generally making the activity look like more of a skill than it actually is
He approaches Step and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets
(hands them each a flier) My band's playing this Friday, come check us out
Hector looks down at the flier
It's xeroxed with fifties clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, "God's Cock"
Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the flier
, where boxes are loaded onto pallets, sits , 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid- wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird -shirt, fanny pack, and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings
She's pear- shaped with short hair
She's bitter and bossy, always shaking her head at everyone
She sits on a stool with a clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her head
She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her forties
You see that
That new guy
He's holding us up
It's not my job to tell them to hold the line either
And then Joel's gonna come yell at us, cuz he's not doing his job
(folds her arms, fed up) 'm just gonna sit here
You're not gonna shut it off
'm not gonna hold the line
If they're not gonna do their job, why should  do mine
Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause the conveyor belt
4
'  - Joel is still on the phone with Dean
If  don't get home before about 8:00, she puts on the sweatpants and once the sweatpants are on, it's over --  get nothing
(notices something down ) Shit
'm gonna have to call you back
Joel hangs up and runs downstairs
: Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line
Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary
What are you doing
What are  doing
(pointing at Hector) What is he doing
/  breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory and Gabriella
Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt
(') All right
Now, what's the problem
They all erupt in more
(') Okay
Okay, everyone settle down
Now Mary
Hector here is new okay
It's gonna take him a couple of days, maybe his English isn't so good
You gotta be patient
That's what  was tryin' to say
And Step, if you wanna be Floor Manager, this is the kind of thing you're going to have to deal with
5
(-) Exactly
Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's get this cleaned up, and get rolling again
We can't afford to fall behind today
Joel walks away
People resume their posts
Mary starts right back up with Gabriella
You see that
We always get the blame
'  - Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production floor, shaking his head
, Joel's second in command, walks in
He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut
He wears a Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants
He walks over to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees
Jesus
They're like a bunch of goddamned children
Tell me about it
Sorry  missed the drama;  was showing boy-genius down there how to back up a forklift
Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as he passes someone
(') That's his whole career, driving that damn forklift
You'd think he'd wanna learn how
Well,  guess he's got that band he's in too
(disgust at the word "") "Band", ugh
() 6
(') 'll bet dollars to donuts he sucks at that too
Then you got ah
(tries to remember her name but can't) Dinkus down there
Who, Mary
No, the other one -- what's-her- face -- she asked me -- or rather "axed" me -- for more personal days
Just like that
told her maybe if she figures out how to fill out the time sheets correctly 'll give her more personal days
(Off Joel's look) Don't worry, she will never fill out her time sheets correctly
Joel looks down at the production floor
Joel's : : Mary and Step bickering
Step walks off
Mary and Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of old hens
(
) Look at 'em
am so sick of baby sitting these assholes
(looks at his watch) better get going
Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about "sweatpants
" '  - Joel drives home, in a hurry, checking his dashboard clock
It's an upscale neighborhood of McMansions in a town like Lincoln Nebraska
He turns a corner, slows down suddenly when he sees something
' : , a middle-aged, overweight, annoying guy is going out to the street to get his mail
(to himself, praying) Please go back inside
Please just turn around
Come on
don't notice me
7
It's too late
Nathan turns, sees Joel's car and waves, then crosses the street to Joel's driveway and waits to talk to him
( ) Shit
Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down
Joel begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan can talk to him
Hi there Joel
Glad  caught ya
Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while, leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car, trapping Joel
How've ya been
left you a message last week
don't know if you got it or not
Yeah, actually Nathan, 'm kind of in a hurry here
Oh yeah
You been busy
Yeah, in fact
(checks his watch) should go right now actually gotta call the office before they leave
Well, real quick while  got ya here -- what're you guys doing November 17th
Ah,  don't ah
(realizes his should fake ) Actually we're going to be out of town that weekend
Oh yeah
Where you going
8
Ah
Oh, wait a minute -- 'm sorry, meant the 7th
Yeah, November 7th
You'll be in town then right
() Ah
Yeah
Great
There's this dinner Leslie and  are going to
It's an annual thing -- we do it every year with the Rotary Club -- it's for charity
It's just a whole lot of fun, and we wanted to invite you and Suzie to be our guests at our table
It's-- 'm sorry,  ah
just don't think that's something we're gonna want to do
Really
Why not
It's a lot of fun
Oh,  don't know
Suzie doesn't really like going to stuff like -- Why not
Well, we wouldn't know anybody there
She get's kind of uncomfortable
Oh no -- It's not like that
She won't be uncomfortable guarantee it
No, it's not like that at all
It's not formal or anything
Trust me
It's just a real loose bunch
9
just don't
tell you what
Why don't we do this -- 'll go ahead and get tickets, since they're gonna sell out fast
You talk to Suzie
See what she says
Like  say, she won't be uncomfortable at all
Maybe 'll have Leslie give her a call -- you know how it is when the wives talk, heh heh-- Joel is about to snap
Um, why don't we talk about this later
(looks at his watch) gotta make this call before they leave
Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan to raise off the window sill
(') ( ) Sorry
just gotta make this call
'  - Joel pulls the car in, steps out and is shocked to see Nathan right there in his garage
Sorry,  almost forgot -- the tickets are forty dollars a plate
know that's a little steep, but the food is fantastic and it's for a good cause
So that'd be eighty dollars total
There's no tax or anything
Ah, look Nathan,  really gotta get inside and make this call
Let's talk about this another time
Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door, waiting for Nathan to get out
Nathan stops, just inside
10
Oh, and if you need us to look out for the house or anything when you go out of town -- Joel's finger still on the garage door button
Well, just let us know
Where you guys going anyway
() Ah, just sort of a vacation
Look, gotta run
Joel hits the button and the door starts going down
Alright then
We'll see ya
Nathan finally steps out of the garage
Joel breaths a huge sigh of relief
Then, : As it gets halfway down, we see Nathan's legs, heading back towards the door
Nathan leans down into frame as the door goes down
Oh, Joel one more thing-- Joel lets the door shut on him, and bolts into the house
'  - Joel walks into the living room just as his wife, , enters from the bedroom pulling on her
look of disappointment on Joel's face
Suzie is a decent looking woman, about Joel's age
Man, that Nathan won't shut up
Yeah, what an asshole
don't even go into the front yard anymore
That wife of his is even worse
11
Suzie plops down on the couch looking tired and pissed off
Joel sits down next to her
(') We gotta get a new pool cleaner don't think that asshole checked the chlorine levels again like asked him too
Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder
She doesn't seem to notice as he starts getting fresh
(') and every time he is here, he goes on and on about some problem with the goddamn filter, and  have no idea what he's talking about
Delayed reaction -- she notices Joel is getting frisky
He gets closer, starts kissing her neck
(') () Ah,
Joel
What
'm sorry
It's just
'm a little tired, and,  don't know, it's the middle of the week
It's not the middle of the week
It's Monday
Why can't-- Monday
(Freezes, suddenly ) Oh shit
() What
Idol
Suzie jumps up with newfound energy, runs for the remote and turns on the
Joel just sits there
12
Suzie plops down in a Barcalounger
(') Sorry honey
Maybe this weekend
Joel leaves the room
'  -- [Quick scene of Joel trying to masturbate (off screen of course), but he's too distracted by the sounds of a bad out- of-tune Idol audition blaring through the wall
] -- Establishing shot
sports bar that's part of a Holiday Inn
-- Joel sits at the bar
, the owner of the bar, late forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar on a stool
gotta get a house with a bathroom that's doesn't share a wall with the
Why don't you do that in another bathroom
You've got three of 'em
It would look suspicious
We never use those other bathrooms
Maybe if  had some insulation put in
Insulation
All  know is, you shouldn't move man; you've got a nice house
mean you've got the American dream really -- you own your own company
can't believe you used to bar back for me here, and now you've got all that
But what do  have really
It's a big pain in the ass
() 13
(') 'm always working; can't stop or the whole place will fall apart
And what good does it do me anyway
don't get laid
That stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably gets laid more than do
(trying to help) Yeah, but he probably lives in a crappy apartment
Hell, 'd move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom wasn't right next to the
- , a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of the really nice ones
The price tag says $3,950
She's beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something vulnerable and sweet about her as well
Two , typical music store employees -- long-haired, goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much attention
It's clear that they don't usually have women this hot in their store
They practically stumble over each other trying to help her
#1 Yeah, it's expensive but it's sweet
Are you familiar with the Gibson humbucking pickups
No, sorry
don't play
It's for my Dad actually -- for his fiftieth birthday
My sisters and are all pitching in
#2 Ah, that's nice
Your Dad would love these humbuckings
They really kick ass
An annoyed   has been waiting behind Cindy, trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible
He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side
14
Excuse me
just have a quick question
Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy
#2 () So, what kind of music did he play
Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard room
think he played like, jazz or something
'm not sure
#2 Well this is an excellent jazz guitar
It's what Pat Metheny plays
#1 Is your Dad into Metheny at all
Oh,  don't know who that is
Sorry
#2 He's like, a totally kickass fusion guitarist
Are you into fusion
don't really know much about it
#2 play fusion guitar so
Just curious
Um, do they come in any other colors
#1 You mean different finishes
There's a sunburst finish we might have in stock
15
#2 Yeah, do you wanna see it
'll go get it
#1 Or  could go
Whatever
Are you sure
#1/ #2 Oh totally
/ No prob
/ 'll show you the case it comes with too
The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the back to find the other guitar
Cindy stands there alone for a beat
She looks around
Then casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks out the front door with it
- Cindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off
- The two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish guitar and the other with the hard-shell case
They look around, notice she's gone
They stand there for a beat, disappointed, before they realize what just happened
#1 Oh shit
( ) They run out the front door, but Cindy is long gone
'  - Joel is at his desk
Brian comes in, excited
You're not gonna believe this
Remember the guy from General Mills that called a while back
Talking like he wanted to buy us out
16
thought you said he wasn't serious; he was just sniffing around
Yeah, well he's serious now
He just made an offer --  mean a real offer this time
You're kidding
No
It must be part of some bigger strategic move, because it's over market value  think
Wow
Joel lets it sink in
He walks over to the window, looking down on the production floor
could unload all this
could probably retire
mean, yeah, there's a lot of details to work out, but this could be great
They'll be calling back next week, what should  tell them
Joel looks down, sees Mary sitting with her arms folded, shaking her head
Tell 'em hell yes
- Mary sits with her arms folded, refusing to hold the line
already warned him
This is the last time
'm just gonna sit here
In  , we see: 17
- The first box falls off the end of the assembly line, bottles shatter
- Rory, carrying some boxes slips on the broken bottles of goopey extract, falls and slides into an aisle
-  forklift stops suddenly to avoid hitting Rory, causing a huge stack of pallets to fall off
- Quick shot of Mary shaking her head in slow-motion
- Just as Step rounds a corner to see what's going on, the pallets land on a bunch of pipes and high-pressure valves which burst open sending a piece of shrapnel flying across the room heading straight for - '
The shrapnel heads straight for his genitalia, as we : '   - Step is on a stretcher being loaded into a  helicopter by a couple of  guys
Step moans in pain as Joel tries to comfort him
small crowd of employees watch
Mary in the crowd, shaking her head
knew it
That's what happens when you don't pay attention
-- Joel sits at the bar, on a cell phone
Dean sits behind the bar on a stool
(to the person on the ) Uh-huh
Alright
Let me know if you hear anything else
He hangs up, talks to Dean
(') Well, he's definitely lost one of 'em
They think they might be able to re-attach the other one, but they're not sure
18
(shaking his head) Wow
Yeah
'm not sure how it happened, but we have a great safety record and we comply with all the safety codes so
it was just a freak accident
There'll be an investigation of some kind 'm sure
Well, you have insurance for that kind of thing, right
Oh yeah
Of course
In fact, he'll probably get a huge settlement
Yeah
would think so
mean, it's your balls
Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it
Boy it really makes you stop and think about how fragile we are -- especially our balls
They're just hanging there in a little sack between our legs
At any moment they could be cut off forever
Yeah
And your balls are really important man
Your balls are everything
What kind of life would you have with no testicles
Can you imagine that shit
Yeah
Beat
(') You know Dean, my life wouldn't be much different than it is now actually
() 19
(') Except for once every three months when  have sex with my wife
In fact,  might even be better off
Wait
Three months
thought you said it was once a month
did
must've been lying don't know
Maybe things'll get better when  sell the company
'll be around more
Well,  hope so
That would suck
get laid all the time
(off Joel's reaction) Sorry
Ah, it's all right
() Actually, it sucks
Yeah, sexual frustration is bad news
You know what you oughtta do
What
Get some Xanax
Xanax
Isn't that for anxiety
Yeah it is, but  find it's good for just about any phsychological problem
mean, basically it just makes you feel good, so it sort of works for anything
even take it when  have a cold
It's probably great for sexual frustration
Want me to get you some
No
20
You know what else is good
Codeine cough syrup
For what
It's just good
Joel looks at Dean for a beat
(') Are you on something now
No
Well,  guess  took some Vicodin this morning
But that was just 'cause  was hung-over
- Establishing shot, a pawn shop in a strip mall
Cindy's car parked out in front
- Cindy is at the counter, the Gibson guitar we saw earlier is in front of her
is counting out money
He pauses, looks around, then speaks sympathetically to her
Um, you know, 'm really not supposed to say this
but since this belonged to your father, and since he passed away and all
() You could probably get a better deal at a music store
Oh, that's okay
Thanks
But just kind of wanna get it over with, you know
It's kind of hard for me
understand
He looks around to see if his boss is watching, then counts off a   , feeling sorry for her
21
(cont'd) Here
'  - Cindy puts the money in her wallet, along with a driver's license
Cindy shuffles through three or four different driver's licenses
On one, her name says
It's a Kansas license
She takes another one out from Colorado, with the name   on it and puts that in front, then puts the wallet away
newspaper sits on the front seat
Something grabs her attention
: We see an article about Step's accident
There's a picture of Step being taken away on the stretcher
Cindy starts reading the article, with growing interest
' : She scans the article, zeroing in on certain words, "
potentially big settlement
" "
no testicles
" "several million dollars" then back to "no testicles" then quickly back and forth several times -- "million dollars" "no testicles" "million dollars" "no testicles" '  -  look of determination
She looks one more time at the name under the picture -- Don "Step" Wilkenson, then zeroes in on the words "Reynold's Extract
" She starts the car and speeds away
'   -   - Joel sits with Brian
Brian has a clipboard, going over the day's business
So obviously Step's not coming back anytime soon
had to hire a couple temps
Is that okay
Yeah, sure
How is Step
22
Better
They say he's going home in a couple of days
Speaking of which, the guys at General Mills heard about this whole Step thing
They're worried
If Step decides to sue us -- beyond the insurance settlement -- it could be a serious liability
They don't want to make an offer until this thing has settled
Really
They think it's that big of a liability
Well yeah
Don't you
mean, think about it
Imagine if you asked a bunch of jurors how much you'd have to pay 'em to cut their balls off
mean,  wouldn't let someone cut my balls off for a billion dollars
Seriously -- unless there were some kind of really expensive operation that could give you artificial balls or something
Would you
No,  guess not
Anyway,  wouldn't worry
He says he's not going to sue us
Says he ( ) "don't want somethin' fer nothin "' and "What's right is right
" If we can just get him to sign something to that effect we should be fine
Boy, Step sure is being mellow about all this
Yeah, well  think when you lose your balls it mellows you out
You don't get as pissed off and aggressive about things
know it's true for horses, and bulls
23
Boy, it sure does make you think
Oh, by the way, guess who asked for a raise today
Who
( to someone downstairs) Dinkus
Can you believe that
Brian, you call everyone here "Dinkus
"  don't know who you're talking about
You know, Forklift-Dinkus
Oh
thought you call him "boy- genius
" Yeah, well boy-genius asked for a raise
said, "are you kidding
You nearly got someone killed last week," and then he blamed it on Dinkus over there
You know Brian, you really ought to learn the employees' names
Well,  was thinking about that, but hey, if this deal goes through next week,  won't have to
It's not like 'm gonna be inviting Dinkus and Boy-Genius over for dinner
'  - Joel stands on one side of his office looking down through a long window overlooking the manufacturing area
Dean comes in, walks over to the window, looks down at the production floor with Joel
24
Hey man
What's goin' o-- Whoa
' : It's , now working down on the floor, on the assembley line
(') Damn
Who's she
Is she new
Yeah
She's a temp
She's a tramp
No a temp
Quit staring
Damn, she's hot
Way to go
Hey,  didn't hire her
She came here through Manpower, like everybody else
They just sent her over
Manpower, huh
Maybe  should give them a call
You don't usually have girls anywhere near that hot working here
What's the deal
Yeah,  know
guess it makes sense though if you think about it
Hot girls need a job just as much as anyone else
(thinks for a second) Do they really
Huh
You just don't see 'em here
Usually your temps look like winos
And they're guys
You wanna hear something really weird
What
25
She came on to me
No way
Really
Yeah
mean, 'm pretty sure could be wrong, but
Hey, 'm sure she did
Are you kidding
You could have any girl down there
don't know about that
'm serious
Dude, you're the big shot here
You're the king of
What do you call that shit you make here again
Extract
And spray-dried flavoring, and we're branching out -- Yeah, you're the Extract King man
You could have any girl here mean,  wouldn't want most of 'em, but her
Way to go Joel
Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in
(') So how did she come on to you
Well, first she started asking me about what happened to Step and all that stuff -- you know, just sort of making conversation
Yeah
But it really seemed like she was flirting with me, you know
() 26
(') Then, she just sort of asked me out
think
Really
How
Well, you see that guy down there by the fork lift
Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc
(') His band is playing somewhere, at some party this weekend, and she asked me if  wanted to go with her
Wow
So, you gonna do anything about it
What
No
No way
couldn't live with myself if  cheated on Suzie
It'd be nice if  got laid at home once in a while though
(still staring at her) Man, she is fine
You mind if hit that then
Beat
Yeah,  do sort of
We see a  down on the floor
Mary runs out of the Women's locker room
'  /   - Mary runs over to where Hector is working, hysterical
My purse is stolen
It's gone
(pointing at Hector) He did it
He stole my purse
27
Brian runs over and stands between them, trying to calm Mary down, but she keeps ranting
Hector looks confused and worried
Now hold on-- won't hold on
'll call the cops
(confused, frightened) What
don'
No comprende
( ) Espera un momento Hector
Tu sabes donde esta su
uh, purse
, watching the whole thing-- completely unfazed
Joel rushes in
Now wait a second
Calm down Mary
How do you know it was stolen
It's gone
That's how
Well, what did it look like
It was black with a fur, leopard style border
As Mary describes the purse, we : '  - Cindy sits in her parked car, going through the purse Mary just described
She takes some cash, puts it in her pocket, then finds what she's looking for -- the address book
Cindy turns to the Ws and finds Step Wilkenson
She notes his address
She starts the car and takes off
28
'  - Cindy sits and waits, listening to the radio
It's a very blue-collar neighborhood
She's about three houses away from Step's house, keeping an eye on it
After a beat, Step limps out of the house, walks over to his pickup truck, painfully gets in, and leaves
Cindy starts the car and follows from a distance
- Step wheels his shopping cart into one of the checkout lines
He uses the cart as a crutch to help him walk
Cindy gets in line behind him
She only has one item, a bottle of Reynold's Orange Extract
Step notices her
You can go ahead of me if that's all you have
() Thank you so much
(holds up extract bottle) can't believe 'm buying this stuff --  work at the factory
Really
work there too
Or, ah, used to
Really
You're kidding
just started there
What's your name
go by Step
Yeah, 'm the fastest sorter there
As Cindy and Step get to know each other we : '  - Joel enters the living room
He first sees the sweatpants, then sees Suzie is sound asleep on the couch
He sighs, then turns and leaves
29
-- Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean
Joel is drinking some kind of hard liquor, getting a buzz
'm sick of it Dean
'm sick of being turned down in my own house by my own wife
We're turning into one of those brother-sister couples
Huh
Now that you mention it, you guys kind of look alike too
( ) No we don't
Okay
(takes a drink) Maybe things will be better after sell the company
Or maybe it's just going to mean more time to sit around and contemplate not getting laid
Dean nods sympathetically
What about that girl at work
She still into you
Yeah
she was really coming on to me
She gave me her phone number and everything
Told me to call her if  wanted to go to that party
Can you believe that
And there's nothing  can do about it, but just be sexually frustrated
've got some Xanax if you want it
Like  say, that always works for me
30
No thanks
Well maybe you should call that girl
No,  can't
can't cheat on Suzie
just gotta power through it until 'm so old that  can't get it up anymore
What about if Suzie cheated on you
Hmm
hadn't even thought of that
() wish she would
You wish she would cheat on you
Wouldn't that bother you
Joel thinks about it
No
don't think it would actually
(occuring to him) guess that's weird huh
Yeah, it's a little weird
Sort of
But see, then  could do something about all this sexual frustration, without feeling guilty about it
Do you think she would cheat on you
Nah
You sure
31
( ) Well,  don't know
Hmm
Maybe if she were really tempted she would
Like if some really studly guy came on to her
So you're saying she would probably cheat on you if she was put in temptation's way
Yeah, maybe
You know what you oughtta do
() don't wanna do any drugs Dean
No, no
Check this out -- If you really wish your wife would cheat on you, it's not that hard to make it happen
How
Hire a gigolo to have an affair with your wife
What
'm serious
know a guy
() You know a gigolo
Yeah
How do you know a gigolo
32
This guy Brad
He comes in here all the time
He's a friend of Vic's
You could hire him to have an affair with Suzie
Come on Dean
Why not
You said you wouldn't care if she cheated on you
Then you'd be free to go out with that Cindy chick and get your ya-yas out -- with no guilt
Problem solved
(proud of himself) Man, what a great idea
Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing
You know, maybe  will try some of that Xanax
Dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a little box and pulls out a pill
-- Step's truck is parked out at a lake in the country
He and Cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate, looking at the stars, talking
just believe that what's right is right
That's right Step, and what's right is for you to send a message
message
You need to send a message so that a horrible accident like this never happens to anyone else ever again
That's what's right
And the way you do that is to take them to court
33
You think
Yes Step
That's why  called a lawyer for you -- that guy on all the bus stop benches
Joe Adler
() You did that for me
Mmm hmm
just want you to do what's right Step
They start cuddling, kissing
Cindy pulls away
'm sorry Step, your doctor said you shouldn't get aroused
No he didn't
Maybe it was your lawyer, but he talked to your doctor
And your doctor said it's very important not to get aroused until after the trial
'm sorry
That's okay
You're so good to me Cindy
They start cuddling again
Look Step, you're getting me turned on, 'm getting you turned on better just go
-- Joel is starting to look really tweaked as the drug-alcohol combination begins to kick in
Dean is examining a pill under the cash register light, trying to read the small print
He looks concerned
34
Shit
Do you remember what color that pill  gave you was
Huh
Damn
don't think it was Xanax
think that might've been Ritalin
Or "Special
" (feeling the buzz) Ah, who cares
It's just that, ah, Special  is a horse tranquilizer, kinda has a weird effect when people take it but
well, don't worry about it
You might not want to drink too much more though
(beginning to slur his ) You know that thing you were talking about
About the gigolo
Yeah
Do you think it would be wrong to do that
mean morally wrong
(with full authority) Oh nooo
Definitely not
What could be morally wrong about it
don't know
Look, if she doesn't want to go for it, she doesn't have to
And if she does, then she's the one who sinned, and then it's perfectly morally right for you to go out and boff whoever you want
35
( ) Yeah,  guess you're right can't think of anything morally wrong about it either
Beat
And this guy, he's a friend of yours
What's his name
Brad
You want me to give him a call
don't know
It's kinda weird even talking about it
Look, this is no big deal Joel
'm serious
Really
Yeah
mean, you can't lose
Just say you're hiring him to come clean the pool or something
See what happens
If she doesn't go for it, then at least you know you're doing the right thing by being faithful
Yeah,  guess you're right don't know
It's crazy
Dean pours Joel another drink
Look
Have another drink
Think about it
You know what
Why don't  just call Brad and see what he has to say
Alright
What the hell
Joel takes a big swig of liquor
36
-   -- Dean and Joel are talking with , the gigolo
He's young, blonde, super good-looking, but clearly a complete airhead
Joel looks really messed up now
So it's two-hundred dollars then
Yeah, two-hundred
Well yeah, but don't forget, 'm getting ten percent
What, so you're a pimp now
( ) don't think they're called "pimps" when it's with male prostitutes, okay
There's some other word for it -- it's not a "john," but it's something like that
Besides, 'm the one who hooked all this up
And don't worry 'cuz it's coming out of Brad's money anyway
Alright, alright
( ) So it's two-hundred dollars then
Two-hundred and twenty
Wait a minute-- Um,  have a question
Yeah
Brad looks at Joel, deeply concerned
37
So like, are you gonna, like, watch or something
No no no
God no
It's not like that
won't even be there
'll be at work
Remember
We already talked about this
Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it
What you'll do, is come to my house pretending to be the new pool cleaner
Then you simply try to seduce my wife
Okay
If she doesn't respond, you simply clean the pool and leave
That's all
It's that simple
Hold on Brad for a long beat
So, uh, you're not gonna touch my ass or anything
Try to pay attention okay will not be there
will be at work
You come over to my house while 'm not there, posing as the new pool cleaner and then try to seduce her
Brad finally makes a breakthrough
Oooh,  see
Sorry man
Yeah, yeah
get it now
You're not even gonna be there
Yeah, that's right
Yeah
cool
No problem
This is gonna be great
Remember, she might not go for it-- Brad starts to get a little too excited
38
Yeah, this is gonna be cool
can hardly wait
Awesome
Hey man, if you know anyone else who needs -- you know -- what  do, like you know, lonely housewives and shit, maybe you could tell 'em about me, you know
Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to stop talking
Cuz like,  figure if  did a few jobs and  was, like, really good
Then maybe they'd tell their friends, you know, and they'd give me a
what do you call those things
Referrals
Yeah yeah, those things
Then those women could tell more women and then it'd be like  was, like, uh
branching or
Networking
Yeah, networking
Totally
Then if  got enough of 'em, maybe could quit my landscaping job and do this full time
That would be awesome
Cause  hate landscaping
like getting laid a lot better, and my boss is a total dick
'   -- Joel and Dean are at Dean's car, trying to say goodbye to Brad, who still won't shut up
Like  say, if your wife has any housewife friends who might-- Dean finally puts his foot down
39
Okay, you've said that a few times now Brad
Go on to your car
Okay
Alright
Cool
Like  say-- Goodnight Brad
Okay
See you later
Brad finally leaves
Let me drive you home
You're in no condition to drive
Joel stumbles into Dean's car
Are you sure about this guy Dean
He acts like he's never done this before
Oh no
He does it all the time
Don't worry
He just gets a little excited sometimes
He's cool
don't know
He sure doesn't seem too bright
Yeah well, what do you excpect
He's a whore
: -    - break room with a kitchen
Joel is badly hungover
He looks like he's about to throw up as he reaches into the cupboard above the sink, downs a couple of aspirin, then drops some alka-seltzer in to a glass of water
Cindy comes in
40
Looks like you had one of those nights
() Where was
Joel nods, tries to grin and look cool as he takes a sip of his alkaseltzer
Then his eyes go wide, he almost does a spit-take as something suddenly dawns on him
Oh shit
He runs out of the room
: ' Joel grabs the phone and dials frantically
Dean answers
Dean
(
0
) ( ) Oh, hey Joel
Thank God you're home
Ah,
did that really happen last night mean, did we go through with it -- with that gigolo stuff
Ah, yeah
As far as  know
Shit
What was  thinking
We gotta call it off
Right now
Can you call that guy, Brad
Okay
Tell him 'll pay him anyway, whatever, just don't come over
God, what was  thinking
41
Sure, 'll call him
No problem
Oh wait a second
don't think have his number
What
thought you called him last night
Yeah, but  got his number from Vic
Well get it from him again
Vic doesn't have a phone right now
Shit
'll try information
What's Brad's last name
Pause
Hmm
it's something like, think it's a Mexican name
( ) Mexican
The guy's got blonde hair and blue eyes
Yeah,  thought it was weird too -- a guy like that with a Mexican last name
It's like Lopez, or Sanchez or something
Joel looks at his watch
It's 11:15
Shit
Joel hangs up the phone, and rushes out the door
'  -- Brian walks in
42
() Joel, we gotta talk
Not now Brian
Ah yeah, it's kind of important -- kind of really important
It's - Joel rushes past him
Not now
We  Joel as he rushes past his
Excuse me Joel
There's a Brad Chavez on line one for you
can't, -- Joel stops suddenly
Who
Brad Chavez
He said he's done with the job you guys talked about at your house
Do you want me to take a message
Joel looks pale
Um, no
He's the ah, pool cleaner
better take that
Joel goes back in his office
on Brian, confused
'  - Joel stares at the phone for a beat then picks it up
Hello
43
(
0
) Hey, is this Joel
Yes
(
0
) Hey, it's Brad
Mission accomplished dude
What do you mean
(
0
) mean it worked
She totally went for it
What
What're you
(looks at his watch) You weren't even supposed to be there for another 45 minutes
(
0
) Oh really
forgot what time you guys said, and  was so excited about it,  just went over there
Joel sits down, freaked out
(reality setting in) So you mean she actually ah
you guys
(
0
) Yup
It was easy
() Easy
What do you mean "easy"
(
0
) Oh,  don't mean easy like she was easy -- like she was a slut or anything
just mean it wasn't hard to get her to
Never mind
No
Tell me
Tell me how it happened
( ) wanna hear everything
44
You sure
Yeah
(
0
) Okay
Well, she let me in, so went back like  was cleaning the pool
'  -  -- As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's telling
It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax
We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag
(
0
) don't know anything about pool cleaning, so  was just faking it
She was in her bathing suit
Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs
(
0
) So  struck up a conversation
This is a really nice house
Thanks
Is it your Dad's house
No
It's ours
Wow, you look so young to be living in a house this nice
Oh, thanks
Beat
Do you have any sunscreen forgot mine
45
Brad's dopey narration comes back in
(
0
) thought that was pretty smart of me -- to ask her to borrow sunscreen
See, 'cuz that way, once she gave me some,  could ask her if she wanted some too, and rub some on her back, instead of just coming out and asking her to rub some on her
Pretty smooth huh
We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face- down on the chair
(
0
) Once  was rubbing the sunscreen on her, the rest was easy
We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back
Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel interrupts,
Okay that's enough
Stop
'  - don't need to hear anymore
(
0
) Okay, cool
Hey, like  say, if you know of anyone else, or if you ever need me to do it again-- No
Look,  gotta go
Bye
Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a state of shock
(quietly, to himself) Holy shit
'  - Joel drives home from work
He still looks freaked out
He notices something ahead, and suddenly
46
Dammit
' : Nathan, the guy across the street is in his front yard, puttering around with the mail
( ) No
not today
Joel puts the car in reverse, starts to pull behind a parked car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves and crosses the street
Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his driveway
How's it goin'
Oh, 'm kind of busy actually
Yeah
Well  won't keep you just wanted to let you know,  got those tickets to that dinner we talked about on the 7th
think told you they were forty dollars a piece, but it turns out it's a tad more this year -- fifty-five -- so if  could go ahead and just get a check from you guys
Look, ah, we can't go
Remember
No, this is the 7th
You said you're going out of town on the 17th
Yeah, but remember,  told you we didn't really want to go to this thing
Nathan looks dumbfounded
Joel is about to snap
But  already bought the tickets
know you said something about her feeling uncomfortable, but, like say, she won't feel uncomfortable at all --  guarantee it
() 47 (') It's just a whole lot of fun
You guys'll have a great time
Look,  gotta get going
Alright then
Joel starts to pull away
(') Oh, one more thing -- Joel just keeps driving, almost knocking Nathan over
'  - Joel and Suzie are eating dinner
Suzie has a glow about her, looking better than ever -- relaxed, satisfied, etc
Joel's has a quietly pissed off demeanor
They eat in silence for a beat
So
How's work
It sucks
Really
What's wrong
Nothing
Suzie looks a little puzzled
They keep eating in silence for a beat
don't feel well
'm going to bed
'   - '  - From the window in his office, Joel watches Cindy working down on the production floor
Cindy looks up, they make eye contact for a brief moment
She gives him a flirtacious wave
Joel waves back
Then Rory comes by, starts talking to Cindy
48
'  /  - So you're in a band
Actually, 'm in five bands right now
But Godscock is basically the same four guys as Fighthead, but Fighthead's more of a thrash/skatepunk thing
Godscock is more melodic stuff
Cindy nods politely
Rory thinks she's interested
(') So you comin' Friday
Yeah, definitely
(looks at her watch) Ooh,  gotta go
Dentist appointment
Cool
Cindy leaves
Mary, on the other side of the room, watching them
She talks to Gabriella
See, there he goes again, slowing us down
(: ) Now she's a good sorter
They need to hire more people like her
She's so nice too
Hector walks by
Mary just shakes her head
can't believe he's still working here
You know Silvia can't find her wallet
Thinks it was stolen
And guess who was in the locker room last
Hector
They both look at Hector and shake their heads in disgust
49
You know,  could get a job at Southwest Airlines
My Niece works there
'd get better benefits than we get here too
Mmm hmm
could get a job at Gemco
You think they would put up with this stuff at Gemco
Mmm mmn
They run a tight ship
That's right
'  - Joel's  of Mary and Gabrielle, yacking self-righteously
Joel looks on with disgust
( ) Good riddance
Brian steps in, taps on the door
You got a second
think we might have a big problem here
'm not sure what happened, but all of the sudden Step says he doesn't want to settle anymore
think he might've talked to a lawyer
Joel goes to his desk, sits down
Like  say, General Mills isn't going to make their offer official until this settles
Joel considers this
think Step is just chest-beating
He does this all the time
He gets all wound up, talks big, then he always backs down
And that's with his balls
50
- It's a bleak looking office with rows of cubicles
We past several cubicles where hardass parole officers meet with their parolees -- various gang-bangers, drug dealers, junkies, a hideous transvestite prostitute, etc
As we pan, each officer is giving them nothing -- "this is your last chance," "You expect me to believe that
", etc
We continue past officers giving them nothing, giving them nothing, ending on a cubicle with Cindy, where a   is giving Cindy everything -- almost apologetic
'm sorry to even bring this up, but you're not living with the drug dealer anymore are you
Cindy's parole officer is a sad schlub of a guy, about 50 with bushy grey hair and a mustache, he has a badge and a gun on his belt
Nope
'm staying at Extended Stay until  can find a place
She smiles, flirtatiously waves her key/card
(') See
() really feel like 've turned my life around
Thanks in large part to you
( ) It's okay
'm just glad to see you're doing so well
Ah, one more thing  just need to ask you: We had a little incident up in Templeton a couple weeks back where someone stole an expensive guitar from a music store
Someone who fit your description
You know anything about that
Huh
No
was probably at work that day
51
Look Cindy, you realize you can't screw up anymore right
mean, even something minor, and you could go back to jail for a while this time
'd hate to see that happen
Well yeah, but why would  steal a guitar
've got no musical talent
'm tone deaf
They both laugh
Heh heh, So am
can't carry a tune to save my life
Really
Wow
Cindy acts fascinated by Parole Officer's lack of musical talent
He happily goes on about it, forgetting about the guitar
Yeah,  could barely sing the Star Spangled Banner in school
: '   -   - It's the end of the workday
People walk to their cars
Joel turns a corner and finds Cindy right in front of him
Hey Mr
Reynolds
Oh, hey Cindy
You can just call me Joel
() Okay Joel
So you going to the party tonight
Oh yeah
Right, that's tonight
() () 52
(  -  ) Yeah,  was thinking about it
Are you going
Yeah, definitely
Maybe 'll see you there
Yeah,  think 'll probably go
Do you have the directions
'm not sure
Here, 'll write it down just in Cindy opens her purse
We see at least  , , , etc
She takes out a pen and a piece of pink, girly stationary and starts writing
(') 'll also put my number on here
In case you want to call me some time -- if you want
Joel blushes awkwardly, like a junior high school kid
Um
Okay
Sure
'  - Joel pulls into the driveway and is  as he practically runs over Nathan, flagging him down
Joel  obscenities as he reluctantly stops and rolls down the window
Hi there
Almost missed ya
Hi
can't talk right now-- Hey,  noticed you guys got a new pool cleaner today
How is he
We're thinking of changing services
53
Look Nathan,  gotta
Wait, you mean yesterday, don't you
Huh
The new pool cleaner
You saw him yesterday right
Not today
No
It was today
The new guy
What'd he look like
Blonde haired kid, about this high, good looking
Real good looking
-- You sure it was today
Not yesterday
Yeah
You're absolutely sure
Yeah
know it was today, because came home for lunch
was gone all day yesterday
Anyway, you think  could go ahead and get that check from ya
Like  say, it's 55 dollars a plate, so that'd be 110 total
There's no tax
Nathan leans up to scratch his back
Joel seizes the opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber
'  -  -- Joel is on his cell phone, yelling in hushed tones at Brad
He has the door shut so Suzie won't hear him
What the hell were you doing at my house today
54
(
0
) Oh, umm
nothing
Bullshit
(
0
) Look, don't worry about it bro' won't charge you for this one
Won't charge me for
You had sex with my wife again
(
0
) Well,  figured we already did it once, so what's the big deal mean, she said to stop by if  was in the neighborhood, so
Besides, 'm not gonna charge you-- Not gonna charge
God damn you
Yes you are gonna charge me
'm gonna pay you
You're not having sex with my wife for free
And better not ever catch you anywhere near my house ever again
Joel slams down the phone
Then realizes it's a cell phone, picks it back up and hits the "End" button
'  -   -- Suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants
Joel walks through, mumbles something about going to a party
'  -- Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on
He stays in the car, checking it out
Scanning Joel's , we see the band, Godscock, playing in the backyard, with Rory on bass
They are set up on the patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house
Most of the people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band
The band sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired
The lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even more loud and overly dramatic
Rory acts all intense, in stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music
55
They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look
It's downright pathetic
There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head, playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes
Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling
He watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away
: -- Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer
can't believe my wife slept with that guy
Well
thought you said it wouldn't bother you
guess  didn't really think about it long enough
just wish it hadn't been so easy for him
Yeah, 'm tellin' ya, chicks really go wild for that Brad
(Off Joel's look) Sorry
No, you're right
He may be a stupid, dull-witted moron, but he can get any girl he wants
Me, had to work for it
had to work hard, get a career going, take Suzie out a bunch of times, marry her
But not Brad
He gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that
Oh, and by the way
That little prick was at my house again today
No shit
What was he doing
Take a wild guess
56
Wow
You pay a guy to do a job, then he comes back and does it for free
'm not going to let him do it for free
No way
'm paying him
Really
How much
Oh,  don't know
The same, guess
Why
Hmm
So should  get my twenty dollars from Brad then or
Joel shoots Dean an angry look
(') We can worry about that later
Look at the bright side, now you can call Cindy
don't know
feel weird about it
Besides, she's at the party, she probably won't be home 'til late
You know what you need to do
(rolling his eyes) don't wanna do drugs Dean
Look,  know  joke around a lot, but this time 'm serious
(like a doctor) You should try smoking a little pot
It's just an herb, it heals
Stress can kill you, and-- get paranoid when  smoke pot
57
Not when you just smoke a little
Come on
You ever meet my friend Willie
Great guy
Really great guy
(as if it's a positive) He's the guy  got that horse tranquilizer from
Oh, wonderful
'  -- loads up some kind of giant three-foot tall bong and inhales a massive bong-load
He's a burly ex-football player type who looks like he might have an extra y-chromosome or two
Joel watches Willie, feeling a little uneasy
Dean pontificates
've been reading about it -- they're making technological advances now, coming up with great drugs that can make you happy and won't leave you with a hangover or nothin'
(holding in bong-hit) Right on
Willie finally exhales
The exhale seems to go on way longer than humanly possible, endless amounts of pot-smoke billowing out (accomplished with special )
He finally hands the bong and lighter to Joel
Oh,  don't know
'm kind of a light weight
think that's too much for me-- (still holding out the bong and lighter) Bullshit
Come on Joel
Don't worry, this stuff isn't that strong
(to Willie, re: Joel) () 58
( -) He gets paranoid when he gets too stoned
Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong, partly out of being intimidated by Willie
Ah, what the hell
Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would
Okay, now this is a gravity bong
Have you ever used one before
Umm,  think
no
Okay, pay attention
Put your thumb right here on the carburetor
When  pull the plunger up and say, "let go"  want you to let go and inhale hard
Joel's : Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl
(') Okay exhale
You know, maybe  should just let -- (starting to get scary) Bullshit
Mostly out of fear, Joel exhales
Willie puts the bong up to Joel's face, lights it and starts lifting the plunger
Then pushes it down
(') Let go
Inhale
Joel lets go of the carburator, inhales
(') () 59
Joel inhales with all his might, sucking up massive amounts of thick pot smoke as Willie pushes down the plunger
- : '  -- Willie, Dean and Joel sitting around, completely baked -- especially Joel
(We play most of the scene from Joel's stoned, paranoid
) Dean makes some kind of barely audible mumble -- or did he
What
Long pause
Huh
Joel's : looking from Dean to Willie
Willie sits there with red eyes barely open
Willie turns slowly to Joel
Huh
Oh,  thought somebody said something
Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to Joel's paranoia
He stares at Joel for a long beat
Then, in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face
Joel jumps back, scared shitless
Willie starts laughing his ass off
Haaaah ha
The look on your face
( ) Man you really do get paranoid when you get stoned
(fake, timid laugh) Yeah, heh heh
60
Hey Joel, why don't you call that chick now
What time is it
Time for you to call her and finally get laid man
(handing him the phone) Come on
It's twelve thirty
She might be back by now
Alright
Joel gets the phone number out of his pocket
So what's this chick look like
Oh, she's got brown hair
Pretty hot
Kind of working-class looking
What do you mean by that
Willie stares at Joel for a beat
Joel can't tell if he's offended Willie or not
Umm
Oh you know,
Is she kind of slutty lookin'
Yeah
Beat
Joel's not sure if that was the right answer either
Alright
That's how  like 'em
61
Yeah
( ) Kinda nasty, heh heh
Joel starts dialing the number
(') hope  don't wake her up
() It's busy
Alright
At least you know she's home
Yeah
Try her again
Come on
Joel hits redial
Still busy
Man, what kind of person doesn't have call-waiting
don't have call-waiting
hate call-waiting
Every time  hear that goddamn clicking sound, wanna put my fist through someone's head
Beat
Once again, Joel doesn't know whether to shit or wind his watch
Willie stares at him, then Haaa ha
Man you really do get paranoid when you're stoned
Seriously though,  fuckin' hate call-waiting
( ) Yeah
Willie grabs the phone
Here let me dial
You're too stoned
62
Willie grabs the piece of paper with Cindy's number
He looks at it, starts to dial, then pauses, realizing something
Willie looks up at Joel, with slowly building rage, then hangs up the phone
'll tell you why you're getting a busy signal
This is my number
Huh
But
Beat
Oh
You're joking right
Trying to make me paranoid
Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up
He doesn't
He just continues glaring at Joel
We hear the Everyone looks
enters
Hi
Sorry 'm late,
( ) Joel
What are you doing here
Willie stands up and walks over to Joel's chair
Dean suddenly stands up
Well, it looks like you guys got a lot to talk about here so  think 'm just gonna go ahead and take off
Later guys
Dean bolts
Willie moves in closer on Joel
Joel starts to leave, but Willie blocks him
Kinda slutty
Willie grabs Joel and throws him against the wall
Joel tries to make a break for the door, but Willie hauls off and punches him across the face
The ass-kicking begins as we : 63
'  -- Joel limps into the house, his face bruised black and blue from the ass-kicking
He looks awful
As he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible, he trips on something, waking up Suzie
She turns on a light and sees Joel
Oh my God Joel, are you alright
What happened
'm fine
'm fine
just ah
got my ass kicked
Go back to sleep
What
By who
What happened
It was just
some guy over at Scoreboards
Let me drive you to the hospital
You need to get checked out
No
'll be fine
just want to sleep right now, okay
You sure you're okay
It looks like your nose is broken, and your -- () Don't worry about it
People get their asses kicked all the time
It's no big deal
Go back to sleep
'   - Joel walks past his Secretary
64
Hi Joel
Brian wanted to see you-- () Oh my God, what happened
Joel keeps walking,  something about falling down some stairs, goes into his office and shuts the door
'  -- Joel walks over to the window overlooking the production area
He looks down and sees Cindy working, with her back turned
Shakes his head
Brian  on the door and enters, looking worried
Hi
Did you talk to Step yet
He isn't returning my calls
Shit
We've got problems
He did hire a lawyer -- Joe Adler -- he's that personal injury lawyer you see on all the bus-stop benches
You oughtta see this guy
He's a real piece of shi-- (noticing Joel's face) Oh man, what happened to you
Oh,  fell down some stairs
Damn
Well anyway,  hate to say this, but  think we're screwed
There's no way this Adler guy is gonna settle for anything less then bankrupting us
Says he'll sue us into the stone age
(clutches his head ) Shit
gotta talk to Step
Brian looks at Joel's bruised face
65
Man, everyone's getting hurt
Cindy came in with a black eye today
You hear how she got it
Ah
no
Step did it
Can you believe that
No he--
( ) What
Where did you hear that
That's what she told Mary
But
Step
Does he even know her
Apparently they've been going out
What
know, it's weird
They didn't even meet here
They met at a grocery store or something
Just a total coincidence
Joel looks down at Cindy on the production floor, his mind reeling
Anyway, we're gonna have to hire a couple of new people because ' -- Really
Yep
And if it's okay with you, 'd like to go ahead and fire Hector
Fire Hector
What for
66
You know, Mary's purse
Sylvia's wallet
It's gotta be him
Who else could it be
Joel looks down at Cindy with growing suspicion
No
Don't fire him
Just trust me on this
Give him another week
If anything else is stolen, then you can fire him
() Alright
If you say so
Brian looks Joel over
(') Man, are you okay
Have you seen a doctor
Joel's Secretary  in
(
0
) Joel, Dean is on line one for you
Okay, thanks
( ) better get this
Brian leaves
(') Hello
Hey man
Sorry  bailed on you like that last night
It's just that  don't like to get involved in other people's personal shit, you know what  mean
Uh-huh
didn't even know Willie had a girlfriend
She must be new
Man, Willie looked pissed
() () 67
( ') thought he was gonna take a swing at you there for a second
He did take a swing at me Dean
Several swings
In fact, he beat the living shit out of me
Whoa, really
Yes
Wow
Man, that really goes to show you -- this town is smaller than you think
You really gotta be careful
Joel hangs up and walks out of his office, past his Secretary
'm not feeling well
'm going to go home early
'  -- Joel turns the corner to his house and does a double-take as he sees '  going the opposite direction
Shit
Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop
They both get out of their vehicles
Joel is livid
What the hell were you doing on my street again
Dude, you weren't supposed to be home for another four hours-- Whoa, what happened to your face
(trying to improvise a tough, snappy comeback, but can't quite make it ) () 68
(') The same thing that's gonna happen
Your face is gonna look worse if
If  ever catch you anywhere near my house or my wife again, 'll have you arrested
For what
Suzie let me in
Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point
What the hell is wrong with you anyway
Do you do this with all your clients -- just keep coming back and hanging around
don't know
This is my first one
What
thought you were a professional
Look man,  know she's your wife an' shit, but you might as well know --  think we're in love
In love
( ) Man are you stupid
You are so goddamn dumb
You think she loves you
You're nothing but a piece of ass to her
That's all
don't think so dude
Oh, you don't think so "dude
" Well did you ever think about this: she doesn't even know that  paid you to have sex with her -- did that cross your small mind
Uuh
69
How about  go home right now and tell her
Tell her you did it for the money
How about that loverboy
Brad suddenly looks worried
This really freaks him out
You wouldn't do that
You don't think so
Watch me
(realizing he's serious) No
Dude, please don't
Please
Joel starts back to his car
Look man, we really have a special thing going on
Please don't mess it up
Joel stops
Don't mess it up
You're talking about my wife
My house
Stupid- ass
Joel gets in his car and starts it
(calls out to him) Dude, you can't do this to me
Oh yes  can
Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his driveway
'  - Joel walks in, still pissed off
Suzie is sitting on the couch, a little surprised to see him
Oh hi
You're home early
70
() Hi
Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at the pool
It's filthy
So how was that new pool cleaner
Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but she plays it cool
Um
What do you mean
What do you think  mean
Did he do a good job cleaning the pool
Ah
well-- Did he get all the
leaves
It doesn't really look that clean mean 'm looking at it, and 'd say it's pretty goddamn filthy
Did the guy even clean it at all
It sure doesn't look like it
() Well yeah,  guess he didn't do a very good job
think he did a horrible job don't think we should use him anymore
Okay
Okay
Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face
Are you all right, Joel
You want an aspirin or anything
71
No
'  -  - Quick shot of Joel staring up at the ceiling shaking his head, can't believe all this
'  -- In a   we see Joel's car is parked on the street
He walks up and rings the doorbell
We see Step answer, talk to him and then invite him in
'  -- Step and Joel enter
Step's 300  - sits on a ratty couch watching , drinking a huge plastic bottle of Pepsi
He looks like he's been sitting there for years
The is deafeningly loud
Wow,  don't think you've ever been to my house before
Have you
(talking above the ) Yeah,  don't think so
would've remembered
This is my half brother Phil
Joel starts to motion "don't get up," then realizes that's not happening anyway
Phil nods
Hi
Hey Step, can we talk in another room
Sure, let's go out back
'  -   -- Joel and Step sit at a picnic table
72
You know, my lawyer told me not to talk to you
() You're not here to try to talk me out of suing are you
Oh, no
No, 'm just kind of curious about
ah
So you've been going out with Cindy, huh
Yes sir
She's my girlfriend
We might even get married after all this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets worked out
so some of the guys at work are saying you gave Cindy that black eye
What
That ain't true at all
Yeah,  know it's not
She got it from falling down some stairs
Hmm
Look, you might wanna be careful with Cindy
() What do you mean
Well, 'm not sure how to put this, but
You know, you got a lot of money coming your way with this settlement
You might wanna be -- Oh no
No, she didn't even know about that 'til after we started going out
73
You sure about that
Oh yeah
didn't tell her about it for a while 'cuz  was kind of embarrassed, you know
You don't tell a girl you just met that you lost one of your balls
Especially a girl as hot as Cindy
Yeah
() You know she lives with this guy Willie right
That's her ex
She broke up with him
She's gonna move out
She just needs to get all her stuff outta there
You sure about that
Oh yeah
She's moving in with me
Oh
Hmm
Look,  know Cindy's got some problems, but she means well
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
Well, okay
If you say so
Another thing -- you just might want to watch your back
Some of the guys at work who think you gave Cindy the black eye were talking about paying you a visit -- you know, getting even
Oh
Well 'm not worried about that
(dead-serious, proud) could kick anyone's ass at that whole company
74
'  - Brad and Suzie are by the pool which is filthy
Brad starts coming on to Suzie
She pushes him away
No Brad, we can't
'm sorry, but we have to stop doing this
Why
It's not right
feel horrible
Besides,  think Joel's getting suspicious
And you gotta start cleaning the pool too
But 've never felt this way about anyone before
And 've been with a lot of chicks
( ) Uh-huh
Look Brad, the truth is love my husband
really do
This was all a big mistake
'm sorry
don't know what got into me, but we have to stop this want to make my marriage work again
'm going to tell Joel about the whole thing and just hope he forgives me
And even if he doesn't, at least  won't be carrying around this horrible feeling
just can't stand that he doesn't know
Uh
This doesn't mean we can't still see each other though, right
Ah, yes it does
Why
Because of all the things  just said
() 75 (') () Do you need me to say them again
Can  see you tomorrow
No
() How about next week
No
Look, you gotta go Brad
Joel could be home any second
'll call you tomorrow
(just trying to get rid of ) Okay
Okay, just go and we'll talk later
Brad leans to kiss her, she pushed him away and he finally leaves
( ) God, what a moron
'  - Joel sits deep in his chair, bummed out, staring down at the manufacturing area
Brian walks in
So
you ready
Huh
The meeting with Step's lawyer
Or lawyers  should say
It's today remember
Oh shit
Alright
Joel drags himself out of the chair
76
-   - , is holding court with the various lawyers and paralegals waiting for the meeting to start
As promised, he is awful
He looks like Henry Winkler with an extra chromosome and a lot of steroids
(Maybe cast Gene Simmons with his hair pulled back in a pony tail
) You see, if both his balls had been knocked clean off, he would be a good case, but not a great case: man with no balls is no man at all
He's a freak
He's barely human
He's gross
And a jury will never feel like they can walk in the shoes of a ball-less, neutered, he/she freak
But Step
He's still got one ball - barely
He's still a man
man who's very manhood has been jeopardized, but still a man
And that manhood, that very sense of what you are as a human being is hanging by a thread
Jesus, you can't get more dramatic than that
That brave ball, hanging on for dear life, hanging on for justice, is going to be the hero of this trial
'm tellin' ya this Step guy is the fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball Jackpot
And you all laughed at me when  bought those bus bench ads
But  knew the asses of those poor slobs that sit on those benches and ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle cars are our future
And  -- Joel and Brian walk in
Oh, hello
'm Joe Adler
Everybody starts introducing each other
-    - bunch of employees including Mary, Garielle, and Rory are talking, getting worked up
77
And when they sell the company, Joel and Brian are gonna be the one's who get rich, and-- And we're the ones doing all the work
That's right
It's bullshit man
We should get a piece of it
work my ass off
Gabrielle and  work harder than anybody
should be making what Brian makes
If you add up all the crates  move,  lift 10,000 pounds a day
Minimum
That's right
Here he's gonna make a million dollars, and we're the ones who do everything
went to college
For three years
If we quit, this place couldn't run
They wouldn't be able to sell this place for anything
, a tall skinny 50-something guy with a ridiculously big mustache and a little paunch, chimes in
That's why what we should do is, is we should all go on strike -- demand stock in the company before it sells
If General Mills knew we were on strike, they wouldn't buy this place until the strike was over
That way they'd have to give us stock
Jim points to his head, gives everyone a "how's that" nod
It starts to build steam
That's right man
We should do it
We should strike
78
That's right
could get a job at Gemco like that
At Gemco, all the employees are owners -- even says so on the name tags
Mmm hmm
could get a job at Southwest Airlines
-   - The meeting is already in progress
On Adler's side of the table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals
On Joel's side it's just he, Brian and Joel's secretary
Maybe one lawyer who doesn't say much
Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents
The confrence room, like Joel's office, has a full length window facing the manufacturing area
Ok gentlemen
We've gone through everything and the only way we would even begin to consider a settlement would be to the tune of the number you see on the bottom of page 18
Does everyone have this
Joel and the rest of them find page 18
Joel is stunned by the number
What
(so pissed he can barely get the words out) We don't have this much money
Not even close
Not in cash you don't
Of course not
But if you were to sell off your assets: the property lease, the equipment, the-- What the ff-- Are you shitting me
That would bankrupt us
This is what 've been trying to tell you Joel
79
If you think 'm just going to give up this entire company that  built from the ground up-- Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation
How about what my client gave up
His testicles
How about that
He walks over to the door
In fact, 'll make a deal with you - - we will drop this case right now if you come over here and put your testicles right here (indicates the space between the door and the ) and let me slam this door like this
Adler  the door ridiculously hard
Go ahead
We can settle this right now -- call it even
will drop this case right now if you let me slam your balls in this door, It was an accident
Not according to our investigation
We believe that, in fact, there was gross negligence
-   - The employees, same ones in the breakroom, are milling around, talking, the idea of the strike gaining momentum
Rory points up to the confrence room
heard those guys up there are the guys from General Mills
80
Employees' : Adler pacing around, yelling, Joel yelling back, etc
[They can't hear any of it
] Mmm hmm
See, now they're probably up there negotiating right now -- cuttin' up the pie that we baked
That's what it looks like to me
The employees all nod in agreement
Employees : Adler pointing at his balls, pointing to the door again, about to slam it
One of his lawyers stops him
We gotta act fast
They could be about to close the deal
Yeah, and leave us out in the cold
Yeah, then it's too late
If they've already sold it we can't get a piece of it
We gotta act fast
We need to do one of those walk outs
Well, we better do it now
Okay, who's in
We need a show of force
Come on, it's now or never
We  around the employees as the idea builds momentum, ending on , who looks completely confused by it all
-   - The meeting heats up
81
Okay then, let me go back to my previous offer:  will gladly come down on that price -- 'll come all the way down to zero and drop this case -- if you go over there right now and slam your testicles in that door
Because-- don't wanna slam my testicles in the door
want you to be reasonable
You won't even budge one penny
Come on
Like  say, if you slam your-- 'll slam your balls in the door
'm sorry, did you just threaten me
Brian puts his hand on Joel, motions him to calm down
Look, we need to cool off a minute
We'll be right back
Brian leads Joel out of the room
- don't need this
'm going home
-   - Joel walks down the stairs
The group of employees see him and ready themselves for the big confrontation
Joel notices them all looking at him and stops
Yeah
What
But they are ill-prepared
No one knows who should talk first
It's incredibly awkward
They all look at each other and mutter things like, "go ahead" "you first"
Finally
82
Umm
We were just uh
Well, Rory was talking about how you guys are doing this deal with General Mills and we just think that ah
We were considering the idea of ah
Well, we just think that we should maybe get a piece of it, you know cuz we do all the work
And if we don't
um
Joel's in no mood for this
He goes off on them
You know what
Fine
Fine
You're all in charge -- all of you
(gestures to all the ) As of now
You run the goddamn place
Go ahead
In fact, you can go up there right now and meet with Adler
He may slam your balls in the door, but woohoo
You're the boss
Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there
erupts over who was supposed to do the talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first, etc
" was gonna say something but you interrupted," "You didn't say anything when he was leaving, so  thought you were quitting
would've stood up to him
" As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back to their posts, muttering
'  -  - Joel is sitting at the table, picking at some food, looking miserable
Suzie comes over, gathers up her nerve
Listen Joel, there's something have to tell you
think we need to be honest with each other
Suzie sits down
83
(') 'm not sure how to say this, but -- well, you've been so caught up in you're work lately, and 'm here alone all day and sometimes  just-- You banged the pool cleaner
Wha
Suzie is stunned
That's what you're trying to tell me right
You had sex with Brad
You knew
Yes  knew
hired him
Well  know you hired him, but how did you know about-- don't mean  hired him to clean the pool,  mean  hired him to have sex with you
What
He's a gigolo Suzie
Suzie is stupefied
But
what
Why
Joel is so fed up, he just tells her everything
hired him to have an affair with you so that  could have an affair without feeling guilty
was really drunk and on some kind of horse tranquilizer and-- 84
Brad was getting paid
(disbelief, hurt) So you've been paying Brad this whole time
All fifteen times
Jesus Christ Suzie
Joel sinks into his chair, shaking his head
(') only paid him once -- well, twice
The rest was on the house
Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in
You wanted to have an affair with another woman
Yes
But  didn't
Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all this
Then, decisively, You asshole
Oh, 'm the asshole
Yes
How could you
() How could
How could you
You didn't have to have sex with him
You could've simply said "No thanks
Just clean the pool," but you didn't, did you
No, you took him up on his little offer and had sex with him -- fifteen times
None of this would've happened if you hadn't hired him
85
Okay
'll admit,  made a big mistake
was drunk, on drugs, stressed, sexually frustrated and shouldn't have hired a male prostitute to seduce you
But if you had simply been faithful, none of this would've happened
Suzie just looks at him for a beat
You're sick, you know that
Beat
Joel can't really argue this point
What do you see in Brad anyway
He's borderline retarded
You probably could've been arrested for having sex with a guy that dumb
That's it
'm leaving
Suzie heads for the door
Joel follows after her
No
You're not leaving me
'm leaving you
Fine
Joel opens the door, about to storm out, only to find , standing right there about to ring the doorbell
Oh, hey guys
Glad  caught ya
You guys hardly ever answer the door
Heh heh
They are both so flustered, they can barely talk
Now's not a good time Nathan
Joel turns around, storms off back into the house
Oh, you guys goin' somewhere
86
No
Look, we can't talk right now
Well, you think  could go ahead and get that check from ya then
'm just trying to balance my checkbook here
Now's not a good time
When would be a good time, you think
don't know
See the thing is-- Okay tomorrow
Great, what time
don't know
Just come by tomorrow
can't talk now
Okay great
And if you could just go ahead and have that check, that'd be great
It's a hundred and ten
That's two plates at --- Yeah, Okay
Suzie shuts the door, cutting him off
-- Joel checks into an Extended Stay America hotel
(a chain of hotels that rent by the week
) Quick shot of Joel sitting alone in the room
He drops his suitcase and glumly sits down on the bed, grabs the remote
87
He turns on Spectravision and surfs the Adult titles, decides he's not into it and switches back to regular  only to find American Idol is on
He stares at it for a beat, then flops down on the bed and stares at the ceiling
-- Joel sits at the bar, drowning his sorrows
Dean is over by the cash register, tending to some business
Brad enters, walks over to Joel
Joel looks the other way
Hey man
know you probably want to kick my ass, but-- couldn't kick your ass if wanted to
You're a good 10 years younger than me, and 'm a pussy
So why don't you just leave me alone
just wanted to tell you, 'm not gonna see Suzie anymore
You don't have to worry
Joel keeps drinking his beer, stares straight ahead
The last time  was over there, she broke it off; told me to quit coming over
She said she was gonna tell you everything -- you know, about us
She's really into you dude
guess that's why she married you an' shit
You're a lucky guy
Sorry if  messed shit up
Beat
Joel takes another swig
Why'd you have to get hung up on Suzie
You could have any girl you want
Yeah, but  want Suzie
And can't have her
You had her fifteen times
88
Yeah, but she doesn't love me dude
It's just not the same
Anyway, just wanted to tell you that
Well
You told me
Alright, later
Brad starts to leave
Then he stops, turns around
Oh, one more thing
quit my landscaping job
And  don't think 'm really cut out to be a gigolo
So  was wondering if you had any openings over there at your extract place
( ) Brad, you had sex with my wife
'm not gonna give you a job, okay
Okay
Sorry man
Brad walks away
Joel stares at his beer for a beat, thinking
He calls out to Brad
Hey Brad
Brad stops
Yeah
don't know
Maybe come by the office tomorrow
Fill out an application
'll see what  can do
Cool
Thanks man
89
'  - Brian sits with Joel
They both look pretty miserable
Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head
We're screwed
General Mills has pretty much withdrawn the offer pending a really favorable settlement with Step
(shaking his head) Not only do we not sell the company, we could wind up bankrupt
(muttering to himself) So  don't sell the company, don't get the money, 'm bankrupt, don't get Cindy,  paid a guy to have sex with my wife, and she actually did it
Excuse me
Nothing
'  -  -- Suzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with the long pole with the net at the end
She looks miserable
(
) Hello
Nathan enters through the back gate
() Shit
Nathan walks over to Suzie
She's in no mood for this
She acts as unfriendly as possible
Why are you cleaning the pool yourself
That new guy didn't work out
90
Yeah, didn't work out
Boy, you just can't get good help, eh
Yeah
So, did you get a chance to write that check
Look Nathan, Joel and  aren't going to that dinner okay
Nathan acts deeply disappointed
Well gee,  wish you would've told me that before  went and bought the tickets
Joel never agreed to this Nathan, and neither did
Well, it sure sounded like you guys were going
Leslie was gonna talk to you about it, but you didn't return our calls
mean, already bought these tickets
They're nonrefundable
really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me
It's the last straw
Suzie has had enough
She unleashes all her pent-up aggression on Nathan
Okay, let me be really clear with you then
When we say " don't think so," or even "'m not sure," that means "no
" Why can't you understand that
Well,  just-- 91
Shut up
In fact, let me be even more clear with you
We don't like you
Is that clear enough
You're dull, you never shut up, you never listen, and we don't want anything to do with you ever again
Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock
He starts to shake a little
Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good to stop
Is that clear enough for you Nathan
Is that
Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure
() Nathan
Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses
Suzie
-- Joel pulls into the parking lot
He looks surprised, seeing something on the other side of the lot that gets his attention
( ) No way
From ' , we see Cindy pull up and get out of her car
Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up the stairs
Joel gets out and watches her from a distance
He sees her go into a room and shut the door
He stares up at the door for a beat
Then, with a look of determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her door
'  -- Cindy opens the door, a little startled to see Joel, but pleasant to him
Oh
Joel
ah,
92
Hi
What're you
What's up
How'd you know  was here
Ah, actually, 'm staying here too
Down on the first floor, around the back
thought  saw you so ah
Well, come in
Joel enters, stands in the living room
Cindy heads in to the kitchen
(
) Do you want something to drink think all  have is Diet Coke
Joel notices '  lying on the coffee table
He stares at it
No thanks
Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke
Have a seat
Joel remains standing, looking at the purse
That's Mary's purse
Isn't it
What
Right there
That's Mary's purse
Oh that
No, that's mine
So how are things at work
That's Mary's purse
You stole it, didn't you
93
Cindy acts like he's being silly
There's nothing about her demeanor that would make anybody think she's lying
No
It probably just looks like it
There's a lot of those
've never seen another one
You probably have Sylvia's wallet in here somewhere too, don't you
And everything else that's been stolen from my employees
Joel, are you okay
No, 'm not
That's Mary's purse Goddammit
Okay
Everyone blamed Hector
He almost got fired
Doesn't that bother you
(innocent, sweet) Joel,  don't know what you're-- Hector
Hard working guy, never did anything wrong
And what are you doing with Step
You're trying to screw him out of his settlement money aren't you
have no idea what you're talking about
Yes you do
You're the only reason he's suing us aren't you
You know how much work it took for me to build up that company
You just don't care about anybody do you
What are you, some kind of sociopath
Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her
(') You can't even admit that you stole this purse can you
You just can't do it
() 94
(') In fact, you probably can't tell the truth about much of anything, can you
Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor
bet Cindy's not even your real name is it
Who are you
Where the hell are you from
Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer
(') You can't answer can you
Because if you said one true thing, you'd have to tell the truth about something else and then it would all unravel wouldn't it
Then you'd have to admit that you stole this purse and God knows what else
Beat
Cindy still looking away, down at the floor
We see her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice
( ) Well, 'm leaving now
Joel picks up the purse
And 'm taking this purse with me
If it really is yours, you can call the police and tell 'em  stole it
In fact, 'm gonna call the police and report it
Joel walks towards the door
Then Cindy slumps down on the couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor, her voice cracking slightly
Please don't
Joel stops
What
95
(still looking down) Please don't report it to the police
'm on probation
'll go to jail
For a long time
Well
Maybe you should've thought about that before you started ripping off my employees
Joel starts to open the door
Joel
Please
'll leave Step alone
promise
He'll drop the lawsuit
Joel considers this
How do  know that
You can keep the purse
If  don't leave him alone; if he doesn't drop the lawsuit, then you can report me
Please
Beat
Hmm
guess that ah
Do you have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's watch
Can  get those too
Beat
Cindy nods, still looking down
Joel considers it
Well
Okay then
guess that works
() And  guess you just admitted that you stole the purse
That's good, guess
step in the right direction
Joel sits down on the couch also
With her head still down, Cindy is weeping quietly
Joel doesn't notice, looking straight ahead
96
So what's your deal anyway mean, how did you end up like this
Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying
He's caught off guard
Ah
Cindy
Cindy breaks down and starts bawling
(') Okay, now you see
that's what 'm talking about
You're trying to manipulate me now, and 'm not gonna fall for it
Cindy starts bawling even harder
(') really hope you're not faking this right now, because 'm feeling really bad
Are you faking it
Cindy shakes her head "no
" 'm sorry,  was just curious, you know, how a person ends up like
this
Cindy suddenly starts  hysterically
Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or comfort her in any way
Never mind
'm sorry
Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she leans in to him, crying on his chest
He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even closer
As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in even more
Finally, she lifts her head and they start kissing
As they get hot and heavy we : 97
-- Wide shot of the Hotel
It's a beautiful morning
'  - Joel wakes up, looking more relaxed than we've ever seen him
We   to reveal that he's alone in Cindy's bed
He sits up, yawns
He has a big satisfied smile on his face
Cindy
He looks around, realizes he's alone
Then suddenly looks worried
(') Oh shit
He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he realizes his wallet is still there
He sets down the pants, then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards
Then he looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse, Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side
He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again
'  /  -- Extract bottles moving along the assembly line full steam
Mary and Gabriella gossiping
(looks at her watch) Joel hasn't been in all morning
can you believe that
If we come in late, we get fired
And here we're working our tails off, and he's gonna get rich
Joel walks in, bright-eyed and cheery, greeting people
He walks over to Mary carrying her
Here you go Mary
98
Joel hands her the purse
Mary looks at it, not quite sure how to react, not ever wanting to appear grateful for anything -- not in her nature
(') And by the way, Hector didn't take it
Cindy did
Joel walks off
Mary just shakes her head at him
She whispers to Gabriella
Can you believe that
Blaming Cindy just to protect Hector
'  - Joel is at his desk
Brian comes in
Step's here to see you
Really
Bring him in
No, he's outside
At the loading dock
Wants to talk to you alone back there for some reason
( ) "Man to man
" - Step is pacing around, waiting
Joel comes out
Hi Step
Hey
How you doin'
How's your, ah
(looking down at his ) Oh it's okay
Some days it still hurts, but they've got me on some pills
It's not too bad  guess
99
Well
that's good
They both sit down on the edge of the dock
Look, ah
Cindy left me
Joel's nods, not surprised, but sympathetic
Wow
Bummer
Yeah, it is a bummer
You know, thought the worst part was having my balls knocked off, but you know what the worse part is
Dealin' with all this bullshit
'm sick of that Adler guy tellin' me what to do
He's a real dick
Yeah, he sure is
The truth is,  just want to have my old life back --  just want to go back to work
'm a workin' man; that's what  do
Yeah
'm beginning to think might be the same way
'm a little worried about what 'd do with too much time on my hands
just lay around and watch  all day
Yeah,
think  do a lot worse
The problem is, if  bankrupt the company, there won't be a job to go back to
You don't have to bankrupt the company
100
Yeah, but then if  drop the lawsuit, you'll sell the company, and the new company might not hire me
Well, maybe  don't have to sell the company
You know 've been thinking; all these years 've been building this company, dreaming about the day  could sell it and retire, but what would  really do if  retired
It's like that old saying -- it's not about the destination, it's about the journey
Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him
guess what 'm saying is, too much free time might not be such a good thing -- like that old saying, idle hands are the Devil's playground
Step's never heard that one either
'm sorry,  don't do much book readin'
What 'm saying is, 'm thinking maybe  won't sell the company
Really
that is, if you dropped the lawsuit
-- and remember, you'll still get that insurance money -- probably a couple hundred thousand
What do you think
Hmm
That sounds fair
But under one condition
What's that
101
You make me floor manager
Deal
They shake hands
- Joel walks in with Step at his side
Addresses the employees
Hold the line
Mary shuts off the conveyer belt
Okay, listen up everybody
(Waits for them to settle) 've decided not to sell the company
Gasps and murmurs among the employees
And 'm making Step the new Floor Manager
More gasps and murmurs
And if anyone doesn't like it, hear they're hiring over at Gemco
But just remember, at Gemco, the owner doesn't know your names; you never even meet him, he's at an office up in Chicago somewhere and you get an auto- response if you try to email him to complain about anything
Here, you can come up to my office any time you have a problem
Thanks
Joel walks off
Brian catches up with him
Huh
You're not selling
102
It's about the journey Brian
The journey
on Mary
She and Gabrielle start right back up
You know, if Joel's going to put him in charge, we should go on strike
You know, at Gemco, the union handles the strikes and you don't even have to-- as Step cuts her off
Quit yapping and get back to work or you're fired
Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill
Mary and Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads
as things get back to normal at the factory
- We are   , in a coffin, embalmed
We to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body
Joel is among them
He looks down at Nathan for a moment and then continues to his seat
few rows back, we see , sitting by herself, dressed in black
- Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground as the priest says the last few words
- People hug and console each other
Joel sees Suzie, walks over to her
Hi
You doing okay
Yeah, 'm okay
103
heard you were right there when it happened
That must've been rough
It was horrible Joel
He came over to ask for that check, and just
Suzie breaks down, starts
(') just lost it
started yelling at him
said horrible things
He had an aneurism and probably caused it
( ) think the last thing  said to him was "shut up
" Those were the last words he heard
Joel hugs her, consoling
It's okay, it's not your fault
It's not your fault
Suzie's crying subsides a little
It could happen to any of us Joel
Any of us could have an aneurism
We could die at any moment
Yeah,  know
know
But we probably won't
It'll be alright
Suzie starts to regain her composure
They stand there for a beat
You wanna go get something to eat
or something
Beat
Suzie still sniffling a little
Yeah, okay
Sure
104
They walk off towards the cemetery gates
After a while, Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex
Here
Thanks
They walk a little further
Joel looks at the Chapel nearby
Maybe we should've been married in a Church like that one
Instead of the Botanical Gardens
thought you liked the Botanical Gardens
Yeah, but
a church just seems more --  don't know -- official
You think it would've made a difference
don't know
So, are we still married
Well, legally yes
mean otherwise
Hmmm
We can talk about it suppose
Alright
They walk for a beat
You know, this is really bad, but
Oh never mind
What
105
Well, as  was looking down at Nathan there,  was thinking
That's the longest 've ever seen him with his mouth shut
Suzie  in spite of herself
Joel
