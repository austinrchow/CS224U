The most prominent one is called '
hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame
opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his head
looks over his shoulder
Felt Like this fucking day would never come
Issue two - on the shelf
Yippee
Don't start, alright
This is a cool moment, and 'd appreciate you not trying to ruin it
How often does a guy get the opportunity to purchase something with his name on it
(points to name on cover) Banky Edwards- right
(points to the other) Holden McNeil
know my name
'mon, sour puss
We got the rest of our lives to be artists
But it's supply and demand
And right now, the unwashed masses demand this
(off comic) This is easy, alright
And right now it pays the bills
Just don't forget that we're better than this
'll tell you who we're better than: these two fags right here
They approach the counter, where -, the store manager, and  the Fan-boy, play a card game
(lays books on the counter) Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up
- (not looking up) Well, well,well, Walt Did you see who it is
The local celebrities
Quick - get them to autograph one of their books so we can sell it for triple it's value
'm not that in need of fifteen cents right now
They snicker and high-five one another
Holden rolls his eyes
You guys operate the smallest, ladies' bridge circle 've ever seen
For your information, we're playing Crimson Mystical Mages' - an overpower card game
Not that either of you would give a shit about something as advanced	as this - there are no dick or poopie jokes involved
(to Holden) don't think they're fans
No, we're not
You're both a couple of fucking no talents that got lucky
- And obviously your handlers or hangers- on convinced you that your first comic was good which it was not it was thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky bits of dialogue
And when you get your foot in the door of the business, what do you do
You turn out a piece of shit like Bluntman and Chronic'
Tell him, Steve-Dave
- (off comic) Bluntman and Chronic'
Pah
What was that thing the little stoner pulled on the villain in the last issue
The Stinky-palm
- Stinky-palm
You give comics a bad name  tell all my customers not to buy it, to spend their money on a real comic book
Fucking one hit wonder, dime-store Frank Miller's
- This is the reality at Comic-Toast - you're not going to get your ass kissed here, because both me and Walt think you suck
And me
- said that
Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then goes back to playing his game with Walt
Holden and Banky stare, shocked
Banky nudges Holden and they both exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to playing
've got a dragon card - forty power- ups and twelve life points
Ha get your elf card
- You're such a bitch
But thankfully, 've saved a dark forces Shaman card for just such an occasion
You suck
Eighty six life-power points to my twenty two
- schooled their asses, now 'm schooling your's
Suddenly
trash can crashes through the front window
Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering one another
They look up slowly
Steve-Dave leaps to his feet and looks at the shattered mess
He pulls something off the garbage can and reads it
You know it was those two fucks
Let's call the cops and have them busted
know where their studio is
Or better yet, let's sue
You can sue them, Steve-Dave
- (still reading note) That won't be necessary
What
Why the hell not
- (holds up check) Because this is a check for three times what that window cost
(reading note) Dear critics - thanks for the insight
But like my grandmother always said - Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke
and break their window
' Kiss it,		Banky the Hack
- Your card game blows
He said Kiss it
:    - physically large  - sweaty brow, tote bag bursting with comics - leans forward, smiling
Could you sign it To a really big fan
Holden sits at a table
Across from the barely-managing- to-stand Fan
He offers him a patronizingly kind, half- smile in return, You bet
We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book- signing
Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding McNEIL    - '
Beside it is a large mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner super-heroes who bear a striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly neighborhood drug dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan
love this book man
This shit's awesome
wish  was like these guys - getting stoned, talking all raw about		chicks and fighting supervillains
love these guys
They're like Cheech and Chong' meet Bill and fed'
like to chink of them as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet Vladimir and Estragon'
Yeah
(beat) Who
signs the book of another
So you draw this
(signing the comic) ink it and 'm also the colorist
The guy next to me draws it
But we both came up with the characters, What's that mean - you ink it'
Well
It means that Holden draws the pictures in pencil, and then he gives it to me to go over in ink So you just trace
Banky freezes up
He composes himself and continues signing
It's not tracing
add depth and shading to give the image mere definition
Only then does the drawing really take shape
You go over what he draws with a pen - that's tracing
(hands book back to Collector) Not really
(calling out) Next
steps up but the Collector lingers
Hey man
If somebody draws something and then you draw the same thing right on top of it, not going out-side the designated original art what do call that
(shrugs) don't know
Tracing
(to Banky) See
It's not tracing
Oh, but it is
(to Little Kid) Do you want Lour book signed or what
Hey - don't get all testy with him just because you have a problem with your station in life
'm secure with what  do
Then say it - you're a tracer
(grabbing Little Kid's book) How should  sign this
(grabs book back) don't want you to sign it,  want the guy that draws Bluntman and Chronic to sign it
You're just a tracer
Tell him, Little Shaver
Holden accepts a comic from another Fan
(off comic) Who do  sign it to
Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard
He looks to his left and freaks
Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table
The Collector attempts to fight him off pull them apart
Holden grabs Banky
Jesus
All  did was call him a tracer
(to Collector) ' ,
(to Security Guard) Could you get him out of here
The Security Guards drag the collector away
Hey, wait a sec
He jumped me
And you're dragging me away
(exiting) Fucking tracer
(calling ) '
Can  explain the audience principle to you
If you insult and accost them, then we have no audience
He started it
Fucking cock-knocker
He's lucky  didn't put my pen through his thorax
Need  remind you
(holds up watch) Curtain's in ten minutes
- fills the frame
He comes off like a typical, pro- black/anti-white homeboy
For years in this industry whenever an African-American character - hero or villain - was introduced usually by white artists and writers - they got slapped with racist names that singled them out as negroes: Black Panther, Black Lightning, Black Goliath, Black Mantra, Black Talon, Black Spider, Black Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat
She's white
She is
(beat) Well bust this - regardless
We're at a panel discussion
The room is full
Five creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in front of them
(One of them is a very striking Girl
)  The banner behind them reads   -    '
(holds up comic) Now my book, White-Hating Coon', doesn't have any of that bullshit
The hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a descendant of the black tribe that established the first society on the planet, while all you European mother fuckers were still hiding in caves and shit, all terrified of the sun
He's a strong role model that a young black reader can look up to, Cause 'm here to tell you - the chickens are comin' home to roost, ya'll: the black man's no longer gonna play the minstrel in the medium of comics and Sci- Fi/Fantasy
We're keeping it real, and we're gonna get respect - by any means necessary
During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up front
(calling out) Bullshit
Lando Calrissian was a black man, and he got to fly the Millennium Falcon
Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of the comment Who said that
(standing) did
Lando Calrissian is a positive black role model in the realm of Science Fiction/Fantasy
Fuck Lando Calrissian
Uncle Tom nigger
Always some white boy gotta invoke the holy trilogy'
Bust this - those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down - even in a galaxy far, far away
Check this shit
You got cracker farm-boy Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy - blond hair, blue eyes
And then you've got		Darth Vader: the blackest brother in the galaxy
Nubian God
What's a Nubian
Shut the fuck up
Now Vader, he's a spiritual brother, with the force and all that shit
Then this cracker Skywalker gets his hands on a light- saber, and the boy decides he's gonna run the fucking universe - gets a whole Klan of whites together, and they're gonna bust up Vader's hood the Death Star
Now what the fuck do you call that
Intergalactic Civil War
Gentrification
They're gonna drive our the black element, to make the galaxy quote, unquote safe' for white folks
But Vader turns, out to be Luke's father
And in Jedi, they become friends
Don't make me bust a cap in your ass, yo
Jedi's the most insulting installment, because Vader's beautiful,		black visage is sullied when he pulls off his mask to reveal a feeble, crusty white man
They're trying to tell us that deep inside, we all want to be white
Well isn't that true
Hooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his belt, draws on Banky and fires
Banky goes down, falling forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to scatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air
' '
The crowd-is gone
Holden sits in his chair, laughing
Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off the floor
(breaking character) What's a Nubian
'  Bitch, you almost made me laugh
Hooper sounds different Actually, he sounds gay
Actually - he is
Banky smiles
Well what about you
You didn't tell me you were going to scream Black Rage'
nearly pissed myself
How do you manage to get away with this all the time
Shouldn't cops be busting your head open right about now
Wrong coast
(off gun) Well this right here - she full of blanks, okay
And Opiate gets all sorts of legal clearances before  go on
Your publisher condones these theatrics
Condones
Honey, they insist
need to sell the image to sell the book Would the audience still buy the Black Rage' angle if they found out the book was written by a
a
Faggot
When you say if it sounds so sexy
(he kisses Banky full on the lips) (wipes his lips) Hey, hey
'll play your victim, but not your catcher
How is it that you sound like Minister Farakhan when you're on stage
They turn to see
beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her purse in a circle
Her name is
She's the striking Girl from the panel who didn't get to say much
and the King of Pop when you're nor
Look out, boys - this kitten has a whip
(shoves and slaps him) Always before  get to speak
swear - the next con  attend and they ask me to be on the minority panel, if see your name anywhere near the List, 'm passing
(defending himself) Holden
Banky - this pile of
is Alyssa Jones
She does that book Idiosyncratic Routine'
This is the fourth panel we've been on together, and even though she knows my publisher sets this up and pays for the event
She still gets mad when it ends with my act
just wish  was the one who gets to shoot you
That's what my father said when  came - nay - leapt out of the closet (off guys) These boys do Bluntman and Chronic', which outsells both of our books put together, hence they're never on a panel with the likes of us
They slumming right now
've read your book
It's cute
Chick stuff, but cute
Holden hits him
What
(shoots him a look; to Alyssa) Sorry about him
He's dealing with being an inker
(to Banky) Oh
You trace
Banky seethes
(shaking her hand) really enjoy your book 'm surprised we've never met at any other Con's before
Lose the dick or change your skin tone and we can get to know each other on panel after panel while the Pink Black Panther here plays Chuck
for the fanboys
Hey, jealousy
(to the Boys) told Alyssa 'd buy her a post-rave drink
Do the Garden-Staters have to sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel, or can you stay for a round in the big, scary city
We're gonna take off soon
We'll go
Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance
Then he nods to Hooper
We'll go
- Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table drinking, talking, and smoking
Archie, alright
Archie and the Riverdale gang were a pure and fun- lovin' bunch
You can't find dysfunction in those comics, because they were just flat out wholesome
Archie and Jughead were lovers
(sips his drink) Shut the fuck up
It's true
Archie was the bitch and Jughead was the butch - that's why Jughead wears that crown-looking hat all the time: he the king, of queen Archie's world
Man,  feel a hate-crime coming on He's got a point
Archie never did settle on Betty or Veronica
Because he wanted them both at the same time, you assholes
He never chose one because he was trying to get both of them into a three-way
(pulls out a dollar and hands it to Banky) Here
want you to go down to the corner store and buy yourself a clue
Go on
Eat it
Urkel
told you to watch it with that Urkel shit
Face it, girl - Archie's a sister
(getting up; to Hooper) That's it
You
Moi
You are marching back across the street with me, and we're going to pick up a shit load of Archie books, am going to prove to you - beyond the shadow of a doubt that Archie was all about pussy
Come on
(sliding out of booth) This boy is conflicted,  shall play mother-therapist for him
You two sit tight
We shall return promptly
Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at the table
Is he always Like that
For years now
Started back in third grade - a nun was teaching us about the Blessed Trinity
She's going on about the three persons in one God thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and he just goes ballistic
guess it was too big for him to grasp
They got into this huge fight
Please
How bad could it have been
You ever seen a nun call a small child a fucking cunt-rag'
Wasn't pretty, Shit like that's bound to happen when you make a kid wear a matching tie and slacks everyday
And your parochial school misadventures
Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass
Turned me into a grade school alcoholic altar boy
couldn't tell you how many mornings after serous benders		'd wake up next to strange priests
Aren't you the sharp wit
Sharp
No
'm just a fan of clergy- molestation humor
Probably why the extended family quit inviting me to First Communion parties
Alyssa laughs
Holden smiles
(looking ) You play darts
Not professionally
You know - only in bars
dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the board
Alyssa winds up with another dart
Holden watches
Her's always hit
His never do
So your new book seems to be selling like mad
It goes back to something my grandmother told me when  was a kid
"Holden," she said "The big bucks are in dick and fart jokes
"  She was a church-goer
Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a real artist trapped in commercial hell - pitying his good fortune
'm sure you can dry your eyes on all those fat checks you rake in
'm sorry - did  detect a note of bitter envy in there
Nope
'm happy my stuff gets read at all
There's very little market for hearts and flowers in this spandex- clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns field
If  sell two issues,  feel like John Grisham
(looking out window) It's all about marketing
Over- or underweight guys who don't get laid - they're our bread and butter
People like those two outside should be yours
Through the window, we see a  making out on the hood of a car
And sadly, there are more of our core audience out there than yours
(smiles) Look at that, though - kind of gives you a little charge, to see two people in love
And all over Banky's car, no less
That car's seeing more action right now than it's seen in years
Bubbly guy like that, it's hard to figure out why
(still looking at  Couple) You've gotta respect that kind of display of affection
It's crazy, rude, self-absorbed - but it's love
That's not love
Says you
That out there
That's fleeting
Fleeting
Uh-huh
You wanna hear about love
Oh, 'll tell you about love
story
The story
The original love story
'Doctor Zhivago'
Nope
My mother's uncle
He was a millionaire
Get out
kid you not
Explain
All through high school, he dated this one girl
They  were inseparable
And when they graduated, she went off to Carnegie Mellon
In Pittsburgh
'm impressed
So he stays in the home town, and they begin their long- distance relationship
The plan is, on the  third Sunday of every month, he'll train out, spend a week then train back They do this for four years
That is love
Not nearly finished
Two months before she's going to graduate, he's got this job digging graves, and he comes across
stiff
steamer trunk containing silver ingots
Get out of here
Many, many silver ingots
Now, my mother's uncle being quite the ingenious chap - he buries the trunk again and heads up to the main office, where he proceeds to purchase a cemetery plot
Guess which one
Clever
So now he owns the plot and all of its contents
Two  days later, my mother's uncle is worth three million
At which time he marries the high school sweetheart and lives happily ever after
Not even close
Inside the steamer trunk, stenciled into the wood, or something like that, is a curse
Someone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new steamer trunk
Not that kind of curse
cryptic curse "Great fortune means great loss" it said
What kind of asshole writes that inside a steamer trunk
The same kind of asshole that buries silver ingots
The day my mother's uncle is heading out to see the girl, he stops at his accountant's to grab some cash, and winds up missing his train
So he has to take the next one - which he does - and he gets there an hour later than his usual time of arrival, whereupon he sees lights
hero's welcome for the new millionaire
It seems that while she was standing on the platform waiting that extra hour for my mother's uncle to show up, the girl was dragged into the bushes by an unknown assailant, raped and gutted
Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink
The assailant was never apprehended
(beat) That's a love story
Yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle rode that train every day for the rest of his life
One day up, the next day back
Did that 'till the day he died
He donated the fortune he'd acquired to the train station in Pittsburgh, to have a well-lit terminal built
The train line let him ride for free after that
should hope so
Jesus, that's the saddest tale 've ever heard
That's my love story
Alyssa tosses her last dart
Holden seems a bit dazed
He looks out the window
Those two aren't on the hood of Banky's car anymore
told you It wasn't love
(grabs her purse) gotta split
It was really nice meeting you
wish you the best of luck with your book
(shakes his hand) Tell Hooper 'll call him later
And tell your friend to calm down
Alyssa exits to the night
Holden stares after her
Two beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an 'Everything's Archie' comic between them
You're insane
Archie is not fucking Mister Weatherbee
Deny, deny, deny
(to Holden) Where's Alyssa
Huh
Oh
She left
She said she'd call you later
(off comic) He's just offering to help Archie with his homework
Read between the lines
(shoves book at him) Fuck this
(to Holden) Let's go
Traffic
(no response from Holden) Holden
(shaken) What
Let's go
(looking out window) 'jou see that dent in the hood of your car
(looking out window) What the
Son of a bitch
Banky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper
Let me guess: you like her
Who
Miss Alyssa Jones
She's alright
As long as that's all
(finishes drink) Maybe you can convince that partner of your's to drop me off downtown before you scurry out the tunnel
(beat) Mister Weatherbee wasn't really trying to fuck Archie, was he
They begin exiting
Hell no
Weatherbee was Reggie's bitch
- We're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment
It's a rented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors and sparse furnishings
There are posters on the walls, a sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big
(with all the trimmings - , Laserdisc player, Sega, ), a huge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent desks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils, paints, erasers, etc
) - at which sit Holden and Banky
They're working
Some music plays
- over his shoulder, we see Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch- nemesis - the Giggler
Holden erases a line and re- draws
- over his shoulder, we see Banky outlining a pre-penciled page
He traces Bluntman swinging from a street light
The two work in silence
Then
(not looking up) This is one of the best street lights you've ever drawn
It's the one across from the post office
Looks just like it
Thanks
(beat) What do you wanna do tonight
Get a pizza
Watch 'Degrassi Junior High'
(erases) You got a weird thing for Canadian melodrama
've got a weird thing for girls who say 'aboot'
The phone starts ringing
Holden answers it, while still drawing
Bank-Hold-Up
between Holden and Hooper
He's on a phone in a Hooper here
Listen,  know how you burb-fiends hate the city, but there's a club shindig going down that  think you'd get into
Where is it
Place called Her-sterectomy - 'm tempting as bar-keep
don't know, Hoop
We're prepping the next issue, and we've got our big - meeting in the morning
told her you wouldn't be interested
Told who
Alyssa
Alyssa from last night Alyssa
How do you begin and end a question with the same word like that
You got skill
Yes, that one
She asked me to invite you
Now here's the part where you say
'll be there
Thought so
Ten o'clock
Later
(both hang up) Who was that
Hooper
He invited me to a club
When's that faggot going to learn - you like chicks
(getting up) Not that kind of a club
So when we leaving
'We'
You can't go
He's setting me up with Alyssa
And
And  don't want you messing it up
Like  care about your shit
Maybe 'll hook up myself
(pulling on coat) just told you - it's not that kind of club
How does one man get to be so funny
(throws him his coat) How are you going to get home if hook up
Like that'll happen
Let me explain something to you, my witless chum the other night in that bar, we two - Alyssa and  shared a moment, alright
Oh, you had a moment
(brings his two pointer fingers together) We shared a moment
And in that moment, one thing was made abundantly clear: this girl loves me, my friend
Loves-me
6
- - 						6
It's a club - people are mingling, a band is playing, it's loud
But something's fishy
Hooper's tending bar
He hands a  a drink
The Guy sips it
This is so watered down
It's terrible
Why is it you can never get a decent drink in these places
Hooper looks around in a very exaggerated fashion
What are you doing
Trying to find you a tissue
The Guy shoots Hooper an angry glare, Banky enters
Alright - bring on the free hootch
As long as you don't bitch about how little alcohol is in the drink
(hands Banky a drink; to Guy) You owe me five sixty
(off Banky) And  suppose you're going to make your friend here pay for his drink right
Hey,  befriended a guy in a position of authority so  could abuse that authority and get free shit
You want to do the same
There's a lonely Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the street
Get in tight with him
The Guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the bar
work at that '7-11'
(storms away) (calling after him) Wanna be friends
Where's your better half
Taking a piss
Guy's got a bladder like an infant
That's funny - he says you're hung like an infant
Must his mother tell him everything
Holden enters
What'd you do - fall in love
Where is she
Over there
- in the middle of a thrall of people - dances Alyssa
She moves like a cat and she's looking very sexy
Been dancin' for an hour
Hasn't stopped yet
Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare
She ain't no Denny Terrio, 'll say that
Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit
Wait
wait, wait - there's something you should know
She's got a boyfriend
Well
no
Then what's to know
Holden exits; They watch him go
Banky looks around
There're a lot of chicks in this place
'Chicks'
You're such a man
(beat) He didn't really say that about my dick, did he
- Holden slips into the crowd and dances up to Alyssa
He intentionally bumps into her
(fake rage, dancing) Hey, hey, hey - you fucked up my cabbage-patch
Well, well, well - Bluntman himself
Or should  call you Chronic
Call me flattered
heard you sent me the invite to this little soiree'
From a former home-town girl, to Mister Home-Town himself
You're saying you're from the 'burbs
Middletown,
Get out of here
'm from Highlands
know
Hooper told me
How is it that we never ran into one another
You graduate from Hudson
Yeah
Eighty eight
went to North
Also eighty eight
What a small fucking world
So you know the tri-town area
Quiz me
Miller Hill
wrote my name on the wall
Sandy Hook
Lost my virginity there
This is so cool
The mall
Eden Prairie of Menlo Park
Wait - here's the big test: Quick Stop
My best friend fucked a dead guy in the back room
You know that girl
did
Before she was committed
You know what this is
This is fate
(regarding her move) No, this is the 'Rog'
was talking about us meeting - what are the chances
Pretty slim
haven't been back to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral
The Quick Stop girl died
Another friend - Julie Dwyer
She died in the
pool
Damn
You knew her too
So well
One friend in an asylum, the other friend in the grave
You're a dangerous person to know
But  can tap
(does an impromptu tap dance) That was the Buffalo Two-Step
Very solid
That's what six years of tap lessons yields
Two towns away from each other for years and we had to meet in New York
The Sand stops playing
People clap
Coulda been worse - we could have not met at all
Holden looks at her
Thank you
Thanks
The  on stage speaks into the microphone
long time ago, we used to have this bass player who took off one day to draw funny books or something
Maybe you've seen her stuff - it's called 'Idiosyncratic Routine'' The crowd applauds
Alyssa shakes her head, smiling
Holden pokes her
But what a lot of people don't know is that she used to harbor these delusions that she could sing
And she used to subject us to these throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson tunes and shit, insisting that we let her front on a few numbers
Well, we didn't and she quit
and then she got famous, the bitch
(crowd laughs) But she's here tonight, and  think if we all begged, or maybe offered her some , she'd get up here and treat us to some of her vocal stylings
(crowd applauds) What do you say, Alyssa
Alyssa shakes her head no
The crowd urges her
Holden pushes her forward
She's shy
(yelling) ,
The crowd thunders
Alyssa offers the Singer an embarrassed half-smile
She looks at Holden, who claps along with the others and nods toward the stage
Alyssa shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd Banky and Hooper stand at the bar
This is so queer
(he exits) (beat) You don't know the half of it
Alyssa jumps on stage, hugging the Singer
She takes the mic, shaking her head
The crowd is applauding
She is such a twat
The crowd cheers
Alyssa laughs
She turns to the band and says something which they nod
She turns back to the crowd
Alright
should dedicate this, right
(thinks) This is for that special someone our there
Holden smiles
Banky joins him
Holden glances at him
Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile
The band starts playing
Cross cutting begins
Alyssa launches into a torchy tune
The song is extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making direct eye contact with
Holden
Or does she
Holden is smiling, being seduced, Banky rolls his eyes
Beside Holden, stands a pretty with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance
Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out there
The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at
It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur of whom
At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but Alyssa's preoccupied
She points to someone in the crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, urging whoever it is to join her
She jumps off the stage
Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw- shucks style
At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps forward
Banky's eyes widen
Holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback
Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss
Holden's eyes bug
Banky allows a smile to creep across his face
The crowd applauds
Banky looks around, and for the first time, we get the distinct impression that this is a lesbian bar
There are a lot of chicks in this place
Gay chicks
Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back
Now that, my friend, is a
(brings his fingers together, mimicing Holden) shared moment Holden continues to stare - mouth agape
Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss
- - Banky, Holden, Alyssa and the Girl from the dance floor sit around a table
Alyssa and the Girl continue to make out
Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed
Banky stares a little harder
Holden hits him
What
(under his breath) That's rude
Man, when are we ever going to get a chance to see this kind of shit live without paying for it
Alyssa and the Girl break their kiss
Uh-oh - better knock it off: we're getting a man excited
Sorry
It's just
new to him
Oh, and you're an old hand at this
No,  should apologize
don't usually get all mushy in public
But it's been awhile since 've seen Kim here
(formerly the Girl) Tell me you didn't set that gross display up with the band just so you could nail me
Like 'd have to go through that much effort You know what
want to dance
Go ahead
'll watch from here
(tugging at her arm) No
want to dance with you
Don't be such a rag
have to sit here and work up the desire to fuck you later
Please
Kim exits
Banky is smiling ear-to-ear
Alyssa looks at him
Yes
You said 'fuck'
To that girl
You said you'd 'fuck' her
And
How can a girl 'fuck' another girl
Were you talking about strap-ons or something
(hits him) Would you shut up
What
It's a valid question
You know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse Letters section is written by guys - this is our chance to get the inside scoop
(to Alyssa) don't know how many times  can apologize for him
It's okay
Secretly, all  really want is to be the center of attention
(to Banky) 've never used a snap-on
Then what's with saying 'fuck
Shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at least modify the term 'fuck' with something like 'fist'
Let me ask you a question - can men 'fuck' each other
Ask Hooper
In your estimation
Sure
So for you, to 'fuck' means to penetrate
You're used to the more traditional definition - you inside some girl you've duped, jack-hammering away, not noticing that bored look in her eyes
Hey -  always notice the bored look in their eyes
(laughs) 'Fucking' is nor limited to penetration, Banky
For me it describes any sex when it's not totally about love
don't love Kim, but 'll fuck her
'm sure you don't love every girl you sleep with
Some of them  downright loathe
But 'll bet it's different with the ones you love
'll bet you go the full nine when it's not just a quick fix - like you go down on them longer or something
Here we go
don't do that
What
stopped dropping
It got to be too frustrating
As stupid as you usually come off during this diatribe of your's, you're going to come off ten times as stupid on this occasion
What
lost my tolerance for the bullshit baggage that comes with eating girls out
What's the big deal
If you say the smell, so help me, 'll slug you
Not the smell - the smell is good
'm talking about not being able to do it property
And my mother brought me up to believe that if  can't do something right  shouldn't do it at all
Of course, my father told me she gave lousy head, but that's beside the point
At least you blame yourself for your sexual inadequacies
No,  blame them
Chicks never help you out
They never tell you what to do
And most of them are self- conscious about that smell factor, and so most of the time they just lay there, frozen like a deer in the headlights, right
Not for nothing, but when a chick goes down on me let her know where to go, and what the status is
You gotta handle it like and the Weather Channel - constant updates
You're such an idiot
No, he's got a point
That's how was in high school -  was nervous, and inhibited about being eaten out
But by the time  got to college, that all changed
loosened up
Not only did  learn to communicate -  learned to be bossy
was like one of those guys at the airport with those big flash lights - waving them this way, directing them that way, telling them when to stop
And that's all 'm saying, it'd be different if chicks helped out - pointed a guy in the right direction
Then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted time, and no chance for permanent injuries
Permanent injuries
Sure
You wanna see something permanent
(pulls our front tooth) got this from Nina Rollins, sophomore year
'm going down on her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her stomach
She does this big ol' pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in half, sends it down my throat
had to get a crown for the stub
(to Holden) got that beat
(to Banky) got that beat
(half-turns and lifts chin) Sophomore year
'm going down on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after we went club-hopping
'm totally drunk, and in the middle of it,  fall asleep - right there in her lap
She got so mad, she digs her heel into my back, right there
(points to scar) That's permanent
You see this
(moves neck slightly right) That's the farthest  can move my neck to the right Sophomore year, 'm going out with Maria Bennert, and for six months, 'm going down on her, and not a damn thing's happening
Then one night,  change a position, or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly it's a whole new world
She's moving around, convulsing, breathing heavy
And her legs are pressing against my ears so tightly that  don't hear her father come into the room
He grabs my hair
(grabs his own hair and pulls back) and he pulls me way back, hard
(throws up her leg, and rolls up pants) Senior year
Spring Formal
'm eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's car
She's laying across the back seat, and 'm half-hanging out of the car, my knees on the ground
She's flailing around, and she knocks the parking brake off
The car starts rolling down the hill, and my right knee is cut up all to shit like a kiddy's scissor class cut it up for paper dolls
Banky and Alyssa laugh
Holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it
Then Kim re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck
(off Banky's watch) Holy shit, is that the time
We've gotta beat traffic
What traffic - it's one thirty in the morning
(getting up) And rush hour starts in six hours
Let's go
(to Alyssa) Thanks for inviting us out
It was
educational
Alyssa waves at him as he exits
Banky slides out of the booth
(to Kim) Since you like chicks, right
do you just look at yourself in the mirror all the time
Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out
Alyssa watches them go, then turns and kisses Kim
- '    - Holden looks preoccupied
Banky flips through magazines, biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing
He sticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks up another one and then repeats the whole process Receptionist types
(off Holden's look) You're still dwelling on the dyke, aren't you
Lower your voice
What'd  tell you - she just needs the right guy
All every woman really wants - be it mother, senator, nun - is some serious deep-dicking
The Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, shocked
(off her look) Don't give me that look -  heard Adam Curry say worse
The Secretary goes back to typing
Banky shrugs at Holden
That's why  can't buy lesbians
Everyone needs dick
See,  can buy fags
Bunch of guys that need dick - just plain need it
That  get
Dykes
Bullshit posturing
But - live and let live,  guess
'm sure the gay community appreciates your support
, the boy's lawyer, joins them
Please tell me you haven't blown this deal already
Sloss like a mother fucker
(slaps his hand) Hey, every mother but your's - a shyster's gotta have his standards
Shall we
- '  - The  are a casual couple of guys, sitting on couches across from our trio
1 We just want to start off by saying that it's a pleasure to finally meet you
While it's been - shall we say - an experience dealing with Sloss here, one of the main reasons we started this whole thing was to meet the guys that do 'Bluntman and Chronic'
2 (points at them) 'Snootchie Bootchies'
The Execs and Sloss laugh
Holden and Banky politely join in
Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' look
1 Which brings us to our proposal: we are extremely interested in doing twelve, half-hour 'Bluntman and Chronic' cartoons
The age of Beavis is coming to a close, and we're looking for something
something
Even more retarded and juvenile to sate the voracious, intellectually- challenged miscreants that make up your key demographic
The Execs laugh hard
Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and gives the thumbs up
1 (composes himself) So what do you say
Are we in business
Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful face
He looks to Holden, then to Sloss
Sloss nods in understanding
Jim, Sean - could we have a few minutes
2 (looks to Exec 1) Uh
absolutely
We'll just
1 Uh
wait outside The Exec's smile and head our, closing the door behind then
Sloss turns to Banky
So
Did  do good
You did better - you sold us out
They clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience
Do you know how much you'll make on merchandising alone
(as Simon Bar Sinister) Money and Power, and Money and Power
(joins in) Money dnd Power, and Money and
(interrupting) don't think it's a good idea
Banky and Sloss freeze
They stare at Holden
What's not a good idea
Please don't say the cartoon, please don't say the cartoon
The cartoon
What
Are you out of your fucking mind
(getting up) John, let me handle this
( to Holden) You are out of your fucking mind, aren't you
Is this how you want to be remembered
As the guy who created Bluntman and Chronic
Banky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through the guy's stuff
No, 'd like to be remembered as the filthy rich guy who created Bluntman and Chronic
But it'll be all glossy and main- stream
We'll lose any artistic credibility we ever had
(to Banky) Is it me
don't see the problem
(to Sloss) He just has to get over this crush of his
Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again
(to Holden) Holden - she's not really a Princess
(opening drawer with a letter opener) Not on her; on Alyssa Jones - the chick that does that comic book 'Idiosyncratic Routine'
You ever seen it
Please
Like  even read your comic, let alone anyone else's, (to Holden) 'm not limited to offering you legal counsel only, my friend
'm also learned in the ways of the heart, and can offer you this advice - nail her, get it out of your system, and move on
Like we say at Sloss Law - good fences make good neighbors
She'd never let him in her yard
The chick's gay
(laughing) She's gay
You fell for a gay, comic- book writing chick
Holden, you poor, poor man
(beat) Wait a sec - does she have representation
Always working, you
(holds up a Polaroid of a naked woman) Look at this - Mrs
- Exec has a string of pearls hanging our of her ass, Would you leave his stuff alone
(to Holden) You can break her resolve, killer
All it takes is one good man
But if it takes two good men, don't hesitate to call me
That being said, in regards to the more pressing issue, suggest you leave art to the museums and grab on with both hands to the big, fat check
'll give it some thought (holding up Polaroid) 'm taking this as a precaution - just in case they give us any shit about pussy's decision delay
(glaring at Holden) You'll 'give it some thought'
You're so retarded 'm retarded
This from the guy who only forty five minutes ago paid fifty bucks for what's supposed to be a boot- leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers' with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel wearing a French Tickler
How'd you fall for that
The guy who sold it to me had an honest face
- There is a door
There's a knock at the door
Holden opens it and Alyssa is standing there
Somebody told me that they make comic books here, and 've got an idea for this story about a guy who comes to a club and high-tails it when he finds out this girl is pay
Any interest in a story like that
Holden smiles
- Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs
-
Twelve episodes
That's great, isn't it
Banky seems to think so
But you don't
They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings
don't know if that's the perception want people to have of our stuff know this sounds pretentious as hell, but  like to think of us as artists
And 'd like to get back to doing something more personal - like our first book
Well when are you going to do that
(beat) As soon as we have something personal to say
Do you know how pretty you are
What
You're a pretty man
Uh
thanks
Oh
get it
'm into girls, so have to find all men repulsive or something
didn't say anything
Aren't there some men that you find attractive
Granted, not enough to sleep with, but still - just handsome or something
Sure
Harrison Ford
And our mail- man
Well it's the same thing
look at you and just find you really handsome
And you know, it has very little to do with your look, per-se
Your look is fine, don't get me wrong
But it's more your outlook
The things you say, the way you see things
It's
don't know
attractive, Holden looks away, embarrassed, weirded you our the other night Huh
No, not really
Come on
(beat) It's just that we've
,  mean, 've never seen that kind of thing up close and personal
It just took awhile to process, longer than usual
Do you want to talk about it
Um
If you want to
like you
haven't liked a man in a long time
And 'm not a man-hater or something
It's just been some time since 've been exposed to a man that didn't immediately live-into a stereotype of some sort
And  want you to feel comfortable with me, because  want us to be friends
So if there are things you'd like to know, it's okay to ask me
(beat) Why girls
(beat) Why men
Because that's the standard If that's the only reason you're attracted to women - because it's the standard
It's more than that
So you've never been curious about men
Curious about men
Well
always wondered why my father watched 'Hee- Haw'
You know what  mean
No
Why not
No interest
Because
Girls feel right
And that's how  feel
've never really been attracted to men
'm more comfortable with the idea of girls
Wait, wait, wait - you're still a virgin
No
But you've only been with girls
You're saying a person's a virgin until they've had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex
Isn't that the standard definition
Again with the standards
think virginity is lost when you make love for the first time
With a member of the opposite sex
Why
Why only then
Because that's the standard
So if a virgin is raped, then she's still a virgin
Of course not
But rape is not the standard
So she's had sex, but not the standard idea of sex
Hence, according to your definition, she'd still be a virgin
Okay, 'll revise
Virginity is lost when the hymen is broken
Then  lost my virginity at ten, because  fell on a fence post when was ten, and it broke my hymen
Now have to tell people that  lost it to a wooden post 'd known my whole young life
Second revision - virginity is lost through penetration
Physical penetration or emotional
Emotional
Well,  fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree when we were in high school
Physical penetration
We had sex
Yeah, but not real sex
move to have that remark stricken from the record
On account of it makes you come off as completely naive and infantile
Well where's the penetration in lesbian sex
Alyssa holds up her hand
finger
Come on
've had my finger in my ass but  wouldn't say 've had anal sex
Did  hold up a finger
(waves her hand) (beat; then he gets it) You're kidding
(she nods) How
Our bodies are built to pass a child, for Christ's sake
But doesn't it hurt
Sure
But in a good way
And it's only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved for really special occasions
What about not-so-special occasions
Tongue only
But how can that be enough
mean, let's be real - how big can a tongue even get
Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her tongue, which is just huge
Holden is transfixed
Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing
Let's go
She exits
Holden remains in the swing
Alyssa comes back in
Come on
Just
uh
just give me a moment
- Holden enters
Banky tries to balance way-too-much luggage
Look at you
It's a two day trip
got the Sega in one bag, my clothes in the other, and two months worth of unread comics in this one
We're going to a convention, for the love of God
We'll be busy from ten 'till eight each day
When are you possibly going to have time for any of that shit
In fact, fuck it - you're leaving some of this shit here in a locker
Come on - give me the two that aren't clothes
Hold on
(starts rifling through one bag) What are you doing
just have to get something
(pulls out a huge stack of porno books) Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt
What are you going to do with all of those
Read the articles
What do you think 'm going to do with them
They're stroke books
You've got like thirty books there
We're only there for two days
(leafing through mags) Variety's the spice of life
like a wide selection
Sometimes 'm in the mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes like them arty and air-brushed
Some times it's a spread brown-eye kind of night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl time
Sometimes a steamy letter will do it, sometimes - not often, but sometimes -  like the idea of a chick with a horse
beeping sound is heard
Holden checks his beeper
Go check us in
've gotta call Alyssa
His master's voice
Put that stuff away
Holden exits
Banky starts packing his mags up little  enters, staring at him
What are those
(looks at kid then books) Do you Like horsies
Holden finishes dialing the phone
Cross cut between him and Alyssa at home
hope for the sake of the women you've dated that you're only this quick in returning calls
What's up
'm about to get on a plane
Ohhh
Why
Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'
Shit
What
My sister's at my parents'
was gonna go see her
The one that wrote the book
Yeah
But  was staying all weekend, and  wanted to hang our with you
This sucks
You didn't get invited to the Con'
don't do southern con's - all the chicks have that annoying drawl
You know how hard it is nor to laugh when someone moans "Fuhhk me"
Well this sucks
(thinks) You know - both of us don't have to go
Really
Yeah
Banky can go by himself
It's not like we're on a panel
It was just a signing appearance
If you come pick me up, 'll be your best friend
(beat) Where's your apartment
'm not there
'm at a friend's - in the Village
Corner of Houston and Mercer
Number eighty six, apartment 6-
'll be there in half an hour
You're so easy
They hang up
Holden reacts to something  and exits quickly
C11
Banky points to pictures in the book
The kid looks on
And then Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer, and he finally did some of his own mounting
(off book) Wow
Holden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away
What are you doing
(waving to kid) think  want kids of my own one day
They're fun
Listen to me - 'm not going
You're going to have to do this one by yourself
What
Why
Alyssa's coming down for the weekend, so  want to hang out with her
You don't need me for this
(taking his excess baggage) Meantime,  'll take this stuff home
You can keep the filth
'll pick you up at nine Sunday night, alright
Don't forget to plug the Annual and don't mention the t
v
show, okay
Call me if you get bored
And he's gone
Banky stands there, open-mouthed check-in   comes up to him
His name-tag reads 'Frank'
Checking in, sir
(still watching Holden go) Hunhh
(looks at
) Yeah
But this is carry-on
Federal aviation security law requires me to ask if you've been given any strange gifts or parcels to carry-on since arriving at the airport today
(thinks) Not this trip
But one time, when was using curb side check-in, this sky- cap gave me a cock ring and a set of anal ben-wa balls
always thought that was pretty strange
He said his name was Frank
(looks closely at him) Hey
You're name's Frank
Banky storms away
The Flight Attendant watches him go
Fucking kids
6- - Holden knocks at the door
It opens
is standing in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up and down and smirks
Let me guess - 'the right man'
Excuse me
You've got it in your head that Alyssa's not really into chicks - that she just hasn't met the right man
And you believe you're it
You're going to treat her right, fuck her like a stud, and 'straight-jacket' her back from the land of the lost
And the sad truth is that you'll accomplish none of that and wind up as either an even more bitter misogynist or a reverse fag-hag
Holden's at a loss
Alyssa slips past the Woman, carrying an overnight bag
Don't mind her
That's just her way a saying hello
Actually, it's just my way of saying "Give it up
" (to Woman) You're such an asshole
When you file the date-rape charges, don't say  didn't warn you
(holding out hand) 'm Holden, by the way
'm the voice of reason that Miss Bitch is having such a hard time listening to
Look, we're just friends
That's what every guy says before he tries purring your hand on his dick
And how do you know men so well
Because  lapdance for a living, dick- head
She slams the door
Holden looks to Alyssa
Ohhh - you look so cute
She heads down the stairs
Who was that
Just an occasional friend
Why would you want to hang our with someone bitter as that
(stops) Remember this
(sticks out huge tongue) Her's is even bigger than that
She smiles and continues on
Holden looks back up at the door
He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his fingers
- The car sits in traffic
- Holden sighs
Alyssa plays with the radio
You were raised Catholic, right
Yeah
You
Baptist
Really
Did you have a strict upbringing
Please There was no time to be bad - we were too busy saying 'Jesus'
You think your upbringing had something to do with your lifestyle choice
Somewhere along the line
It's a gradual transition to make - from doing what the majority does to taking a leap of faith and doing what feels more natural
Everything helps - from the way you were handled as a kid, to the way the boys acted in third grade, to the shoes you wore at your freshman prom
Shoes
Well they were really tight
With the requisite music, over which we hear a conversation between Holden and Alyssa
1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the  eating
Holden's talking
The Waitress walks past and drops her pad
She bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in the process
Alyssa stares at her ass
Holden stops talking and stares at her
Alyssa looks over at him and offers a caught smile
2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the  , throwing various things into the basket
Alyssa comes up with a box of Tampons and throws them in
Holden glances at them, a bit flushed
Alyssa catches him, picks up the box, and pulls one out
She proceeds to demonstrate their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming insertion
Holden puts up his hands in the " know, know," fashion
3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes to light it
It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having trouble
Holden grows a little frustrated
Finally, he grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with his teeth
Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback
Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke
He then continues with his display
4) Holden and Alyssa at the
Steve-Dave and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously
Alyssa pays for a comic
Steve-Dave glowers at Holden
He gives Alyssa her change and they exit
Steve-Dave goes back to his card game with the Fan-Boy
Suddenly, a garbage can comes crashing through their window
Steve-Dave rips a check off the garbage can and punches the counter
The Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly, 5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a  , talking
She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder
Holden smiles to himself
Let me ask you something - we get along, right
Famously
We have a definite chemistry
So it would seem
But we're both into girls
'm into women
But you weren't always gay
When  was nine  had a crush on Scott Baio
So If we'd met a long time ago, say in high school
'd still be muff-diving, yes
Thought so
- Holden and Banky play  Sports Hockey on Sega
There's a knock at the door
Come in
Alyssa enters and stands besides them, smiling at their game
read somewhere that guys who play hockey are merely making up for penile deficiencies by carrying big sticks
thought you lived in the city
This is like the umpteenth time 've seen you here
Isn't that grounds enough for the little pink mafia to throw you out of their club
(hits Banky; to Alyssa) 'll be ready in a second
just have to school this mouthy second-stringer
Bitch, you're schooling no one
They play
Cut back and forth between the game and Banky, Holden, and Alyssa
(off game) What
Do something
(off game) You fucking cock-teaser
'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass
Look at how slow you are
Christ, you move like a geriatric
(screaming at screen) Fuck
You Fucking cock-sucker, man
These faggots won't do what  tell them to
Oh
It's the controller, right
It's always the controller
No, it's these
fucking queers on blades that can't accept a fucking pass to save their lives
What period is this
Final sixty of the third
Fuck
Look at your fucking guys, they
(whips controller) , Banky storms away
Alyssa looks at Holden, Imagine if 'd only beaten him by one instead of thirty
-  - Holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine
Alyssa looks on
Explain this again
How could you have grown up down the shore and never played skee-ball
What did you do with your youth
They head toward the skee-ball runs
Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed around
Not your grade school years; your high school years
(off skee-ball run) This looks complicated
(Inserts coin and pulls lever) The premise is very basic - you roll the ball up the ramp at varying speeds, in an effort to pop it into the score circles
The higher the score, the more prize tickets you get
What do you do with the prize tickets
Trade them in for prizes that aren't worth nearly as much as you paid to play the game
Then what's the point
It's fun
And you question my lifestyle
Observe
Holden rolls the ball
It pops into a twenty point circle
See
It's just that simple
Why not just walk up there and put it in the fifty every time
Where's the skill in that
Oh, this is a skill
'm sorry,  had no idea
Just toss one
Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it overhand
It pops off one of the circles and shoots back at them, missing them as they duck
An  knock and an "
" is heard
Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs
(to  guy) 'm sorry, man
She's new at this
Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head
He gets up
(to ) Thank you
(hands Alyssa another ball) Underhand
Throw it underhand
This is where you take straight chicks on dates
It's like Spanish Fly
This'll probably be the first time  don't score afterwards
don't know
'm starting to get a tingle in my bottom
(tosses a ball) Ten
(grabs a ball) So what'd you do last night
(prepares to throw) Got laid Holden whips the ball in surprise
It ricochets off the ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine
Alyssa laughs
Holden looks around, nervously
Some more of that skill you were telling me about
Maybe we should just leave before somebody gets hurt
No way
want a cheap prize
(throws a ball) So your friend's quite the homophobe
He just feels left out,  think
'm not talking about his infantile hang-up with me
'm talking about when you two were playing that game
Everytime he swore - when his players messed up, he called them cocksuckers, he referred to the players as queers, he called you a cock-teaser
thought he was talking to you
know you think it means nothing, and it may in fact be unintentional, but it's ugly all the same
He was just pissed he was losing
So he slams the gay community
'mon
Don't get all p
c
on me
'm not
But what is that saying
It says he gets too easily frustrated
It's passive/agressive gay-bashing
How do you figure
How casually did it roll off his tongue
And that's how he expresses his anger
By calling people faggots
think you're reading too much into it
think you're just so used to it that it rolls off your back
've heard the two of you play your little rank out game where one insists the other is gay
(as the boys) "You're a faggot
No, you're a faggot
"  It's cute and all to watch you go at it like grade-schooler, but it's also offensive - labeling and ducking the label of being gay as if it were the scarlet fucking letter
You're blowing this way out of proportion
We live in a more tolerant age now
You refer to yourself as a dyke
Hooper calls himself a faggot all the time
Yeah, but that's what's known as empowerment/disempowerment
call myself a dyke so it's not too devastating when some throwback screams it at me as 'm leaving a bar at night
Same for Hooper - by calling himself a faggot, he steals the thunder away from the mouthy jerks of this world who'd like to beat him to it
But the difference between us having it and your friend saying it is miles wide
We say it to mask the pain - you say it for lack of a better expression at any given moment
No Holden, we do not live in a more tolerant age
And if you think that's the case, then you've been in the suburbs way too long to be resuscitated
Holden kind of sulks
Alyssa notices
But you know what
(picks up his face) have more faith in you than that
(rips her tickets off) Come on -  want my cheap prize
- Holden enters
Banky's still playing Sega
Holden sits next to him
(off screen) How bad do you suck
How was your pseudo-date
Leave it alone
That chick bugs me
(rubs his head; in baby-talk) Aww
Everyone bugs you
Get off
(off game) Fucking faggot
Did you see that
Your dyke courting ass just got me scored on
(beat) You know, you should watch that
If you're going to get all bent out of shape while playing the game, so much so that you need to curse the t
v
, try not to gay-bash it, alright
You're nor that kind of guy
(gets up) And don't call her a dyke, alright
She's a lesbian
Holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat
Banky sits there, shocked
He puts the controller down and crosses to the drawing table
What the fuck is going on here
(pulling out pencil) 'm starting a new page
(smacking pencil away) Not with this shit
With you
What the fuck is going on with you and that girl
We're friends
She's programming you
beg your pardon
Programming
Yeah
And apparently, you don't even realize it
What does it matter if refer to her as a dyke, or if  call the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the privacy of my own office, far from the sensitive ears of the rest of the world
It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing; and  know you're not really prejudiced at heart
You should just find some other way to express your anger, is all 'm saying
Holden starts drawing
Banky stares at him
Then he grabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to the side
He starts drawing something
What the fuck are you doing
Bear with me here
just want to put you through this little exercise
(drawing feverishly) Okay, now see this
This is a four way road, okay
Banky draws a four-way stop
He illustrates according to his voice-over
And dead in the center, is a crisp, new, hundred dollar bill
Now at the end of each of the streets, are four people, okay
You following
Up here, we got a male-affectionate, easy- to-get-along-with, no political agenda lesbian
Okay
Now down here, we have a man-hating, angry-as-fuck, agenda-of-rage, bitter dyke
To this side, we got Santa Claus, right
And over to this side - the Easter Bunny
Banky finishes drawing
Holden's shaking his head Which one's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first
What is this supposed to prove
'm serious
This is a serious exercise
It's like an
question
Which one's going to get to the hundred dollar bill first - the male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter Bunny
(beat; then pissed) The man-hating dyke
Good
Why
don't know
(wildly crossing out the other three) Holden storms away
Banky follows
don't need this
'm going home
She's fucking with your mind, man
She knows you've got this schoolboy crush and she's using it to sway your way of thinking
And why would she need to do that
What is she Mata fucking Hari
What does she gain
Maybe she thinks you'll get her comic picked up by Contender
Or maybe she thinks you'll change the content of our book to something more political and message oriented
Or, gee - don't know - maybe because that's just what dykes like to do: fuck around with straight guys' heads, just so she can go back to her little rug-muncher club and have a good laugh with all her man-hating harpy cronies about how fucking stupid and easily duped men are
You're so out of line right now
, You don't even know this girl
Big deal, she's from Middletown and she went to North
All the girls at North were bitches and sluts anyway
And this one's got them beat by a mile because she's a bitch/slut/dyke
Watch your fucking mouth, is all 'm going to tell you
Oh why
Do you get my back when she bashes me
Because  know she does
And do you know why she does
Because won't play her fucking game
Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious bullshit is amusing
Sometimes it's just fucking annoying as piss
What is it about this girl
You know you have no shot at getting her into bed
Why do you bother wasting time with her
Because you're Holden fucking McNeil - most persistent traveller on the road that's not the path of least resistance
Everything's gotta be a fucking challenge for you, and this little relationship with that bitch is a prime example of your fucking condition
Well  don't need a fucking magic eight ball to look into your future; you want a forecast
Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa
(shakes and looks at imaginary ball) What a shock - "Not fucking likely"
This relationship of  your's is affecting you, our work and our friendship, and the time's going to come when  throw down the gauntlet and say it's me or her
And then what're you going to say
(beat) think you should let this one go
No, what would you say
Would you trash twenty years of friendship because you've got some idiotic notion that this chick would even let you sniff her panties, let alone fuck her
Let it go
What the fuck Holden looks at Banky for a long beat
'm in love with her, man
Banky stares at him
Holden stares back
Banky looks into Holden's eyes
Suddenly, he softens a bit
He drops his head
Fuck
Banky walks away
Holden watches him go and exits
- Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth
Alyssa picks through her food
Holden looks at the check and pulls money from his wallet
wish you were the one being pursued by -
Oh really
Sure
Then you could sell our and maybe pick up the check once in awhile
(drops her fork and wipes her hands) We're leaving
Well it's not like this is a bed and breakfast, 've got a little business to conduct
She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth
Holden watches her, then follows
A23
Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug
Alyssa offers the 'just wait' finger
The  turns to her
Are you an authorized deal-maker in this establishment
Do you have the power to negotiate
You wanna haggle over the price of your French Dip
want to haggle over the price of fine art
What do you mean
(pointing ) There
By the kitchen
That painting
What about it
The price tag says seventy five
So
(to Alyssa) Tell me you're kidding
'll give you fifty
(to ) Manuel
Bring, me the Dyksiezski off the wall
(to Alyssa) All my years in the diner business, 've waited for this day - the day when someone wanted to buy one of the pictures
(holds out hand) Alyssa Jones
Pleased to meet you
You say you want to haggle, but you don't know rule one about haggling, which you just broke: you never give your name
The name is power, and to give the opponent that piece of you is to give away victory
'm only trying to conduct a transaction
We're not opponents
(accepting painting from ) Oh, but we are - if you think 'm letting this beautiful piece go for fifty
Ah-ha
(to Holden) Now we're haggling
24
- 									24
It's drizzling outside
Holden drives
Alyssa hugs her painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield, making footprints
've always wondered what kind of people buy those things
can't believe you talked him down to twenty five
It was looking shakey when he told me the artist was a blind cripple with a hump-back, but  held my ground
There's no room for sympathy in the buyer's market
Where are you going to hang it
'm not
You are
You want me to hang it for you
You better hope it doesn't get out to the girl-nation that you needed a man to help you hang a picture
You're going to hang it in your house
bought it for you
(laughs) Yeah, right
(looks at him) 'm serious
Holden stares at her
Why
Because it's captured the moment
It'll be a constant reminder - not just of tonight, but of our introduction, the building of our friendship, everything
Make no mistake about it my Friend - it's a gift to you, from me, so you'll always remember us
Holden stares ahead
Then he swerves the wheel to the right
- The car pulls to the side of the road
The rain is a bit heavier now
- Holden throws the car into park Why are we stopping
Because  can't take it
Can't take what
love you
(beat) You love me
love you
And not in a friendly way, although  think we're great friends
And not in a misplaced affection, puppy-dog way, although 'm sure that's what you'll call it
And it's not because you're unattainable
love you
Very simple, very truly
You're the epitome of every attribute and quality 've ever looked for in another person
know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option you'd ever consider
But can't do this any longer
can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you
can't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels
can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are
know this will probably queer our friendship - no pun intended - but had to say it, because 've never felt this before, and  like who  am because of it
And if bringing it to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me
But  couldn't allow another 	day to go by without getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot- down
And 'll accept that But  know some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there is a moment of hesitation, that means you feel something too
All  ask is that you not suppress that - at least for ten minutes - and try to dwell in it before you dismiss it
There isn't another soul on this fucking planet who's ever made me the person  am when 'm with you, and would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau
Because it's there between you and me
You can't deny that
And even if we never speak again after tonight, please know that 'm forever changed because of you and what you've meant to me, which - while  do appreciate it - 'd never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of
Holden stares at Alyssa
She stares back
Then she gets out of the car
Was it something  said
- Holden gets out of the car
It's raining pretty hard now
Alyssa's hitching up the road
Holden reaches her
What are you doing
Get back in the car and get out of here
You're going to hitch to New York
'ep
Aren't you at least going to comment
Here's my comment fuck you
Why
That was so unfair
You know how unfair that was
It's unfair that 'm in love with you
No, it's unfortunate that you're in love with me
It's  unfair that you felt the fucking need to unburden your soul about it
Do you remember for a fucking second who  am
So
People change
Oh, it's that simple
You fall in love with me and want a romantic relationship, nothing changes for you with the exception of feeling hunky- dorey all the time
But what about- me
It's not that simple, is it can't just get into a relationship with you without throwing my whole fucking world into upheaval
But that's every relationship
There's always going to be a period of adjustment
Period of adjustment
(hitting him) '  '  ' '
' ' If this is a crush
then  don't know if  could take the real thing if it ever happens
She looks at him, rain drenching the pair
She shakes her head ruefully
Go home, Holden
She walks away
Holden stands there, at a loss
Then he turns and heads back to his car
As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with him, big time
He drops his keys and embraces her
And there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched kissing
- Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys with the other
He jams them into the lock, opening the door
He picks up the mail on the floor
- He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each other's arms
The place looks a mess - Like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous fucking
Banky is oblivious
He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls out a chocolate milk
He opens it, sticks a straw into the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail
He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the couch, near Holden's head
He looks down at the sleeping couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats
Then he freezes
He looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco
It hits the floor with a pop
Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus
They look at one another, then at the flabbergasted Banky
Banky blinks
Then he shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out
(off Holden's reaction) take it that's not good
(getting up) Stay here
(he kisses her and exits) - Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden saunters up and sits beside him
He follows Banky's gaze
Catholic school girls
Across the street, the Catholic High School is letting out
Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters smoke, frolic, wait for their bus
The uniform is what does it for me wish 'd have went with more Catholic school girls when  was a kid
As it stands
have no "
and then she unzipped her jumper
" stories
You looked weirded out back there
That's my couch you were fucking on
Sorry
wanted to watch some
Hard to do when your best friend's wrapped around a naked rug-muncher on your couch
She had boxers on
Banky shoots him a glare
He goes back to staring at the girls
This is all going to end badly
You don't know that
know you
You're way too conservative for that girl
She's been around and seen things we've only read about in books
But we have read about them
So we're prepared
There's no 'we' here
You're going to have to go through this alone
And it's one thing to read about shit, and something different when you're forced to deal with it on a regular basis
When you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick, it's going to eat you up inside
You'll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoe's going to drop
Because for you, this isn't about cool weird sex stuff, it's about love
Maybe it is for her as well
Somehow  doubt it
Everyone's not out to get someone in life
Bank
Everybody has an agenda
Everyone
Yourself
My agenda is to watch your back
To what end
To insure that all this time we've spent together, building something, wasn't wasted
She's not going to ruin the comic
wasn't talking about the comic
(gets up) 'm going to gel a bagel
Clean off my fucking couch so  can watch
Banky walks away
Holden shakes his head
'   - An all-girl gathering
,  and  help Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'
Tory letters a page
Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork
Dalia drinks wine
Alyssa paints the cover
From what  understand, when you sign with a publisher, someone else does all this work for you, and you just sit back and collect
And miss these last minute cram sessions with my nearest and dearest
Never
don't know what she's bitching about
All she's done since we got here is pound Merlot
'm sorry weren't you the one who misspelled 'receipt' on page eighteen
Yeah, you're a real help
What 'd like to know is why we're here at all when we haven't seen Princess funny-Book in a month
Yeah Alyssa - who've you been shacking up with
'Shacking up
' Please
(stops painting; smiles wide) 'm so in love
Everyone aww's
Alyssa buries her face, giggling
know
know - feel like such a goon
But  can't help it - we have such a great time together
Who is it
Don't even tell me it's Ms
Thing from the
place
'll kill you
It's not her
It's someone you guys don't know
That chick you left the restaurant with that night
They're not
From around here
Don't even tell me you met her down the shore
Eww
Not a bridge-and-tunnel Jersey dyke
With huge hair and acid-washed jeans
They all cackle
Alyssa tries to laugh with them
Come on, Alyss - Hoboken Hussy or what
For your information, they don't have big hair or wear acid wash
(goes back to painting) They're from my home town
Dalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously
Why are you playing the pronoun game
What
What are you talking about
'm not even
You are
" met someone
"  "We have a great time
"They're from my home town
"  Doesn't this tube of wonderful have a name
(beat) Holden
All four Girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified
She stops painting
Oh, Alyssa - no
Not you
You're dating a guy
He's not like a typical man
He's really sweet to me, and we relate so well
You guys'd love him, really
They stare at Alyssa
Then Dalia gets up
've gotta go to the store
'll go with
They exit
Alyssa looks to Tory and Nica
(pouring wine) Whelp - here's to both of you
(moves the glass to her lips) Another one bites the dust
'  - Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight bathing them
She smokes
Can  ask you something
Don't even tell me you want to do it again
Why me - you know
Why now
Because you were giving me that look, and  got wet
You know what 'm talking about
Why not You
'm a guy
You're attracted to girls
see you've been taking notes
Historically, yes  that's true
Then why this
've given that a lot of thought, you know
mean, now that 'm being ostracized by my friends, 've had a lot of time to think about all of this
And what 've come up with is really simple:  came to this on my terms
didn't just heed what  was taught, you  know
Men and women should be together, it's the natural way - that kind of thing
'm not with you because of what family, society, life tried to instill in me from day one
The way the world is - how seldom you meet that one person who gets you
it's so rare
My parents didn't really have it
There was no example set for me in the world of male/female relation ships
And to cut oneself off from finding that person - to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender
that just seemed stupid
So  didn't
And by leaving my options open,  was branded 'gay', which to me was no big deal - labels are labels, you know
They define what you do, not who you are,  guess
But 		then you come along
You - the one least likely;  mean, you were a guy
Still am
And while  was falling for you,  put a ceiling on that, because you were a guy
Until  remembered why  opened the door to women in the first place - to not limit the likelihood of finding that one person who'd compliment me so completely
And so here we are,  was thorough when  looked for you, and feel justified lying in your arms - because  got here on my terms, and have no question that there was someplace  didn't look
And that makes all the difference
(beat) Shit
What
Well, you took the luster our of it
What luster
(joking - in case you didn't get it) Of how  brought you back from the other side
How all you needed was the right man to turn you around
You're not the right man
(kisses him) You're just the one
She snuggles into him and closes her eyes
Holden stares at the ceiling
Can  at least cell people that all you needed was some serious deep- dicking
She hits him with her pillow
' -- 1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various directions, shaking her head accordingly
Then she puts up her hands to stop
Cut to Holden, hanging the picture
Alyssa gave him
It hangs at a severely crooked angle
He looks back to her and shakes his head 'no'
2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game
Banky plays as well
Holden instructs her in the ways of '96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things on the screen)
She presses the reset button, over and over
Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck
' look
Alyssa sticks her tongue at him
3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon off the shelf
He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick porno
An old  stares at her
Holden nods to the old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands, putting it back on the shelf
He ushers her away
The old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the tape herself, 4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the park, her crotch against the back of his neck
He's talking
She taps him and he stops and looks up
She begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face
He pulls her off and put her down
She's laughing
He's flushed with embarrassment
The same Old Woman from the Video store passes by with her husband
Holden shrugs
5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the waving, then putting up her hands to stop
Cut to Holden again, this time with the painting hung completely upside down
He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze
6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table
There are penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging out with Alyssa today
Holden"
Banky crumples it up and throws it across the room
7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop
She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile crawling across her face, and closes her eyes
We pull back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her, eating her out (no, we don't see anything
)
- Holden draws
book is thrown in front of him
He looks up
Banky stands there
Check out page forty eight
Holden looks down at that book
It's the Nineteen Eighty Eight yearbook from Middletown North
He shakes his head at Banky and flips it open
On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo
Under her name is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'
(looking up) So
Did you see the nickname
'Finger Cuffs'
And
And
she had a weird nick-name
What's your point
Do you know why it's 'Finger Cuffs'
suppose you do
do
(takes a seat) You remember Cohee Lundin
Left Hudson and went to North our senior year
Yeah
Well,  ran into him at Food City the other day, and we got to talking, and mentioned that you were dating Alyssa, and he said
In the   of  , addressing the camera
Alyssa Jones
Shit
know Alyssa Jones
mean,  know Alyssa Jones, you know what 'm saying
Me and Rick Derris used to hang our with her for awhile, right
Just hanging around her house after school, 'cuz her parents were like never home, and shit
And one day, Rick just whips it out, and starts rubbing it on her leg and shit; chasing her around the living room -  was dying
But you know what the crazy bitch did
She fucking drops to her knees, and just starts sucking him off right in front of me
Like  wasn't even there man
almost died
But that's not the fucked up part - the fucked up part was Rick, man - right in the middle of it, he turns to me and he's pointing at her and he says "Cohee
" Just like that - "Cohee
"  So 'm like 'll give it a shot
And  start pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz figure any second she's gonna turn around and belt me in the mouth, right
But yo, check this shit out - she's all into it man
She don't try to stop me or nothing
She's all wet and shit, and  just went to work, know what 'm saying
Me and Rick are going to town on this crazy bitch, and she's just loving it, all moaning and shit
It was fucked up
So Rick's the one that came up with the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had us locked in tight from both sides - like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger cuffs
- Holden stares at Banky
He's full of shit
Cohee's a lot of things, but an exxagerator he's not
The dude's Catholic
She's never even been with a guy
That's what she says
But  say her on her hands and knees getting filled out like an application constitutes 'being with a guy'
He's pulling your chain
And the fact that you even bought it for a second makes you look like an idiot
'm getting your back, asshole
People don't forget shit like 'Finger Cuffs'
And if it got out that she's queer as well, how do you think it's going to make you look
give a shit what people think
Alright, forget about that; what if she's carrying a disease
That was just one story - what if there's more
(grabs his coat) You're such a fucking asshole
What
Oh, it's not possible that she's all crudded up
Cohee  can vouch for as clean - the dude never got laid in high school
But Derris is an arch fucking bush-man
Name me one chick in our senior class that Rick Derris didn't nail, for Christ's sake
Would you let this go
'm telling you - she's never even been with a guy, let alone those two zeroes
And 'm telling you, the bitch could be a bigger fucking germ farm than that monkey in 'Outbreak'
Holden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall
Give it a rest
Do you hear me
'm tired of this shit
She's my goddamn girlfriend, do you understand
Show her a little fucking respect
And if you ever even so much as mention that Alyssa looks a little peaked from now on, 'll put your fucking teeth down your throat
He releases Banky
Banky brushes himself off
Maybe 'll put your fucking teeth down your throat
(walking out) Not bloody Likely
Banky runs to the open door
(calling after him) 've been working out you know
(no response) You better be ready to make that - deal
The downstairs door slams
Banky makes a muscle, then feels it
- Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs
Where's that bitch partner of your's been
Sulking
He's having a real problem with this Alyssa thing
think it's more like Banky's having a problem with all things not hetero right about now
And 'm just another paradigm of said aberration
Banky does not hate gays, you know that
But  do think he is a bit homophobic
And this latest episode between you and Ms
Thing has tapped into that
In his warped perception, he lost you to the dark side - which is she
You make it sound like me and him were dating
Don't kid yourself - that boy loves you in a way that he's not ready to deal with
(beat) He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa
And just what has Mister Angela Lansbury uncovered about your lady fair
He heard some bullshit story that she took on two guys
Really
Well then he's barking up the wrong we if he wants to split you up, isn't he
He's not going to make you see the error of your ways by pointing out how truly gay she's not (holds up a disc) This one
Have it
(beat) Actually, it's kind of gotten to me
How so
Banky's not known for believing misinformation
He's got a pretty good bullshit detector
So, what if it is true
Would that bother you
Sex with multiple partners
Hooper lets our a faux-shock shriek
At the same time
Again, even louder, hands slapped against his cheeks
Thanks for being so comforting
So what do you care
Well that's the thing, isn't it shouldn't
but it gets to me
Kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't think she's been in the middle of an all - girl group-grope
You see - that doesn't bother me
But the thought of her and guys
Uh
Oh Holden,  beg you - please don't drop fifty stories in my opinion of you by falling prey to that latest of trendy beasts
Which is
Lesbian chic
It's oh-so acceptable to be a gay girl nowadays
People think it's cute, because they've got this fool picture in their heads about lipstick lesbians - like they all resemble Alyssa - while most of them look more like you
Do  detect a little inter-subculture cattiness
Gay or straight - ugly's still ugly
And most of those boys are scary
thought fags were all supposed to be super-supportive of one another
Screw that 'all for one' shit gotta deal with being the minority in the minority of the minority, and nobody's supporting my ass
While the whole of society is fawning over girls- on-girls, here  sit - a reviled gay man, and to top that off,  'm a gay black man - notoriously the most swishy of the bunch
Three strikes
Hey, hey
There's a line
young   approaches Hooper, holding a comic book
Are you Hooper
(in militant mode) -salaam Alaikum, little brother
Could you sign my comic
(signing comic; nods to Holden) See that guy there
He's the devil, you understand
Never take your eye off the Man
Our people took their eyes off him one time, and he had us in chains in two shakes of his snake's tail
The Kid offers Holden an angry look
Hooper gives him back his comic
Fight the power, little ''
Word is bond The Kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice
Look at what  have to resort to for professional respect
What is it about gay men that terrifies the rest of the world
(shakes his head) As for this hang-up with Alyssa's past, maybe what's really bothering you is that your fragile fantasy might not be true
What do you mean
Holden - don't even try to come off like you don't know what 'm saying
Men need to believe that they're Marco fucking Polo when it comes to sex - like they're the only ones who've ever explored new territory
And it's hard not to let them believe it
let my boys run with it for awhile - feed them some of that "'ve never done this before
" bullshit, and let 'em labor under the delusion that they rockin' my world, until  can't stand them anymore
Then  hit 'em with the truth
It's a sick game
The world would be a better place if people would just accept that there's nothing new under the sun, and everything you can do with a person has probably been done long before you got there
can accept that
Honey, that almost sounded convincing
Do yourself a favor - just ask her about her past, point blank
Get it out of the way, before it gets too big for both ya'll to move
(spotting something ) Oooh
'Myra Breckinridge'
Hooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his hands
Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely clad, making out
The title is 'Men Suck
and so do Girls - All  Action
' - On the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and back, checking galore
In the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches the game with a large degree of enjoyment
Sitting beside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm
Since most of these people are rooting for the home team, 'm going to cheer for the visitors
'm a big visitors fan - especially the kind that make coffee for you in the morning before they go
(smiles at Holden; no response) That was a joke
little wacky wordplay
What do you mean, 'visitors'
Was  being too obscure
The kind that - until recently - had no dicks and would spend the night
So that was until recently
Oh, yeah
(shouting; to ice) Hey - foul
Foul
He was traveling or something
So nobody bur me has stayed the night at your place since we got together
(beat) Something on your mind, Holden
No,  was just wondering, If 've been 'faithful' or something
Look,  was just asking
(toucher his face) Oh, sweetie
only have eyes for you
(to ice) , (to Holden) told you  was great at sporting events
Imagine what a bitch  could be if  knew what was going on
- Things heat up between two opposing
One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off
The other Player gives chase
Alyssa's very into the game
Holden shakes his head That'd make Banky half right
About what
He said all the girls from North were bitches and sluts
Really
'm sorry - you two left high school behind how many years ago
(grabs his face and kisses his cheek) Can  put some of my books in your locker
(goes back to watching game) (under his breath) How about your yearbook
- The Player giving chase slashes the Player with the puck
Alyssa jumps to her feet
(to ice) ' ' (to guy next to her) Right
What's with 'Finger Cuffs'
(sitting back down) 'Finger Cuffs'
Yeah
In your senior yearbook your nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'
What is that
It was
Shit, damned if  can remember
'd look it up, but  threw all that shit our years ago
(beat) Where'd you see a North yearbook
Do you know Rick Derris
- The Players skid into the corner where Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard
Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his gloves
The crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild
Rick
Sure
We used to hang out in high school
(to ice) , Did you go out with him or something
(eyes on the ice) Date Rick Derris
No
We just hung out a lot
Just
you and him
No
Me, Rick, and
um
what was that guy's name
Cohee
Yeah
Cohee Lundin
God,  haven't thought about that name in years
- The Players square off
Player Two pulls Player One's helmet off and punches him in the face
Holden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his companion
Alyssa's into the game
remember those guys'd come over almost everyday after school
They'd bug my sisters, look for porno tapes in my dad's closet, raid our fridge
They really took advantage of my parents never being home
- Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and gut punches him
Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's anger, so enthralled with the action is she
(starts laughing) This one day
Rick pulled out his dick and chased me around the house with it
Right in front of Cohee couldn't believe it
Guys are weird - thought the whole size hang-up made you all terrified to show your dicks to each other
- Player One staggers a bit, then quickly rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a barrage of his own punches
Blood sprays across the ice
Holden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking
Alyssa's still in the game
Rick pulled his dick out
Really
What'd you do
(looks him dead in the eye) blew him while Cohee fucked me
- Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming his fist into Player Two's nose
The blood shoots out like a geyser, and Two goes down hard
Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted
The crowd around them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in their midst, shocked
Alyssa fumes
Excuse me
That's what you wanted to hear, isn't it
Isn't that what this little cross- examination of your's is about
Well try not to be so obvious about it next time, there are subtler ways of badgering a witness
(to Bystander) Am  right
(to Holden) Jeez, even  knew what you were getting at
(gathering her stuff) If you wanted some background information on me, all you had to do was ask - 'd have gladly volunteered it
You didn't have to play Hercules fucking Poirot
She storms away
Holden chases after her
The Bystander watches them go
(to companion) told you these were good seats
/    - Alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat
Holden catches up to her
We track with them our into the parking lot
So it's true
Yes Holden
In fact, everything you heard or dug up on me was probably true
Yeah,  took on two guys at once
You want to hear some gems you might not have unearthed -  took a twenty six year old guy to my senior prom, and then left halfway through to have sex with him and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo
And the girl who got caught in the shower with Miss Moffit, the gym teacher
That was me
Or how about in college, when  let Shannon Hamilton videotape us having sex - only to find out the next day that he broadcast it on the campus cable station
They're all true - those and so many more
Didn't you know
'm the queen of urban legend
How the hell could you do those things
Easily
Some of it  did out of stupidity, some of it  did out of what  thought was love, but - good or bad - they were my choices, and 'm not making apologies for them now - not to you or anyone
And how dare you try to lay a guilt trip on me about it - in public, no less
Who the fuck do you think you are, you judgemental prick
How am  supposed to feel about all of this
How are you supposed to feel about it
Feel what ever the fuck you want about it
The only thing that really matters is how you feel about me
don't know how  feel about you now
Why
Because  had some sex
Some sex
Yes, Holden - that's all it was: some sex
Most of it stupid high school sex, for Christ's sake
Like you never had sex in high school
There's a world of fucking difference between typical high school sex and two guys at once
They fucking used you
used them
You don't think would've let it happen if  hadn't wanted it to, do you
was an experimental girl, for Christ's sake
Maybe you knew early on that your track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but unlike you  wasn't given a fucking map at birth, so  tried it all
That is until we - that's you and  - got together, and suddenly,  was sated
Can't you take some fucking comfort in that
You turned out to be all  was ever looking for - the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle
(tries to calm down) Look 'm sorry  let you believe that you were the only guy 'd ever been with
should've been more honest
But it seemed to make you feel special in a way that me telling you over and over again how incredible you are would never get across
She touches his face
He pulls back
She stares at him, hurt and pissed
Do you mean to tell me that - while you have zero problem with me sleeping with half the women in New York City - you have some sort of half-assed, mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent antics, that took place almost ten years ago
What the fuck is your problem
Holden's eyes are downcast
Alyssa waits for a response
want us to be something that we can't
And what's that
(beat) normal couple
Holden skulks off
Alyssa stares after him, and then starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally slumping to the ground
She cries
- Holden sits on the couch, alone in the dark
The door opens and Banky enters
He stands there, sizing up Holden's mood
The girl
Holden nods
Banky nods back
He stands there for a beat
Then he sits beside Holden
He opens his arms
Holden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying on his shoulder
Banky pats his back
Pull back on a man in pain and the comfort of a friend
- Holden sits alone at a booth
He stirs his iced tea
Yo, look at this morose mother fucker here
Holden looks up
and   stand above him
Smells like somebody shit in his cereal
Holden offers a half-smile
The pair slide into the booth
What took you so long
We were at the mall
You bring the salad
Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it to Jay
Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills, along with the latest issue of ' and
' Man, this likeness rights shit is more profitable than selling smoke
How'd a dirt merchant like you ever learn about likeness rights
(hands envelope to Silent Bob) We deal to a lot of lawyers
Speaking of which
(pulls out a dime bag) Little signing bonus and shit
'll pass
Take a look at the issue
Silent Bob thumbs through the comic
Jay looks over his shoulder, as he begins rolling a joint
Yeah
When you gonna get some pussy in that book, man
Throw some super- villain in with big fucking tits that shoot milk or something, and  just drink her dry, bust some moves on her
(demonstrates) and then she has to fuck me
(Silent Bob hits him) Fuck us
'll see what  can do
joins them
What can  get you
Nothing, thanks
Yo Flo - tell Mel to whip me up a toasted bagel and cream cheese
(to Silent Bob) You want one too
(Silent Bob nods) Make that two
And kiss my grits
Noonch
(the Waitress leaves; to Holden) 'jever watch 'Alice'
That show's good as hell
(continues rolling) So why the long face, Horse
Banky on the rag
When is he not
No - 'm just having some girl trouble
Bitch pressing charges
get that a lot
No
'm just at a point where  don't know what to do
Kick her to the curb
Girls get to be too much trouble, there's always the 'band of the hand'
Can't do it, g
'm in love
Ah, there ain't no such thing
You gotta boil it all down to the essentials
It's like Cube says - life ain't nothing but bitches and money
Just what  needed - advice from the 'hood Who is this girl
don't think you know her
Come on man - 'm people who know people
You sound like Barbra Streisand
That's 'cause  got this tubby bitch playing her greatest hits tape in my ear all the time
You should see him: she starts singing 'You Don't Bring Me Flowers', this faggot starts crying like a little girl with a skinned knee and shit
It's embarrassing
got the only muscle in the world with a weakness for ballads
(to Silent Bob) You big fucking softie
(to Holden) So what's this skirt's name
'm telling you, you don't know her
ain't playing
Tell me her name, Mysterio
Alyssa Jones
Finger Cuffs
Holden rubs his eyes
You're dating Finger Cuffs
Wait a minute  thought she was all gay and shit
She is
Or was
don't know
The Waitress returns with the order
And you go out with her
Shit, man - you're a lucky dog
She bring other chicks to bed with you, get a little of that filet o' fish sammich going on
The Waitress stares wide-eyed and offended at Jay
(off the Waitress' look) Yeah - you know what 'm talking about, baby
(Waitress  leaves;  to Holden) So - four tits, or what
It's not like that
Well what's it like then
Right now
(beat) don't know
love her
But she has a past 'll say
Stuffin' two guys, eating chicks out
Yo -  heard one time, she had this dog
Eat your fucking bagel already
(to Silent Bob) Look at this touchy mother fucker right here
(to Holden) So, if you're all in love with her, what's the problem
The problem is shit like that
It was one thing when it was just girls - that was weird enough
But now you throw guys into the mix - two guys at once, no less
All that experience
What am  supposed to think
You think good; because now she'll be all true blue and shit
The girl's tasted life, yo
Now she's settlin' for your boring, funny-book-makin' ass
Settling
That's comforting, Jay
Thanks
That's what 'm here for
'm lust having a problem with all of it  can't get it out of my head these visuals of her doing all this shit
And  don't know why  can't let it go
Because 'm crazy about her, you know
look at this girl,  see the future
see kids
see grand- kids
You're scaring me
'm scaring myself
Because  think so much of her,  and then  can't get over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'
(shakes his head) don't know what 'm doing
Holden looks out the window
Jay continues to roll his joint
There's silence
Then
You're chasing Amy
Holden's head snaps forward
He stares, wide-eyed at Silent Bob
What
what did you say
You're chasing Amy
Holden stares, shocked
He looks to Jay, who's still rolling his joint
What do you look so shocked for
He does this all the time
Fat bastard thinks just because he never says anything, that it'll have some huge impact when he does open his fucking mouth
Why don't you shut up
Jesus
Always yap, yap, yapping all the time
Give me a fucking headache
(to Holden) went through something like what you're going through
Years ago
Same kind of thing with a girl named Amy
When
couple of years ago
What'd she 'Live in Canada' or something
Why don't  remember this
What you don't know about me  can just about squeeze into the Grand fucking Canyon
Did you know  always wanted to be a dancer in Vegas
Jay and Holden look at him
Silent Bob busts a move with his hands
Hunhh
Bet you didn't know that
Just cell your fucking story so we can get out of here and smoke this
(to Holden) So there's me an Amy, and we're all inseparable, right
Just big time in love
And then about four months in, ask about the ex-boyfriend
Dumb move,  know, but you know how it is - you don't really want to know, but you just have to
stupid guy bullshit
Anyway she starts telling me all about him - how they dated for years, lived together, her mother likes me better, blah, blah, blah - and 'm okay
But then she tells me that a couple times, he brought other people to bed with them - menage a tois,  believe it's called
Now this just blows my mind
mean, 'm not used to that sort of thing, right
was raised Catholic
Saint Shithead
Silent Bob backhands him
Jay raises his fist as if to strike
Do something
(to Holden) So  get weirded out, and just start blasting her, right
This is the only way  can deal with it - by calling her a slut, and telling her that she was used -  mean, 'm out for blood want to hurt her - because  don't know how to deal with what 'm feeling
And 'm like "What the fuck is wrong with you
"  and she's telling me that it was that time, in that place, and she didn't do anything wrong, so she's not gonna apologize
So  tell her it's over, and  walk
Fucking a
No, idiot
It was a mistake wasn't disgusted with her,  was afraid
At that moment,  felt small - like 'd lacked experience, like 'd never be on her level or never be enough for her or something
And what  didn't get was that she didn't care
She wasn't looking for that guy anymore
She was looking for me
But by the time  realized this, it was too late, you know
She'd moved on, and all  had to show for it was some foolish pride, which then gave way to regret
She was the girl, know that now
But  pushed her away
Everyone's silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette
So 've spent every day since then chasing Amy
(takes a drag from his smoke) So to speak
They sit there for a beat
Jay pockets the rest of his dime-bag
Enough of this fucking melodrama
My advice - forget her, dude
There's one woman in the world
One woman, with many faces
(to Silent Bob) Get up, bitch (to Holden) We gotta book
We're catching a bus to Chi-town
What's there
Business, yo
How many more of those phat envelopes do we got coming to us
don't know
don't know if the book's going to be around much longer
Yeah
Good
'll be glad as shit when it's gone
Are you kidding me
There's millions of people out there that'd love to see themselves in a comic book
know
spend every fucking waking hour with one of them
But it ain't like us at all - all slapsticky and shit - running around like dicks, saying
What's that shit you got me saying
Snootchie-bootchies
'Snootchie-bootchies'
Who talks like that
That's baby-talk
(slaps his hand) It's a big world, g - but we're bound to run into you again
Until then - keep your unit on you
'll try
Do, or do not - there is no ay
(slaps him) Knock it off
Get your fat ass moving - we got a bus to catch
(under his breath) Jedi-bitch
Exit Jay and Silent Bob
Holden remains in the booth, thinking
- 1) Holden sits at his drawing table, tapping his pencil up and down
2)Alyssa sits in a club, getting talked at by some women
She's not present in the conversation
3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes the contracts at him, and Banky makes the " know, know," face
4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him
5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone
She hangs up, angrily
6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked through
He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture
He closes the book and sighs
Then, an idea hits him
He jumps up and dashes out of the park
- Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch
Holden paces in front of them
know you're wondering why  asked you both here tonight, at the same time, knowing that we have shit to settle between us, separately
just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone by telling her to fuck off with me here so you didn't have to go through the story again later on
Fuck you
Not even if you let me videotape it
Enough
(they both look at him) 've been going through things, over and over
And  dissected it all, and looked at it a thousand different ways
Banky - there's friction between us for the first time in our lives
You hate me dating Alyssa and you want me to sign off on this - thing
How perceptive
Alyssa - you and  hit a wall, because don't know how to deal with
your past,  guess
That's a nice way of putting it
'd have said the whole double-stuff thing
(right in his face) 'm only going to say it once: shut up
(back to pacing) Now -  know 'm to blame one way or the other on both accounts
With you, Alyssa - it's my fault because  feel inadequate
Because you've had so much experience, had such a big life; and my life's been pretty small in comparison
That doesn't matter to me
Please
have to get through this
(beat) And with you Banky -  know why you're having such a hard time with Alyssa, and it's something that's been obvious forever, but  guess  just didn't acknowledge it
(takes a deep breath) You're in love with me
(makes a face; beat) What
You're attracted to me
Just as, in a way, 'm attracted to you
mean, it makes sense - we've been together so long, we have so much in common
(getting up) Well, 've got to get home and catch the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5', so 'll be
Holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts
Banky - wide-eyed and speechless - looks away
It's something you're going to have to deal with
Bank
You may very well be gay, which explains your homophobia and why you're so jealous of Alyssa, and your sense of humor as well
Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection coward dick jokes
Bank
Stop
Deal with it
You'll feel much better
He grabs a chair from the side of the room
Now - at this point, you may be asking yourself the question that 've been going over and over in my head for the last few days: what does one have to do with the other
Alyssa's face drops
She subtly shakes her head
(under her breath) Don't
And when  did some serious soul- searching, it came at me from out of nowhere, and suddenly it all made sense - a calm came over me
know what we have to do
And then you - Bank, you Alyssa, and  - all of us
can finally be
alright
(again, under her breath) Please don't say it
(sits in the chair; takes a long beat) We've all got to have sex together
The room is silent
Holden Lights a cigarette
Banky's eyes nearly bug
Alyssa's  head drops
Don't you see
That would take care of everything
Alyssa -  wouldn't feel inadequate or too conservative anymore
'll have done something on par with all the experience you've had
And it'll be with you, which'll make it that much more powerful
And Banky - you can cake that leap that everyone else but you sees that you should take
And it'll be okay, because it'll be with me - your best friend for years
We've been everything to each other but intimates
And now, we'll have been through that together too
And it won't have to be a total leap for you, because a woman will be involved
And when it's over, all that aggression you feel toward Alyssa will be gone
Because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman love
It'll be cathartic
true communion
We have to do this
For me, for both of you
for all of our sakes
This will keep us together
(beat) What do you say
Banky stares forward, wide-eyed
He leans back into the couch and lets out a huge sigh
Then shrugs
Sure
Holden smiles at his friend
Then he looks at Alyssa
You know  need this
You know it'll help
Alyssa looks at him, sadly
No
Holden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief
No
thought you'd be into this
You did
What does that say about me
But you've
you've done
stuff
like this
This should be no big deal for you
You don't want this
(lights her cigarette) You really don't want this
Trust me
need this
This has to happen
Why can't you see that
And how can you not
What does that say about me
You can take it from two guys whose names you can barely remember, but ask you to share an experience like it - where it's about intimacy - and you say no
(inhales from her cigarette, takes a beat) can't
Holden moves to her side of the couch
You can
'll be there
And when it's over, we'll be the strongest we've ever been because we got through some nasty shit together
And we'll finally be on the same level together
And then there'll be nothing we can't accomplish
tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and touches his face
Oh Holden
(trying to compose herself) That time is over for me
've been there
've done it
And  didn't find what  was looking for in any of it
found that in you - in us
Doing this won't help you forget about the things you're hung up on
It'll create more
No it won't
thought about all of that
No, it will
Maybe you'll see me differently from then on - maybe you'll despise me for going along with it, once you're in the moment
Maybe 'll moan differently and then you'll resent Banky, and become suspicious of us
Or you'll alienate him because of it, and then grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship
Or what if-  sincerely doubt it, but what if -  saw something in Banky that  never saw before, and fell in love with him and left you
've been down roads like this before; many times
know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons and give you experience
But 've had those experiences on my own
can't accompany you on your's
'm past that now
(touches his face; stares to cry) Or maybe  just love you too much
And  feel hurt and let down that you'd want to share me with anyone
Because  never wanted to share you (holds it in; gets up) Regardless  can't be a part of this
(beat) Or you
Not anymore (hugs him) love you
always will
Know that
She releases him, then slaps him
But 'm not your fucking whore
Alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and down
He's your's again
She walks our of the studio
The door closes behind her
Banky and Holden stand there, silently
Cut to black
- It's   later
We're at another show, not unlike the one from the opening
copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame
The cover reads 'The Death Chronic', complete with a corresponding drawing
Blast from the past
Banky sits at his own signing table
Behind him hangs a banner that reads '  -  Of  '
small line is formed in front of him
He talks with a Do you know how much it's going for these days
One ten
You signing it will push that up even higher, If you sell it,  want a kickback (starts signing) don't know if this is true, but heard once that there was going to be an animated series
There was going to be What happened
(off comic) You're looking at it
No Chronic - no cartoon That sucks man
That would've been awesome
Tell me about it Is that what happened to you and Holden McNeil
You got into a fight over the rights or something
It was a little more involved than that
Whatever happened to him
He quit the biz
guess
You guys don't talk anymore
(looks ) No
Not really
Banky locks eyes with someone
His expression softens
Holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room
He smiles at Banky
Banky smiles back, and sort of nods
Holden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic
He points to it and gives a thumbs up
Probably shouldn't have killed off Chronic
Banky smiles to
Guess not
Some doors just shouldn't be opened
Banky looks in another direction,
He looks at Holden and points to it
Holden looks in the same direction, and then looks back at Banky and nods
You don't need that guy, anyway
You do great stuff without him
Banky looks at Holden for a beat
Then he brings his pointer fingers together,  mimicing Holden's 'shared moment' gesture
Holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if to say 'hopefully'
You were just carrying that guy, anyway
Banky sort of smiles at the  Holden
Then he offers his own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'
(to fan, still looking ) You're so right
Holden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off
Well, keep up the good work, man
Love them dick jokes
Love 'em
See ya
The Fan Leaves, but Banky is watching Holden go
Yeah
Bye
(shakes it off) Okay
Who's next
Alyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in front of her
behind her
Alyssa dashes off signatures in the copies of her comic
(to  departing fan) Thanks for reading it
The Woman stands and rubs her shoulders
'm going to get a soda
You want anything
'm fine, thanks, The Woman heads off
Alyssa starts rummaging through her bag
(not rooking up) Okay, who's next
comic book drops on the table in front of her
It's a comic book called 'Chasing Amy'
She leafs through it, not looking up
Um
This isn't one of mine
It's mine
Alyssa looks up sharply
Holden stands before her, smiling
saved you one
Hi
Hi
(beat) How've you been
Good
Really good
Yourself
Good (beat; off her own comic) New issue's selling like crazy, for some reason
Because it's so good
really liked it
Thank you
(off comic) haven't even seen this yet
Did it just come out
month ago
did a really small run
Self-financed
Only about five hundred issues
Will  enjoy it
You might
It's familiar subject matter
Alyssa leafs through it
Her eyes get somewhat misty
Looks Like a very personal story
finally had something personal to say
They look at each other for a beat 'm going to go
don't want to hold up the line
Yeah
mean, it can get ugly just saw this nun in line call this small child a cunt-rag
(smiles) Read that, when you have a minute will
'd like to hear your thoughts about it
If you get a chance, give me a call
Okay
They look at each other for a beat
Nice seeing you again, Really nice to see you too
He walks away
few steps away, he turns and waves again
She waves back
And then he starts moving through the thrall of fan-boys
The Woman returns with coffee
She follows Alyssa's gaze
who was that
Hmm
Oh
Just some guy  knew
She watches him go for another beat, then
(to line) Next (to Woman) So what do you want to do tonight
And as they fall into conversation, the show goes on
