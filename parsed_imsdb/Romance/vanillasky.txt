Written by Cameron Crowe Shooting Script We hear a whooshing sound, getting louder
New York City from a perspective of flight, not an airplane, a swooping diving shot
Back to black
' Abre los ojos
open your eyes
open your eyes
'  - ,
, 32, swings out of bed and sits on the corner of his mattress
it's a chilly New York City morning
Early sunlight glows around the corner's of his curtains
' open your eyes
He reaches behind him to shut off a slim voice-activated clock-radio
He rises, a comforter draped around his shoulders, and heads to the bathroom
'  - David regards himself in the mirror of a beautifully-tiled and well-appointed bathroom
in his thirties now, his looks have only deepened and improved
He brushes his teeth
He spots a gray hair, and holding tweezers, seizes and plucks it
'  - David puts on a shirt
Checks his wallet for money
His bedroom is elegant and spare
'     - He slips down the stairs into the expansive living area of this deeply-textured apartment
stunning, inherited book collection lines the walls
/
/ - David starts up his dark green sports car, and roars onto the New York City streets
u- David travels the side-streets to work
He senses a growing weirdness
The streets are empty
He looks at
his watch
It's        8:12
He continues anxiously
Runs a red light
Music rises
-- The most recognized piece of real-estate in the world is silent
It is as if the world's biggest parade has just left, taking everybody with it
David pulls over haphazardly
He exits the car, leaving it in the middle of the street
He begins to walk, faster now, as music rises
All the electricity is on
There is absolutely nobody in sight
David begins to run, searching for humanity
The billboards - electronic and still - all sell easy solutions to his loneliness
He pulls up short
, stopping and crying out in anguish
There is no one left in the world
' Open your eyes
open your eyes, David
: - David hangs out of bed, his mouth in an open silent scream
Covers his face with both hands
' open your eyes
He reaches behind to shut off the same clock-radio, and its voice
He makes a relieved agonized sound into the pillow
Gets up, sees a pizza box
a container of soup
a remote control on the floor
We hear an incisive voice with a comforting lilt - a man we'll meet later
' Well,  suppose the empty street meant loneliness
' You're a shrink
You've got to do better than that
' 'm a doctor
Let's not stereotype each other
Not all rich kids are soul-less, and not all psychologists care about dreams
The question is how you got here, and why you've been charged
' What do you want to know
was about to turn 33
ran three magazines, and a world-wide publishing house
On most days actually fooled myself into believing it would last forever
- David checks himself in the mirror
Seizes and plucks that same gray hair
' Isn't that what being young is about
Believing secretly that you would be the one person, in the history of man, who would live forever
- David enters, reaching for his wallet, repeating the morning ritual
figure stirs in the bed behind him
She leans upward, wearing David's college basketball tank for a pajama-top
She's warm and wicked, a mildly reformed party girl, the kind of girl first-novels are written about
She is  ,25
Where you going so early
(slightly self-conscious) Hey, don't record any more messages on my alarm--clock, okay
Why not
'll think we're married or something
Don't you ever say that word
Or 'll never come over here and bring you chicken soup and fuck your brains out again
(
) (exiting, from other room) How's your cold
Still there
How's yours
(
) guess you took my mind off it
She pulls a pink pill-box purse from the nightstand, withdraws a multi-colored phone
Reyna, it's Julianna
missed my audition
(dramatic, like Bette Davis) lost my head
Listen,  have to go
(whispers) 'm with David
- David in his steel-and-linoleum bachelor kitchen
Julie swings into view
Her blouse is unbuttoned two buttons too many, down to mid-chest
She gives him a kiss on the cheek and lingers
David grabs a racquetball bag, talks to the next
room
Help yourself to whatever you want
Set the alarm, Maria will clean up
Lock up when you go
And
you are the greatest
Bye "honey
" Bye "honey
" 'll call you later
When
When
Soon
They have a comfortable, healthy, mutually satisfying, gloriously superficial relationship
/
/ - David is about to enter the green sports car, then thinks better of it
He fires up a knock-around beater car from his collection
He drives into the street which is, comfortingly, now full of people
We hear
's "All The Right Friends
" - - David drives the crowded streets
It all seems more poignant today
Life is good again
'  - David pulls up to a lower-end apartment, checks his watch
Enter the hung-over  ,        30ish
In a world of acquaintances, Brian is a true friend
He has all the qualities of Abe Lincoln and, much to his chagrin, the looks too
He hops in the car with racquetball bag
Did you reserve the court
Easy
can't handle heavy conversation at this ungodly hour
'm sorry to do this early gotta be done by 10
Car phone rings
David checks Caller  - it's his office
He clicks on
() You're not going to make the 8:45, are you
How did you find me
' David Aames, you have to check the colors of the letters for the new issue of Rise
What are the colors
' Yellow-and-red
or the traditional white
Let, me think about it
' David, please
Don't be late for the ten o'clock with the board
Okay, but
don't tell anybody where am  don't care if God calls
'm very busy
Can't you just get rid of that board
The Seven Dwarves
No
Those people drive you nuts
And that was the desire of my father, who hired them
(suspicious pause) You fucked Julie Gianni again, didn't you
David takes off driving
-  - know someone was there when called
You had that tone
(imitates nasal phone voice) Oh, no man, 've got a cold
'm hanging in tonight
(shaky defense) had a cold
was alone
Fine
You can do whatever you want with your life - Thanks
-- but one day you'll know what love truly is
It's the sour and the sweet
And  know sour which allows me to appreciate the sweet
Julie Gi
anni is a friend
Sometimes we sleep together
Brian howls in pain, like a hurt dog
What -- My dream girl
Julie Gianni
is your
fuck buddy
Brian emits another pained howl
David reaches over to change the music
What do you want to listen to
Slow down, man
What have we got here - Barcelona, Looper
Radiohead
Brian freezes at what he sees
Look out
Look out
David turns and sees he's hurtling into the back of a car stopped just in front of him
Clenching he hits the brakes, narrowly avoiding a high-speech collision
And then
to his right
another car comes hurtling toward him
and stops within an inch of deadly impact
There is an awful moment, as the second car blares on the horn
Traffic continues, but the lingering feeling of dread and confusion is still in the air
Fuck
(annoyed) We almost died
know
My own death was right there in front of me, and you know what happened
Your life flashed before my eyes
How was it
Almost worth dying for
Pedestrians continue walking around the honking tangled mass of the near-
accident
- David meets Peter Brown and , his second assistant, at
the front of the well-appointed headquarters of Aames Publications
Aames hops out of car and heads into the building
- David Aames Jr
turns down the corridor of Rise Magazine, a male youth-culture-style magazine
Rachel gives him daily tabloid reports, continues with the essentials
The art department needs a decision on the colors
Yellow- and- red, or white
And the board is pissed you're late
You changed your hair
David taps on the window of the art department, in panic over several cover mock-ups
He gives a presidential thumbs-up, moves on
They look at each other, trying to decipher if the thumbs-up was a decision
Did he mean the yellow-and-red or the white
David passes a holdover from the old days, older Receptionist       () who speaks uncomfortably and gruffly into a headset
She gives David a knowing look - late again
They're all waiting for you
And David - opinions are expected
' Do you dream about the Board, David
The Seven Dwarves, as you call them
David walks into the office
Framed original photos from album covers co-mingle with a splash of cultured art and books
Seven very-interested and very-alert looking Older Executives wait
(

) Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy, Happy, Doc, Dopey, and of course, Grumpy
(skeptical) How was Aspen
(playful, mock drama) Good
Now  want answers, and want them now
(pause) How's it going
He gestures charmingly, easily, and bows with apology over his lateness
All are happy to see him
Sort of
' They still look at me like  was still eleven years old
David at          11, blithely skateboarding the hallways
He passes Beatrice, who turns to an editor
He's going to inherit everything
He gets it all
if -      ( # 1) The light from a small line of chicken-wired windows cuts through the blackness
In the shadows of this dank room, we hear his voice but we do not see him
It is the smaller, slightly muffled tone of David Aames
In the shadows, he wears a mask
You're scared of your dreams, aren't you
10 Portrait of  McCABE, 52
Doctor of Psychiatry, prison division
He's far too wily to spend the currency of his brilliance just yet
It's too early in their relationship
He stands tall, leaning on a steel desk, polishing his glasses with end of his coat
It's a nightmare either way
Is that how do you explain what's happened to you
What -- What happened to your face
'm not talking to you anymore
And you don't want to show me your face
No
Do you know why you're here
(sarcastic) The conversation, the coffee -- David - the part where we parry and joust, and get to know each other bit-by-bit
we're going to have to skip it
You've been charged with murder
In four weeks, a judge will determine your fate based on what  write
You will talk to me -- There is no murder
It didn't happen
don't have to talk to anybody
Contentious Prison Guard () swings his feet down and gets up from watching a 17-inch television on a stool
He exits into the bigger room to quiet down David Aames
11 Slight push in to show the television show he is watching, and we see a snippet of "To Kill  Mockingbird
" You want me to help - Get the fuck away from me
Take it easy, sunshine
Get the fuck away from me
Take it easy, Face
Your whole story is full of holes
With great power, McCabe advances on the guard
His presence, when he turns on the switches, is considerable
Stop
Please leave
Right now
'll take responsibility
(whispering, exiting) 'm gonna get you, Daddy's boy little freak
My parents are dead, you fuck
Enough
The Contentious Guard leaves
Is it true
(sing-song) Good cop
bad cop
That you're a Daddy's boy
(in darkness, by rote) Primer on David Aames, Senior
My father was not built for the 21st Century
He never ate at 12 McDonald's, not once, and never watched television
Yet his biggest magazine is still Digest
He and my mother threw the grandest parties of the literary world
He ballooned, jumped from planes, sought adventure
His autobiography is the manual for every cutthroat publisher in New York
It's called Defending the Kingdom
've read it
Page  127
"David Junior was a delight as a child
" Did  miss something here
Is that all he wrote about you
don't think he ever got over the fact that  was terrified of heights
And when he and my mother were run over by a drunken teenager on New Year's Eve, ten years ago
David Aames moves closer to the light
We see a strange bland expression of his mask, at first other--worldly
and then more clearly
he left the keys to the Kingdom to me
51% control,   49% going to a group of seven board members who all thought they were first in line
And you believe the Board, the Seven Dwarves, put you here to take control of your company
What do you care
We're just talking
And tonight's Wednesday night, and  go to Black Angus for dinner with my daughters on Wednesday nights, so 'll have to leave soon
You understand that our time is limited, don't you
13 If  talk, you'll just think 'm crazy
McCabe gathers his things
With all the respect  can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories, David, trust me - you've crossed that bridge
Fine
Enjoy your dinner
Somehow the lilt in McCabe's voice draws him closer
There are five basic emotions in life
Tell me
what emotion gripped
him
before he entered that cell
Was it Guilt
Shadows
There is no answer, just a rustling and a growing sense of anticipation in the darkness
Hate
Shame
Shadows
Still no answer
Revenge
McCabe now shows the invisible skill with which he has brought his client to the precipice
And now, with one word, he invites David Aames to look over
Love
In the darkness, a rustling and the slight turn of a head
'm completely on the wrong track, aren't
: 14 ' /    - From the darkened back room, David Aames appears with ice, and re-enters his party
Who needs ice
Aames moves swirls is more like it - through into his party, which is nicely underway
Upscale
Modern
Part literary crowd
Part fashion crowd
He's great in a crowd
Surrounded by people, David Aames comes alive
catching the attention of a model
() David
Happy Birthday
Jesus, you have the greatest taste in shoes 've ever seen
Bar none
Anywhere
Woman Caterer in Whites    () slips by with a knowing smile
The old place sure looks more crowded with people in it
Emma, do you know Lynette
No, but  shudder to think what
we might have in common
David notices that Brian Shelby has arrived with a guest, a Woman who struggles with a package and a very large coat
On first glance, she's just another girl
On second glance, she's a killer
He notes her oddly funny behavior
She removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural beauty
She is  , a 27 year-old city girl with a barely containable life-force
Enter  , David's male assistant with surreptitious headset
He gestures to a stereo appliance set up in David's living room
The Living Stereo system is online and looking great
it's an 15 amazing prototype
They'd love an article on it if you like it
David nods, still focused on Sofia
Suddenly, he finds he can't take his eyes off her
and happy birthday, sir
as David arrives to greet Brian and his guest
Hey man
Happy birthday and all the usual shit people say to each other
How you doing
Livin' the dream, baby
Livin' the dream
The two friends hug
David shares a quick glance with Brian's date, who still burdened with coat
(to Sofia, as in 'meet the notorious
') Meet David Aames
(can't help but flirt) And to what do  owe this pleasure, the pleasure of -- (playful) -- the pleasure of Sofia
Serrano
We met today at the library, if you can believe that -- 'm sorry about my coat
It's too big for your closet
- we were both pretending to be intellectuals
No no,  think it's amazing love your coat
16 overdressed
mean underdressed
'll just continue like you're both actually listening to me
(to David) Do you have another room to put it in
(invisible, re: their chemistry) have ceased to exist
Well, Madison Square Garden is nearby, it might fit there
(shoves David playfully, as in touche) Happy Birthday
Her upbeat physicality is intoxicating
Sofia hands David her present
We picked it out together
Neither look at Brian
Brian takes a breath
He's been here before
Thank you
We picked it out together
We
Welcome
Stop flirting and open it
Okay
Let's get a drink
17 Okay
'll leave this upstairs
David exits
They are left to consider his personal charisma
An odd and disarmingly beautiful display of Coltrane performing "My Favorite Things" in David's living room
Sofia passes a hand through Coltrane's image, admires it
David is approached by  , a Brit, and an Associate board-member at Aames Publications
Tipp is ten years older than David, and he is the rarest of birds sentimental lawyer
And at the moment he's a bit drunk
Hey Tommy
David moves to address him so he can still track Sofia
Hey
Listen to me
Don't blow me off
'm all packed, 'm going back to London and  understand
You put me up for that other attorney's job, so you didn't have to fire me
classy move, and your father would have done the same --- It's okay, Tommy -- became incompetent
Is there anything more unbecoming than an aging mascot
cared about your father
lived and breathed for him
But these guys, the board, they think you're stupid corporate hazard, a rogue
But the word "stupid" is what David heard loudest of all
Nearby, we see a Woman Partner          (one of the Seven Dwarves) taking a quick look at David
18 But they're going to find a way to get you out
They're lined up for your office - David scans the room
Beneath the good cheer, he sees the other layer
Lying
Disloyalty
All part of the institution he enjoys forgetting exists
Each word bashes his soul
-- your job
Your life
Your position
They are working day and night
to cheat you out of your 51% vote
And they are going to sell this tradition, this tradition of words, so they can eat at a better cafeteria
And what they don't know is this - (gestures grandly to books that surround them) - people will read again
David's gaze falls upon Sofia, who is looking directly at him
And for one blinding moment, something passes between them
She looks away
He feels saved
(interrupting with finality) got it
They even have a nickname for you behind your back
David smiles faintly
Understandingly
Tipp kisses him on the cheek, boldly and drunkenly
He feels like a hero to himself
Citizen Dildo
David flinches, just a little
Now you've got great instincts
But  say this with complete love
Claim your life
Learn to be an Asshole
Don't be         - 19 (extracting himself) Two's enough - Don ' t be- (immediately) Okay
Forgive me
still believe in this family
Even if it's only you
David continues tracking Sofia as he slips over to Peter Brown
Get Tipp out of here, drive him home, and in the morning tell him he's re-hired with a 50% raise
Set up a meeting with the other attorneys
'm going to be in early tomorrow -- (a look from Peter Brown) -- earlier than usual
'  - David enters, shuts the door and sets Sofia's present down
party dress is on his bed
Hello handsome
He turns to see Julie Gianni in the bathroom doorway, wrapped in a comforter
've come to wish you happy birthday
didn't invite you, Julie
Yeah, that was a little weird - But that's how it works with parties
You have to be invited
'm mad at you, you dick
We made love four times the other night
20 Is that good
Two is good
Three is very good
But four - (fishing for a compliment) Four is pretty good
No, four is
four is
just hold me
Four is what
Hold me, and then 'll leave, and you can go talk to that cute brunette
Four is what
don't want to meet your fancy friends
knew 'em all back when was fancy too
He holds her
They talk in between friendly kisses
Four is what
She pulls away, and talks plainly to him
She looks like a moth, David
moth
Sometimes  worry about one of these clever girls in a big silly coat who'll play you in just the right way, and 'll lose my friend
And there'll be no more chicken soup parties for you and me
21 She kisses him again
David very gently, and skillfully resists
She gets the message
When will you call me
And don't say soon
hate it when you say "soon
" -- Sofia eyes a framed smashed guitar handsomely mounted in a glass display case
So this is what's become of rock and roll
smashed guitar behind a glass case displayed on some rich guy's wall
It was a gift, actually
She turns and sees it's David, engaging smile in place
She jumps slightly
(apologetic) like it
She turns and walks away, David following close behind
Whoa, whoa, whoa
- how did you get all this stuff, this apartment, this life - David is looking just over her shoulder
She turns to see an almost disturbingly large portrait of David Aames, Sr
She turns back
see
How about if you help me
Unless 'm horning in here
You are, but the food's good
22 (playful, like a spy) See, 've got a little problem
've got a stalker
It doesn't
sound life-threatening
Someone passes, bumping her slightly, into him
need a cover
need for you to pretend we're having a scintillating conversation
And you're wildly entertained
know it's tough
'll improvise    - She's right across the room and she's burning a hole in my back right now, isn't she
Red dress, strappy shoes
Yes_ (beat, jarred) -- wow, she's really staring at you
Shit
And she seems to be growing
less happy
Hmm
think she's the saddest girl to ever hold a martini
Julie Gianni sits on the steps watching
The girl, and the dress, looked much happier in the bedroom
Julie rises and begins to move
23 Brian holds a drink, attempts to crash a conversation between two models
His debonair act is shaky
-- David and Sofia race up the stairs
Bad kids having fun
You have another apartment
Sort of a day office
Come on - They arrive at the door to a smaller upstairs apartment
'm not going in there
Well  am
Goodnight
He enters and shuts the door
Frustrated, she stands for    a moment, listening to the music streaming from the downstairs apartment
We watch her private moment as she decides to leave him, turns, feels the emotional pull, dances back and knocks sharply three times
hear her coming
(0
5
) Really
No
David pulls her inside
Shuts the door behind them
- Julianna and Brian, both looking for David, discover each other
/ - Artwork on the walls
Sofia is drawn to a powerful Monet
and it is not a copy
We're safe
And 've got nothing to drink
24 Who did these paintings
This is Joni Mitchell
This one is Monet
And this one is done by me
(as a tour guide) It is a snowboard
Well, two of them are geniuses
(laughs) (off the Monet) It's the real thing
His paintbrush painted that vanilla sky
His canvas
It
was my mother's
- Julianna and Brian hold their private conversation by a piano
They are bonded, almost mesmerized by their mutual fascination for David
'   -- David and Sofia laugh
You know what  think
You're either a very good actress or you really do sort of like me
am an actress
There's probably not too much you aren't great at
Are you about to compliment, my phone voice
It's pretty good, you know - Oh, 'd only disappoint, you
See - 'm not
qualified
can spell
25 'm surprised you're available
'm surprised you're surprised
can't keep this banter going
Me neither
Beat
They drop the act
powerful, awkward moment
and the door opens
caught you
Brian
Come in here
What's going on -- Your friends are fun and 'm drunk
(cheerful) Julie Gianni is stalking me
She looked dangerous
Nobody stalks me
So  drink
Well, we're out of drinks up here
Here, finish my Jack and Coke
He messily tries to hand his drink to David, but spills it embarrassingly
All his cool is gone, and what's left are his friends covering for him, cleaning up
These stupid glasses        - No, it's the stupid guy holding it
26 (embarrassed) Don't worry
'll get
us all something
Jacks and Cokes
She exits, leaving the two friends
better hit it
drank too much and  didn't fucking eat
Don't be stupid
The party's just starting
(moving away) For you it is
You can't go
You're my guest of honor
Fuck you, David
You're paying me to write my novel, so you own me
don't own you
You're brilliant, you're good-looking, you're handsome
But why'd you have to hit on Sofia
No one's hitting on Sofia
Fine
Whatever you say
'm crazy, 'm blind
No, you're not blind
You're just drinking Jack Daniels
And when you drink Jack, you start
in with that Frank Sinatra, "She Shot
Me Down," gimme a cigarette, King of Sad thing
That
do
Gimme a cigarette
27 'll find one
But wait
You're rich and women love you and 'm from Ohio and 'm drunk
Can  tell you the truth
Everyone does
dig her
And 've never said this to you before, about any girl
But she could be
could be could be could be
the girl of my fuckin dreams
You're not from Ohio
know
But if she fucks tip our friendship - she can go to hell
won't allow it
We are bros
feel the same way
(wishes he believed it) Sure you do
Brianprepares to leave, as Sofia returns with   drinks
Where you going
am Frank
And Frank must go
Huh
good you bid evening
Sofialooks at her watch, and the situation
Hang on, 'll go with you
28 Stay, baby
'll give you a lift home later
No,  have to work tomorrow
You're in great
hands
(beat, realizing it's over) 'm just humoring myself that my opinion matters
Brian looks at the two of them
Life is telling him, and he knows it's time to go
Portrait of a man who will not get what
he wants
David notes the poetry in his friend
(leans in close to David) You will never know the exquisite pain of the guy who goes home alone
Because without
the bitter, baby, the sweet ain't as sweet
Have a good time
He exits like a champ, a glorious sad-sack, with a hand flourish
The Sweet and Sour speech again
Julie Gianni dances, her eyes closed, her hand around a strange man's neck
'  __ They stand nervously out in front of her apartment
In the distance, rain
lot of people are scared of heights
It's not the heights that bother me, it's the impact that terrifies me
(off her look) won't stay long
She laughs
It was never his decision to make
29 - She switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl apartment
life is lived here, a bed on the back-room floor, a bag of trash on the counter, lamp is askew
She makes no attempt to clean it up
He soaks in the details, including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and shelves
Hey Paulo
large goofy dog comes running at her, and then proceeds to slather David with love too
'm glad he protects you
This is a lethal canine
(from other room) love living here
And  refuse to clean up
No problem
've got to work around the clock to keep this place
David eases the dog away as he examines the oddly exquisite dolls
He grabs a look at her in the other room
bit of leg between boot and skirt
As he admires the dolls: So you're really a dancer, huh
For     14     years
But  don't dance like you dance
She laughs to herself, steals a look at him
Turns away
- Do you want something to drink
Sure
David looks at her refrigerator
note reads: Call Dad
An odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos 30 that represent a hard-working, hard-earned, committed and passionate life
Shot moves across the photos
young girl living a young girl's hard-working and happy life
Group photos of co- workers
few from a vacation
whole new cast of characters, all committed, and they all look inviting to him
And one gloriously random photo of her in Cabo San Lucas, raising a toast with friends
like your life
Well, it's mine and you can't have it
David examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of a sloshed Sofia, a guy's arm reaching for her breast
Dedication reads: To Sergio
Marry me
do not want to know the story behind this photo
Who's Sergio
It's a nickname
Your nickname is Sergio
It's a long story, and we don't know each other
So many secrets
That's because 'm really an arms dealer
've never known an arms dealer
You do now
What about you
What's your nickname
David freezes
And then decides what the hell - to tell the truth
Citizen Dildo
31 You're not staying over
(still stung over nickname) Never run a company
Stay an artist
Stay an arms dealer
Oh please
Somehow,  can't play the violin for you
(beat) Although
It must be hard controlling all those people's lives
Everyone at that party is connected to you for survival in some way, it seems
David looks at her, mentally assessing her level of guile
Ever been married
No
Ever accept any of your 12,000 proposals
(playful, self- deprecating) 12,008
No
And you moved to New York
To dance and paint and act and deal arms
Right
(going through CDs) Do you want to hear Jeff Buckley
or Vikki Carr
Jeff Buckley
or Vikki Carr
Both - simultaneously
He continues looking
Flashes of the photos on her refrigerator
Everyone said "don't go to New York
" But  just think good 32 things will happen if you're a good person with a good attitude
Doncha think
He regards her
He's a little restless, and a lot enchanted
Is she for real
You think 'm naive
He decides she's for real
He turns back to the photos on her fridge
No
really don't

You keep the relationship casual until the absolute breaking point
And then, one night, or afternoon, or morning
it could be months from now
oh, you know how it works - 33 His vision moves across the bright blue sky of one of Sofia's photos
single crimson cloud
-,          -- / # 2 David sits with the mask, facing McCabe
McCabe is hanging on every word
- actually no  don't
've been married for twenty-two years
Ah, you've got dinner with your daughters
That's right
do
Back then  had intricate systems with women you wouldn't believe
Like
what
Hey Doc
Don't get all melancholy over the thirty seconds you were single a long time ago
That's what you think 'm doing
Yes
Well, you may have a point
Let's continue
Time is not our friend
' /  - Aaron watches David, a 17-inch television on a stool to his right
Again, strangely, it is "To Kill  Mockingbird" that he's watching
We hear audio from the movie through the glass
David with artist's notebook in hand
Across the table, Sofia holds the other notebook
34 Just our shortcomings
That's all we're allowed to draw
(confidently) 've never drawn such a true likeness before
Mine's finished
Already
Hang on
Okay - done
Sofia offers her drawing
It's a caricature of a good- looking guy surrounded by money, cars and very thin girls
He snatches it, studies it, and what he sees hurts him in surprising ways
(embarrassed laugh) Jesus
That's how you see me
Maybe  didn't add enough money -- No
It's wonderful
It's something you'd see on the wall of a steak-house in hell, but it's wonderful
Sign it
Sofia's face falls a bit
She sees she's hurt him
She takes the drawing and signs it, a little guilty
Let's see yours
No
She grabs it
Its a rich portrait, filled with detail, humor and style
She is rocked by its elegance
Wow
feel bad
(regarding it carefully) You said to draw a caricature
know
couldn't
saw you like that
35 Well, it's very good
'll sell it to you
You monster
How much for
One kiss
She smiles
Something is developing between them
That smile is gonna be the end of me
(serious) And what happens when your friend calls you tomorrow
He only met you a few hours before me
He would do the same
see that friendship is important to you
It is
But as his best friend, also know that he's trying to finish a novel about inadequacy and rejection
So the longer stay, the better it is for his career
Sofia smiles, shakes her head
And yawns
Your career is one 'd worry about
David looks down
She's hit a nerve
'm sorry - No, no
You're more right then you even know
used to be one of those guys who was just 36 snowboarding through his life, with no focus whatsoever
When did you change
(pause, confesses) About five minutes ago
(direct, slightly whimsical) Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
David shakes his head a little
Her words strike right to the heart of him
: '  -  - Sofia is asleep on the sofa
Clothes still on
David gently strokes her hair
Television in b
g
It's one of those late-night infomercials, and it's ridiculously compelling
The perfect thing to bond over on a great, lingering date
And to those who think that you're a charlatan
understand
The perception of a head frozen somewhere waiting for reanimation - it sounds like science fiction
What are you watching
It's the greatest show
it's called "Sofia
" Sofia looks at him and smiles
They look back to the television
charming looking older-man discusses eternal life with a television interviewer

v
) 've seen this thirty times
We did a story on this guy
He owns half of Arizona
Is he a fraud
How would you ever know
Good point
Can you unfreeze a human life
Take the case of Benny the dog
Benny is a dog who was frozen for three months, and thawed out to live a normal life
Oh, well that's comforting
It's safe for Benny
'm in
David moves closer to her
We better watch out
They regard each other, and David gets up off the sofa
It's true
The promise is too great to not savor it, and walk away for now
Thrill remains in the air
Where are you going
left my number on your fridge
He makes a courtly bow and turns
She feels the loss of his company
Come here,  want to tell you a secret
He pauses a moment, and turns
In this instant, a fleeting instant, it's the oddest thing
He can see their entire 38 life together
He returns to her
Tentatively, she grabs a quick sweet kiss on his mouth
He stays for an extra moment, kissing just her upper lip, leaving no doubt as to the potential of their future
And then
very close she says: meant that to be your forehead
David stands
He looks around the small apartment
Thank you for the inspiration will now attempt to run my company, showing compassion for the seething throng of my partners who root quietly for me to fail
She looks at him, quite aware of his personal and business crossroads
Silently, she roots for him like crazy
For things you don't even know - thank you
'm going to go to work
have a company to run
Pleasure delayer
He is still somewhat stunned by the evening, and the girl
He actually wants to run his company
'  - David slips out onto the street
It's shabbier than the alluring night-time version
He'd never notice, or care
because David is a man with a brand new buzz
The city is his
Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable
Life feels like a great pop song
Behind him, a car with its lights still on starts and advances alongside
Behind the wheel is Julianna Gianni
David Aames
David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head
Julie Gianni
You're following me
only a little
wanted to finish what we were talking about
39 And _- How'd it work out with our Moth Girl
Did she turn into a butterfly for you
Yes she did
But  can see from your walk that you didn't sleep with her
David turns
Let me see if  can guess
You haven't slept with her because
it's more fun when you can draw it out
Sex just isn't as good if the woman hasn't told all her friends she'd never sleep with you
You're right on the money, Julie
She must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long
Hey, Julie
Sorry
You're just never there for your friends until they've already given up on you
'm not blowing you off
just want to be alone for a little bit
Trust me -  have a lot of things gotta take care of
If we're friends, which we are, you'll understand
(simple, honest) 'm sorry  got weird
missed an audition and  just felt bad 40 you didn't invite me to your party
It zings him
David turns, considers her
Do you want to make it up to me
won't tell a soul
Slowly, he is drawn to her
His old self rallies one last time
He gets in the car
'  -- The streets are empty
She plays a  of a romantic sweet pop track with a feeble vocal
Would you do a story about me if made a
Sure  would - Do you like my music
(winning, truthful) It's vivid
If  weren't me,  would buy a by me
Well, you know, if you can reach one person
Julianna is a little hurt, hides it well
What is happiness to you, David
(considering) what is happiness
For me, this is happiness
Being with you
David doesn't look at her
She speeds up, slowly
41 One thing bothers me
Why did you tell Brian  was your fuck-buddy
didn't tell him that
didn't say that
When did you stop caring
(watching the road) About what -- About the consequences of the promises you made
Promises         -  thought we had an understanding
Do you know how hard it is to pretend to be your "buddy
" love you, David
You fucked me four times in one night
You have been inside me and  have swallowed your come
That means something
Julie
Four times, David
That means something
Four times
He grabs at the wheel
She won't let go, and speeds up
stop the car
She picks at things on the dashboard, as she talks with a manic energy
Twenty-four hours a day  live with the aching possibility that you might call me to do something
42 (caring, almost
pleading) Take me to your house
We'll talk this out
want to see where you live
want you to stop the car, Julie
want you to stop the car
Don't you know, David
Every time you sleep with someone
your body makes a promise whether you do or not
who turns slowly to face her
All he sees are haunted blue eyes
He knows at the very least, there will be a crash
She guns the accelerator
He is paralyzed, unable to alter his fate
Tell me something, David
Do you believe in God
Sweet pop music swells
She bursts the barrier of the winding road, and the car sails into an embankment of a road below
All sound disappears, as we hear a new kind of music
Ethereal, almost wondrous
This music continues
-    -  - David walks the hall of trees
It's the gentle seductive whoosh of a new day, the way the world sounds when you're in love
Vibrant
Alive
Ironically rich in the beauty we all take for granted when we're not in love
He looks impossibly drawn forward to Sofia, who stands waiting to meet him
Hello
He steals a kiss
They both feel like they're getting away with something
You're amazing
Hello
Did you get to work alright
43 Yeah, well, actually
had a horrible dream
You dreamed you'd never see me again
left your house
went to the car, and my friend the stalker had been following me
Julie
Yes
She followed me down the street
She wanted to talk, and had that buzz
from you and me, and  think my mind was on that terrible drawing of me
and, you know,  got inside
And she drove me off a bridge and committed suicide with me in the car
thought you were going straight to work
But  survive
survive with my arm and my face reconstructed
And what's worse  couldn't wake up

And maybe you should let people see you

47 - Sofia Serrano walks down a New York street in sensible shoes
Just another part of the working force
To our unseen follower, she is most beautiful when unaware she's being watched
Shot continues parallel to her
She stops, sees someone she knows
truck with several panes of glass passes by and stops in traffic
Her image blurs behind the glass, but visible to us in the window is David Acmes
His healing face is dotted with stubble
He wears a wool hat
He looks noble, an assembled victim, a modern miracle
He looks like many things
But he no longer looks like David Aames
The truck moves through frame
- dashing-looking surgeon dripping with confidence,
, talks with David
The cranial structure was based on thirty pins fastened by small panels and bits of bone from the mandible
and it seems the cartilage grafts have maintained your cheek structure
Unfortunately, because you were in a coma, immediate plastic surgery was impossible

) Doctors
Their power is in jargon
So you study up
Is that the procedure for all Bilateral Periorbital Hematomas in a LeFort  fracture of a comatose patient
(pleasantly surprised) In a LeFort    - absolutely
The potential for sub-cranial brain damage was too great
(

) you do your best
David consults a list he's made
And beyond the cheek grafts, Dr
Pomeranz is, are the pins fastened 48 with any kind of aluminum which could ionize and cause that pressure in my head
Because 'm ready for another operation
three other doctors in the room listening
Yes, we are working on processes
But it
you're specifically not at the stage where we can experiment -- Experiment
Use me
The headaches will go away - These are more than headaches
This is like a steel plate slicing through my every thought
We're not cowboys
We can't, just wing it
Because  can't think straight most of the time
We can increase your medication
Yes
Medication
And there are things we'll continue to investigate
But there are so many others who've not been able to benefit aesthetically from plastic surgery as you have -- This isn't about vanity, Dr
Pomeranz
(keeping rage bottled) This isn't about vanity
This is about functioning in the world
49 It is my job to be out there functioning
've got the money, and 'll pay any amount
Invent something
Play jazz
You say you're the best face man in New York City
Fucking prove it
We could do something about your arm -- Fuck my arm
Dr
Pomeranz looks over to a young assistant
Nobody here takes your feelings for granted
We did prepare something for you, based on the preliminary examination
Tell me
Bring it on
It's sometimes useful in the early stages of rejection
It's a facial prosthetic
It was two weeks in the making
The assistant opens a black-leather bound box
In it is the mask - molded from David's own face, locked into a pleasant, bland expression
facial prosthetic
The aesthetic replacement does work
Emotionally, and actually
(helpfully) And the plastic in the aesthetic shield also filters out abusive rays, and assists in the regeneration of cells
So it's an aesthetic regenerative shield
50 That's correct
Exactly
And the ergonomics of the plate- barrier allows it to reflexively interact with the movements of your own face
see -- It's a helpful unit
Good
Because for a minute there thought we were talking about a fucking mask
(beat) It's only a mask if you treat it that way
No it's great
This completely takes care of Halloween
But what about the other 364         days of the year

And on December 5th
my planes filled the sky
the return of David Aames, Jr
Citizen Dildo
- Sofia dances at the end of a long day
few others leave for the day, trying not to stare at David
Sofia is there alone
For a moment, we share her solitude
She practices ballet, twisting and turning and landing in frame, looking just past camera
She freezes
She catches sight of David, undisguised
And she begins dancing again
Harder
Does she even recognize him
He moves closer, attempting an easy-going persona
We hear nothing but the sound of his heart pounding, in odd counter-rhythm to her dancing
Finally she stops
You won't believe this
but this is me smiling
She laughs a little at his strange new humor, keeps a brave front
It's been a long time
tried to see you but your people wouldn't let me
didn't want to see me, okay
But then  woke up today and finally, a good hair day
David fights anxiety, smoothes his coat
53 You want to go out, you want to do something
(convincing herself) Sure
What
Let's go out and do something
This weekend
'll cancel an operation or two
We'll have fun
Because  am all about fun
She kisses his cheek, pulls back quickly, and as she exits
he sees her fighting tears
- David's mirror is restored
He studies himself
Raises his arm higher than he has been able to
In the next room we hear Conan 'Brien welcoming: (
) please welcome, Benny the Dog
- David watches Conan
The Owner of Benny sits with Benny himself
He wears a t-shirt reading:
Benny is not the most excitable dog in town
In fact, he seems rather spacey
(
) have so many questions
To start off, tell us all just what has happened to Benny
What's Benny been through
/ Benny fell into the water near our home, and was frozen in the Skykomish River
And  went fishing, thinking he'd gone three months earlier', and there he was in a block of ice, and
David grabs the phone, and dials a number
54 (off the dog's complacency) He is thawed out, right
Laughter on the t
v
Riding the buzz of what he's watching, David dials
Hey listen, it's David
'm back in your life
saw you earlier tonight
was just watching our old friend Benny the Dog on
on Conan
and  thought of you
(laughs) Whatever
loved seeing you today
So 'll see you soon
You're a great dancer
He hangs up and feels instantly mortified
He looks at the phone in his hand
- David moves into the thick of a high-energy neighborhood dance club
He wears a facial prosthetic
In the darkness, he doesn't stick out, not much
He spots Sofia and Brian, chatting, waiting for him
The sight of the two together recalls happier times
Sofia is dressed down
Brian, on the other hand, has never looked better
His clothes are nicer
He wears them with confidence
David has practiced an opening joke, clapping his hands together
He will be trying too hard, all night long
They regard him in the mask
(a little too big) Hi
(equally big) Hey
What are you drinking
Nothing
55 am in the mood for cheap sugary overpriced rum-and-cokes
You want one
(spreads arms) Is there any other kind
'll go get us some         - Where's the bathroom
Behind
over by the place next to the door by the chick mean, girl who looks like Bjork
She leaves
David turns to Brian immediately
You look good, man
How's your book
Take it off
can't
It's a facial shield
It's an antiseptic prosthesis to stop infections
These fucking doctors
(with all love) Take off the mask
It's freaking me out
can't
It's my face
This is my face
Oh no
Trust me
It's a little different
Hey, if you're embarrassed, just go
Nobody asked you to chaperone 56 Sofia asked me
She didn't want to be alone with me
(Brian regrets his words) That's bullshit
Because  think 'm being pretty fucking cool about the whole thing
Talk to a shrink
Or you can call me sometime, instead of hiding in your apartment
Don't take it out on a girl you only met once
(stung) Did she say that
met her "once
" Did she say  met her "once
" Brian looks away
He's said too much
Cut it out
miss the old you
We all miss the old you
Because the new guy is shit
David turns away
The perfectly wrong thing to say
Oh
Man
Wait
That came out wrong
love you - period
How's your arm, man
David shakes his head, moves toward the bar
Fuck you, Brian
How about no more sympathy
How about if that's the deal we make with each other
Okay
David shakes him off, goes to the bar, and rips off his mask
His head thuds from a migraine
Gimme a Budweiser and a shot of tequila
57 (avoiding eye contact) What kind of tequila
What did you say to me
(leans closer, still looking down) said - What
Kind
Of
Tequila
Why don't you ask me to my face, bitch
The barman looks up, expressionless
Patron
If you have it
- watching Sofia and Brian from a distance, talking as friends
Another shot, another Bud
He throws bills on the bar
No
This is on the house
Why - (odd compassion) It just is
Bitch
David looks across the club to see Sofia
Clubgoer Guy whispers something in her ear
She shakes it off
He pounds down another shot at the bar, this time with the Barman
Patron
David regards a video monitor behind the bar
Someone's camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another good-looking Young Man
She playfully shoves the good- looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David 58 over lo those many nights ago at her apartment
He pounds back another drink
- Weaving at the urinal, David pees
Squeezes his temples to ward off a headache
# 1 Dude, fix your face
The Clubgoers laugh
David laughs too
Suddenly, he feels better
- David moves through the crowd, powered by a new sense of belonging
The music swirls, and takes him along with it
He dances wildly
In the strobing darkness, he is anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one
David takes the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards
In profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions
David sees his moment
Sofia is alone near the corner of the club
He approaches her
Hello again
Hello again
Idea
Let's start all over
He regards her for a moment, sees her apprehension and discomfort
How about if you help me
Unless 'm horning in here - (beat, does her) You are
But the food is good
He continues, taking a step
See, 've got a little problem
've got a stalker
(does her) It doesn't sound life-threatening
(does himself, self- deprecating) need a cover
need for you to pretend we're having a 59 scintillating conversation and you're wildly entertained
know it's tough
(does her, with head nod) 'll improvise
(a touch playful) don't talk like that
She's right across the room and she's burning a hole in my back right now, isn't she
Red dress, strappy shoes
That's right
Their heads are close together, looking off into the club
David doesn't notice that Sofia is having a hard time playing along with this game
She is overwhelmed, holding it in
David continues
think she' s the saddest girl to ever hold a martini
(about to burst) David -- Are you okay
No
What's wrong
Is it me
'll tell you later
Come on
Tell me now
Something's wrong
Tell me everything
Let's talk about it right now
60 'll tell you in another life
when we are both cats
David looks at her
His eyes flash at her choice of words
Perhaps there is hope
Sofia stares at
him, worried about his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn of a phrase
Push into close-ups as they struggle to deal with the discomfort of this moment
don't believe you just said that
That
is the best thing 've ever heard
That is hilarious
God, that just killed me
The way you said that
See - that's what love about you
"'ll tell you in another life when we are both cats
" - David, Brian and Sofia walk swiftly down the street in silence
David weaves
They are anxious to pretend it was a wonderful evening
Well, this is where  leave you
Wait
'll walk you to your door
No,  live just around the corner
've got my bike here
'd rather walk
Don't be a drag
Can't you see she wants to go on her own
Shut up, you're drunk
may be an idiot, but 'm not drunk
61 Seriously,  don't need you to walk me home
Thank you
Okay then
So
We'll call you
(unconvincing) Great
We'll go catch a movie or something
So
We'll meet up soon
The word sounds a lot like goodbye and they both know it
We'll meet up soon
Sofia turns and runs away
(lacking all pride) We'll call you again to go out with me
We'll call you
David and Brian walk on
Brian turns back to see Sofia running to the corner
Well, it's been a real blast, David
bid you good evening
Where you going
My bike
It's back over there
We'll hang soon
Bring your mask if you want
'm getting used to it
Wait a minute
(stops) What
62 (shrugs) don't know
You drank a little too much
Call me tomorrow if you want
Tomorrow 'll wish  was dead
(starts in Sofia's direction) No you won't
You just need to sleep
Hey
(Brian's itching to go) What
What did you say to Julie Gianni the night of the accident
What
You told her she was a "fuck buddy
" Never
And she was a little more than pissed about it
(a little guilty) Have you been harboring this shit all along
never talked to her
Whatever
mean - who am , if can't
be the one who tells you you're not ugly
Aw, give me a courtesy laugh
Come on
Brian shakes his head, starts running
63 Brian
'm so fucked up
'm just so fucked up
Brian stops one last time, irritated, at the far end of the street
We're best friends
We're bros
Brian needs to rid himself of David
He turns and runs in the direction of Sofia
David feels the deep pangs of rejection
Breathing hard
His head hurts
His body hurts
Come on, man, we're bros
Beat
He sprints down the middle of the street after Brian
/'  - David runs frantically, heartbroken and sobbing
Brian catches up to Sofia
She turns, relieved
They kiss messily, hungrily
Her shoes arch to reach his height
David runs the streets, nearing her home
The images are tearing his mind apart
He stops and leans against a car, unsteady and nauseous
Holding his head in pain, he manages to run further
David stops on the street outside her apartment
His sobs overwhelm him
He drops to the pavement
He passes out, mouth agape
The empty street visible in the b
g
, his hand loosens its grip on the mask
' Open your eyes
open your eyes
'  -- David is passed out, the mask is still clutched in his hand
Butterfly crosses frame
hand enters, resting on his shoulder
64 ' This is a cheap ploy for sympathy
David wakes up and looks into the kind face of Julie Gianni
Boo
He recoils
His vision sharpens
In the morning shadows, with increasing focus, we see that it is actually Sofia
No, 'm okay - Sofia examines him with a look of concern and understanding
Everything takes on a clear and sharp focus
Behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky
And it worked
Get up
Ugh - (helping him up) That's right
agree
Ugh
This is a joke
(touches his cheek) David
'm not going to lie to you
liked the way you looked
But if you don't pull it together, 'll forget the other guy
You know that
other guy -
(groggy) 'm still that guy
'm still that guy
Sofia speaks with rapid-fire conviction, as if she might change her mind if she thought about it too much
don't
have a mother-savior bone in my body
It's not about that
You're coming inside
But if this 65 turns out to be a big mistake, do have the ability to fall out of love with you - (snaps fingers) - like that
She helps him up
am still that guy
Shut up

) We created our own world together
Us vs
Them - Where's Brian
He went with you, didn't he
(shaking head at his own paranoia) thought you guys hooked up
She stops in profile with him
She's astonished at his jealousy
Then: (raw truth) wish you hadn't gotten in the car with that girl
(a long apology is coming) Sofia
'm
She covers his mouth, nose and face
Only his eyes remain
Your eyes apologized better
Come on
Portrait of the two, her leading him to the door, the crisp glycerine morning overhead

) - and we were quite a pair
Her believing in me
Me believing that  deserved it
We hear the sound of voices, human voices howling like dogs
- Prison
Human voices, howling like dogs
-- David is led down the hallway to his appointment, past many door's with thick windows and howling prisoners
Aaron pulls him along
They arrive at the Psychiatric Unit
McCabe is visible, standing, deep in thought through the door
-  -      ( # 3) McCabe holds his drawings, standing
David is seated
see you haven't been wasting your time
Do you ever draw anything else
All the drawings are of Sofia, drawn in a similar fashion
David is a little jumpy, a little amped
He moves to the window
The yard is filled with prisoners
No
Did you sleep last night
No
did not sleep
've got to leave early today, so you'll have to be brief
Now
What can you tell me about the name "Ellie
" Ellie
Is that a girl you knew
girl you were in love with
've only been in love once
Apparently, you kept repeating it last night
You did sleep, David, and your advisor said you cried out, you had a nightmare
Everything is a nightmare -- You cried out for "Ellie," David
Do you remember what happened
No
no
Dig deep, David
Dig deep
You cried out for Ellie
What do you remember about Ellie
Show me your face, David
Help me
Open the door
David rises and goes to the prison window
McCABE In powerful framing, lower shot capturing him powerfully
(digging deeper', aching to help) It's true you had an accident
It's true you were disfigured, but not anymore
Do you remember
(with certainty) They did fix your face
Take off that mask, David
You'll see your face is perfect under there
never trusted the Doctors
What happened next was surreal
That same arrogant bastard, Dr
68 Pomeranz, called me and suddenly he was my new best friend
friendly with outstretched hand, standing in front of x- rays (warmly) David
Hey, my brother
felt
really bad about our last conversation
He'd discovered a new form of reconstructive surgery, with the help of a doctor from Berlin
who bows to camera
Hello
- The next thing  knew they shot me full of drugs 'd never heard of and away we went
-a David is wheeled down the hallway on a stretcher
He is high on tranquilizers, singing "One of Us
" The doctors are all smiles
() what if Gawd was one of ussssss
" (

) The odds, they said, were one in three that the headaches could be reduced by 50% and facial tissue could be regenerated
69 - David is strapped onto a plank headed for a metallic capsule
We hear odd noises and see high--tech details of the operation
Laser beams criss-cross his face
Shot moves to the video playback of the operation with this legend beneath: Capture
An assistant doctor captures Polaroid frames

) couldn't tell you what they did
It seemed like science fiction to me

) He's going to be one good-looking guy when 'm done
Polaroid still of David in mid-operation rolls out of the print-machine

) Obviously,  was suspicious
Wouldn't you be
-  -    ( # 3) David and McCabe both sit against the wall
McCabe listens intently
Suspicious of whom
Of what
Once you've been driven off a bridge at 80 miles an hour, somehow you don't invite happiness in without a full body search
Well, at the risk of boring you, can present the alternate argument
once knew a guy who was a real loner
And one day he woke up at 40, with two daughters who lit his life up with purpose
Suddenly he goes to endless school plays, he gets home at       9:20                  for the evening discussion, and he has the time of his life
His favorite Beatle was once John, and now it's Paul
70 always liked
George
It all depends on the individual, doesn't it
Tell me
What's happiness for you
'  -  - What's happiness to you, David
-  - How about another question - Well, you won't show me your face
So back to the time-line
Hurry
Let's move through this
'  - There is tension in the air
David's face is covered in high-tech facial plates
He sits at a table near the window
Sofia stands
You've got to take the plates off, David
don't want to know what's under here
It's going to be fine, you'll see
already called Pomeranz and switched it to Wednesday
hope that shrew at the front desk gave you shit about it
'll go in the morning
The car'll be fixed
She advances, takes his face in her hands
She tugs at the corner of one of the plates
71 Good, because  know that the problem wouldn't be you delaying something you were dreading
Couldn't be that
Nooooo, it couldn't be that
She pulls off one of the plates
mean,  agree, it's very important to have
She pulls off another one of the plates
She grows a bit emotional
the right car
She pulls off another one of the plates
Tearing slightly
to take you where you want to go
24   hours a day
Quadrant by quadrant, his face is restored to a pale- skinned and tender
perfection
How bad is it
Well, your ears are in the right place
And the rest of it is
not too bad at all
Tenderly she kisses, and hugs him
'  -- Sofia and David make love, looking into each other's eyes
Do you love me
mean, really love me
because if you don't, 'll just
have to kill you
In my next life  want to come back as this mole - 72 (points out mole between her breasts) - seriously, this mole
mean, you'll have to wear bikini tops to work, or loose-fitting shirts so can breathe, but - love you
love you
love you
-  could live right there
Is this a dream
Oh absolutely
She grabs his face, kisses him
a powerful moment, like few others in this life
- Portrait of the couple together, moving down the middle of the street on fresh snow
(
0
) We talked about the big things, the little things, and the big things
But in truth, with Sofia, it was the in-between times
'    - Sofia laughs
perfect laugh
David admires her, sits next to her, holding her hand
Theirs is the unmistakable closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual relationship
They share a giddy open secret
Across the table, we reveal Brian
He's got a tiny high-tech camera
Sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to David in Spanish
David replies knowingly - "si"           - every few words
It's a deep communication
She exits
What, did she say
(in love) have no idea
Brian shakes his head
73 How's things, Brian
Fine
David's face is huge in the Brian's viewfinder
How's things, Brian
Don't flatter yourself
'm fine
Besides - Sofia is great, but by no means one-of--a-kind
She was a proximity infatuation
Brian, naturally suspicious and somewhat jealous,             spots  a writer at a nearby table making notes
(to writer) And don't use that, it's mine
The writer looks busted
Where'd you get the camera
'm into things
you have no idea
Well, as long as you're okay
And anyway, we're friends, aren't we
Always
David offers his hand
They shake
' David's gaze moves to a 40 year-old man staring at him with a bemused smile
plate of food sits in front of him
His eyes suggest a piercing intellect, he looks at David with deep familiarity
David can't quite place the face
74 Hey what's up with your face
Fuck, there's a seam opening or something
(mounting horror) What - what are you talking about
Brian laughs
The spell is broken
Friends again
You asshole
'  - David sleeps next to Sofia
He sits up, takes a glass of water from the night-stand, admires his girlfriend and moves to the bathroom
/ - He turns on the light, fills the glass with water
Looks up into the restored mirror
His face is disfigured
He recoils in terror, knocking against a towel rack, sinking to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the lower cabinet
Sofia bolts upright
She sees him on the floor across the room, sees his face and backs up in the bed, leaning on her arm, screaming
'  - He awakens suddenly
Sofia is next to him, smiling
Was  snoring
(still breathing heavily) No,  think it was me
Thirsty, that's all
She kisses his hand reassuringly
'm dreaming about you
Mmmmmmm
He gets up and goes to the bathroom
75 Tentatively, he flips the light on
very relieved David regards his restored face
He shuts off the light quickly, and fills the glass of water
Splashes some water on his face
David climbs back into bed
(small laugh) could listen to you say "mmmmm" for the rest of my life
They kiss
The kiss expands, as he moves to the back of her neck
He caresses her body
She kisses his fingertips
Her back to him
Tangled in sheets, they ease into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant for each other
He gently grabs a handful of her hair
His hand stops
It's not Sofia's hair
He slowly turns her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of the woman who is not Sofia
He leaps out of bed, falling to the floor, the sheet tangled around him
He turns on the light
Julie Gianni hides her face from the light, like a night animal caught in the intrusive glare of day
When she speaks, it is with Sofia's cadence and accent
(scared, uncomprehending) Baby, what's wrong
He gasps for breath, backing away
Totally terrified
Paralyzed
In a low voice: Where
Is
She
Who
His instinct is to protect his lifeline Sofia - and he pounces on her with a manic will to survive
76 Julie Gianni looks a little loopy, almost stoned
Taunting
(taunting, sweet) 'm Sofia
--  - David dismantles the phone, takes the cord
He ties her willing hands to the posts of the bed
She protests oddly, like an actress playing a part
Now 'm going to make sure that tie this four times
Do you know why, Julie
Because four times really means something
David pulls his pants on, frantically opens the wardrobe closet
No Sofia
Goes to the kitchen
No Sofia
Julie sobs quietly, sweetly, tied to the bed
She behaves and acts like Sofia
David, don't hurt me
David returns and sits across from her on the bed, terrified and barely hanging on
Okay, 'm freaked out
It worked
So just tell me right now - where is Sofia
am Sofia
In one minute 'm going to call the police -- (heart breaking) Don't do it, honey
knew you'd survived the accident
She looks at him with tearful eyes
What
accident
77 Whose body was it
Who's the one who hired you
The Seven Dwarves
haven't had any accident
No, of course not
It wasn't an accident at all
It was attempted murder
Honey, please
He picks up the phone
Dials 911
Police Department
've captured an intruder who's entered my home
He turns to her
Her eyes are yearning
/  - The flash of mug shots
We see David sitting, sweating, agitated waiting in a Police station holding room
Suddenly, the door opens and Thomas Tipp enters, flanked by other Detectives
Guys, can you give us a minute here
Detective Larson
Detective Andrews
thank you
The room empties, and Tipp approaches David
They think that  had something to so with this
'm going to handle this exactly the way your father would have handled this
've got it solved
You've got it solved
Where is she
She's going to be fine
David hugs Tipp
78 Thank God you're here, man love her
Yeah
Now,  want you to look at these photos and then 'm going to destroy them
Sofia's testimony is also in here
It won't exist
She's not going to press charges
Press charges against
me
David, wake up
As your friend, think you should see what you did to Sofia
The press won't get hold of this if you get
away quickly
David leans back in his seat
It's all of them - everybody - against him
Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two computer discs and photos
He displays a photo to David, moving it into the light so he sees it clearly
Julie Gianni, battered
This is Julie Gianni
That's not Sofia
This is Julie Gianni didn't do that do that to her
(beginning to shut down) Tommy, someone's setting me up
David, the Board and  have taken care of everything
They've been really great, actually
All of this is going to disappear
We're all behind you
even the Board
David looks at Tipp
It's very clear now
He's one of them
David attempts calm
(quiet, helpful) Get out of here
migraine is thundering in David's head
His world is spinning backwards
79 -a David strides down the hallway
Man in a crystal blue sport coat stands, waiting
As David passes, the Man confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable secret
Voices from other rooms, including a small child saying: "Mommy, mommy
" This is a revolution of the mind
/
- Exiting, David is intercepted by a furious Brian
You're in fucking sad shape, man
Don't fucking ever hit a girl, man
Hit me, but don't fucking hit a girl
David looks up -- sees a small security camera trained on them - pulls Brian out of the station
It wasn't Sofia
It was Julie
Oh
it was Julie Gianni
So, Sofia was abducted by Julie, and now Julie is posing as Sofia
Yes
You're in
land, man
Julie Gianni is fucking dead
don't know what the cops have told you, but let me assure you - Julie Gianni is alive alive
didn't talk to the cops talked to Sofia
Where is she
just dropped Sofia off
And saw everything you did to her
80 Let me tell you something -  did not do that to her
Look me in the eye and tell me that it was the same girl you brought to the party
Tell me it was your dream girl, your "proximity infatuation
" (raw, finally) Yes
And you stole her from me
David backs away, as Brian responds bitterly, from his heart
The one girl  really wanted, and you took her from me
You're insane
You're losing it, man
David nods powerfully
He now understands
Brian is one of them too
You have revealed yourself
Oh yeah, 'm with them
Where'd you get the coat, Brian
Where'd you get the camera
How much did they pay you
Listen to me, 'cause it's the last time we're ever gonna speak was your only friend
You have revealed yourself to me
' - David nurses a drink, still breathing heavily
He's been crying
His head aches with this thought - maybe  am insane
man in a classy suit walks towards him, inviting himself to sit at the table
His bedside manner is impeccable
His smile offers infinite compassion
He was the man staring at
him in this same restaurant
He is 81 Problems
(takes a sip) 'm in no mood to be fucked with
So do yourself a favor and le - There's an explanation for all this, David
Who the fuck are you
You and  know each other
You found me on the Internet
Silence
David stares at the man
What do you want
Why are you following me
'm here to help you
And first of all, it's very important that you calm down
Calm down
You must overcome your fears and regain control
Take hold of your life again
It's as easy as holding that glass
What if told you that you can take control of all of this
everything
even me
David turns to him
Look
'm straight, okay
David, look at these people
It seems as though they're chatting away, doesn't it
Nothing to do with you - 82 David listens, as he looks at the spirited Saturday night crowd, lost in their revelry
-- and yet, they might only be here because you wanted them to be
You are their God
And not only that, you could make them obey you
or even destroy you
David shakes his head, exhausted and in no mood
He shuts his eyes, fights off a headache
(cutting him off) What 'd like them to do is shut up
Especially you
Silence
David opens his eyes
They're all staring at him
Casually waiting for orders
You see
David looks at him with horror, backing away
Receding in his vision: You and  signed a contract, David
-  -    ( # 4) McCabe is taut, following the thread
His voice calming
Who is the man in the restaurant
Who is it
can' t
-- Can you tell the difference between dreams and reality
Of course
Can you
Think about it
Think with your head
You signed a contract, did you not
83 woman walks down the hallway, looking back
Flash   of papers signed
signed something
Was the man at the restaurant there
McCabe's voice becomes infinitely calm and helpful
Fuck
Accept your body's resistance
Let your head answer
Yes
That's right
Who is Ellie
don't know what's real
What happened that night, David
Somebody died
don't want to remember
Do you understand that you hold the keys to this prison
It wasn't Sofia
Who was it
No
Who was it
84 No
You want to let it out, don't you David
You're about to tell me
Tell me what your heart and soul will not allow you to forget
David shudders
It's coming
Did you kill Sofia
McCabe stands tall, stunned and curious, still pressing to pull the nightmare out of him
'  -  - The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear the front door kicked in
David enters, slamming the door behind him
He looks around what was once the site of such happiness
The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now horrifying to him
He looks at a photo on the refrigerator
The same note: Call Dad
The exact expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier visit
Now it is Julie who is in her place
He opens her drawer
Just some papers
And then
the drawing he'd once done of her
Now featuring Julie
He rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment until he stops, collecting himself
Takes a breath and
Smash
lamp is broken over his head
Julie Gianni bends down to help him
shard of the lamp-base is still in her hand
Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl
Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around sweetness of Sofia
thought you were a vandal
(with difficulty) Who
are
you
'm Sofia
You are not Sofia
you're not Sofia
85 'm Sofia
Whatever
Julie starts to cry
Battling tears, she offers her heart and soul
David, honey
This will all be over soon
We'll be together again
You'll forget Julianna and won't be afraid of you
Let me get you a cold towel
She exits
He struggles to rise
His head is a swirling mess
And then: Sofia slowly returns with towel
Her image still blurry
David advances, and faints into her arms
Sofia
(whispers) Yes, David, 'm Sofia
'm Sofia
He accepts it, all of it, whatever it is, just to hold her
They kiss, gently, then more powerfully
'  - They make love, emotionally and deeply
Two bodies yearning to possess the other
Camera moves across their bodies, as David wipes frame to black, as the move continues onto her back
Where were you
Sofia doesn't answer, doesn't want to lose the moment
don't want to know
(thrusting) Just tell me you love me
David keeps his face buried in her shoulder'
He doesn't want to look
The passion gives way to a mounting dread, as he hears a voice almost like Sofia's
86 (
) love you
'm afraid of how powerful this is
He continues moving passionately, harder now
Julie responds to the overwhelming surge within David
She gives over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a rocket
from hell
Harder now
Grabbing her hands and pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his own
Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion
This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking it
And then
slam
a pillow comes down over her face
What the fuck is happening
Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an advanced lovemaking session
want to see your face
She grabs at the pillow
want to see your face
David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control
Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence
He loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent attempt at life
Her hand smacks his neck
He's so taut it bounces off
She grabs at his face one last time, her hand is left with enough power only to caress his face
She goes limp
Silence
David's crying turns to a whimper
He looks at the pillow over Julie's head
He's confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline
He doesn't want to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath
He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest
With true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand will reveal who he's just killed
as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest
Quarter- inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top of her breasts
dreading the inevitable, not seeing it, and then
there it is
The mole between her breasts
- David exits hurriedly, past some tenants, down the stairs
He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror
87 He looks horribly disfigured
We hear the sound of breathing, encased in a mask
-  -  ( # 4) McCabe sits across from David
McCabe looks away, haunted by the admission of guilt
did it, didn't
don't
feel
like  killed someone feel like
David, who
'm in a dream
was the man at the restaurant
David shakes his head
(pained) Sometimes the mind behaves as if it were in a dream
Faces change, people become other people
The subconscious is a powerful thing
You treated Julie carelessly, didn't you, David
Your feeling of responsibility or guilt over Julie might have easily turned Sofia into Julie
(pause) Do you know what derangement is
need your help
All  know is, you killed your girlfriend and  don't know what's in your mind
need your help
'd work on this case forever if could, but we've run out of time
88 What will you plead
Temporary derangement
It's your best chance
They won't believe me
What do you believe
Believe it or not,  care about you
You've become like family to me
don't want to give up on you
David looks at, him oddly
Suddenly, the archetype seems very familiar
McCabe continues with the noble concern of a towering father figure
(continued) But  needed more
needed an answer
even thought there was more than a good chance someone was playing tricks on you
Maybe it was the board
But can't exceed my duties here
'm just a psychologist, and  have to leave you
Will  see you at the trial
No
'm just the opening act
He exits
David sits at
the table as McCabe and Aaron exit
He hears Aaron's television; it's the Life Extension Infomercial
'  - Through the glass of the psychiatric unit, we see McCabe and Aaron exit
Only Aaron's television, sitting on a stool, remains
Push in on the television, which is playing the
Infomercial
Push in on the reverse
It's David at the window as he realizes the true meaning of "Ellie" --
He bangs on the glass, at first slow, then faster, yelling for McCabe
The
Infomercial and Benny the Dog are reflected on the window
89 McCABE
McCABE
- McCabe hustles down the hallway with David
McCabe stands tall, moving forward, like Atticus Finch with Tom Robinson
McCabe watches David closely
Aaron the Guard turns to look at David behind the glass partition that separates them
David looks out the window at the world he's missed
- The police vehicle pulls up in front of a crowded business plaza
McCabe exits with David
Always watching his every move, his every revelation
David looks upward at the towering skyscraper in the center of the plaza, rising high into the sky
- Building Guard guides them through the lobby
McCabe trained on David
look between the two
Building Guard intercepts them
(to Building Guard) Life Extension Corporation, please
What - (a look to David) We hold a court order
think 've been here before - McCabe strides purposefully past the Building Guard
Aaron shows the pass, and hustles to keep up
-63RD /
- The elevator door opens to reveal a very pleasant and peaceful environment
Comfortable lounging chairs
On the reception station is written -
and underneath it the words: Life Extension Corporation
Two more Guards meet 90 them
McCabe watches David, as Aaron releases him from the handcuffs
The group moves together
Senses are overwhelming David, as they approach the reception station
Her name is Libby
stunning young woman rises and moves to greet them
Good morning
'm Libby
'm here to assist you
Libby stares at David's masked face
It's slightly unsettling to her
He's my son
He's very shy
(smiling professionally) You're not
with the media or part
of any legal consortium, correct
No
Welcome to Life Extension
Have a look at our proposal
Please follow me
She-offers them two bound folders featuring the logo -
- and guides them down the hallway, looking back with great style, beckoning, just as in David's dream recollections
(to Aaron) You can wait out here
You'll be meeting Rebecca Dearborn
(aside) My personal role model
Containing monitors with video-taped "tour guides
" Talking heads expressing the convictions of Life Extension
Compassionate, expressive people
The bits of their testimonials echo phrases from David's own life
91 #1 and 'm not a "true believer" by nature
But the older you get, the more you see the flow of the future, and  made a choice
#2 why not embrace the future Believe the research - the future is in the union of the spiritual
and the scientific
Annoyed at everything around him, McCabe pulls David onward
- Aames and McCabe sit and wait in a warm wood-paneled office, proposals in hand
glimpse shows words like Re- Evolve and Re-Experience, peppered with colorful photos of simple, life-affirming portraits of everyday life
It's well-appointed and well-marketed organization
McCabe regards David as the victim of a lunatic's scam
Injustice fuels McCabe
(continuing, scoffing) "Cryonization - a journey of re- awakening after the preservation of the human body at extremely low temperatures
" They laughed at Jules Verne too
(a little sadly) David, you're not- Account Liaison   enters with paperwork
She is an electric presence
Efficient, caring and oddly compassionate
Mr
McCabe, how are you
'm Rebecca Dearborn
(quick notice of mask) Life Extension, or
as we like to refer to it, is a glimpse of the future
a ticket
not in the juvenile sense, but in the deeply meaningful sense that can only be borne in the human heart
92 The  codes of the human body have been broken
Soon, heart ailments, cancer and so much more, will be a thing of the past
Very simply, your anguish
your discontent
even your death is no longer necessary in a traditional sense
Whatever malady that hides behind that mask
is temporary
She looks directly at David, and it stirs him
McCabe studies her, and the operation
He thirsts for clues
David flips through the folder - toward the back, a panel of photos of storage tanks
Lavishly and warmly photographed, just like next year's cars in a magazine
Within an hour of your passing, will transfer your body to a vessel where you will be sealed and frozen at     196                   degrees below zero
Power outages, earthquakes, nothing will effect your suspension-hibernation
Did you sign this contract, David
David looks down at pamphlet, looks up
What's the "Lucid Dream" option
Good choice
The Lucid Dream is Life Extension's newest option
For a little extra, we offer the cryonic union of science and entertainment
(rueful, skeptical) "Cryo-tainment
" Dearborn spreads apart the paperwork on her desk to reveal a thin Video Monitor built into the glass table-top
Aames and McCabe peer into the table--top as Dearborn presses play
Some find this presentation helpful
93 - An appealing presentation begins         -- Man's Life
generic happy-looking Man with graphics floating out of his mouth: Re-Emerge
Re-Store
Re--Invent
a voice takes over for Dearborn
wonderfully comforting tone is present in the narration
Like that of a parent
Portrait of a modern human life
American, male
(highlighting stage) Birth
(highlighting another stage) and Death
Imagine that you are suffering from a terminal illness
You'd like to be cryonized, but you'd rather be resurrected to continue your own life, as you know it now
offers you the answer
Upon resurrection you will continue in an ageless state - preserved - but living in the "present" with a future of your choosing
-- Push in on a door that opens to a panel of steel compartments
Music and atmosphere are seductive and compelling
( '  ) Your death will be wiped from your memory
Your life will continue as a realistic work of art, painted by you, minute-to-minute
And you'll live it with the romantic abandon of a summer day
with the feeling of a great movie, or a pop song you always loved
With no memory of how it all occurred, save for the knowledge that everything simply
improved
And in any instance of discontent, you'll be visited by Technical Support
94 - Shot of Edmund Ventura holding a Life Extension folder in his arms
Graphic reads: Tech Support
(') It is all just around the corner, the day after tomorrow
- The words: ,   drift onto the screen, obscuring the phase marked: Death
Another chapter begins seamlessly, a living dream
Life Extension's promise to you
Life -- Part Two
living dream
Your death will be wiped from your memory
guess  missed that one in  Today
David sits, reeling from the revelation he may be living a Lucid Dream
a dream
What if there was a mistake
What if the dream became a nightmare
Of course, your subconscious can always play tricks on you
The subconscious is a very powerful thing - - Sits forward
He turns to David with great strength, worried for him
Did you sign a contract with these people, David
(continuing) -but this is a serious business
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk
95 And what is any life, if not the pursuit of a dream
The dream of peace
The dream of achievement
The dream of hearing someone saying these words, when they truly mean them
David is deeply moved as he listens
Somewhere, music begins to play
It is The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations
" love you, David
Te Quiero
Roam free, David
Most of us live our whole lives with no real adventure to call our own
It's hard to comprehend-but they laughed at Jules Verne too
This is a revolution of the  This is a revolution of the mind
mind
David pulls off his mask
He runs out
- David storms around the corner from Dearborn's office, yelling, raving
want to wake up
want to wake up
Aaron grabs for him
David wrenches free
David runs down the corridor and into the elevator, Aaron chasing after him
It's a nightmare
The doors shut
Music rising
- David runs out of the elevator, into the empty lobby
Shot cranes up to reveal he is utterly alone, reminiscent of the much-earlier Times Square shot
96 Tech Support
Music stops
We hear the ding of the elevator
Who turns and approaches the elevator, exiting frame
- David enters the elevator to see Edmund Ventura, calmly waiting
David Aames
think it's time we had a proper re-introduction
'm Edmund Ventura from the oasis Project, formerly Life Extension --a Tech support
Yes, 'm your Tech Support
We first met      150   years ago
Oh shit
You sold me the Lucid Dream
Ventura smiles
Well, what the hell happened
tried to warn you in the bar told you to exercise control, that it all depended on your mind
All of this, everything is your creation
And we're now heading toward your true moment, of choice
"True moment of choice
" Yes
When did the Lucid Dream begin
97 Remember the day of the nightclub
(trying to remember) Yes
'  --  - David is collapsed on the ground
His mask clutched in his hand, passed out
Rhythmic score
(with importance) That night, when Sofia left you and you fell asleep on the pavement, that was the moment you chose for the splice
(remembers the word) The splice
The mask has tumbled out of his hand
Splice
The end of your "real" life and the beginning of
's Lucid Dream
splice of many years which passed while you were frozen and dreaming
moody day dawns
David's mask is just outside the reach of his outstretched hand
Sofia's hand reaches in, and awakens him
Everything is suddenly a little more vivid, a little more super-real
Open your eyes
They walk away, down the street, into a beautiful Vanilla Sky
Sofia slips her arm around his shoulder, as we've seen earlier
From the moment you woke up on that street, nothing was "real" in 98 a traditional sense
Your Lucid Dream is monitored by Life Extension, and a panel of experts who follow your every thought
Even at this moment
- The scene continues as David Aames rides the elevator
The compartment now rises above the first seven floors to reveal they are traveling upwards in an exterior elevator
Other skyscrapers pass by outside the window
Forgive me
'm blowing your mind
David looks down with dread
'm not a big fan of heights
know
(continuing) We erased what really happened from your memory
(reaching to understand) erased
Replaced by a better life under these beautiful Monet-like skies
(recognizing pieces) My mother's favorite
That's right
better life because you had Sofia
- walking down the center of the Village Street
And you sculpted your Lucid Dream out of the iconography of your youth
99 from the life and psyche of his youth
Mirrored in David's life in moments we've already seen
An album cover that once moved you
An album cover
The cover of "Freewheelin' Bob Dylan
" Same pose
Same street
a movie you once saw late at night that showed you what a father could be like
- Atticus Finch sits at the breakfast table with his kids
- The exact pose as McCabe and David talk in one of their prison conversations
or what love could be like
' - Her head held high, laughing
- laughing in the same way, a moment from "Jules et Jim
" - The compartment hurtles upwards, rising higher than the surrounding buildings
This was a kind woman, an individual, more than your equal
Ventura nods wistfully
He fell in love with her a little, too
100 You barely knew her in real life, but
in your Lucid Dream, she was your savior
- trying to remember, feeling the flashes of truth in brief moments
And then a bracing, challenging realization that something went wrong
What happened in my real life
Something happened
What did you erase
Do you really want to know
almost nauseous Tell me everything
- Match push in on David rising to his feet
His disfigured face thunders with a massive migraine
The exact
shot we once saw as David and Sofia walked away together
This time, David is alone
The morning after the nightclub, you woke up on that street, hung- over and along
You got up and walked away
You never saw Sofia again
didn't kill Sofia
No
- He can't remember any of this
And then
You battled your board, the Seven Dwarves, for control
In the end it was Thomas Tipp, your father's 101 friend, the one whose job you saved, who wrenched the company back in your control
-  - David exits the company elevator and returns to Aames Publications
Tipp is out in front of the employees and staffers who welcome him back
(warmly) Tommy
(vague memories) But then
somebody died
'       - David sits in front of the computer in bad physical shape
You longed for Sofia
You shut yourself away for months
You were alone
You couldn't take the pain anymore
Headaches
you could barely function
found you on the Internet signed the contract with you
And then
---  -- Aames takes pills, collapses
Music plays
remember
It comes back to him, powerfully
Somebody died
It was me
-- It's zipped up
102 -- The plastic-wrapped body of David Aames is slipped into a tube, which is clamped shut
Christmas tree in the background, as music continues
And on a day in late December, you gave yourself to us
You're now in a suspended state
'  a--  - Friends and family clog the old apartment
Shelby looks out into the hallway and sees an old acquaintance
Your friend Brian Shelby threw a three-day memorial in your old home
He was a true friend
'  - Sofia ventures into David's apartment alone, taking in the environment and remembering the best moments of her brief encounter with David
You were missed, David
She moves into close-up, and we see the wonder and the joy of a perfect love, nearly attained
She soaks in the beautiful, painful mystery of life
It was Sofia who never fully recovered
It was she who somehow knew you best
And like you, she never forgot that one night where real, true love seemed possible
- David contemplates getting into the car with Julianna
He makes the choice that
will change this, and his next life
Consequences, David
It's the little things
'  -- Sofia exits the shot and we're left with an empty frame
103 -- David turns from looking out the window of the elevator
(tears in eyes) The little things
There's nothing bigger, is there
- David and Ventura exit the elevator onto the rooftop
Your subconscious did create problems
Your dream turned into a nightmare
The glitch has been corrected
So all  have to do is imagine something
If  wanted McCabe to come back, right now - McCabe comes flying out of the door
David
Listen to me
These people are dangerous
We're in trouble
We need to get off this roof now
Who turns from McCabe to Ventura
Ventura leads David away
We're now on "pause"
And you're about to return to your Lucid Dream
"Pause"
(continuing) with all of the upgrades
You won't remember any of this, nor be charged for the technical support
it is now your moment of choice
You can return to your Lucid Dream, and live a beautiful life 104 with Sofia, or whomever you wish
or you can choose the world out there
Ventura gestures to the city beyond, as they come to a halt
The world out
there
And you can bring me back, just
like Benny the Dog
The client is starting to understand
Yes
Just like Benny the Dog
Your face and body can now be fixed, of course
But it's very different out there now
Your finances won't last long
Your panel of observers are waiting for you to choose
Ventura gestures into the camera
He begins walking backwards to the roof's ledge
There are no guarantees
But remember, even in the future, the sweet is never as sweet without the sour
David sees that Brian Shelby has now joined McCabe on the roof
He nods to Brian, who nods back
How do  wake up
The decision is yours
Ventura glances over the edge
And  chose this scenario, didn't 105 (enjoying that he understands) Yes, to face your last remaining fear of heights
David, don't listen to him
You were right
This is the Seven Dwarves
It's a set up
You can't trust him
David looks at McCabe with compassion
Don't feel bad, David
This winning man is your creation
It's in his nature to fight for his existence
But he's not real
who looks on with compassion
McCabe fights for himself
'm real
have two daughters
You know that
What are their names
-  -- who feels for McCabe as the apparition crumbles
Mortality as home entertainment
This cannot be the future
Can it
David regards McCabe
Once dynamic, McCabe now seems unsure of his own existence
Slowly, always looking at David, he settles into the truth of his very being
With great nobility, McCabe shoves his hands into his pockets and faces his own destiny
or lack thereof
(quietly) Goodbye
106 It's been a brilliant journey of self-awakening, and you've simply got to ask yourself -- what is happiness to you
His moment of realization
want to live a real life don't want to dream any longer
Any last wishes
Let them out there read my mind
wish you well, David
Music rises as he turns to see Sofia
He moves to her
She touches his cheek
His face is restored
They embrace
Look at us
'm frozen, and you're dead
And  love you
It's a problem
lost you when  got in that car
'm sorry
She looks at him, beguiling and understanding
But remember what you told me once
Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
She kisses him
'll find you again
She regards her lost love, taking him in
David treasures his last moments with her
107 David takes a breath and begins backing to the ledge
'll see you in another life when we are both cats
David backs up and begins to run
He arrives at the edge, looking down at the distance to the ground, stopping himself at the precipice
He looks back to Sofia one last time, and then leaps out into the celestial future
For a fraction of a moment, he is suspended in mid-air
And he hurtles to the ground
And the ground hurtles to meet him
It is the little things, the random poetic instances of David Aames' life that come back to him
Music rises as he realizes, finally, his own true poetry and humanity
The images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his heartbeat
Father
Mother
casual glance of a stranger
All combine to give his life meaning
And then, finally, we see the face of the one person who gave him purpose in this life
and the next
Sofia
: The sound of a breath
gulp of life
Someone's heart is beating
' Relax
relax, David
open your eyes
An eye opens and the pupil darts to the right and left
Life again
' open your eyes
