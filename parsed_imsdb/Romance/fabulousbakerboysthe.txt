He is wearing a tuxedo
(
) Hey
It's the  from this afternoon
Hey
Jack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the bedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment
Not good
Whatcha doin' over there
Gotta go
How come
Job
The Girl glances at the bedside clock
Funny hours
Funny job
Will  see you again
Jack looks out at the dirty street again
No
The Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this
(at the tux) You weren't wearing that, were you
Earlier
Jack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on the sill
Brought it
Shit, thank God
You look like a creep
Thanks
mean, 'd hate to think 'd pick up someone who wore that shit
Jack smiles, grabs the paper bag, and moves to the door
(continuing) Hey
(as he stops) You got great hands
- Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with the milieu
Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he goes
Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel
Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent
Hey, Jackie
How goes it, Tommy
() (shrugging) Ah, you know
Howsa pooch
Losing his teeth
No shit
It's the goddamn water
Kill an ox
buy bottled for my Danny
You can't trust the taps
Yeah
(standing back) Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy
Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat
Yeah
The big boys sent it down yesterday
Another five years, huh
Like clockwork
You got a good memory, Jackie
It ain't always a blessing
My brother here
(nodding) He's got blood in his eye
Jack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and moves into the hotel
- Jack's older brother, , is pacing outside the lounge when he sees Jack approaching
Great
Terrific
Glad you could make it
How we doing
How we
What, are you kidding me
Am  late
That's not the point
(taking out a cigarette) What's the point
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack
You want me to show up late a few nights
Jack
Frank
Jack
Frank
'm here
always get here
Don't sweat it
Christ, will you look at your hair
Jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold
What's wrong with it
You look like you just crawled out of bed
No one's gonna be looking at my hair
Come on, we're on
Frank just stands there, bottled up with exasperation
(continuing) Careful, Frank
When you get angry your tie starts to spin
Jack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his head, follows
As they move away, a cardboard stand-up is revealed
On it are two 8  10 glossies of Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters, this: "Tonight
The Doubly Delightful Tones of the Fabulous Baker Boys
" as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent that what the "Fabulous Baker Boys" are, in fact, is a poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher
As they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads
After a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and the couples applaud
(Mr
Smile) Thank you
Thank you
Good evening and welcome to the Starfire lounge
My name is Frank Baker and eighty-eight keys across from me is my little brother, Jack
Applause
Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes a draw on his cigarette
(continuing; could do this in his sleep) You know, my brother and  have been playing together, gosh,  don't know
How long has it been, Jack
Twenty-eight years, Frank
Applause
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack
Lotta water
Of course, back then, things were a little different
was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil
(to Jack) We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack
Laughter
Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of razor blades
(continuing) But seriously
It's been fifteen years since Jack and  first stepped on the stage as professionals
Three states, sixty-eight cities, and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later
well, believe me, we've seen our share of this crazy country of ours
But even though we've played some of the finest venues in the world
At this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words
(continuing) There's one place that's always been, for us, a very special place, and that place is
this place, the Starfire lounge
Jack lays in a few soft bass chords
(continuing) Why
Well,  guess you could just say it's the
(pregnant moment) people
At which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard and give birth to the melody of -- what else
"People
' - They exit the stage to applause
Thank you
Remember, room service is available till one
for you late-nighters
Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen
Don't make trouble, all right
Who's gonna make trouble
(spotting someone) Hey, amigo
'  - in an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone, looks up
Jack
(lower) Frank
(the feeling's mutual) Yeah, hi, Hector
() (re: the soup bone) For Eddie
wrap
Gracias
(as they exit) mean it, Jack
Behave
Like an angel
Frank stands across the desk from a   who, despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal attitude toward the two men in his office
Jack stays in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture any further is to risk contracting some hideous disease
( ) (preparing a cash envelope) Terrific, boys
Really
Terrific
Thanks, Lloyd
Yes, sir
You're just what we needed on a night like this
Uh
thanks
Frank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left him in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone
Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal
If you wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on State Street
These blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some guy dripping ash all over himself while he's playing 'The Sound of Music
' - Smoke curls out of Jack's nose
He is utterly still, like a pit bull eyeing a steak
Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more lessons
By the way, Frankie, 'm declaring this
Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and, business closed, busies himself with other matters
Uh
You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd
'll call you
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, thought maybe
'll call you
Frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk
Count it
Huh
Count it
Jack
Count the fucking money, Frank
Lloyd looks up
Jack is staring right into him
Reluctantly, Frank opens the envelope
It's all here
(pulling Jack out) 'll be talking to you, Lloyd
Lloyd doesn't answer
He just looks at Jack, smiling with amusement
- Jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped soup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard stand-up under his arm
You mind telling me what that was about in there
Was that planned
Or were you just bored and decided to get creative
Fuck him
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack
Fuck him
(to himself) Fuck him
Great
Terrific
Fuck him
The fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to Frank's car
Frank opens the trunk and starts to put the stand-up away
So we on tomorrow night
(shaking his head) Maybe Thursday
hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis
Jack nods and starts to walk away
(continuing) Hey
Jack stops
(continuing) Listen
why don't you come out to the house this weekend
Say hello to the kids
They've grown
hate your kids, Frank
You're their uncle
Only by relation
Besides, they hate me, too
They don't
They're always asking about you
They tried to electrocute me, Frank
It was an accident
It was no fucking accident, Frank
The little one
Cindy
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub
How do you explain that
She didn't know what she was doing
You're too sensitive
You got weird kids, Frank
Look,  just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing
Jack just stares at Frank
(continuing) Just think about it, all right
Consider it a standing offer
Frank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side
(continuing;like a litany) You want a ride, Jack
No, Frank, 'll walk
Okay, Jack, good night
Good night, Frank
Frank turns the   and pulls away from the curb
Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance, then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads for home
- Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment building, where a black labrador is studying him from a second story window
' Jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably cluttered
The most striking item is a vintage phone booth placed against the wall
As Jack lets himself in, , the dog from the window, walks over
He is not an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack
Hi, pal
Thought you were gonna clean the apartment
Eddie nuzzles the soup bone
Jack unwraps the paper and hands it over
(continuing) Take it easy, will ya
You're becoming a regular Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth around here
Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs
He lifts the records back up the post and clicks  the As Bill Evans' smoky " " fills the tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and walks over to the old piano near the window
Settling back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows gently on the keys and stares out the open window, listening to the music
Jack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano showroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color
, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap upright, contemplating his shoes
What happened to the two Clays, Willie
Out
When they coming in
Wednesday next
Frank looks across the room at Jack
What d'ya got
, Bosen black
(taps a key) Flat
What d'you say, Willie
Tighten her up
What's the gig
Two nights
Willie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head
Frank frowns and glances around
Across the room, Jack pauses before another piano
(continuing) What d'ya got
(tapping) Yamaha white
Nice
Frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony
What do you think
Try the black Knable
Frank moves to another piano and repeats the process, watching Jack for a verdict
After a moment, Jack nods
Tag 'em, Willie
The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday
Thanks
My pleasure
The brothers sit at a window of a corner diner, Jack nursing an ice coffee, Frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs
The glass next to them is cluttered with photographs of neighborhood luminaries, including two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes
You know,  think it's been five years since saw you eat anything
That's the God's truth
Trust me, you're not missing anything
You look awful
Thanks
Really
You sleeping
Only on odd days
(a look) Seeing anyone in particular
Why the interest
Because 'm your brother
Because  care about you
Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours
Jack studies his brother's face
'm not seeing anyone
In particular
What about that waitress at the Ambassador
Uh-uh
How about you
You seeing anyone
Funny
(points at his wedding band) Strike a bell
It's only a ring
Not a collar
It's more than that
Jack smiles and sips his coffee
(continuing) By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow
No thanks
No,  mean it
So do
We gotta go, Jack
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty
won't feel guilty, so  don't gotta go
This time you gotta go
don't gotta go
You gotta go
Says who
Your older brother
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank
That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday
Jack glances up
Frank nods
(continuing) So what do you say
Think the city can spare you for an afternoon
Jack squints out the window
(continuing) Okay
And don't worry about a present
got her something from both of us
Jack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand, gets out of Frank's car and surveys the street on which he grew up
Make sure you lock
Unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity
But it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point
Place looks good, huh
got a neighbor boy to mow the lawn, pick up
Five bucks
Times've changed, huh
(pointing) See the tree
Remember the job Cecil did on it the day Dad planted it
You can still see the scars on the trunk
Really
was looking at it just the other day
Jesus,  thought he was gonna kill that cat
Frank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise, then raps on the front door
Jack studies the tree a moment, then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand
So what'd we get her
You'll see
- At that moment, the door swings open and is there, a vibrant woman in her sixties
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys
How's the birthday girl
little stiffer, but just as sturdy
Mrs
Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly, embraces Jack
(continuing) John
It's good to see you
(uncomfortable; balancing cake box) Good to see you, Ma
Jack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and mimics "John" with a knowing nod
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore
Jack
He goes by Jack
thought maybe held gotten over that
Twenty years, Ma
Yes, yes
It's just that John is so much nicer
Jack sounds so
crude
When  was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack
guess  just can't help making the association
Jack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he holds his brother personally responsible for this
Uh
yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack
Catholics
What do you expect
Oh, well, what's in a name, right
Let's go inside and have a look at that cake
As Mrs
Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack
Keep her busy, will ya
have to set a few things up
Frank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch with the bakery box
Jack shakes his head, wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon, then enters the house
The front room is cluttered with his childhood
Most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights, perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed with age
Above them, pressed between glass and framed, are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight
Finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared, piled everywhere in drunken stacks
This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly, warily, but with a noticeable dispassion, until his eyes fall upon a photograph
In it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms
Frank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean, perfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger, his shirt too big, is caught in profile, looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze
(entering) Well, now, where's everyone run off to
Frank
Downstairs
Oh
All at once, Jack and his mother realize they are alone
Well, shall we cut that cake
Jack nods and follows her into the kitchen
He places the box on the table and stands off to the side while Mrs
Baker sets about preparing things
So
How are you
Fine
You
Oh, fine
Silence
Jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake
Her fingers are trembling
(continuing) Big piece or little
Huh
Oh, no
None
'm not much for sweets
Mrs
Baker nods
How's that dog of yours
What was his name
Eddie
Yes
Right
Eddie
How is he
He's losing his teeth
Mrs
Baker stops and looks up into Jack's eyes
Suddenly, a  is heard in the other room
Sounds like your brothers back with us
- Frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an old movie projector and a roll-up screen
(entering) What's all this
Frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the tiny ribboned box
Go on
Jack watches from the kitchen doorway as Mrs
Baker pulls the ribbon off the box
Inside is a tiny spool of film
Why, what's this
() Blank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark
Frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake
Mrs
Baker close on his elbow, sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen
Jack sits off to the side
title card appears: "For Mrs
Ellie Baker, who made it all possible
" Mrs
Baker gives Frank a puzzled look
He just smiles
Suddenly, images spring to the screen, obviously footage several years old, showing Jack and Frank as children, sitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits, smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera
Oh my God
Recognize these two characters
thought these were lost
Where did you find
In the attic
Behind some of Dad's stuff
(pointing with his fork) Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals
As Frank's laughter fills the dark room, Jack stares with cold fascination at the screen
Suddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later, in the same positions, smiling the same smiles
(laughing) Oh no
had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together
Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack
Jack says nothing
Oh, look at you two
So skinny
And those tiny suits
Wait
Watch
Here comes Dad
Jack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year and a man enters the frame, obviously by accident
He is so tall his face cannot be seen
As he dances quickly out of sight, he ruffles Jack's hair
That man
As the film jumps again, Jack glances at the photograph to his right
The images on the screen flicker softly off the glass of the picture frame
(
) (continuing) Oh, look how you're growing
My little boys
Jack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother and brother, sitting close together in the love seat, laughing
After a moment, their voices fade and Jack looks back to the children on the screen, like two tiny men, mirror images of one another
At first the changes are subtle
Little Jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button
But as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one another less and less, until finally, the little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in his place is a slouching, tousle-haired adolescent in rumpled coat and open collar, a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip
woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the offending cigarette away in a flash
Frank and Jack are parked in front of Jack's building
Whispers of steam snake from the mancovers in the street
made her nervous
What do you mean
Her hands
Like that
Jack holds out a trembling hand
Nah
Medication
Jack looks over at Frank
He nods
(continuing) Couple years, now
(taps his heart) Keeps the beat steady
Nothing serious
Jack considers this a moment, then gets out of the car
She was glad to see you
' Jack lets himself into his apartment and stops
Across the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl
Jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to the bedroom
As he folds a blanket under her chin, he pauses
The girl's face is calm, peaceful
- The next morning
Early
The sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and beginning to drip out onto the street
Suddenly, over the rooftops, is " " -- not the entire song, just the first two bars, over and over
'  - Jack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering Eddie, opens his eyes
Across the room, seated at the piano, is , the little girl
She stops playing and turns
Morning
You want coffee
made coffee
Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up
He nods to the coffee
Nina goes to the kitchen
(continuing) did the dishes last night
You're missing a cup
Jack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window
(continuing) Did you break a cup, Jack
Eddie did
Nina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch, then brings Jack his coffee with both hands
practiced the piano last night
Two hours
think 'm ready for 'Jingle all the way
' Jack nods
Suddenly, the sound of   is heard
Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling
(continuing) Guess they're up
Sounds big
What's he do
Process server
Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular
All  know's he came to take the  one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner
And breakfast
What happened to the donut king
Married
Upstairs, a   and    in the stairwell
Nina peers out the window
No breakfast
Maybe they had a fight
sound on the ceiling
(continuing) Well, gotta go
Teach me later
Jack nods
Nina kisses him on the cheek and exits
Jack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge
Hey
Though the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses of the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys' presence seem a bit incongruous, Jack and Frank hold nothing back, giving "McCarthur Park" the full treatment
Unfortunately, the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldn't fill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause is less than volcanic
Uh, thank you
That concludes our show for this evening
Jack and  only hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did
As the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys, a freckle-faced  comes up
Mr
Baker
(tired) Yeah, Jimmy
() Mr
Simpson asked to see you
All right, tell him 'll be right there
As Jimmy exits, Frank stands and points at Jack
(continuing) Tomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite
' Frank pauses before a door marked "
" It's half-open
Inside,  , a heavy man in a shiny suit, is throwing darts in the general direction of a dartboard
He's not very good
Frank knocks
Frankie
You wanted to see me, Charlie
Yeah, come on in
Little slow tonight
(waving it off) Mondays
Charlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it to Frank
What's this
Your pay
Now
Why not tomorrow
After the show
Take it now
(confused) What about tomorrow
We don't need you, Frankie
For a moment, Frank just stands there
've got the grands for two nights, Charlie
You can't just -- It's all there
Both nights
Frank looks at the envelope in his hands
What're you saying, Charlie
Look, Frankie
You and Jack been playing here, a long time
Twelve years
Right, twelve years
Couple times a month
So
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other
Vacation
Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night
You said so yourself
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie
got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball
gotta move the liquor
To move the liquor,  gotta fill the tables
It's a matter of economics
Me,  love you
love both you guys, you know that
You're class
But people today
They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls
Jack rises as Frank passes through the lobby with the cardboard stand-up
What's with Charlie
Nothing
Everything's great
Terrific
' With the stand-up under his arm, Frank enters and closes the door quietly
light is glowing in the kitchen
The rest of the house is dark, quiet
In the kitchen, he checks the message pad by the phone
Nothing
On the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him
Next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached: "Frank
Please
" Frank sighs and leans the stand-up against the wall
The photo of Jack is peeling off the cardboard
Finding a stack of glossies in a drawer, Frank removes the old Jack from the stand-up and replaces it with a new one
As he presses the photograph in place, his eyes drift to the one of himself
It was taken a long time ago
' Jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the piano by the window
As the needle hits the spinning disc, a sharp, snappy    throughout the apartment
Jack takes a drink, then joins in with the record, playing along
His concentration is intense, so much so that, a moment later, when the  , he seems not to hear it
Finally, he picks it up
Yeah
(
0
) It's me
Frank
(
0
) Yeah
Listen
come out to the house tomorrow, will ya
've had enough family for one month, Frank
(
0
) It's not family
It's business
So talk to me tomorrow
After the gig
(
0
) We don't get a gig
What're you talking about
(
0
) Something came up
Don't worry, Charlie stayed true
Both nights
'll give you your share tomorrow
At the house
Silence
(
0) (continuing) So you'll come out, right
Yeah, okay
Jack listens to the   in the dark, then the  goes
taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses
In his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers
He walks up to the door of a small white house and presses the doorbell
When there is no response, he goes around to the back
The backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence surrounding it
Two kids, a girl and a boy, are splashing around in a build-it-yourself above-ground pool
When they see Jack, they stop splashing
Only their heads are visible above the water
Hey, kids
Dad home
The two heads say nothing
(continuing) What d'ya say
Wanna run and get him for me
Still nothing
Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette, and pats his pocket for a match
(continuing) Shit
The kids' eyes widen at his profanity
Jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, ponders things for a moment, then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence
At which point, the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream
(continuing) Hey, kid
Take it easy
No use
The kid's a world-class screamer
Frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed, comes racing out of the house
Cindy
What is it
Cindy points
At Jack
(continuing) Jack
Your doorbell doesn't work
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack
You remember Uncle Jack
, Frank's wife, appears
What's the matter
Jack
Jack waves
(lifting Cindy out of the pool) Nothing's the matter
Is it, sweetheart
'll take her inside
You too, little Frank
Out of the pool
Donna shepherds the kids toward the house
Feet
The kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat and disappear into the house
Frank turns to Jack
(continuing) It's probably the excitement of seeing you again
() Donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade
The men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed aluminum chairs
Well, look at this
You bring trunks, Jack
Trunks
Swimming trunks
Oh
No
Strictly dryland
Too bad
You could use some sun
Really
Maybe next time
We have some lotion
Just the same
Suit yourself
Donna returns to the house
Frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his surroundings complacently
Nice, huh
What
The trees
The flowers
Nice
Terrific
(expansively) Yeah
we're gonna paint in the spring
After the rains
Look good as new
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank
Frank shakes the ice in his glass
(continuing) Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he
don't know what you mean
The hell you don't
told you
Something came up
Some political dinner or something
Bullshit
Fifteen years, Frank
No one paid us off
It wasn't like that
No
No
What was it like
Hey pal,  got a mortgage, all right
got two kids
got a wife
Besides, he made the deal
There's no shame in it
That how you see it
Yeah, that's how  see it
Jack shakes his head in disgust
(continuing) And don't go shaking your head, little brother
'm not the one who walks in every night smelling like he's got a day job in a piss factory
(pause) It killed him, you know
Jack glances up
Dangerous territory
gust of wind killed him
Yeah, and what put him up there
Hey, you weren't there
Right
Jack's look ends this
Frank sighs
Look, can we forget last night
We gotta talk
Talk
been thinking maybe we should make some changes
(pause) been thinking maybe we should take on a singer
Silence
Sure, why not
It's just an idea
want your opinion
mean, we go halfway on everything, right
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say
We agreed that if  took care of the business; 'd be entitled to the extra
Isn't that what we agreed
That's what we agreed
If you're unhappy with the arrangement -- 'm not unhappy
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, 'd be glad -- Frank
Fuck it
Okay
've tried to do well by you, Jack
By both of us
'm grateful, Frank
How much
For the singer
thought maybe twenty percent
Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead
The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice
We have to stay competitive, Jack
Jack laughs coldly
What's that
You, Frank
All these years you been telling me we're different
We got novelty, Jack
No one can touch us
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack
It never was
in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the center of a tiny room in the back of Willie's piano showroom, holding some sheet music
Sammy Davis Jr
's face is on the sheet music
Frank is sitting against the opposite wall, a notepad in his hand
Jack is at the piano
Good morning, Miss
Moran
Monica Moran
All right, Miss Moran ( ) Actually, that's my stage name
'm sorry
Moran
Monica
The whole thing
It's my stage name
My real name's Blanche
Blanche
No romance, right
That's why  came up with Monica
It's what  prefer
Well, that's fine -- But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche
If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up
Right
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her
She's opposed to my career
Uh-huh
Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us
Candy Man
' (worried) Is that all right
It's one of Jack's favorites
Monica turns and, seeing Jack at the piano, gives a little start
Oops
almost forgot you were there
Here's the music
Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music
Uh
he knows it
Really
Isn't that a coincidence
Small world
Monica smiles
She likes Jack
Well, shall we
Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway, laconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica swings her arms and taps her foot
Despite all this, Monica still manages to come in between beats and Jack has to scramble over a chord to catch her, sort of like a fireman with a net
Who can take a sunrise Sprinkle it with dew Toss it in the air and Make a groovy lemon pie The Candy Man can The Candy Man can
, There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the mother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her daughter's career
Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough
Monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up
Frank looks over at Jack
Jack shrugs and continues to play
(continuing) Miss Moran
Miss Moran
Blanche
Monica's eyes pop open
Oh, sorry
get so caught up in it sometimes
It's scary
Yes, it is
Well
thanks
(to Jack) Bye
Drive carefully
As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring singers who can't sing
As Frank sinks lower in his chair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes, and colors, come forth to offer their own unique interpretations of "Feelings," " Gotta Be Me," "This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately, "What Kind of Fool Am
" Finally, when it is all over, Jack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room, looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal
As the sequence ends, a    in high heels walks into Willie's
She glances around, then spots Willie across the room, eating a corn beef on rye
Hey
You one of the fabulous Baker Boys
are putting on their coats, preparing to leave
Frank is staring at his notepad
Thirty-seven
Thirty-seven
What
Thirty-seven girls
And not one who can carry a tune
That must be statistically impossible
It was a somewhat extraordinary day
just don't understand
You would think someone
anyone
(
) Damn
The Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway, holding a shoe in her hand
It's broken
(continuing) Brand new Thursday
You believe it
After today, Jack and Frank are prepared to believe anything
(continuing) This where the auditions are
This is where the auditions were
What do you mean
We're finished
What about me
Frank looks at his watch
You're an hour and a half late
My watch is broken, too
Punctuality
First rule of show business
The Woman looks around her
This is show business
(in no mood) Look, miss
We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home
(touching her lip) Just like that, huh
You're not even gonna give me a chance
Don't take it personally
How should  take it
Impersonally
Frank begins to leave
don't believe it
come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because  have gum on my lip and 'm a few minutes late
You're an hour and a half late
So if 'm so 'late how come you're still here
We ran long
So run a little longer
Miss -- You find a girl
Jack and Frank glance at each other
No
So
'm here, you're here, the piano's here
What d'ya say
Before Frank can answer, Jack walks over to the piano
Terrific
Thirty-eight
What's that mean
Thirty-eight
Don't worry about it
(to Frank) You know, 'm feeling a lot of hostility from you
(appealing) Jack
Let's get it over with
All right
What's your name
Susie
Susie Diamond
Catchy
You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond
() Well
for the last four years 've been on call to Triple Escort service
Jack and Frank exchange a glance
(continuing) Hey, it's legit
Strictly dinner and dance
Okay
think that's all we need to know
sing now
That's the premise
Susie gives Frank a dark look, then turns to Jack
Get Along Without You
' Slowly, okay
Jack nods and begins to play
Frank slouches down in his chair, preparing to be tortured again
(continuing; singing) get along without you very well Of course  do Except when soft rains fall And drip from leaves, then  recall The thrill of being Sheltered in your arms Of course  do But  get along without you very well
' Susie stops
Frank just sits there
Jack just sits there
She can sing
(continuing) So
(blinking) Uh
we'll let you know
Jack looks over at Frank like he's insane
When
When we know
(smiling) Don't leave a girl hanging
Second rule of show business
Frank's not amused
(continuing) Yeah, well, okay
'Bye, Bakers
Susie walks out barefoot
What are you, crazy
just thought we should talk about it
Between ourselves
What's there to talk about
She can sing
That puts her at the head of the class
That makes her the only one in the class
don't know
She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake
don't think she's right for the act
(studying him) You're getting cold feet about this
was just thinking what Ma would think
Ma
Ma
Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador
Oh, that's right, she was on bass
How could  forget
Frank frowns and looks down at his hands
(continuing) How many other silent partners are there, Frank
Donna
Little Cindy
Hell, let's give Eddie a vote
Okay, okay
'll call the girl
Frank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad
What's the matter
didn't get her number
Jack and Frank dash out of Willie's and glance up and down the street
Nothing
We can always look her up in the book
Right
Susie Diamond
She's probably listed right next to Monica Moran
Jack shakes his head in disgust
(
) Does this mean  get the job
Jack and Frank whirl around
There, standing in the doorway, is Susie
Intuition
Gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day
Once again, " " is heard, only this time carried a little further: "Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
" , Ensconsed in the back room of Willie's, preparing for their first rehearsal
Ready
Jack nods
(continuing) Ready
Susie nods
Frank poises his hands over the piano, hesitates, then looks at Jack again
(continuing) Ready
Jack squints at Frank, then nods
Frank turns to Susie
(continuing) Ready
(looking around) What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden
Frank g1ares at her
(continuing) Sorry
Frank poises his hands over the piano again and begins to play the opening passage of "Just the Way You Are
"  moment later, Jack joins in, and a moment after that, Susie
Unfortunately, Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone, are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a fifth grade recital
After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand
Fellas, fellas
Jack and Frank stop
What's the problem
The problem is  can't hear myself sing with all this
(searching) music
You know what 'm saying
Jack and Frank look at one another
(continuing) mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here 'm having a little trouble getting a word in
Jack and Frank just stare
(continuing) mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right
(icily) No
We are not supposed to be backing you up
What  mean is -- We're a team
We work together
So work with me, not against me
Okay
Frank stares at Susie for a long moment
suppose we can bring it down a little
'll drop the eighths
Okay
Susie looks at the two brothers
Okay
'  - Frank is on Willie's telephone
In the front of the store, just out of earshot, Jack sits at a beat-up grand, while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another
'm telling you, Ray
She's got a voice like an angel
What
Frank glances furtively across the room to where Susie, making a very sexy silhouette against the front window, is running her hand over a pearl-white piano
(continuing) No,  wouldn't say she's got a body like an angel
As Frank continues to talk in the background, Susie looks over at Jack
Hey, he's not sore, is he
He'll come around
Susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano
(continuing) You never sang before
Not for money
With my mother
Jack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand
(continuing) She used to waitress downtown, nights, when  was a kid
On the way home, we'd sing
You know how people whistle when they're nervous
My mother sang
She always said you're never alone with a song 'cause thousands of people know the same song and even though you can't hear 'em, they're singing with you
don't know
If they were, they were all singing safe inside their apartments
(shrugging) But it worked
We always got home
Ever since, always wanted to sing
never took lessons or anything, though
guess you guys took a lot of lessons
Jack looks down at the piano in front of him
Yeah
We took a lot of lessons
Jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets ready for the night's gig
Nina, standing next to him at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds
You shave like an old movie, Jack
As Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins to soap her face in the mirror
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop
Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him
Is that what you used to do
My days are not the old days, genius
What are they
The recent past
Oh
(nodding to the ceiling) Bigfoot gets his out of a can
How do you know
saw his stuff in the bathroom
Oh
guess it's getting serious
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him
hope not
He's already busted the springs in two chairs
Hey, what's this
Nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush
Ivory
Looks old
Older than me
Wow
Jack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face
Nina picks up the razor
Hey, what do you want to do
Grow a beard
Why not
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay
What's a prom
Ever go to church
Nina nods
It's like that
Only you gotta dance
As Jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard stand-up, prominently displayed in the lobby
It is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation at the bottom: "With Guest Vocalist
" On the other side of the lobby, Frank is pacing nervously
Where the hell is she
It's early
told everyone seven-fifteen
Didn't
Seven-fifteen
She'll get here
Just like the day of the auditions, right
Jesus
How's my hair
Awe inspiring
Yeah, well, Your's isn't
(taking out a comb) Let me run a comb though it
Get out of here
Come on, stand still
Get out of here
It's not gonna hurt you
'll hit you, Frank
swear
Frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to feint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair
Jack hits him
(holding his shoulder) You hit me
told you  was gonna hit you
He looks capable of hitting him again, too
All right, all right
'm a little tense
You're a fucking alarm clock
just wish she'd get here, that's all
She's here
Susie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress, is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up
Christ, look at her
You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back
(walking over) Good evening, Miss Diamond
You're late
Where's my name
What-
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster
We'll talk about it later
Right now, you gotta get changed
Changed
Where's your dress
(to Jack) What's he talking about
Is there a language problem here
Your dress
For tonight
Where is it
Do  look like 'm naked
That
You can't wear that
What's wrong with it
It's orange
(to Jack) Am  missing something
Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and pulls her toward the door
Come on
Hey
Come on
We don't have much time
Time for what
Frank, Jack and Susie dash through a cavernous downtown department store, the brothers turning a few heads with their tuxedoes
As they reach the ladies' department, Frank begins to flip through the dress racks
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid
Just look
What do you wear
nine
(offended) seven
My wife wears a seven
You don't look like a seven to me
wear a seven
Okay, okay
Here, how about this
(looking) Save it for your wife
We're not exactly silly with time, you know
Jack, you find anything
Jack, somewhat out of his element, is looking at belts
No
Here, how's this
Frank holds out an inky black dress
Susie gives it a long look
(continuing) Close enough
Let's go
Frank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room
Hey, pal
don't know about you, but where come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go
All right, but make it quick
(remembering) Shoes
What size do you wear
(from the dressing room) Nine
Nine
Nine
(to himself) Big feet
Frank and Jack work the shoe department, scouting the endless rows
See anything
(holding one up) How about these
Jack, for crying out loud
Your bachelorhood's showing
(seeing something) Ah, here we go
Frank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the , who's waiting on a woman
Hey
Do these come in black
'll be with you in a minute, sir
don't have a minute, pal
Yes or no
(glowering) Yes
They come in black
Okay
Give me a pair of nines
Pronto
The Salesman looks casually at Jack
Does he want a pair, too
As Jack and Frank return to the dress department, Frank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper
All right, we got your shoes
Just then, Susie steps out of the dressing room
Even Frank stops at the sight of her
What do you think
Uh
good
(turning to Jack) Zip me up
The dress is open down to the small of her back
It's a nice back
Jack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully
(continuing) Shoes
Right
Frank puts the shoes down and Susie steps into them
They're tight
They're nines
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens
You can buy new ones tomorrow
Oh, thanks
Don't worry
We'll take it out of your share
You're a prince
As the trio rushes into the hotel service entrance, , the assistant manager, appears
You better buy yourself a watch, Frankie
We had a little emergency
Yeah, well, 've got a little emergency
You know what 'm saying
(seeing Susie) Who's this, Minnie Pearl
All eyes turn to Susie's dress, which still has the tags attached
(moving off) Jesus
want seventy-five minutes, Frankie
You hear me
This is going well, isn't it
The three rush into the kitchen
We need scissors over here
Who's got scissors
(turning to Susie) Okay, remember
Jack and  go on first, do the set-up, then introduce you
And you say
(deadpan) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
can't tell you how thrilled  am to be here
It's like a dream come true
And speaking of dreams
Right
Piece of cake
tiny  in an apron walks up with a meat cleaver
Carlos, that's,a cleaver
need scissors
() No scissors
Jesus Christ
All right
Let's go, Jack
Fix your tie
Jack and Frank exit
Susie stares a little warily at Carlos and his cleaver
Jack and Frank slide quickly behind their pianos
About half the tables in the room are filled
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge
My name's Frank Baker and no, you're not seeing double, it's just my little brother, Jack
Some laughter
(continuing) 'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight, because we've got a very special evening planned
Susie sits on a stool while Carlos positions the dress tags on a cutting board
As a  from the bar passes by, Susie snares a drink from her tray
Hey
Just a sip
To kill the butterflies, okay
Okay
But no lipstick
Susie takes a quick sip
There
No one's the wiser
Nice dress
As the Waitress exits, Carlos brings the cleaver down with a sharp chop, severing the tags
Appreciate it, Ace
The audience is laughing
But seriously, folks, as  sit here tonight, looking out on all your kind faces,  can't help but feel some of us have met before
We may not know each other's names, we might not recognize one another on the street, but we know each other just the same
And over the years we've shared something
little music, a little drink, a little laughter, maybe even
a few tears
But  guess that's what friends are for, huh
Applause
Jack puts out his cigarette
Oh, brother
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and
This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all
She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as 'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place
Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond
Applause
Susie strides out of the kitchen, past the busing station, and up to the microphone stand, which, unfortunately, is not on
(continuing; whispering) The switch
Hit the switch
Switch
(as she hits it) What fucking switch
Silence
(continuing; very demure) Pardon me
Jack and Frank look at one another, then, before outrage can set in, plunge into the opening number
Susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly
(continuing) can't tell you how thrilled am to be here
For the moment, the audience doesn't seem quite sure how thrilled they are to be here
(continuing) 'm all smiles, darling Through and through
' exits the elevator and, hearing Susie's voice coming from the lounge, stops
He looks to the  behind the front desk
thought the Bakers were on tonight
They are
Well, who's that
The Clerk looks up from the register and listens
don't know
Frank
Judging from the faces, Susie's as big a hit in the lounge as she is in the lobby
Head thrown back, eyes closed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long extended note, then swooping down in a dramatic, exhausted bow
There is a split second of silence, then thunderous applause
Magic
The new trio, fresh off their first gig, come out of the service entrance into the night
Fucking
She says fucking in front of an entire room of people
said  was sorry
(to Jack) Did you hear it
Fucking
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time  got out there anyway
(directly to her) Fucking
For Christ sake,  said it, didn't do it
(pulling out some bills) Besides,  don't think they were too offended, do you
(grabbing the bills) Give me that
Hey
We are not a saloon act
We do not take tips from dirty old men
(innocent) was gonna split it with you guys
We do not take tips
'll apply this to the cost of the dress
Frank puts the money in his pocket
Susie stares at him, steaming
Then  want my name on the poster
And my picture
(taking off her shoes) And these shoes are too goddamn tight
Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot
Jack is leaning against the wall, watching it all with amusement
Nice girl
Frank's expression we hear the   of "New York, New York" and we see: Susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after another, playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences, no empty tables now
As the  ends, we   the cardboard stand-up, newly done over with a picture of Susie and an accompanying exclamation: "See the Sensational Susie Diamond
" As the   sounds we -- : ' Jack and Frank, once again in the office of the supercilious Lloyd, waiting as he prepares their cash envelope
Yes, sir
That's quite a girl you boys latched onto
She a local
Born and bred
Lucky for you
Well, there you go, guys
Don't spend it all in one place
Oh
you want to count it, Jack
We trust you, Lloyd
You know that
Frank takes the envelope and begins to leave
Say, Frankie
Since 've got you here
How's next week look for you guys
Frank glances at Jack, giving it to him
Jack's eyes go cold
We'll call you
As Lloyd's face drops, Jack and Frank step into the hallway and begin to walk slowly away, playing it cool, then glance at one another and begin to walk faster because they're about to burst out laughing
By the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing, tripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and onto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz together, laughing giddily, until they see - standing under an awning, lighting a cigarette - Susie, watching them with raised eyebrows
Jack and Frank, frozen in a clumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing their throats and squaring their cuffs
Susie exhales a plume of smoke, studies them a moment, then smiles slightly
Night, Bakers
As she turns away, Jack glances up, watching her trim shadow disappear down the street
Gray and cold
The streets swept with rain
And once again the tentative piano: " , jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
Oh what fun it is to ride
Oh what fun
" Jack and Eddie are sitting in the waiting room: small and dirty and packed with pet owners and their animals
After a moment, a  with a clipboard appears
Barker
(no takers) Jock Barker
(realizing it's him) Baker
Jack Baker
Right
Bring him back
Come on, Ed
Jack and Eddie follow the Woman down a corridor
You should've brought a leash, Mr
Barker
The doctor doesn't like to be bitten
He doesn't bite
They never do, Mr
Barker
Baker
Right
In there
The Woman points Jack and Eddie into a small room
There is an examining table, a sink, and on the wall, a chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats
Jack glances around the room, then comes back to Eddie, who's staring up at him
You shoulda brushed, pal
Just then, a  in a white coat breezes in
() Ah, labradorus retreiverus
Good fellows
Quiet, but able to appreciate a good joke
Dr
Beasley pats Eddie on the side, then turns to Jack
Beasley
Baker
What's our friend's problem
Teeth
What's wrong with them
They're falling out
Uh-oh
That's not good
Let's get him up here
Jack lifts Eddie up onto the table and Dr
Beasley opens Eddie's mouth for a look
It doesn't take long
They gotta go
(a take) How many
Five's my guess
Maybe more
Won't know till  get in there
(consulting his clipboard) Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning
Isn't there something you can give him
pill or something
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr
Baker
It spreads into his chest
Then the heart goes
We wouldn't want that, would we
How will he eat
Start him out on cottage cheese
If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes
Go down like pudding through a hot pipe
No bones
No bones
Jack looks at Eddie
What do you do to him
Don't worry, Mr
Baker
We'll knock him out
He won't feel a thing
think maybe 'll bring him back next week
The sooner we do this the better, Mr
Baker
Jack steps out onto the rainy street alone
He glances back at the vet's with second thought, then moves slowly off
' Jack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the refrigerator
carton of cream, a few eggs -- there's not much there
He takes a small container of cottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an empty shelf
As he closes the refrigerator door, he glances around the apartment
It is very still, very quiet
He looks up at the ceiling absently, then walks over to the window and looks out
There is a mug of coffee there on the sill
He takes it and holds it in both hands for a moment, then places it back on the sill
He sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over the ivory, not making a sound, then places his hands on the keys and begins to play
"Jingle Bells
" In the front window, room has been made among the photographs for one of Susie
Inside, Jack, Frank and Susie sit at a table, surrounded by empty coffee cups and cigarettes
Frank has several slips of paper before him with names and dates
The twenty-third
Yeah, here it is
We got the Carlton or the Plaza
Four day turns
What do you think, Jack
Jack is staring out the window
(continuing) Jack, you with us
The Carlton's a dump
No cover
No minimum
And they water their drinks
It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd
Susie, as she says this, is pouring sugar into her Coke
(watching) guess it's,the Plaza then
That brings us to the twenty-seventh
We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two
We take the Avedon, right
Simple
Frank rubs his chin and looks at Jack
Jack shakes his head
(continuing) The Park
It's only two nights
Why throw away a night
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through
Oh
(lifting her glass) Well, for Blackie then
By the way,  got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action
Resort, upstate
(likes "resort') Hey
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee
That's what  figure
Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls
Maybe it's legit
Maybe
'll call him
Make it collect
(shuffling his slips) That's it except for the first
We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth
All three-day turns
Frank looks at Jack
Draw
Susie shrugs
How'd you guys used to decide what gig to take
Jack and Frank exchange a glance
Uh, well
we flipped a coin
So find a dime
Let's get out of here
Jack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their collars up against the chill
Frank pulls on a pair of gloves
Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year
Where're your gloves
Jack shrugs
(continuing) Better take care of your fingers, little brother
Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks
' 'll take my chances
Frank pats his hands together and glances into the street
Something, huh
All those bids
Yeah
Something
Yeah
Well,  gotta go
You wanna get a drink
Frank stops, surprised
No,
Little Frank's got strep
Donna's been up two nights making sure the rest of us don't get it
Jack nods
(continuing) You all right
Yeah, fine
Okay 'll see you tomorrow night then
Right
As Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother, then disappears around the corner
second later, Susie comes out of the diner
Where's egghead
His kid's sick
(searching her purse) don't know
It's hard figuring you two as brothers
Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere
He takes after our mother
Yeah,well, a11  know is mother nature must be one crazy dame
Shit
Jack offers his pack of cigarettes
Uh-uh
never touch American cigarettes
(still searching) What's tomorrow again
The Stratford
Nice place
Fulla velvet
Even the bedspreads
(shaking the purse) Damn
Two-fifty a pack and  go through 'em like toothpicks
Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that
Huh
Paris Opals
Twelve-and-a-half cents
sat down with a pencil and added it one day
But figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best
(finding one) Ah, here's a lost soul
Jack lights it
She takes a draw
(continuing) Mmm
Like kissing a rose
Well, au revoir
Hey
(as she stops) You feel like a cup of coffee
You kidding
We must've killed three pots in there
Anyway,  gotta get home
Rest the pipes
You want me to walk you
Susie looks at Jack a little funny
No
Thanks
She starts to move away, then stops and looks back
(continuing) Hey, listen
You're not going soft on me, are you
mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like 'm some kinda princess when  burp
Forget it
mean, that'd be too creepy
With us working together and all
Forget it
Nothing personal -- Jack holds up his hand
Susie just stands there
Better hurry
You're a nickel down on your cigarette
Jack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his arms against the night's chill
He glances up at the flickering sign over the building: "Twenty-Four Hour Emergency Care
" Inside, a  with deep-set eyes is bent over a magazine
Jack hesitates then enters
Yeah
Jack glances around, ill at ease
(continuing) You want something, pal
If you're looking for a bathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner
The Kid goes back to his magazine
No, , uh, left a dog here this morning
He needed some work on his mouth
Regular hours are eight to five
Yeah, yeah,  know
was just passing by
Thought 'd check in on him
You can check in on him tomorrow
Between eight and five
Yeah, well, couldn't  take a look now
The Kid looks up at Jack with mild contempt
You want to know if he's okay
Right
(uncomfortable) Yeah
All right
Hold on
The name's Baker -- Save it
What's he look like
(puzzled) Black
Labrador
All right
they lay the dead ones out in the cold room
'll take a look
The Kid disappears into the back
Jack stands frozen, watching the swinging door come to rest
He looks like a man who, unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed to his neck
He fumbles for a cigarette, but doesn't light it
He waits
moment later, the door swings open
Nope
Just a couple poodles
Jack nods, then, moving stiffly, leaves
Outside, he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle
' On the floor, a long line of bowls, each containing a different concoction, all intended for the ailing Eddie
Eddie, lying a few feet away, shows no interest
In the kitchen, Jack is heating something up in a pan
tried Cheerios this morning
He didn't even get up
Maybe they took out the wrong teeth
He's just feeling sorry for himself
This is it, pal
Hear me
Two bucks a can
Jack dumps some brown slop into a bowl and places it next to the others
Nina and he wait
At first, nothing, then Eddie's eyes move
His nose twitches
His head lifts
Finally, he gets up and walks to the bowl
He eats
(continuing) Chili
draped in winter
Dark skies, people lost in heavy coats, the city's battered Christmas decorations hung tenuously across traffic-clogged streets
Over it all we hear " ,"  for the first time completely through, hesitantly but without error
As the  , we are: ' watching Nina strike the final chord triumphantly
She turns to Jack, who's been listening from the couch
(nodding to the ceiling) You're gonna knock her dead, kid
All done up in reds and greens for Christams Eve
Jack, Frank and Susie -- each decked out in their own little Santa hats -- perform "Silver Bells" for the happy crowd
Jack, smoking a cigarette, will not be mistaken for Santa Claus, but Susie looks adorable
Frank just looks happy
As they finish, the crowd applauds
Jack, now sans Santa hat, enters the bathroom off the lobby and finds Santa Claus standing in front of the mirror, fussing with his beard
Hey, Frank
You recognized me
Just a lucky guess
So what do you think
Very realistic
(not buying it) Yeah, well, what can  say
Dad must've had forty pounds on me
Jesus, you remember him being this big
Jack looks in the mirror
Yeah
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother
Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay
Jack and Frank step out into the lobby, thus giving a few people, Susie among them, the curious privilege of seeing Santa Claus exit a men's room
You want to come out to the house tomorrow
The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on
Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit
Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move
We could use another appetite
Thanks, but 've got plans
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know
gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway
(coming up) Well, well
Ho, ho, ho
You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank
For the kids
(moving off) Merry Christmas, you two
Don't forget
We leave the twenty-sixth
Frank pushes through the revolving door and steps out into the street in his Santa suit
He do that every year
Every year
Aren't the kids asleep
Every year
So why's he do it
guess in case one year they're not
Jack looks into Susie's eyes, then crosses to the door and exits
Susie watches him go, then turns to the desk clerk
Call me a cab, will ya
' As Jack enters his apartment, he senses a presence in the room and looks over to the old phone booth
Nina is sitting inside on the little stool, her head tilted against the glass
Jack studies her a moment, then takes the carton of eggnog he's carrying into the kitchen and grabs a pair of glasses
He pulls a chair over to the phone booth and sits down
How'd the show go
Okay
How'd yours go
Not so good
Jack looks at Nina's face, tender and young in the soft shadows of the booth
After a moment, her eyes shift to the carton in his hand
Eggnog
Jack nods
(continuing) From Hurley's
Eighty proof
What d'ya say
Think you can handle it
Nina nods
Jack begins to fill the two glasses
Jack
Yeah
Can  stay here tonight
Even if she comes here
Jack pauses a moment, then closes the carton and sets it aside
Sure
He hands Nina her glass, then takes his own
Merry Christmas, Jack
Merry Christmas
'  - Jack and Nina are standing in the middle of the room, looking down at something
What do you think
Eddie, outfitted in a brand new, spanking red dog sweater, stares up at Jack and Nina, wondering why he's the object of so much attention
Very cool
- , (sporting his new sweater) make their way across an empty cemetery
Nina is swinging a bottle of whiskey
(looking around) There were more flowers last year
Mr
Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's
Says he can feel it in his elbows
hope it snows
want to make a snowman
You ever make a snowman, Jack
Sure
That's what  want to do
want to make a snowman
As they come to a plot of ground, they stop
There are two matching headstones, one for Jack's father, fully engraved, and another for Jack's mother, bearing only her name
Jack studies the plot a moment, then crouches before his father's marker: "
Adoring Husband of Eleanor, Loving Father of Franklin and John
" Jack brushes some dirt from the face of the stone, then stands
(continuing) Now
Jack nods
Nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours it onto the dead man's grave
(continuing) Merry Christmas, Mr
Baker
They stand another moment, just looking, then turn away
As they begin to walk, Jack sees Eddie in his new sweater sniffing at a gravestone
Hey, Eddie
Have some respect, will ya
Jack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building
moment later, Frank pulls the car up to the curb and Jack gets in
Susie is sitting up front
Frank, burning with the afterglow of a holiday spent with family, cheerfully maneuvers the car through the city
So
How was everyone's Christmas
Jack and Susie stare disconsolately out the window
(continuing) Too early, huh
Well, there's coffee and donuts for whoever wants them
How about a maple bar, Jack
Jack shakes his head and takes out a cigarette
(continuing) Uh, Jack
if you don't mind
Jack stares at the back of Frank's head, then puts the cigarette away
Susie takes a peek in the donut bag and looks a little sick
(continuing) By the way, if anyone gets bored, Donna packed some travel games
They work wonders with the kids
Frank reaches under the seat and hands Susie a sack full of magnetic games, puzzles, and plastic cubes
(continuing) You two could play checkers
Maybe we should just listen to the radio
Sorry
It only plays static
Susie looks at the radio, then at the games in her hands
How long did you say it takes to get to this place
- Jack is staring out the window at the winter landscape, an unlit cigarette dangling from his lip
Susie is gnawing on a donut, deeply obsessed with an elaborate plastic puzzle
Any more coffee
Susie snaps out of her trance and shakes the Thermos
Uh-uh
Hey, what's this
Susie notices an old, leather-bound ledger
Inside, there are hundreds of tiny entries
(continuing) You play all these places
Baker's unabridged
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise
What's with the stars
Virgins
Virgins
First times
Hey, look at this
crepe-covered car surrounded by several other passes by
Jack stares at the beaming newlyweds as they glide past his window, two kids starting life in a beat-up Eldorado covered with toilet paper
(continuing) When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack
Two years ago
March
(consulting the ledger) He's right
He's always right
Go ahead
Pick a virgin
Susie looks at Frank curiously
(continuing) Go ahead
(scanning the book) Okay
The Fantasy Inn
Jack
(staring out the window) November
'71
First night
Day
Wednesday
Last
Sunday
don't believe it
told you, he's got the gift
Same with music
Hears it once and he's got it
Frank smiles into the rear view mirror
(continuing) My brilliant little brother
The hotel, done in a sort of King Arthur motif,is built right on the ocean
Frank guides the car down a simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out
Will you listen to that ocean
It's
Frank takes a deep breath
(continuing) And how about this air
'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life
Smells like fish
Of course it smells like fish
We're on the ocean
What'd you expect, Chanel number five
(to herself) Smells like tuna number two to me
It's paradise
That's what it is
Paradise
As Susie and Jack follow Frank up the drive, Jack notices the beat-up Eldorado in the parking lot, its toilet paper streamers blowing gently in the ocean breeze
The lobby is done in royal reds and blues and there are a lot of swords on the walls
Franks steps up to the front desk
Hi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys
Glad to meet you
'm Terrific Tom
No
We're the entertainment
() Oh, right, gotcha
You got bags
Outside
Blue Chevy
(ringing a bell) Cyril
Chevy
Blue
Take 'em up to the Guinevere Suite
lanky boy in velvet jodhpurs and high stockings ambles out for the bags
Tom hands Frank the room keys
(continuing) Right on the ocean, Mr
Baker
You can practically dangle your toes in the water
Tom wasn't kidding
The immediacy of the ocean beyond the window is almost scary
You believe this
'm telling you, we're getting away with murder
Two shows a night and the rest of the time we live like kings
It's a crime
Jack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed side by side
Suddenly Susie comes through the bathroom
Hey, we're connected
Great
Great
Yeah
Susie shrugs and returns to her room through the bathroom
thought we had separate rooms
(opening drawers) We do
She's got hers, we've got ours
Hey
Wash and Dries
thought we all had separate rooms
Come on, Jack
It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together
It'll be like when we were kids
Relax
Enjoy the view
Jack, Frank and Susie are in the dining room, which, like their rooms, looks out over the ocean
Dinner is over and they're well through a second bottle of wine
You're kidding me
As Charlie Steinway is my witness
Peggy Lee
Tell her
She was staying at the Grand downtown
It was April
April seventeenth
That one  remember
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in
Pearls
White gown
Beautiful
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars
few bars
What'd she sing
People
' You think Streisand, right
Hot that night
Chills
Through the whole audience
could hardly play
Wow
You ever see her again
No
We got a picture, though
One of the waitresses had a camera
(to Jack) God, we were just kids
That was something, wasn't it
Jack nods
Frank shakes his head, still lost in the spring evening years before, then notices the newlyweds sitting across the room
(continuing) Hey, will you look at that
They must've bought the same map we did
What do you say we send a bottle over
don't believe it
You're a romantic, Frank
He's drunk
Not true
Besides, Jack's the romantic
Oh yeah
He's just afraid to show it
Aren't you, little brother
Have some more wine, Frank
Good idea
(lifting his glass) To Peggy Lee
Frank, standing, dressed in pajamas
Jack is staring out the window at the darkness
'm putting my stuff on the right, okay
Okay
figure that way we won't get confused
Right
Unless you want the right
No, you take the right
We might as well do the towels the same way
Okay
just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning
Good idea
But if it doesn't work out, let me know
'm,flexible
Right
Frank nods and moves to the bed
(continuing; re: the bathroom light) You leaving that on
Yeah
All night
Yeah
We're gonna be here a week
(puzzled) Yeah
So you're gonna leave it on
Every night
For a week
Yeah
You mind
Why would  mind
don't know
mean,  always did it as a kid
figured it was no big deal
Is it
big deal
Jack just stares at Frank
(continuing) Oh
didn't know
mean,  always did it as a kid
It was never a big deal then
Was it
Jack just stares at Frank
(continuing) Oh
Well
You want me to turn it off
Jack just stares at Frank
(continuing) 'll turn it off
Jack turns back to the window
Forget it
It's no big deal
- The next morning
Jack and Frank are standing in a huge dining room, appraising two elegant grands
They're beauties, huh
Jack steps up to one and runs his hand over the keys
(continuing) Reminds me of those Steinways Willie used to have
Frank taps a few notes on his piano, humming happily
Jack begins to echo his brother's notes, listening
After a moment, Frank notices
(continuing) What
short, stubby   in a charcoal suit strides into the dining room, followed by Terrific Tom
( ) Good morning, gentlemen
'm Mr
Daniels, the manager
believe 've spoken to one of you on the phone
(offering his hand) That'd be me, sir
Frank Baker
This is my brother Jack
Jack, slouched against the piano, smoking, nods
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos
We were assured they were in tune
Yes, well, they are
Then 'm afraid  don't understand
They are in tune
But not with each other
Is that important
Uh, well
Yes
It's important
Frank glances nervously at Jack
Tom, who're we dealing with on these
Mr
Reynolds, sir
But he's gone on vacation
called this morning
Well, gentlemen,  don't know what to say
Not being a musician myself  find it difficult to grasp the magnitude of this
don't suppose there's any way you could just
accommodate
Accommodate
don't think  know what you mean
think what Mr
Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is -- Why don't we let Mr
Daniels tell us what he's trying to say
assure you, Mr
Baker, no offense is intended
simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we
Frank dogs Jack down a hallway
Jack
Jack
You're acting like a kid
No, that's your problem, Frank
You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old
What's the matter with you
So the piano's a little out of tune
So what
(stopping) Christ, can't you hear it
No
never hear it
(shaking his head) Maybe
Sometimes
don't know
But  won't let it bother me
Doesn't it matter to you
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years
So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat
So what
Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack
Nobody
So why should you care
Because  can hear it
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on
Understand, little brother
Frank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror
Jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean goes dark
After a moment, Susie enters wearing a little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair
Hey, fellas
What's the word
Nothing
(continuing) What's with you two
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle
Susie looks at Jack
Then Frank
0-kay
As Jack, Frank and Susie perform "Strangers in the Night," dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor, while others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails
As the song ends, the couples applaud
Thank you, thank you
(as applause dies) You know, Susie and Jack and  only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family
And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also
So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever
don't be a stranger
Stop
Say hello
Introduce yourself
Because here, there are no strangers, only friends
And family
Right, Jack
Right
love you, Frank
(stunned) What
love you
just wanted to say it
Frank stares incredulously at Jack
Uh, well,  love you, too, Jack
(moving quickly along) So
Susie
How 'bout it
Huh
Got another song for us
Oh
Yeah
gotta bunch of them
Well then
shall we
Frank corners Jack as they exit the stage
Susie looks around nervously to see if anyone's watching
(whispering) What's the matter with you
'm sorry, Frank
All that talk about family
just got emotional
How dare you say you love me
It won't happen again
Scout's honor
What's with you guys
Someone needs to grow up
won't take it, Jack
Sure you will
Jack pushes past Frank and leaves
Frank watches him go, then turns to leave himself
Middle of the night
Jack, fully clothed, is sitting on the rim of the tub, smoking
Susie enters
Oh, sorry
With the light always on, it's hard to tell
It's okay
(the cigarette) Last one
Can't sleep
In and out
It's the waves
God's music, my mother used to say
She was crazy for the ocean
Yeah, well,  wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets
How's egghead
Like a baby
You
In and out
Jack nods
Susie looks at him carefully
(continuing) If you want,  got a pack in the room
No thanks
never touch French cigarettes
- The next morning
As Jack passes through the lobby, he hears the plaintive  of a
Curious, he goes to the dining room and peers in
The tables have yet to be set for the evening and, except for Frank, the room is empty
What the hell are you doing
(not looking up) What's it look like 'm doing
'm tuning a goddamn piano
Really
Yes, really
don't want you to be unhappy, Jack
If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune
Jack smiles to himself and crosses the room
How's it coming
Fine
How long you been at it
(shrugging) Half-hour
Once  finish this octave 'm gonna get breakfast
You see what's on the buffet
They stopped serving two hours ago
Two hours ago
Time flies, huh
Frank looks despairingly at the pianos
(continuing) could give you a hand
If you want
- Jack and Frank are eating lunch
Frank has a tiny stack of blue cards he's perusing
He holds one out to Jack
What do you make that
Paruchi
Jack nods
Frank continues to go through the cards as he speaks
(continuing) You haven't seen Susie, have you
No
Why
Just wonder what she's up to
never see her
Makes me nervous
She's a big girl
Yeah, well, she's our girl now
think we better keep an eye on her
There's trouble there
(another card) Hey, listen to this
Ethel and Bert Lane
Married seventy-five years
You believe that
What the hell are these
Dedications
came up with the idea on the road
See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room
The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it
Daniels went crazy for the idea
(whispering) And that's not all
Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability
Like he wants to line something up
think he's got a hard-on for Susie
Excuse me
Frank jumps
in a bright flowered gift shop dress pokes her head in
'm sorry to interrupt, but when  saw you sitting here,  just had to come over
Florence Simmons
Uh
Frank Baker
This is my brother
() Oh,  know,  know
My husband and  saw you play last night and it's the most remarkable thing
Oh
Well, thank you
No,  mean you
(to Jack) have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you
Exactly
You don't happen to have a Huckleberry in your family tree, do you
Afraid not
Well, it's frightening
You could be his twin
Of course, he doesn't have your talent
Musically, mean
He sharpens things for a living
Lawn mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge
Can imagine
Jack is having a hard time imagining Florence Simmons
(continuing) Well, anyway,  just had to make sure there was no relation
You play wonderfully
Both of you
Florence Simmons gives a little flutter of a wave and exits
Funny, huh
What
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere
(smiling) Wonder if  saw him 'd think it was you
- Jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the hotel, watching the waves tumble into one another
As he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices Florence Simmons standing a few yards away with a camera
just know my sister won't believe me
Do you mind
Jack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the camera
really hate to impose
It's just that the resemblance is so extraordinary
(focusing) wonder if you could turn this way so your face isn't in the shadows
As Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other end of the walkway
They are leaning into the wind, her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face
Say cheese
The camera clicks
(continuing) Gotcha
Would you like a copy for yourself
The hotel develops
Jack glances away from Susie and the man
No
Jack's expression  is heard and a moment later we -- : - That evening
The trio has just finished a song and those on the dance floor are clapping
Thank you
You know, before we came out here this evening, Susie and Jack and  were looking over your dedications and something struck us
Susie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea what he's talking about
(continuing) We realized that, well, we're really not so different from one another after all
Oh sure, we may be at different points in our journey, but we all travel pretty much the same road
And so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce you to two very special couples
First, married for all of two days, please say hello to Helen and Bud Wilson
Helen
Bud
Those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young couple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the front of the room
(continuing) And now, our second couple
'm talking about Ethel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen
Now, Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if  told you they'd been married for fifty years
Why
Because, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane have been married for seventy-five years
The audience lets go with an audible "ooh" and applauds enthusiastically
(continuing) Ethel, Bert
Get up here and show these kids how it's done
path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make their way to the dance floor
(continuing) Aren't they a sight
They are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the dance floor than Frank anticipated
He nods to Jack and they launch into "The Anniversary Waltz," but have to keep repeating the opening passage while they wait for Ethel and Bert
Finally, everyone on the dance floor steps back and, with some help from a few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the way, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center of the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite
Jack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking
He hears Susie's door open, then  -- hers and a man's
He puts out his cigarette in the sink and leaves
- The next morning
Frank, the early bird, is returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm
Whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to see a man exit Susie's room
Astonished, then outraged, he goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply
(opening door) Forget your tie, handsome
Frank
You want to tell me what the hell's going on
Huh
just saw a man walk out of your room
Uh
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here
So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency
Decency
Hey listen, pal
No
You listen
had my doubts about you from the beginning Hey
Frank and Susie turn
Jack is standing in the hallway
(continuing) What're you trying to do
Wake up the whole goddamn hotel
We were just having a little discussion about morality
Some discussion
just saw a man walk out of your room
You saw wrong
Huh
He's with the hotel
called him
What are you talking about
We had a leak in the bathroom
He fixed it
He was wearing a suit
He had to come quickly
It was a big leak
How come  didn't hear anything
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank
You've always-been a heavy sleeper
(looking at Susie) Unlike me
Frank looks at Jack, then Susie
guess
If  jumped to
Forget it
The three stand there awkwardly for a moment
Well
Frank shrugs lamely and exits
Boy, he comes on like a hurricane in the morning, doesn't he
Jack just stares at her
(continuing) Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in
Hey, business is business
He turns to leave
Susie's eyes narrow
It wasn't business
It was pleasure
Just dinner and dance, right
Jack, Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the smaller dining room
It is conspicuously quiet
The main course seems to be a conscious attempt to ignore each other
Finally, Susie looks at Frank
Then Jack
Then out the window
Paradise
- Jack and Frank's room
It is New Year's Eve, just before show time, and Jack and Frank are in their tuxes
Frank is on the phone
(into phone) Yes, Daddy promises
'll bring you one of the little glasses, how's that
Just like Grandma has
It has a picture of the hotel on it and everything No, honey, they don't sell puppies here
Who
Well, we'll see
Let me talk to Mommy, okay
Okay,sweetheart
Happy New Year
(waits) Hi, honey
She says Angela Secoli got a puppy for Christmas
Explain to her why we can't
don't know, tell her you're allergic
It's not lying
Well, okay, it is lying, but
All right, then tell her 'll explain it
He what
No kidding
Without the training wheels
(affected by this) Well, that's great
Tell him, tell him
can't wait to see
No, no new bike
Maybe for his birthday
Okay
Listen, honey,  have to go
We're on in ten minutes
Yeah, Happy New Year
love you
Frank sets the phone down and stares at it
Jack studies him a moment, then Frank suddenly claps his hands
(continuing) Well, let's go
The public waits
- mass of swarming, jubilant people
The voices are high and loud and there's not a hand without a champagne glass
Couples lean into one another intimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting strangers without hesitation
(yelling to be heard) All right, everyone
This is it
Let's hear it
Ten
Nine
Gradually, the entire room joins the chant
/ Eight
Seven
Six
Five
Four
Three
Two
There is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to find that certain someone to kiss in the new year
In this moment, Jack, Frank and Susie find themselves oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them, their presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten
Finally, Susie walks over to Frank and gives him a kiss, then goes to Jack
They hesitate, then kiss lightly, pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's eyes
Frank sounds the first chord of "Auld Lang Syne" and Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place on the stage
As she begins to sing, the others in the room, all intimate friends for one brief moment, begin to sing with her
/ Lest old acquaintances be forgot
As the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the sound of the  until the ocean is all we hear and we see: - Jack, lying on his bed in the dark
He opens his eyes, squinting against the light from the bathroom, then glances over to Frank's bed and detects the outline of a body in the darkness
Swinging his legs over the side, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes
Suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in the next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast from the bathroom
It is a little boy
Startled, Jack stares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the bathroom
Rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and gently eases the door open a few inches
Inside, swimming murkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man
His back is to Jack, but Jack can see that the man is shaving
As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees that water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and gathering in pools on the bathroom floor
Jack wakes up
He stares at the ceiling, listening to the waves, then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom
It is dark
Turning, he glances at Frank's bed
It's empty
Dark and soundless
Balloons, streamers and the other debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow
Frank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at the ocean
As Jack crosses the room, he looks up
Ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear
Happy New Year, little brother
What're you doing down here
Celebrating
Join me
The party's over
No, you're wrong
It's just beginning
Come on, have a drink
Show your big brother how it's done
Frank pours him a glass
Jack notices the bottle
Expensive hangover
gift
Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr
Daniels
(toasting Jack) We, dear brother, are a fucking smash
(nodding) Yup
They want us back
Easter
It seems they have this egg hunt every year
Only not for kids
Adults
They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn
Then afterwards, they have a dance
An egg dance
Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open
It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites
Slippery business
Frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then leans his head back, staring at the ceiling
(continuing) You know, 've never kissed my wife on New Year's
Not once in twelve years
Jack studies Frank as he stares at the ceiling
The Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it
With the blue glass
Jack looks up at the chandelier
The Royal
Right
The Royal
When's the last time we were there
Couple years
February
April
Right
It's incredible how you do that
Remember things
useless talent
Drove me crazy when we were kids
The way you never looked at the music
Miss Simpson would just play it and
Frank snaps his fingers
They were simple songs
Not for me
still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that
Otherwise,  forget
just forget
But you
You never forget
Ever
(turning) So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday
told you
It's a useless talent
Frank studies Jack a moment, then stares out at the ocean
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he
Yeah
always think of him on New Year's
How he used to pour us each half a can of beer
Remember
You always threw up
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice
He loved that about you
He was just having fun
It was like you'd passed some test, you know
It was just a can of beer, Frank
Yeah, but he told you things
He never told me anything
Even though  was the oldest
It was always you two, running off, doing things together
You could've come
could've
But he didn't want me to
You're making things up, Frank
Maybe so
(pause) You ever go back there
Where it happened
Jack stares at the angry ,  even through the thick glass
No
- The next morning
Jack is sitting outside the hotel, watching  and   pack up the Eldorado
The streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal to the car's exterior
After a moment, Frank exits with a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a tiny souvenir shot glass
Want one
Jack shakes his head
(continuing) Ah well, the kids'll break a couple anyway
Suddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the newlyweds are heard
Give me the keys
You're not going to drive
Give me the keys
You're not going to drive
It's my goddamn car
It's our goddamn car
Give me the keys
No
Bud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car
Frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a madman, trying to catch her
Finally, when he gets close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot
think 'll warm up the car
- Cold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite appealing after a week in paradise
- The trio, looking road-weary, is parked in front of Jack's building
It is very late
That takes care of this week
The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri
The tenth's out
What
can't make the tenth
What do you mean
mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance
Be reasonable, Jack
play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank
How much more reasonable you expect me to be
Jack gets out of the car
Frank shakes his head in exasperation, then looks to Susie
How about you
Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend
(distracted) Huh
Forget it
' Jack lets himself in and closes the door quietly
In the darkness he can make out Nina and Eddie, curled up on the couch, asleep
Above them, hung carefully on a string, are some paper letters: "
" In a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of several historical eras but which might best be described as Modern Pilgrim, Jack, Susie and Frank perform "Feelings," while waiters in huge Paul Revere hats pass in and out of view
Feelings
Wo wo wo
Feelings Wo wo wo
Feelings
Jack, Frank and Susie exit the lounge to applause
can't sing it anymore
What
That song
can't sing it anymore
'm gonna get sick
What're you talking about
They love it
'm gonna throw up, Frank
mean it
Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay
(as to a child) Susie
It's one more show
One more time
That's all
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night
Frank,  can't sing that fucking song anymore
She's yelling
The kitchen workers are glancing over
Jack studies her as she tries to calm herself
(continuing) need some air
few minutes later
Jack comes out of the hotel and sees Susie pacing
He sits down and watches her for a moment
You're gonna wear down those heels if you don't give it a rest
She stops
(continuing) Relax
We'll drop the song
Guess  got a little scattered
It's a shitty  song
Susie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel
How do you do it
Every night
Practice
(pause) There are worse songs, you know
Not many, but a few
Susie nods
Jack studies her
Something's on her mind
Listen
(looks into his eyes) Nothing
'  - record is spinning on Jack's phonograph as the sun goes down outside his window
As we the phonograph and  the window, we  Jack at the piano, playing along with the record, lost in concentration
- Susie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally glancing up at Jack's apartment, where the  can be heard
After a moment, she drops her cigarette on the sidewalk
There are half a dozen others already there
' The record finishes, but the needle doesn't pick up, bumping into the label
Jack glances at the clock next to him and gets up
He puts on a jacket, then takes a pair of gloves and pulls them on carefully
As Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing, surprised
Jack, wearing the same look of concentration he had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the other end of the street
Susie starts to call after him, but stops
- The sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky
We see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club
- Jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage, where a trio is playing
He has a drink in front of him, but it is untouched
After a moment, the trio finishes and the pianist, a huge black man named , nods to the applause
Thank you
As most of you know, we like to shake things up here every so often just to keep you people on your toes
So 'm gonna take a little rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit in
He drops by about once a year just to keep his hands clean
Ladies and gentlemen
Jack Baker
Jack rises to polite applause and shakes Henry's hand
As he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment, not moving, then nods to the two men behind him
As they begin to play, we recognize the music from the record
Jack waits, then brings his hands to the keys
As he plays, his face is suddenly calm
Peaceful
- Later
Jack comes out of the club and into the night, lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street
(
) You were good
Jack stops
Susie
can keep the beat
Better than that
Jack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing, beginning to walk again
What's the matter
Nothing
What'd  say
Nothing
You're upset
'm not upset
All  said was you were good
(stops) Look
You don't know good
All right
What's that supposed to mean
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you
You were good
Let's make a deal
You shut up
You were good
(exasperated) How do you know
(yelling) Because  saw the other people
And they knew you were good
You were good, goddamnit
Jack studies Susie, then glances off
For a moment, they just stand on the corner, not talking
(continuing) So you wanna get a drink
' Nina
Who's Nina
Friend
Friend
What's she look like
Maybe  can help you find her
She's four feet tall
Ed
Ed
How many people live here
Eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at Susie
Jack moves to the kitchen
have to make him some chili
Okay
(a look) Sure
'  - Light from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic as Jack's apartment will ever get
Outside the window, the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming
Susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as if they were veils
(at window) Like diamonds, huh
never get over it
When  was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish
Like  could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself
She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes,  don't know, it was like she really believed it
How come you didn't close your eyes
She looks surprised by the question
don't know
guess  didn't trust the night like she did
Susie finishes her drink and sets it down
(continuing) Let me have a cigarette, will you
All of mine are down there on the sidewalk
Jack looks at her curiously
(continuing) Long story
Jack gives her an American cigarette and lights it
(continuing) You know,  saw you guys once
You and Frank
At the Roosevelt
Must've been a cheap date
Soap convention
Soap
Yeah, they got a convention for everything
At least he was clean
Boy, the guys  met when was with the service, you wouldn't believe
The older ones, they were okay
Nice
Polite
Pulled the chair out for you
But the younger ones
(shaking her head) Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again
She thought she had it all figured out
But she wasn't so smart
There are killers with palms like a baby
Susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly
(continuing) It wasn't so bad, though
'd get a nice piece of steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift
Usually whatever the guy was into
Got a socket set once
Believe it
The guy looked like held just given me four dozen roses
(almost wistful) But  stayed at the Hartford once
You should see the rooms
All satin and velvet
And the bed
Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow
Hard to believe sleeping in a room like that don't change your life
But it don't
The bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't
You wake up the same old Susie
(pause) didn't always, you know
If  liked the guy
Susie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink
She looks out the window again
(continuing) Sometimes  wish the sun would never come up
She stares at the lights another moment, then turns and nods to the phone booth
(continuing) So what's this
Jack frowns, takes another drink
History
Huh
My father proposed to my mother in there
No kidding
It's a small phone booth
(continuing) The both of them
In there
He called her
Oh
So what's it doing here
Long story
You sending me home
Jack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven
Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't
Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous
Nervous
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition
You're kidding
He had a mind that escalated things
So, what happened
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb
Susie blinks
(continuing) don't know
Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her
Wow
But  still don't see how
Ma didn't want it around
After
Oh
Jack glances out the window
(continuing, carefully) Frank said you saw him die
Jack glances up quickly, surprised
He nods
(continuing) Frank said --- Frank wasn't 'there
Susie stops, looks down
Jack studies her for a moment, then decides
He took me out to the docks one day
We did that a lot
There were other places, but he loved the ocean
He'd worked boats as a kid
Never got rid of it
It was always in him
He'd drink a little when we'd go
If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig
To make me laugh
(pause) He drank a lot that day
Susie studies Jack as he stares into his glass
(continuing) There was a lot of wind
He was up on this cargo shelf, right over the ocean
And he started to do the jig
One minute he was there
(shrugs) thought it was a joke at first
He did things like that
Games
(pause) was laughing when it happened
Jack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances up and catches Susie looking at him
You got pretty eyes, you know that
' Jack's bed
In the darkness, we see Susie's profile, her eyes looking up toward the ceiling
Jack's body falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck
'   - We see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater, sleeping on the fire escape
'  - Susie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the window as she absently hits a key
She is smoking one of Jack's cigarettes
Distracted
Jack comes to the doorway and watches her
Plink
Plink
Plink
You gotta move 'em around if you want to play a song
Susie starts, looks at her hand on the piano, pulls it away
Oh
Hi
Sorry
Coffee
Yeah
No
Look, if you want to leave
Yeah, maybe
No
God,  hate these cigarettes
Susie throws the cigarette out the window, then looks down
(continuing) Shit
think  started a fire
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano
Susie smiles weakly
(continuing) Why don't you go
'll see you tomorrow night at the Ambassador
Susie doesn't move
followed you last night mean,  was here
Outside
was about to come up when you came out
Jack waits
(continuing) The reason  came by
couldn't tell Frank
'm leaving
The act
Susie stares up at Jack, but he says nothing
(continuing) It's a
met this guy at the resort
He liked my voice
And, it's
He thinks  can sell cat food just by singing about it
Can you believe it
Susie tries a laugh
Jack nods
(continuing) You can always get another girl
(looks out window) There's always another girl
Jack and Frank stand in a lounge, talking to , the manager
Busboys move in and out, preparing the room for the evening
Sick
How sick
The flu
So she's got a few sniffles
Doctor's orders
Nick frowns, looking at the two pianos across the room
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie
It's unethical
Look, Nick
You want us to pack up, we'll pack up
What am  gonna do
Put a record player out there
(exiting) Bad, Frankie
Bad
(to Frank) What're you doing
Just until we find another girl
Cancel, Frank
You want to know how much  got tied up in deposits with Willie
We're in for three weeks solid, Jack
Better give her pneumonia
Jack and Frank find themselves in the back room of Willie's again
They do not look happy
(
) Remember me
Jack and Frank look up
girl in a yellow and black dress is in the doorway
She looks like a bumblebee
Monica
Monica Moran
came in the last time you guys were looking for a singer
(smiling) Perseverance
First rule of show business
Jack and Frank just stare at her
() bought a book
That's what it says
' - Frank is looking at a list
We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a couple of weeks
Larry Shelton said he'd let me know by Friday on the Ambassador
That's it
Frank folds the paper carefully
(continuing) got some calls out
Things that might be good for us
Frank looks over at Jack for the first time
He's leaning against the building, staring at his shoes
(continuing) We'll try for a girl again next week
Jack nods
(continuing) Okay
Well, the Roosevelt then
- Once grand, now dark and dusty looking
small crowd
You know, my brother and  have been playing together, gosh,  don't know
Jack
Twenty-eight years
No response
Bored, brutally indifferent faces
Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little different
We were just kids
Just about the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil
We must've shaved three lives off old Cecil, huh, Jack
Frank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the microphone, is the only sound in the room
(continuing; hanging tough) Yeah, well, anyway
It's nice to be back here in the Roosevelt Room, because this has always been
Frank falters as he sees Mrs
Baker enter the lounge and seat herself at a table in the back of the room
Jack follows Frank's eyes and spots her
(continuing) a very special place for Jack and
(recovering) And tonight we'd like to open with a very special song
It's the song my mother and father danced to the night they were married
This is for them
Jack watches as Frank gives Mrs
Baker a hug
You should've told us you were coming, Ma
We would've come and got you
Spur of the moment
So what'd you think
Thrilling
(glancing at Jack) Both of you
The audience was a little off tonight
few empty tables
It's cozier
Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night
guess you're,right
Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack
Theo's should still be open
No, no
You boys are tired
No, we're not
Jack
No
'm tired
Really
should get home
You sure
(nodding) Just call me a cab
cab
Ma, come on
My car's just a half block down
You wait here
(smiling) All right
Frank dashes out of the lobby
Jack and Mrs
Baker watch him go, then turn to each other
Mrs
Baker smiles awkwardly, then surveys the lobby
(continuing) It's beautiful, isn't it
The brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs - once covered with velvet, now with a cheap imitation - look old and dowdy, but the room still maintains an elegant dignity
Yeah
This was quite,a place once
After the war
On Friday nights they had dances in the ballroom upstairs
It was beautiful
Crystal chandeliers
White tablecloths
Orchids floating in the punch bowls
It was a wonderful place to be young
Jack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room
After a moment, she nods toward the lounge
(continuing) It went well tonight
Frank works hard
And you don't
He leads,  follow
Is that the way it is
Pretty much
He mentioned you had a girl for a while
singer
For a while
She left
Yes, well, it's probably best
No sense bringing someone else in
suppose
Mrs
Baker glances into the lounge, at the two pianos
Funny
Watching tonight,  was remembering when you were young
How  used to stand in the kitchen, listening to the two of you practice while  did the dishes
(smiling) My two little radios
Sometimes 'd stop and go to the door and just watch
Sometimes your father would too
(pause) He liked to listen to you play
Did you know that
Jack shakes his head
(continuing) You miss him, don't you
It's been a long time, Ma
Yes
(pause) supposed you still have that old phone booth
Jack nods
Mrs
Baker smiles, then it fades
(continuing) His love scared me, you know
The day he died he left a flower on my pillow
Jack looks puzzled
Suddenly his mother reaches out and very gently touches her fingers to his face
(continuing) You look so like him
They stand like this for a moment, connnected, then Frank steps in from the street
Your limo's ready, Ma
All right
Mrs
Baker takes her hand from Jack's face and turns away
Just before she exits, she looks back
(continuing) Good night, Jack
Jack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops
Across the street, talking to a man, is Susie
She says a few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the arm and begins to walk away
Jack watches her retreat, then follows, moving quicker as he draws close
As he reaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns
Not Susie
The woman stares at Jack, startled
For a moment, he doesn't move
Finally, he lets go of her elbow
Sorry
- few nights later
Frank guides the car through wet city streets
It's two  and raining hard
We're not getting paid then
No
Nothing
We get nothing
told you, Jack
It's a telethon
No one gets a cent
(a pause) What's it for
don't know
Some disease
What disease
don't know
You don't know
It's a disease, Jack
We're against it
It's not a moral decision
(another pause) What channels it on
Seventy-one Seventy-one
What's seventy-one
(defensive) channel
It's just a little further down the dial, that's all
Look, it's publicity
Publicity's publicity
Right
Jack stares at Frank
Right
Jack and Frank make their way down a hallway
The guy said to find Studio  and turn right
What's that say
Suddenly, a rapid-fire   resounds through the corridor
As Jack and Frank turn, they see a huge in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them
Fast break
Jack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it around the corner
guess it's that way
Jerry Lewis need not fear
This is strictly a tin foil and crepe paper operation
Along one wall is the "phone bank," monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite, in makeshift bleachers, is the audience
huge tote board, set on rolling astors, is next to the phones
The total, at 2:15 , is $1125
38
As Jack and Frank enter, the kid in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the camera
This must be it
'll see when we're on
Frank leaves
Jack glances around the studio like he's walked into a nightmare
At the phone bank, a heavyset in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over
Both the sweatshirt and the cap have "Earl" printed on them
() You the magician
No
(disappointed) Oh
What do you do
Jack points to the pianos across the room
Piano
(hopeful) Two at a time
My brother and
One each
(disappointed again) Oh
(indicating the kid in the wheelchair) What's wrong with the kid
Knee
Tore it up against St
Anthony's
Right before the accident
Accident
The fire
The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym
As Jack registers this, Earl's
Frank returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair
We're on after Meadowlark
(seeing Jack's face) What's wrong
Are you kidding me
Are you fucking kidding me
What
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium
(worried) What
Before Jack can further enlighten Frank, the kid in the wheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux strides in front of the camera
He's  , the host
Let's hear it for our own Jimmy Marshall, shall we
The audience applauds
(continuing) As most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist on that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant High this year
Luckily, the doctors tell us Jimmy'll be able to play next season
That is
if there is a next season
(Uncle Sam) That's where you come in
Pick up that phone
Make a donation
Let's keep our kids off the streets and in the gym where they belong
Applause
(continuing) All right
Well, friends, what can  say about our next guest
(consulting a card) He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with us two of the most respected men in the musical entertainment field
think you'll agree with me when  tell you we're in for a real treat when say that we have with us
the Fabulous Bunker Boys
Come on out here guys
Vince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and Frank enter from the right
(continuing) Whoops, there they are
Hey, nice suits, fellas
(to camera) Now  know a lot of you amateur musicians out there are going to want to rap with these guys and don't worry
Right after they finish up here, they're going to be manning the phones
Maybe we can even convince them to raffle off a few piano lessons if we're lucky
What do you think
The audience applauds
Jack glares at Frank
He shrugs
(continuing) Well, all right then
What are we waiting for
Take it away, guys
Jack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and begin to play
As the music rises, the studio becomes very quiet, almost still
Unfortunately, Jack and Frank are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously begins to
Suddenly, Vince steps out again
(continuing) Uh oh
We know what that means, don't we
It's time to turn the board over
(to Jack, Frank) 'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute
Let's bring out the board
Two post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board right in front of Jack and Frank
Jack looks positively homicidal
Jack
Jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave
Then, seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the basketball and fires it at Vince
What the -- (pointing) You're a fucking creep, you know that
oughta kick your ass
(whispering) Jack, you're on television
Shut up, Frank
Earl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on Jack's shoulder
What do you say we go for a walk, pal
Get your hand off me
Come on, friend
can smell it on you
Get yourself a cup of coffee
You'll forget what you're angry about
Go fuck yourself
(eyes go hard) You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace
don't see any ladies here
Except maybe you
That does it
Earl takes hold of Jack's collar and starts to-wrestle him roughly toward the door
Hey, leave him alone
Do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up
You're a lousy dancer, Earl
Don't you know the man's supposed to lead
Earl shoves Jack into the hallway, hard
Jack stumbles back against the wall
Who do you think you are, asshole
Liberace
Jack walks down the street, mindless of the rain
Frank follows a few yards behind
Jack
We just,passed the car
Jack
This is a tuxedo
Three hundred dollars
(pause) You gonna talk to me
Or is this Jack's famous silent act
Look, it was for publicity
Do you understand
Publicity
Jack stops and stares at Frank incredulously
What-are you
fucking moron
It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank
Who's watching
Your wife
Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party
What do you think
Look
didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday
What was  supposed to do
had the pianos anyway
Basketballs, Frank
You had us playing for basketballs
'm sorry
should've checked it out
screwed up
But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig
(incredulous) What
It wasn't professional, Jack
It was a stunt
stupid-ass stunt
Jack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger
What's happening to you, Frank
You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it
You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight
We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank
What's happened to your dignity
Dignity
Who the hell are you to talk about dignity
Frank suddenly steps forward and reaches into Jack's jacket, coming away with a bottle
(continuing) This where you get your dignity, Jack
This is where you get your courage
Jack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away
(continuing) No, let's do it straight for once, shall we
Frank tosses the  into the street, where it (continuing) Let me explain something to you, little brother
See, 've got people who depend on me
've got a wife and two children who expect to wake up every morning with food on the table and heat in the house
got a mortgage
got car payments
got Ma's medical bills
Oh yeah, and  got you
Yeah, you
Jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so fucking sure he's better than everyone else
Don't you think 'd like to walk up to one of these assholes and blow smoke in his face
Goddamn right  would
But  can't
Because  have to be responsible, little brother
have to make sure the numbers balance out in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go on living their lives
You don't win medals for it, but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if folded up shop
So don't talk to me about dignity, little brother
You're drawing on a weak hand
Jack stares at Frank through the rain, then turns and begins to walk away
(continuing) Great
Terrific
Walk away
You're good at that, Jack
Just don't forget to stop off for another bottle of courage on your way home
(pause) That's what he'd do
Jack stops, his back to Frank
(continuing) You've found the perfect solution to all the pain in the world, haven't you, little brother
Eight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store
You're weak, Jack
Just like he was
Jack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness
Stay off it
No, let's stay on it
'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god
For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig
He left a wife and two sons
He wasn't a hero
He was a fool
(eerily cold) You weren't there
That's right
wasn't there
don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy
(coiled) Fuck you
No, fuck you
And fuck him too
Fuck the both-of you
Jack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs Frank by the lapels
(continuing) Hey, what're you doing
Hey
Jack flings Frank against the wall, pounding, pulling and slamming him in a fitful rage
(continuing; scared) Jack
Jack
Frank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect himself
Jack hovers over him
How's it feel to have your little brother beat the shit out of you
Huh
Huh
Jack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face
Frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself, and catches a blow on his fingers
My hands
My hands
Jack grabs one of Frank's hands
(mocking) Your hands
Your hands couldn't take the blue ribbon on amateur night
Jack bends back Frank's fingers
(terrified) Jack
Who's weak now, big brother
Jack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack
Jack
Frank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain
Suddenly Jack stops
Looking at Frank's hand, still clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior as Frank
Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped and dirty
He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split and bleeding
He no longer looks dangerous
He looks hollow, frightened
'm through with it
can't do it anymore
Frank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack just turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and disappears into the rain
begins
sad, plaintive solo piano
And we see: Jack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain over now
Frank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the dim glow of the streetlights
Jack, letting himself into his apartment and standing there
Alone
Frank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off the engine
Jack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly
Frank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as the sun begins to come up
Jack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand
'  - The next morning
Jack is sitting on the windowsill, watching the   the
He glances at the phone across the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes to the phone
He picks it up hesitantly, then dials
It rings
Again
Again

) Hello
Jack blinks
It's Cindy
Hello
Hellooooo
(fainter) Daddy
Daddy
Someone's on the phone and they won't talk
Jack sets the phone back down on the cradle
Jack stands in a dark bar
It is early morning and the light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere
big, beefy  with a bar towel hooked in his belt is talking to Jack
If they wanna talk about their wife, you listen
If they wanna talk about their job, you listen
If they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen
That's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until send you home
Okay
Jack nods and points to the piano in the corner
That it
How many you need
Jack walks over to the giano and strikes a note
It's out of tune
Trust me, the way  fix a martini, it'll be in tune
The  , sad and plaintive, and we see: ' Frank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother and sister tandem who would be better served by an obedience school
While the little girl pounds incessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles around the room, destroying everything in sight
and we see: Jack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner where Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed
and we see: Jack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing throughout the previous scenes
It is after midnight and the tables are empty
Only a few somber men remain at the bar
They do not appear to be music lovers
As Jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys
There is a glass on the piano with money in it
(
) thought the Bakers didn't take tips
Jack glances up, but he knows the voice
give it all to charity
Susie nods
Saw the sign outside
Got your own sign, huh
Yeah
Got my own sign
So
We outgrew each other
Yeah, well, like  said, it didn't figure
You two
You don't pick your brother
Yeah
So how's the cat food business
Terrific
'm doing vegetables next week
Jack nods
What kind
Huh
Vegetables
Oh
Carrots
And peas
None of the important ones
Susie tries a smile
Takes a breath
(continuing) Listen
you want to get a drink
got a new place
Or we could go to a bar
(looking around) Well, maybe not a bar
But  know a place uptown, if you want -- 've given it up
Susie stops
No kidding
Well
guess you can't do a reunion over tomato juice, can you
(pause) Anyway, if you're ever in the neighborhood
wrote it down
Susie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands it to Jack
They lock eyes for a moment
(continuing) Tell egghead  said hi
If you see him
If  see him
Susie nods and walks toward the door
(continuing) Hey
(as she stops) You got pretty eyes
Susie smiles
As she leaves, Jack studies the slip of paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass
He glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's wake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle
' Frank sits alone in the darkness of the den
The cardboard stand-up is there, along with several old photographs, including one showing two skinny kids in tuxes standing with a glamorous Peggy Lee
After a moment, Donna enters
Frank
It's late, honey
Frank stays staring at the photograph of Peggy Lee
(continuing) Mrs
Lerner called after dinner
Robbie can't make his lesson tomorrow
Donna waits for her husband to say something, then sees the photograph in his hand
You know how good he is
It's like breathing with him
've always envied it
But tonight, looking at all this -- at his face --  don't know
Maybe it's worse
For him
(gesturing to the piano) It's funny
When  sit here and play
nothing
But when  was up there with him
It was like  had the gift, too
'  -  - Frank is standing in the hallway of his house, leaning against the bathroom door
It's locked
Come on, Jeremy
Open the door
Somewhere in the house, the
Frank ignores it
(continuing) Jeremy
You want me to call your father
He's not going to be very happy when he hears he's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you to sit on the toilet
Donna, looking shaken, steps into the hallway
Honey
You believe this
The kid won't come out
'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing  know he's locked himself in the bathroom
There's nothing sharp in there, is there
Honey
Where are our kids
Has he got one of them in there
Frank
Frank finally looks at his wife
She's crying
- Jack rushes down a hospital corridor and heads for the nurses station
As he moves to the counter, Donna appears
Donna
Where is she
Donna just shakes her head
We tried the apartment, but after that we didn't know where to call
Jack looks frozen
(continuing) Frank'll be back in a moment
He took Little Frank to the bathroom
Jack begins to back away slowly
(continuing) Jack
Jack moves aimlessly down the street, slipping in and out of shadows
Finally he stops inside a closed storefront, his back up against the window, and looks down at his hands
They're shaking
Jack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting
After a moment, the door opens
It's Susie
Jack
Hi
Well, this is some surprise
(seeing his face) Hey
You don't look so good, pal
Susie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway
(continuing) Jack
Jack looks up
(continuing) You want to come in
He nods
Susie steps back and Jack enters
(continuing) Let me get the light
No
He stares directly into her eyes
(continuing) Leave it dark
'  - Jack is standing at the foot of the bed, looking down at Susie's naked back as she sleeps
He studies her face as if looking for something, then takes his coat and begins to leave
used to do that
Jack turns
Susie is looking at him
(continuing) Sneak out in the morning
Before the guy could wake up and ruin it
Never figured 'd be on the other end of it, though
didn't want to wake you
(smiling slightly) Yeah
Thanks
For letting me in last night
Funny how life repeats itself, huh
Over and over
Like a song
Jack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and turns for the door
(continuing) Hey
Jack stops, his hand on the doorknob
(continuing) Am  gonna see you again
Jack looks at her face, beautiful in the morning light
Yeah
You're gonna see me again
Susie smiles slightly
Okay
Jack is standing across the street from his mother's house, just looking
After a moment, he crosses the street
As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it, kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there -- cat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the damage smoothed and widened by time
He runs his fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks toward the house
Through the screen door, Jack can hear a sound and see partially into the front door
Half the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light
He opens the door and enters
Inside, the movie  is , the tail of a completed   like a whip against the carriage
Jack   the  and the room falls entirely into shadow
For a moment, the house is silent, full of ghosts, then, gradually, a  is heard coming from the kitchen
As Jack comes into the kitchen, he finds Frank searching through a cabinet
He watches for a moment
What're you looking for
Frank turns quickly, surprised
didn't hear you come in
What're you doing
Oh
was just hoping for something to drink
But it seems the old lady was dry
Not even a bottle of cooking sherry
Jack nods
Frank looks nervous
(continuing) Uh, we already boxed some things
figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff
It's in there
If you want to get started
Later
Frank nods
Silence
(continuing) Is everything done
The arrangements,  mean
Oh
Yeah
It was all worked out before, you know
She and Dad had taken care of it
Right
set it for Wednesday
The ceremony
They're doing the stone today
(pause) It's okay
Wednesday
Yeah, fine
There's not going to be a viewing
figured with the kids and all
Sure
Jack glances around the room
Pictures on the walls
Handmade curtains, lightly faded
It's funny
Before, whenever  came here, the house seemed small
But today
can't keep up with it
keep losing my wind
Frank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a moment
(continuing;glancing away) God,  could use a drink
Jack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat
(continuing) Oh
Well, great
'll get a couple glasses
Frank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there
(continuing) Damn
Donna must've packed them up this morning
Jack holds out the bottle
Go ahead
No
(showing the seal is unbroken) Bought it on the way over
Clean as a nun
No, it's not that
can't drink from the bottle
gag
Oh, yeah, right
forgot
Frank looks embarrassed
(remembering) Oh, hey,  want to show you something
Come on
Jack follows Frank back into the front room
Frank stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and gestures Jack to the other
(continuing) Hit the
Go ahead
Jack steps over to the other piano and taps, then Frank does the same
Jack glances up in surprise
(continuing) 'm right, aren't
They're in tune
Jack hits the note again and nods in amazement
(continuing) All these years
She kept them in tune
Can you imagine
Now why would she do something like that
Frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades
Suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot glasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a different hotel
(continuing) Hey, what do you know
Looks like we can have that drink after all
(picking up a few glasses) What's your pleasure
We got the downtown Ramada
We got the Travelodge on Route 41
And
the Mallory
'll take the Mallory
Good choice
Frank blows some dust off the glasses
(continuing) Looks like these got a few years on them
This'll kill 'em
Jack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano benches
As Frank swallows, he winces
Jesus
It suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old familiar place, staring into his glass
How're your hands
(surprised) Oh
Fine
It was nothing
Couple sore knuckles
Nothing
You know, that night,
It just all came up
Yeah,  know
Me, too
mean, you can play
You're okay
(smiling) can keep the beat
Jack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses
(continuing) Charlie called
Yeah
Yeah
Larry Shelton
Blackie
Couple others
Donna said even Lloyd called the other day
Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh
Yeah
Jack and Frank lock eyes again
Frank's glance drops to Jack's glass
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory
Five years ago
(thinking) November
Right
It was someone's birthday
Halloran
Daughter's
Sweet sixteen
Christ, that's right
How could forget
What a nightmare
She asked for it
told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said: (in unison) What my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets
She got it all right
Jack and Frank glance at one another, little boy mischief glowing in their faces
Suddenly they swivel on the pianos and begin to play "You're Sixteen
" (singing) She comes on like a dream Peaches and cream Lips like strawberry wine She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine
Ribbons and curls Ooh, what a girl Eyes that sparkle and shine You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine
As Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing
After a moment, their voices die and the house is quiet again
Full of ghosts
Each stares at the tiny keyboard before him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment
It is quiet for a very long time
Finally, Frank looks over
Well
One more time
Jack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass held out
He hesitates, then picks up the bottle
One more time
