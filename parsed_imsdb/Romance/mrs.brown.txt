Brown ,  - Begin on black
The sound of rain driving into trees
Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and right, as he searches the lightening-dark
crack to his left
He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past saplings and plunges on
,  - Close-up on  as he bangs against a tree and heaves for air
face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome, bruised lips, liverish
He goes on searching the dark
Stops
Listens through the rain
beat
Thinking he hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and races on
,  - tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length, breath coming harder and harder
But even now there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace
He leaps fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes forward, never stumbling once
,  - bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops
With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow circle
His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the wildly swaying trees
There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him
He spins round, bellows deep from his heart: God save the Queen
And fires
Nothing happens
The trees go on swaying, the storm goes on screaming and  just stands there, staring into empty space
pause
Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on him that he is alone
He stares at the thrashing trees, waving their mocking arms at him
His hand lets the pistol drop to his side
He feels the rain drench down his face
And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds
He shifts a foot
His dress-shoes are covered in mud
He goes on staring into the dark
Nothing
Just the wind and rain
Gradually, we pull back, higher and higher
As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice: : "1864" : (
) have sent for a Mr
John  from Balmoral
Her majesty has mentioned him, on one or two occasions, as being a most devoted outdoor servant to Prince Albert during his last days there
John  is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm
: ,  '   - The screen is black
As the camera pulls back, we discover that we are looking at a black night-gown
Queen  is sitting at her dressing table, while an elderly , also in black, works at her hair
(
) The depths of the Queen's sorrow remain impenetrable
She has now restricted herself to a regime of such ferocious introspection that we are all at our wits' end
,  '   - bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black
His desk is laid out as if for work
is brushing one of his suits before laying it carefully on the bed
(
) The Household continues, at her instruction, to observe the rituals now so familiar to her, in a vain attempt to render vivid that which can never be revived
Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water
,  '   - The hairdresser is pulling 's hair back into the widow's cape
For the first time, we see her face
It is set in a mask of severity
(
) It will not surprise you to hear that she continues steadfast in her refusal to accept any public engagements, however trivial
,  '  - bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal bed
His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side
somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed: , the Queen's physician
He is placing potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table
Behind him,   are busy stripping and remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the room
(
) Family and staff expend all their efforts endeavouring to draw her out of this state of unfettered morbidity, but to no avail
Indeed, Doctor Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe her sanity, unless some remedy is found
,  '   - is turning slowly around as a young completes the fastening on her black crepe dress
(
) We must hope, therefore, that this Mr Brown will appeal to the Queen's sentimental, though deeply-held, view that all Highlanders are good for the health
If she can at least be persuaded to take the air, the prospect of further recovery may seem less remote
The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress
winces slightly
(terrified) Sorry, ma'am
,    - We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads: "
1864
" stands against the sea front with a horse and cart bearing the Royal coat of arms
John  leads his pony along the dockside, towards the waiting driver
He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket
(
) He is arriving by boat this afternoon, by which time it is hoped Her Majesty will be in a fit state to consider riding out
,  '  - , the Queen's Private Secretary, is sitting at his writing desk, completing a letter
(
) As to that decision, along with all others, we remain, as ever, prisoners of the Queen's grief
(beat) Ever your devoted husband, Henry
He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope
He is a middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine and with a civil servant's stoop
As he looks up, we see a white-stockinged  standing to attention by the door
hands the letter to him
(') Windsor
: : " ,   " ,   '   - series of windows are being slammed open by white stockinged  as members of the   and hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and rushing to make the luncheon hour
, '   - Queen  heads down the empty corridor with two ladies-in-waiting,   and  , hurrying along a pace behind
, '   - Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into the icy dining room and take their designated places at the luncheon table
Everybody is dressed in mourning and nobody speaks
Wind whistles through the open windows
Silence
Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of , the Prince of Wales
He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff dressed and balding
He stands next to his young wife, , who fiddles nervously with her shawl, trying to keep warm
As  smooths down his thinning hair, bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation with the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers
Congratulations, Your Royal Highness
Thank you, Doctor
boy,  hear
Excellent, excellent
Yes
(beat) Albert Victor
Eddie for short
What do you think
fine choice, sir
Excellent
,    - leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms
The  leans in
Are you riding up front
looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved
'll stay with the pony, thank you
She's all the way from Deeside and she's not sure she likes you yet
The  shrugs and slams the doors on them
,   '   - reaches the dining room door and takes a deep breath
and   stop a pace behind
How many
is slightly taken aback
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am
Just them
Yes, ma'am
closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps through the door
, '   - Everyone stiffens as  walks in
Acknowledging the other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place
She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else sits and does the same
The meal is served immediately by waiting , who plonk the food down without ceremony
It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables starts eating heartily, straight away
Everyone does the same
Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence
,   - The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne House
few outdoor servants watch its progress curiously
, '   - The silence continues as  finishes her plain pudding
Immediately, servants appear at every place and whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have finished or not
Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the routine
clears his throat
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am
Whom
beat
takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with her napkin and rises
Everyone else rises too
Suddenly, the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, , and proclaims abruptly: (') That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex
Silk suits you well
(beat) But you are not eating enough
One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite
Yes, ma'am
nods earnestly
Lost to the effect her words have had, she marches out again
Behind her, she leaves feeling humiliated and crestfallen in front of all the others
takes her hand and squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console
- The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance and the  opens the doors
pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks the time
His eyes narrow critically
was due at a quarter past one
(beat) You're late
,  - few minutes later,   strides down the long corridor with  at his side
Their journey takes them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and householders hurrying about their duties
The presence of the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed portraits and busts that crop up along the way
and  could not be more contrasted
(in low tones) Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it
The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever
As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five
No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home
On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent
You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock
You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires
How will  know
(surprised to be interrupted) 'm sorry
How will  know what she requires
You'll be sent a message
Who'll bring it to me
Her Highness' Equerry
need a man who knows where  am
'm sure it won't be difficult to find you
That's not good enough
beat
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged
Aye, do
stiffens
beat
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries
No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household
came down at the Queen's request
'll take my orders from her
In matters concerning the Household, act on her behalf
takes the measure of him
Do you
Yes
(beat) do
glances up the corridor
So, is passing wind out of the question or do  need permission for that
refuses to acknowledge what he has heard
They reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the interview
As  am sure you remember from Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty addresses you directly
refuses to answer, so  knocks
After a moment, the door is opened by   who ushers them in
, '   - walks stiffly into the room and stops waits by the door
(
) Mr Brown, ma'am
is bent over the desk, working at one of her numerous red boxes
She scribbles furiously at a letter, underlining and accenting words as she goes
Finally, steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear
She carries on working
has time to survey the room
Dominating everything are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince Albert glimpsed in the corridor
Finally,  nods and   beckons  forward
He steps up in front of the desk and waits
looks up and  bows deeply
Silence
She stares at him for a long moment without apparently registering who he is
He towers over her, in bright tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black and knotted with tension
Finally, she finds her voice
She sounds nervous and edgy
Mr Brown
Ma'am
You are here safely
Aye, ma'am
You are well
am
And the pony
She's well, too
blinks at the sight of him
His presence is bringing him back
beat
Your family sent cards
It was much appreciated
'm glad of it
In an effort to control her emotions,  now sounds the same severe note as at lunch
But , unlike others, seems unaffected
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you
He would have approved,  am sure, of my calling on you in this way
(beat) trust it does not inconvenience you too much
've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters
Yes
(beat) You have a brother in service here, do you not
(furrowing her brow) forget his name
Archie
Yes
(beat) That will be company for you
Yes, ma'am
Silence
starts to tire
She takes a sip of water and spills a little on herself
Flustered, she searches for a hanky but cannot find one
hurries up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off watches all of this with genuine concern
When finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy
(') Honest to God,  never thought to see you in such a state
You must miss him dreadfully
stares back in stunned silence
coughs involuntarily
freezes
beat
You do not - he
get him out
(beat) Get him out
Get him out
Suddenly,  finds himself tugged backwards out of the room
rushes up to assist as  shouts herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing
, '  - Some minutes later,  is angrily unpacking a trunk
His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary ferocity with which he slams down every object
His younger brother, , sits on the bed
He's in his early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same distinctive kilt and tweed
(telling it fast) So the day they arrive, she greets the Sultan and his family with barely a word and then retires to her chamber
The Sultan, not used to State Occasions without a head of State, is standing in the lobby waiting for someone to tell him what to do
But the court is under strict instructions not to talk in the corridors so nobody speaks to him, not a living soul, for the whole afternoon
So now it's dinner and everyone's standing round the table -- still not a word -- waiting for Her Majesty to arrive
One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's getting a wee bit peckish to say the least
So finally, his wee laddy breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a slice in his mouth
Well, the uproar when she heard
You'd have thought someone had stolen the crown jewels
stares back, still pissed off
So
So, there are rules
Things you do and things you don't do
was just telling the woman how feel, for God's sake
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel
speak as  find, Archie
Not down south you don't
slams a drawer shut
lets it go and watches his brother
beat
(') So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting
think he nearly ruptured his truss
beat, then both men burst out laughing
, '  - The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants hurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper Servant's huge table for dinner
leads through this rush of activity
How much
Seventy a year
Not bad, not bad
How about yourself
Sixty
(grinning) That's pretty good for a ghillie
smiles dryly
They pour themselves a drink from the table
Prince Leopold
Is he the one who bleeds all day
So what does his valet do
Wash his poultices for him
It's better than shovelling horse shit
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones
She's hardly a full hamper herself
(beat) It's only grief makes her like she is
Three years, John
Is that not a bit long to be grieving
She loved him
Come on, man
There's love and there's
What
You know what  mean
'm not sure  do, Archie
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to
Hold on
He lets it go and moves on
Across the hall, he spots the pretty   watching them
Which one of us is she flirting with
The good-looking one
Aye
Then she's obviously not got enough to do
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself
Just be thankful you're not working for Household
The Queen never lets them out of her sight
But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy
beat
stares straight at him
'm no wee spat,
,   - The next day,  and her ladies are hurrying down a corridor on her way into the dining room suddenly stops and stares out of the windows
Her entourage are several steps past her before they realize what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions behind
Now we see what has caught her attention
is standing in the courtyard below, by his pony
She watches him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on
- Some hours later
It is now raining
gaggle of   hurry out of a carriage from their afternoon recreational while their frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas
John stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush around him, laughing and giggling
,   - Rain on the window
is walking in the opposite direction down the corridor with her entourage
She stops at the same place as before
(as if she had not seem him earlier) Who is that
Lady Ely peers through the rain
It's Mr Brown, ma'am
What is he doing there
He appears to be
standing by his horse
made no request to go out riding today
(beat) How long has he been there
don't know, ma'am
(nervously) He was observed earlier,  believe
At this moment,  comes down the corridor
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard
have no wish to go riding
'm very sorry, ma'am
can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions
Please make sure it does not happen again
Of course, at once
takes one last look and walks away
,  '  - Half an hour later,  stands at his desk facing What on earth did you think you were doing
stares straight back
Awaiting my orders
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it
You know that very well
didn't come all this way to sit on my arse
You will await your orders like everyone else
Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement
No
beg your pardon
,   - The next day
From a high window, we see scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of , who is standing exactly as he was the day before
watches impassively
,  - stands close to , shouting in his face
thought  made myself perfectly clear
You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it
(eyes straight ahead, shouting back) Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her
What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise
From the window above,  takes in his words beat
collects himself
Go inside at once
Is that the Queen's request
Yes, it most certainly is
turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back to the stables
,  - few minutes later,  is in the process of stabling his horse
Suddenly he turns
is standing at the far end of the stable with her entourage
Mr Brown
Yes, ma'am
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so
Yes, ma'am
Then why do you persist in doing it
Because  think Her Majesty is wrong
If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her
beat
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses
And  intend to be there when she's ready
Silence
The two of them stare at each other
,   - The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured landscape
Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the distance, the glittering sea
,   - sits side-saddle on a horse
leads her in silence
- looks up
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here
He thought it one of the best views in Osborne
It's a fine spot, ma'am
He thought so, yes
She stares ahead
(') In everything  do and everything say,  try to think, as much as possible, what he would do, or say, if he were here now
My Private Secretary wishes me to return to public duties-- She stops abruptly, but  cuts in
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two
Sir Henry is not alone
They all wish it
(beat) The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank-- She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk
(') It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not
Aye, ma'am
Yes
pause
(') have some letters in the saddle bag
wish to read them
walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon
(') cannot read them like that
undoes the ribbon and tries again
cuts in
(') You will hand them to me as  require
takes off the top letter and hands it to her
,  '  - The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as sit themselves down to dinner while prepare to serve soup
comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle next to an empty seat
moment later,  strides in
But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself down
Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room stops and stares at him in silence
fixes them with a look
An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in amazement at
smooth young man, ' , hurries up to intercede
' Mr
Carter, the Head Butler, sits there
Not now he doesn't
This is my place
' By whose authority
My own
little frisson of oh-my-gawdness
'  stares icily at him
' The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself
That's a tautology lad
(unable to stop himself seriously explaining it) If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally
That's understood
But as far as '  is concerned, it isn't
He stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of the under servants, who rushes over
There is a hurried exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out
Unperturbed,  brings out his flask and pours himself a substantial draft of whiskey
He turns to the pretty assistant dresser, sitting to his right
(') Are you dresser to Her Majesty
She blinks nervously at him
Assistant, sir, yes
tucks into his soup
Everyone watches and waits
What's your name
Mary Taylor, sir
Have  seen you up in Balmoral, Mary
hope to go up next year
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary
The assistant dresser thinks for a moment
Lord Tennyson, sir
nods
All conversation stops as the under servant bursts back in
She halts at the door, looking blankly from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler
beat
The old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the table
looks up from his soup
Am  the only one eating
With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats
,   - few days later
morning "drawing room
"  Standing round the unlit fireplace are  ,  , , the two    and All are dressed against the icy wind that whistles through the open window where  sits knitting busily while  stands beside her, coat buttoned up to the collar
has stationed himself opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes
He runs through the daily itinerary
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday
Dispatches, as usual, at two
(finishes, then coughs) The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend
He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience
Why
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government
No
shall be out walking
beat
watches closely now
coughs again, nervous
Then perhaps Your Majesty might consider it opportune if the Prince of Wales were to meet him on your behalf
stiffens
She speaks without turning
On no account
gives up
Politely, but firmly,  takes up the reins
Mama,  really do think it's time we made ourselves a little more
available
carries on knitting
(') think we must accept our position in the country is not entirely unrelated to the continued absence of the Monarchy from public life
(silence) thought perhaps we might consider a small gesture of some kind
looks up sharply
Gesture
thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps
(cutting in firmly) No dinners, Bertie
(beat) Why are you dressed for outdoors
It's so infernally cold in here
Cold is good-- (calling across) Is that not so, Dr
Jenner
'm sorry, ma'am
Cold is good
Excellent, ma'am, excellent
(trying his hand) But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity
(becoming very agitated) Why am  being lectured in this way
Forgive me, Your Majesty
In no way did  wish to suggest-- (cutting across him) will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy
Mother
Least of all my son
It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave
An appalled silence
With great dignity,  absorbs the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation in another direction
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host-- do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me
Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box
Silence
has crossed to the window and stares out at the view
Having recovered her composure, she turns to address them all
(') wish to take the Princesses for a swim
For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard
She continues
(') The turns  have been taking in the grounds have proved most beneficial to me, and Brown thinks that salt water will do me good
Bertie stares at her in silence while  and exchange a worried look
,    - The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen , in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck into the freezing sea
As she does so, the doors of the other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise follow her in
Dignity does not allow them to shout out, but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture
begins swimming around in a vigorous little circle
Don't potter, children
Swim
Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces
- Half an hour later, ,  ,   and two  watch as  helps  up some steps and onto her horse
He glances at the stiff line of householders and mutters curtly to himself
You could buy that lot for garden ornaments and still see change from ten guineas
The household do not hear this, but   has overheard and tries to suppress a smile
As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose
fastens it into the stirrups
(') Lift your foot, woman
Everyone hears this
obeys
Taking the reins, he then walks the  out of the courtyard
As they vanish from site, we hear
(
) This nation is fortunate in so much as it is not governed by force
: "1866" : - The speech continues as we follow the progress of a Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches from knee to knee
It is entitled, "Where is Britannia
" and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak
(
) but by a chain of traditions that have been cherished from generation to generation, because in them -- in our traditions -- are embodied all the laws which have enabled us to create the greatest empire of modern times
During the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and lands on the knees of the young, earnest
As he frowns at the picture in front of him,  winds up
(') but, even though we have amassed great capital and even though we have established an industry with no parallel in the world, yet all these mighty creations are as nothing compared to the invisible customs that shape our lives
To those honorable gentlemen of the opposition who seek to destroy the essential elements of this country,  say let them remember: England cannot begin again
During this peroration, we see  for the first time
He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like Dickens on Slimfast
He dresses almost dandyishly but speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance and cheek that is his key
To cheers from his back benchers, he sits
As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the Liberal benches
is different in almost every respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall
They stare levelly for a second, then  flashes a brilliant smile
plops the cartoon on his lap
Have you seen this
,   - few minutes later,  and  are strolling down the busy lobby corridor
Throughout their talk, Tory back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and offer their congratulations
Should we take it seriously
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism
Well, both
The question is, do we need her
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense-- My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion
The pass  in a huddle of cohorts
(') Gossip counts
Lord Aberdeen was right
This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk
(beat) Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close
So
We'll see which way the wind blows
sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers
,    - and  crash into the water
It is freezing
braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing Burns at the sea
My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here
My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer
Chasing the wild deer and following the roe
My heart's in the Highlands wherever go
is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns
,    - few minutes later,  and  hurry back up the cold beach to rub themselves dry
is very energized
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges
It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it
Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys
So
Someone'll send it on ahead
Aye, but will they
John, it's not your problem what she eats
The woman's surrounded by fools
(beat) She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning
Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight
takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his brother
She's got an army of people to get her up and out
But 'm the only one she trusts
stares at him
beat
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does
You want to be careful
'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan 'd be wearing anyway
That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs
(raising his hip flask triumphantly at the sea) 'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant
Indoors and Out
There's no stopping me now
- few days later
The clatter of carriage and horse as the thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle
: "" - mass of torches encircle the   as kilted and  swarm round the carriage, opening doors and clambering off boxes while a regiment of  play them in
Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse  opening the door to a smiling  as she climbs down, followed by and
Emerging from another carriage come  and  , staring grim faced at the castle
and alight from their carriage as  slips on his gloves and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance
Oh God, not the pipes
- The next day
High over the vast, bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch Muick
and  are riding fast towards the top
Reaching the summit,  points excitedly at the far horizon
What are those
What
Those, over there, there
(horse chestnut trees
) Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich
(beat) Craobhan-geanmchno
(bursts out laughing) How can  possibly say that with a straight face
lets it go and they ride on
(') am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals
" Are they worth reading
(beat) am told so
Who by
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming
What does he know about the Highlands
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years
That doesn't make him an expert
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject
don't groom a horse to have it admired by others,  groom it because it needs grooming
(curtly) do not do it for others
But Ponsonby thinks they are good
Just say what you have to say, woman
What other people think shouldn't matter to you
(snapping) Of course  shall say what  have to say
always do
The stare at each other until  kicks his horse on
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you

(beat) Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson

(briskly) She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt
If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before
She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires
That can wait till the weekend
There are important papers from -- It can wait
Anything else
Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such a long journey
She has only just recovered from a severe head cold
If  thought she wasn't up to it, wouldn't let her go, would

Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie
It should be discouraged
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive
It is quite late enough
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose
It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father -- (cutting in angrily) Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already
He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed
The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock
Mama
And that is my last word on the matter
Well, 'm sorry, but  really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant
It's the Queen's decision

They fling open the windows, slosh water on the fire, tidy up their two grubby , plump up the cushions, dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves up, all in the space of a few seconds
There's really no need for this
'll not have her seeing it like it is

She thinks if she warned you, you'd go pouring water on the fire and stuffing the knitting under the sofa
Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being house-proud

All right

Good
Oh and here are Douglas and John
Haven't you grown

And in your opinion
Is she foolish
The   stares blankly back

No doubt you've heard the rumors

My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy
Of course

The man's word is not to be credited
He is an arriviste of the very lowest water

She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops

He gives me a shout and we chase them down towards the loch until Grant has your men up against the stacks and he's shouting and cursing at them, "Why are you poaching on Royal land

Don't think  can't persuade her
don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused
She has always had a very healthy sense of humor
This is a slur on her good name
In as much as the article is about yourself,  think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you
Nobody has any rights over me

Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years
We need help
(long beat) Where is the old girl
Who
Mrs Brown
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction
She's never been less popular
In the press, perhaps
(holding up Punch) But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year
Time to wheel her out
She's refusing to leave Balmoral
What's her excuse this time
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move
Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity

Not at all, Dean
Good of you to spare the time

You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch,  take it

opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean Wellselly
The Dean clears his throat and starts to read
(as Wellselly reads) One of our madder brethren in the house was calling for disestablishment of the monarchy
Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified
Good Lord

Who told them that
have no idea
Why not
-- forgive me, ma'am,  am no wiser than yourself
Suddenly, 's temper goes and she shouts at him
No-one should think themselves wiser than me
(beat) It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning
It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded
It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely
Your Majesty -- (cutting right through him) Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors
(a pause, more quietly) am not a fool

Sometimes --  feel that Brown is all have left of Albert

Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion
Out of my way
Foolishly,  tries to barge his way past

In a roar of hooves and wheels, the Royal Carriage sweeps into the huge quadrangle

Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what  eat next

She was limping badly

Yeah, yeah,  did
Good man
And is she all right

Good
She's a good girl

The  pile onto him and he collapses under their weight
As he falls,  manages to yank himself round, bang up a fist and fling the others off him
But the   is up again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back
The others grapple his arms down, but  is incredibly strong
Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them fight to force him back

Dumping  against the wall, the men step back and start kicking the shit out of him

Not a sound
Finally, they back off, panting hard

His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting his teeth, while  crouches in front of him, tending to his wounds
And she sent no word down
They said you were drunk
(beat) Why don't you tell her the truth
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me
completes one of the dressings when  suddenly reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt
What are you doing
'm getting dressed
You've got three broken ribs, man
've got my duties to attend to
Don't be an idiot
You're in no fit state to go anywhere
She'll be worried about me
She'll get over it

And when was the last time she put herself out for you
Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant
Oh, 'm much more than that
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants
You watch your tongue
Come on, man, 'm telling you what you already know
You know nothing about her
When are you gonna see it, John
She doesn't give a damn about you
lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card showing a coy picture of a pretty woman
He holds it up, eyes blazing

There is one other matter

From whom
From Princess Helena and other members of your family

Waiting for her, smiling softly, is the Dean of Windsor,
You wished to see me, ma'am
She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods
,  - few minutes later,  and   are seated in a corner of the chapel, talking softly
She cannot bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how carefully he is watching her throughout the interview
This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles to be as honest as possible
My husband tried always to make me think more subtly
Of course he taught me so much and  can never repay my debt to him, or the love feel, even now
But, in truth, think  am someone who can only feel things while they are alive to me
For that reason,  know  do not have a subtle mind
know that
But work hard and  try to do my duty
(she hesitates; she is struggling now) However,  have noticed of late that my feelings of grief are not so strong and -- that  find myself leaning more upon the comfort of living friends
(beat) Friends close to me now
She stops herself
She is crying
watches her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words carefully
Your Majesty, a settled resignation is more lasting proof of affection than active grief
If the good Lord sees fit to bring one into contact with congenial fellow beings, one should not analyze one's reaction too deeply
To allow oneself to be comforted by someone else need not imply any disloyalty to the memory of the loved one
Silence

Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her disappointment turns to anger

tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland landscape
(
) Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three hours on the Irish Church Bill am as guilty as the rest of underestimating his reforming zeal
Tory days may be numbered, but  fancy there yet remains one last hope of deliverance
Wheresoever the blame lies, we must now close ranks and defend Mrs Brown's England
As for my interminable journey to the land of Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur

Reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors bang behind him
, '   - The next day
is playing the piano like she walks, with great vim and vigor
The tune is some quaint Scottish ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice, almost drowning out  ,   and who are meant to be accompanying her
They stand in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies
Ignoring them completely,  bobs up her head with a quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated
and the rest of the  stand a few yards off, smiling rigidly
, the consummate politician to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them
This man is in raptures of delight
And the more liquid his smiles, the happier he makes
He beams, she belts, until her children are drowned out completely
And then, with characteristic suddenness,  stops playing and launches into one of her tirades
The wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back, but  glides smoothly from delight to sober concern
How dare the Irish break with the Anglicans
If Albert were alive today he would never allow the Crown to give up Church patronage
No, the Irish must be told, very firmly, to stay exactly where they are
It is the thin edge of the wedge, Mr Disraeli
Next, you will be telling me that the Crown no longer governs this nation

But  lack your prose, Mr Disraeli
gives him a tiny smile
acknowledges it, then steers the conversation back
Of course  understand your concern
You miss your people
(a pause) And they miss you
registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the implied criticism
Then they may read about me
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful
Is that not enough
In so many ways
and yet it is your presence they crave
figurehead
has the measure of him
never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli
You,  thought, understood a widow's grief
Forgive me, ma'am,  cannot speak for the nation, only for myself
As Prime Minister  confess  miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and  should not burden you with it
The Household waits
Has he clawed himself back acknowledges his apology
Her voice drops and she talks directly to , straight from the heart
stay here because  am happy
(beat) Is that such a terrible crime
No, ma'am
At this moment the far door opens and  walks in
Time for your walk
Without a word,  rises from her chair and starts following him out
As they pass , she stops
This is my good John Brown
(taking him in) Yes
have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral
measures  suspiciously
What brings you here
man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen
It was remiss of me not to come earlier
smiles
stares
What do you know about the Highlands
am a blank sheet
Do you hunt
Occasionally
Dare say you can be taught
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill
If you hunt, you kill
counters effortlessly
Well then, 'll do my best
,   - Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud, crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly cold
Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party
The sound first
Like a small army, crashing their way up the winding path
urging on their horses and dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then the tall figure of   striding out in front
Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead
Behind them trot the men on horseback -- , ,  and other , each led by  and , among them Suddenly,  stops and raises a hand
The party halts
He listens for a second
Satisfied that he has found his quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen dismount as quietly as they can
As he waits,  winces slightly from the pain in his side
He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and drinks
All the time,  keeps his eyes on
,   - The stalking
Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill
stalks with , panting hard to keep up, eyes on his man, trying to make no sound
Suddenly,  stops
Very slowly he rises rides alongside and sees
huge stag staring majestically across the hillside
Keeping his movements smooth and slow,  brings up his rifle, cocks it and offers  the kill
With a deferential gesture of the hands,  declines stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his shoulder and fires
,   - The kill
rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to
- sweeps in from the hunt,  dripping at his side
(demonstrating with his rifle) Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick
Aim for the head
Then imagine it's Gladstone
(smiling) Quite
pulls out his flask and offers some to , who declines
He watches  take a long swig
,  '  - That night
is standing at his place, drinking steadily
He has a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list
Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh, are five or six   including the pretty and '
They each step up, one at a time, to make their report
(ticking as he goes) Back doors, West Wing

Kitchen and lower house

Back and upper corridors

Folding up the paper,  downs his glass of whiskey and sits
On his nod, dinner is served by   amid a clatter of cutlery and chat
looks across at his brother but  is hunched over his plate, pecking at his food
Someone titters and  looks up
' coughs
slowly lifts his head
His eyes have the slightly unfocused look of too much drink
It is clear to that he is about to be sent-up
' (with a smug smile) Did you see any Irish assassins today, Mr Brown
Brown doesn't react
'  (') We heard the dogs were Fenian sympathizers
Brown drinks
'  (') Or was it the stag
Everyone bursts out laughing
Brown slams down his glass
There's not a soul here cares about that wee woman's safety except me
She'd die in a ditch if  wasn't there to look out for her -- He stops
has come across to his brother's chair and pulls gently on his arm

Everyone is about to burst out laughing
Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his chair and lets  lead him away
As  reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in the back like a wave
holds him steady
, '  - is lying on a grubby bed
is looking around the untidy room
For the first time, he notices a thick manuscript on the table
follows his eyes
What's this
It's a diary
Be careful who sees it
What do you take me for
turns back to
You should have someone look after you
'm all right
just need to rest up a wee bit
(feeling everything spin) The room
You don't have to stay
shuts his eyes and starts to drift
watches over him
The place is a mess
can't move to tidy
It's what the maids are for
'm not having some prattler going through my things
beat
Won't you give yourself a rest, John
She's other people to look out for her
She needs me, Archie
She canna do without me, she said it to my face

is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the stairs
- crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed -- to be met by the smiling figure of
He is got up in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket
You sent for me
've been called back to London
My last day
thought  might take a walk on Lochnagar
stares straight back
- An hour later,  leads  up the hill
has his head down, on with the job
slows to a halt
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God
(beat) You must miss such magnificent views
don't think about it
They reach the top and continue along the high ground
glances at  and notices the limp
Forgive me, 've called you out and you should have been resting
'm fine
You're injured
It's nothing
Still, someone must attend you
Your wife should not have let you out
'm not married
(deadpan) Oh
This is the top
admires the view for a moment, then continues
confess,  sometimes feel as if  am not married myself,  see my wife so little
But 'm forgetting the rewards
He looks across
keeps staring ahead
(') The look on their faces when one walks into the room
Still gives one a ridiculous thrill
wouldn't know
Surely -- (interrupts) What  do,  do for my Queen
Was there never ambition
(beat) Maybe, once
Then  envy yo
Why
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work
do what  do
For Her Majesty
Aye
But yourself
(beat) What about John Brown
said

No other aspiration
stares for a long moment
Finally he speaks
To see her safe
steps a little closer
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism
Why do you think  keep her here
Ah, but therein lies the paradox
It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents
The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that
However many doors you lock, someone will always get in
Even here
watches him, eyes alert
So
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public
John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense
Her mind is set
She won't change now
She trusts you, John
is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice
They don't see it
See what
The threat
(beat) tell them, but they don't see it
They aren't as watchful as you
Too busy looking after themselves
The greasy pole
No loyalty
No love
Silence
For a moment  seems unaware that someone else has said that
promised to protect her from people like you
For once in my life,  am not the issue
She'll never understand it
In time, she will
She'll think  betrayed her
But others will know that you acted for the greater good

The wait on the shore
trails her hand in the water, frowning at the surface

Duty
You talk about duty
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye,  do

You, who  have relied on all this time -- (cutting in) Have  ever let you down before--
(as if he had not spoken) -- You stand there and tell me it is my duty
after all you promised me
'm breaking no promises
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know  fear most
For god's sake, woman, 'm just trying to keep you safe

You made me a promise and now you have broken it

Then why send me back to them

Suddenly the huge castle doors open and  bustles out with her entourage in tow

She ignores him completely

As he looks up, he sees his brother staring at him from across the courtyard

Over his intense watchfulness we hear

The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but there remain a few blank pages
Slowly, he fills them in

) We should not live in expectation of contentment
Fifteen years of vigilance will not guarantee peace of mind
Yesterday, intruders were again reported in the South Wing

It is a great comfort to me that my efforts in securing the Queen's safety over the years have not been in vain
Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word that she's dissatisfied
And  feel sure that if she were unhappy she would have found the occasion  to speak to me in person, as she has so often done in the past

Her voice is the old voice, between friends
