Royal August 3, 2008 : (
) The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated
: '  - (17), a cute teenager, speaks directly into the  atop her computer
Let the record show that , Olive Penderghast, being of sound mind, ample breast size and the occasional corny knock knock joke, do enter this video blog into evidence in the case against me
Because 'm being judged by a jury of my peers,  will attempt to insert `like' and `totally' into my confession as much as possible
So here it goes
confess 'm, in no small part, to blame for the vociferous gossip that has turned my Varsity letter scarlet, but - for anyone hoping that the sizzling details of my sordid past will provide you with a reason to lock the door and make love to a dollop of your sister's moisturizing lotion - you'll be gravely disappointed
(Beat
) Look,  just need to set the record straight and what better way to do that, than to broadcast it on the Internet
So, here it is -- Part One: The Shudder-Inducing and Cliched, However Totally False Account Of How  Lost My Virginity To  Guy At  Community College In Neighboring Town
(Beat
) Let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story
This is my side, the right one
(Beat
) Like, totally
2
- Olive sits with her best friend,   (17), a brash teenager
It would be safe to say that these girls are definitely on the " List" at their school
Fuck off
George is not a `sexy' name
George is like what you name your teddy bear, not the name you wanna scream out during an orgasm
That's bullshit
There are lots of sexy Georges
Name three
Olive starts to say something, but Rhiannon interrupts her
(') Besides Clooney
Too easy
Shouldn't that alone be enough
Fine
That's one
Number two
() Okay
George
Ummmm
Reeves
Who's that
Superman
From way back
He was hot
No way
Teddy bear
Bullshit
Ben Affleck played him in that movie
So what
Charlize Theron played that butt-fucking-ugly lesbo serial killer
Besides he's from another century
() 3
(') We're speaking present day mean, Jesus, Mortimer was probably a sexy name in some era
George Stephanopolous
What are you
Fifty
( ) George
Bush
Yeah
He's one hot mutherfucker
Just face it
There's no such thing as a sexy George
Well, mine is
So,  think we should just put this conversation to bed
Fine
Don't come
hate you
Rhiannon folds her arms and pouts
'  - Olive continues to narrate into her webcam
Let me back up
don't know if any of you have ever met them, but Rhiannon's parents are quite possibly the creepiest people in a four county radius
and
(50's) sit on their couch, smiling at the television, in their horrifically rustic home
bares a striking resemblance to ukelele player, Tiny Tim
(Although the man we're looking at has an even more frightening smile
) has hair to her ankles and dresses like a Mormon
4
(
) 've always felt sort of sorry for Rhiannon, but not enough to do what she was asking me to do
We float upwards to - '  - Rhiannon is on the phone, agitated
(Into the phone) Please
'm begging you
'll pay you
'  - Olive is on the other end of the phone conversation
We  between the two sides
Rhi,  can't
told you  have plans
You're lying
You're a lying bitch and  hate you so much right now
() 'm not lying
promise 'm not
really would love to go camping with your family this weekend had fun with your family last year
-   - Olive, uncomfortable, and Rhiannon, bored, sit around a campfire with the Abernathys
The couple stare at the fire with the same creepy smile plastered on their faces
There is an excruciatingly long and painful silence
Would you like a marshmallow, Olive Oil
5
Mrs
Abernathy squeaks out a meek titter that is annoyingly high-pitched
Olive oil
That's funny
Very, very funny
() No thank you, Mr
Abernathy
You can call me Mortimer, Olive Branch
Mrs
Abernathy titters again
Rhiannon rolls her eyes
There is another awkwardly long silence, while the Abernathys grin away at their fire
'  - Rhiannon is getting increasingly angrier at her friend
(Into the phone) Why don't you just say it
You don't like my parents
You think they're hopelessly pathetic and devoid of souls and wish that you could live with normal people who didn't meet at a Star Trek convention
She quickly catches her faux pas and stops talking
(Sympathetic to her ) Rhi,  like your parents
They're sweet
But  can't go camping this weekend
Quick
Hurry and make up a lie
have a date
Liar
6
() No
do
With who
You don't know him
And neither do you, you selfish bitch
'm serious
He goes to the community college with my brother in Denton
What's his name then
( ) Who
My brother
Stop stalling
You're totally trying to come up with a name
Just say it
'  - Into the webcam -- 'm not proud of this
Less about the lie and more about the unoriginality of it
Okay, have you guys ever watched `The Brady Bunch'
Of course you haven't
You're busy watching fake people pretend to be real on
That's why  knew  could get away with it
See, there was this episode where Jan - the awkward middle child - made up a boyfriend to assuage the ridicule of her snatchy sister who had just stolen the heart of the boy that Jan loved
The name of her imaginary boyfriend -- 7
'  - (Into the phone) George Glass
George
What kind of a fucking name is George
He's pretty hot and he asked me out this weekend, so  said yes
Although still skeptical, she seems a tad more mollified
If you're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even 'm not convinced aren't serial killers, he had better be the one
You had better fucking marry him, have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything he's worth
Deal
- Rhi and Olive continue their conversation, as Rhi pops a tater tot into her mouth
(With her mouth full) You're not off the hook, you know
want lurid details
This had better be the best date of your life to counterbalance the worst weekend of mine
'm sure you'll have a good time
- Rhi sits, bored and uncomfortable, while her parents smile at the campfire for an, again, awkwardly long moment
8
'  - To her webcam -- (Through the proverbial ) Even though we now hate each other, Rhi,  really hope you're watching this
Because this part's for you
The lurid details of my weekend en flagrante delicto with the all-too- imaginary, yet surprisingly satisfying George Glass: Ken Nordine's beat poem `,' (from the late 60's album `Colors'), underscored to jazz, plays as we see a montage of ' : In her bedroom, Olive -- -- watches `The Notebook,' pining over Ryan Gosling
(
) Olive
Poor thing
-- paints her toenails Jungle Red
(
) (') Sits and thinks that it's drab
Sure does
Sits and sits and sits and sits and about it's olive drab drab
-- dances to the jazz music, but alone, in her underwear and a t-shirt that declares: `Hands off
' (
) (') ' that it is about to be named `Color of the Year,' by those with the nose for the new
By the passionate few
Yeah
-- reads   magazine
(') Olive is definitely in
that can possibly mean () 9
(') anything
Anywhere
At least for a year
-- dances some more
(
) (') Has got to be Olive
Did you hear that Olive
Did ya
Know what it means
Oh Olive
There'll be olive cars and olive trucks and olive chickens and olive ducks and olive socks and olive garters And olive brakes and olive starters
Olive, sorry
Olive, please
and olive trees
Olive trees
What a quaint notion
Olive trees
() Olive
Out of breath from dancing, she walks over and displaces the from the    she's playing
'  - To the webcam -- But on Monday, when Rhi asked me how my weekend was
- Olive and Rhi walk, with books in hand, to class - weaving in and out of people
It was nothing short of perfection
10
Details, bitch
Wait, first  need a scope of reference
Who would play him in the movie of your life
Ryan Gosling, definitely
That works
Spill
He was charming
real gentleman
Are you going to see him again
Probably not
It was just one of those weekends
The whole weekend
Yeah
Rhiannon suddenly stops and twirls Olive to face her
Wait a minute
You didn't
No, of course not
( ) You fucking liar
You totally lost your virginity to him
Pedestrian students stop in their tracks to stare at them
did not
, Olive grabs her and drags her forward, interrupting the show
(') Tell me everything and spare me the coquettish `just-the-tip' bullshit
() 11
(') know you did it
know you let him put it inside you, so just 'm not that kind of girl
The kind that does it or the kind that does it like a fucking porn star and then doesn't have the balls to talk about it
Rhi drags her into the -- '  - -- and abrasively, gets up in Olive's face
want every perverted detail
, bitch
Pressured, Olive lies
Okay
Fine
We did it
You lost your virginity
Fucking finally
Now, you're a super-slut like me
Rhi
Blowing Peter Tolliver once behind the Pizza Hut doesn't make you a super-slut
There were people walking past
Whatever, this isn't about me
This is about
What did you let him do
(
) started piling on lie after lie
It was like setting up Jenga
: 12
well-manicured   stacks    onto a table
: (') It was
Normal
Nothing freaky
It was sweet
was sweet
Was he big
Did it hurt
No
It was great
Like  said
Okay, that's enough
The toilet flushes and   (16), an Aryanesque, cardigan-wearing Christian-girl exits from a stall and walks to the sink, where she vigorously washes her hands - while staring at Rhi and Olive with disgust
What the fuck are you looking at, Marianne
Nothing
Just a couple of admitted whores
Marianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom
Olive's stomach revolves at her now-turned-public admission
So, how was your weekend
( promise it's the last time
) - The Abernathys smile at the campfire, roasting
Rhiannon would rather be anywhere other than there
Wienie, Rhi
Rhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie
'  - Into the webcam -- 13
Marianne Bryant, as we all know, is the President of the Christian Student Coalition and is that rare breed of human born with a stick the size of a baseball bat implanted up her anus
God's honest
'm sure it's in some medical dictionary somewhere
- Marianne and her lackey,   (16), who's just as awful as she is, pass out flyers
(
) Last year's cause celebre was the changing of the school mascot, which she spearheaded
Marianne aggressively shoves her literature into passing students faces
- The school's  (17), a    painted and costumed as a , bursts into the auditorium and begins to rile students up by thrusting his  in the air
Blue Devils
Blue Devils
Blue Devils
The crowd goes wild
-   - Marianne, melodramatically, grabs a   by the arm
How can we exhibit school pride when we're conveyed to others as satan worshippers
The scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away
14
(
) Now, thankfully, we're the much less intimidating -- -   - The mascot, unenthusiastic and feeling ridiculous, walks into the gym dressed as a -- (
) Meerkat
Go meerkats
Go meerkats
He can't seem to get himself or the student body as excited - with the exception of Marianne and Nina, in the stands applauding proudly
The school band is playing `
' Across the gym, Olive sits with Rhiannon
What the fuck is a meerkat anyway
Beats the hell out of me
But can we just take a moment to applaud the Barbara Bush High School Marching Band for their very ambitious effort to learn all of the James Bond theme music in a single year
personally wish them all the best in their endeavor
Ku-dos
think  speak for all of the female students and faculty - and maybe a couple of males - when say that  liked Todd much better when he was shirtless
actually looked forward to these disturbing displays of -- what do they call it
School spirit
Yeah
That's it
15
Even dressed as a meerkat,  still fantasize about him
Ha
What are those people called again
The ones that dress up like stuffed animals when they do it
Communists
Rhiannon laughs
Shhh
Don't let Marianne hear you say that word
The last thing we need is McCarthyism at Barbara Bush
Isn't high school already a hotbed of just that
True
(Beat
) Yeah, 'd totally fuck Meerkat Todd
They both get lost in the thought
'  - Into the webcam -- So, of course, immediately  knew that the little white lie  told to my then-best-friend in the ladies room would come back to bite me on the ass
However, even  - who my fourth grade teacher stated on my report card `has an imagination that should be quickly expunged' - had no idea how quickly this article of fiction would spread
So, now we move on to Part Two: The Accelerated Velocity of Terminological Inexactitude
16
- Olive loads books into her locker
She sees Marianne walk past with Nina
They give her a repulsed look
Olive decides to nip this in the bud
She catches up to them
Hey Marianne, can  talk to you for a second
Nina, reluctantly, gives them a moment alone
() What
Listen, what you heard in the bathroom, that wasn't true
It's actually a funny story
Do you ever watch `The Brady Bunch'
Olive - that's your name, right
Olive knows that Marianne knows her name, but obligingly nods
(') 'm not the one you have to answer to for your depraved behavior
There is a higher power to judge your indecency
() Who
The guidance counselor
() hope for your sake, God has a sense of humor
Oh,  have sixteen years worth of anecdotal proof that He does
Olive looks over and sees that Nina is talking to a group of , who are looking at Olive, intrigued
17
(') ( ) Damn it
Marianne sees what her friend is doing and smiles at Olive, coldly
Look
You've made your bed just hope for your sake, you cleaned the sheets
She turns on her heels and leaves Olive behind
( ) Did  just get saved
She shakes off her attempt and continues on her way, walking past the guys who smile at her
This alarms her
Hey Olive
How's it going
Without stopping -- 'm swell, guy-'ve-never-laid-eyes- on-before
Thanks for asking
(
) (') All  could think to myself was `Great, now 'm going to have to start wearing red lipstick and stiletto heels
' Battling her frustration, she goes to class
- Olive eats dinner with her family
Her father,  (40's), is a regular dad-kinda-guy
Her mother,  (40's) is heavyset with a fun disposition
Also in attendance is her `a-little-too-precious' sister, (12)
Olive and her folks get along really well
Hey, you guys know that  was here all weekend, right
18
They all nod at her
(') And you would testify to that
( ) What's up, sweet pea
It's nothing
Just the rumor mill
What's the rumor mill turning out these days
Seriously, it's nothing
They continue to eat
Don't forget your brother's staying here next weekend
Why
He never comes home
They're fumigating the dorms
And thank God for that
Last time was there,  saw three cockroaches
() Mom, can you please not say that word while 'm eating
Sorry, hon
'  - Into the webcam -- Like all families, mine has a deep dark secret
And since 'm spilling all this dirt,  might as well go ahead and confess it
She takes a deep breath
19
(') 'm trusting that this nugget of information isn't going to be spread around, but - okay, here it goes: My dad's name is Dill and my mother's name is Rosemary
They were so amused by this that they decided to name all of their children after -- ( ) -- edible items
(With mock emotion) My brother's name is Sage and my sister's name is Ginger
It's shocking,  know
We're like a fucking pantry, us Penderghasts
( ) But at least my parents didn't meet at a `Star Trek' convention,
Sorry
Now, 'm just being mean
Okay
Back to the story
- As Olive walks through school, she is met with a totally different energy
She no longer blends in
Guys are checking her out
Girls are glaring at her, scornfully
She's kind of digging it
(
) So, while  would never have classified myself as a wallflower, was now the center of attention and who doesn't love that
Jeez, if 'd known that losing my virginity would create such a new persona for myself, 'd have lied about it back in eighth grade
Eighth grade sucked
did get my first kiss back then, however
It was gross and kind of turned me off to the whole my-tongue-in-other- people's-mouths thing
Not to mention, the even-worse other- people's-tongues-in--mouth thing
Seriously, folks
Who invented kissing
Why is everyone so dead- set on sticking their body parts in other people's orifices
If there's a hole on a person, rest assured, somebody wants to stick something of theirs in it
20
In almost complete darkness, a very nervous (13) sits with a scared shitless    (13)
You can hear other - snickering and whispering outside the door
So,  think this is the part where you're supposed to stick your tongue in my mouth
It's just what 've heard
Just give me a second, okay
Olive presses a button and her watch illuminates
According to my watch, you have 382 of them
How do you do that
What
Add so fast
And you also talk like a grown up
Don't worry
'm not nearly as smart as  think  am
The kid snickers
He feels a little more at ease
(') think it's just practice
For when  do grow up
Plus, don't sweat it
Girls mature faster than boys
That's what they say
And it's probably the reason 'm ready to do this and you're not
Is it that obvious
21
Painfully so
So, if we didn't do anything, would you tell everybody
Absolutely
will tell everyone you pussied out and the whole school will make fun of you and you'll most likely spend the rest of your teen years as a joke - no, even worse - a cautionary tale
They both laugh
The Kid Who Opted Not To Kiss The Girl
They'll tell it for years
It'll be a suburban legend
The kid smiles warmly and gratefully at her
Thanks, Olive
Don't mention it
No
don't mention it
She extends her pinky to him
They link pinkies and they swear on it
We still have five minutes and thirty six seconds
There's a long silence
'm really interested in politics
Oh yeah
Totally
22
Well,
Uh
Cool
There's another long silence
Finally, from outside the door -- (
) Ewwwww
Hunter Neblett just puked all over the dining room
Olive and the kid listen as people scurry from outside the closet
Thank God
Hey, we're in Junior High
Vomit- viewing will always trump spit- swapping
The kid starts to make his grand escape, but Olive stops him
(') Real fast - and you can tell me the truth
It's not because 'm -- The kid smiles
No
You're very pretty
He extends his pinky and she links it to hers
He kisses her quickly on the cheek and darts from the closet
Olive sits in the closet for a moment, contemplating what just happened, wondering if he was telling the truth, then she opens the door
The coast is clear, except for    walking past
She aggressively grabs him and pulls him into the closet with her and, promptly, thrusts her tongue into his mouth
They make out
'  - Olive seems lost in thought
She snaps back to reality and the task at hand
23
If 'd known that Meerkat Todd was going to turn out so hot, probably would have cherished the moment more
suppose just that 'm sitting here reminiscing about it means that it must have meant something
(Beat
) Yeah, so anyway - kissing's not really my thing
That's what learned in Natalie Giblin's closet
digress
- Olive half-listens in class, while her English teacher
(early 30's), a handsome guy, lectures on ` ' (
) So, 'm feeling like the cat's ass, because everyone thinks 've been deflowered
'm surprised at how empowered  felt by this prevarication
wonder to myself, would  feel this invigorated if had actually let some college kid violate me in his cockroach- infested dorm room
Probably not
(Beat
) Ironically, we were studying `The Scarlet Letter,' but isn't that always the way with these teenage tales
The literature you read in class always seems to have a strong connection with whatever angsty adolescent drama is being recounted
consider this
(Pause
) Then  think: Except for `Huckleberry Finn
'  don't know any teenage boys who have ever run away with a big, hulking black guy
Alright, so thoughts
Nina raises her hand
Mr
Griffin points to her
think Hester Prynne was - excuse my language - a whore
24
You don't see her as a victim
Why should
She brought it on herself
Nina whips around and gives Olive a look, surprising her
Excuse me
Perhaps you should embroider a red on your wardrobe
Perhaps you should  a wardrobe, you twat
The class bursts into surprised laughter
Even Mr
Griffin tries hard to suppress a congratulatory glance in her direction
(
) (') Admittedly, not my best line
But it was provocative enough to land me in the Principal's office
Mr
Griffin, begrudgingly, calls her to his desk
He starts writing something on a piece of paper
-     - Olive sits with her arms crossed outside of the Principal's office
She clenches a note in her fist
Marianne, who's an office aid, has a smirk on her face as she watches Olive squirm
She slams her fist down on the stapler, repetitively
-- Seems as if someone's on a downward spiral
Seems as if someone's practicing the mundane activities she'll be saddled with the rest of her pathetic life
25
You have a chip on your shoulder the size of Texas
Wow, that's even bigger than your ass
() You're going to hell
(Growing weary of this ) As long as you won't be there
Oh,  can assure you  won't
Neither says anything for a few moments
(') hope you at least had the good sense to wear a condom
Why
Your parents didn't
You know, you're just like -- The principal's door opens and Marianne quickly shuts up and continues her work
emerge
One, obviously, a bully; the other, obviously, the bullied
The  kid is holding a up to his nose
He and Olive exchange meaningful glances
(60's), a colossal prick disguised as a man, gestures for her to come in
Olive gets up and enters -- '  - He closes the door behind them
He holds his hand out and she gives him the note that Mr
Griffin wrote
Gibbons studies it
don't know you
She thrusts her hand out
26
Olive Penderghast
He eyes her hand, not amused, and she quickly withdraws it
Why are we just now meeting
Using language like this should have warranted a visit to me years ago
Well, to be perfectly honest - 've never used an epithet like this in an educational arena before
Sir
This is foul
In my defense,  think  meant to say `twit
' It just came out more - what's the word 'm looking for
Veracious
young lady with such an extensive vocabulary shouldn't be stooping to such vituperations
() Touche
As serious as a heart attack
Wipe that smile off your face -- (Consulting the note) Olive
don't tolerate this kind of language
Ever
Consider this your first warning
If  find out you've used a word like this in my school again,  will make sure that it's your last
don't operate on a `three strikes you're out system'
You get one warning from me
She starts to say something -- (') Think very carefully before you speak
27
She relents, but stares him squarely in the eyes
always do
Are we finished
He gestures to the door
Detention tomorrow after school in Room 704
And, young lady,  don't want to see you again
Not even in a more positive capacity
Maybe  could win a ribbon or a medal or something could conceivably be valedictorian
Or something
( ) Get out of my office now
She quickly runs out of his office
-   - Rhiannon, excitedly, approaches Olive - dying to talk to her
Please tell me the rumors are true
Yes, 'm a big whore
Not that one
The one where you called Nina Howell a cunt and then socked her in the nose
It's not entirely true
(Beat
) Look, there's something  need to tell you
Rhiannon ignores her sincere attempt to confess
Yeah
Like the exact moment you turned into such a think 'm in  with you
() 28
(') Please tell me you at least left a mark on that scrunched-up face of hers
The cunt goes down for the count
() Never mind
Rhiannon pulls her keys from her purse and they walk to her car
(') want a car
Please
It's my only perk
Trust me
They get into her car
- The scene looks the same
Olive sits with her family, having family dinner
got sent to the Principal today
Her parents seem more impressed than upset
This is definitely a first
What did you do
used inappropriate language in English class
But we're reading a book that , personally, deem wildly inappropriate for my age group, so  felt that it was actually quite apropos
(More curious than angry) What did you say
Olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying the word out loud
Let's just say it was an inappropriate word
29
What did it start with
snide comment from a snotty-ass girl in my class
meant what letter did it start with
Oh
Yeah
That's an odd one
Is this one of those new curse words
Both her parents wheels are going
They're both seeking the answer in their heads, but are coming up with nothing
(') Was it --
She leans over and whispers something in her daughter's ear
don't even know what that means
Yeah
Neither do
Her parents search their brains, but nothing is coming to them
Okay
Noun, adjective or verb
Noun
Definitely slang
Think British, although they pronounce it differently
Well, 'm stumped
Whisper it in my ear
can't
Too weird
Excited by the prospect -- Oo
Oo
Spell it with your peas
30
Now, ' a challenge
She begins maneuvering her peas around the plate
Does this have something to do with this rumor you were talking about the other night
Olive touches her index finger to her nose, as she continues to manipulate her food
(') Is there something you want to tell us, kiddo
'm spelling it out for you as quickly as  can
(Desperate for attention) got a  plus on my spelling test today
Too intrigued by Olive's admission to really care -- Good, sweetheart
Rosemary figures it out as Olive is assembling the
(') Oh,  know what it is
She leans over and whispers it in Dill's ear
He nods in understanding
(Glancing at Olive's ) What's a twat
Olive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile
It's a word that will get you sent to the principal's office
(Whispering into Ginger's ) It's not a good word
() 31
(') ( ) So, what was the principal like
The male equivalent
Of what
Now, it's Dill's turn to whisper in Rosemary's ear
She nods in understanding
Well, it's the first time since second grade, so  guess we can't be too hard on you
( ) What would my punishment have been otherwise
dunno
To bed without supper
But 'm already finished
Except for my helpful and profane peas
( ) Uhhhh
This grounding thing seems to be taking the country by storm
No phone,  or
Or
'll help you out
don't have anyone to call
haven't watched since they cancelled `The Illegitimate Children of the Real Housewives of Laguna Beach' and really only watched that as a joke
Fine
'd take away your -- Books
Computer
Yes
You're computer
32
All my homework's on there
Sorry
You lose
But thanks for playing
( ) guess then 'm lucky this isn't a regular occurrence
Olive gets up from the table and kisses her dad on the cheek
think we both are
wouldn't know how to be grounded any more than you know how to ground
love you
(Whispering in her ear) And 'm sure that girl was acting like exactly what you called her
( ) You have no idea
She goes over and kisses her mom on the cheek, as well
Leaving the dining room -- (') How's about  go and punish myself
Mea culpa, mea culpa
She retreats upstairs
How come you guys never get mad at her
Because, pumpkin, of our three darling children, we love her best
(Erupting into laughter) Just kidding
Now eat your dinner
Dill chuckles, but Ginger is not amused
'  - Into the webcam -- 33
The next day, things took a turn for the scandalous
Which brings us to Part Three:  Lady's Choice and a Gentleman's Agreement
She smiles slyly into her camera
704 - Bored, Olive sits at a desk in a classroom, reading a tattered copy of `The Scarlet Letter
' She's dressed much racier and is starting to look pretty hot
There's only one other person in the room
The seen by Olive leaving Gibbons's office the day before
The bullied kid is thin as a rail, pale as a ghost and slightly effeminate
He looks miserable
Not just by this detention, but from life in general
Are these detention sessions often unchaperoned
don't think we pose a flight risk
see
Olive laughs to herself
What
was just thinking it's kind of funny
We haven't really talked since that closet incident back in eighth grade
was afraid you were going to bring that up
So, how have you been, Brandon
() have been fantastic
() 34
(') Really, really amazing
Don't know if you heard, but according to my locker, 'm a `power bottom
' Yikes
Yeah, only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing `turd burglar' off
Which, if you think about it, really contradicts the previous label
Maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility
Brandon shoots her a `that's not funny' look
But, of course, 'm in detention
Why
Because Gibbons is a homophobe
(Beat
) And  called him a facist
So, the rumors are true, huh
() Have you ever met me
No
meant about Gibbons being a facist
He laughs
(') kind of guessed it that night with the whole kissing thing
The way you ran away

Gold star for you, Nancy Drew
There's a brief silence between them

'm the new school slut
As a matter of fact  did hear that
heard you banged a guy twice your age
No way
He's a freshman in college
Also heard he gave you crabs
Ewwww
People suck
36
Tell me about it
He's not real
The guy  slept with
made him up
So, you started the rumor
Indirectly
Sort of
Well, not really
No
No,  didn't
But you're perpetuating it
That's fucked up
() Excuse me
It's true
There's only one thing worse than these tabloid-chasing celebutantes with their vapid minds and their immoral souls and that's the people who want to be like them
Did  say  wanted to be like them
No, you just want everyone else to think you are
Why does it matter if it's not who really am
No offense, Brando, but maybe you could learn something from me
You're saying  should pretend to be straight, so people will like me
What a novel idea
You should do seminars
Oh, wait a minute, forgot
In high school, '
37
Calm down, Adolph
There's a vein popping out of your neck
'm simply suggesting that maybe these kids we call peers have got the right idea
Maybe Bridget Schumacher isn't as hippy-dippy as she pretends to be
Maybe that's just the label she's put on herself to avoid having to bathe as often as society deems necessary
Or take Marianne Bryant
It's convenient for her to act like a stuck-up Jesus-freak
(Thinking about this) No
'm wrong
think she's actually just a stuck-up Jesus- freak
But do you think she cares that that's the way she's perceived
No
Maybe she was just sick of being just another nameless, faceless entity in a place and a time that reveres people for extremity
Brandon realizes why she's chosen this path and feels for her
There are some of us, though, that want to just blend in to the crowd
Then maybe you need to go to that extreme
Or make the steadfast decision not to care
Even better if you can manage to do both

For a virgin, 'm impressed
How about me

Not bad
For a fag

If we really wanted to shock the world, we'd get up and leave detention
But you know that we would never do that
Isn't going to stop me from telling everybody we did
Brandon thinks hard about everything that's just been said
His brain is going a-mile-a-minute
In that noggin, an idea has been planted
Olive, not oblivious to this, returns to her novel
'  - Olive lounges on her bed, flipping through a magazine and talking to Rhiannon on the phone

Well,  guess that's better than me getting crabs from a guy twice my age
(
) Ewww
Who said that
You know that Brandon kid
(
) From your seedy pre-pubescent closet romp
The one and only
It's what somebody told him
(
) Nobody talks to him
Isn't that sad
He's actually quite the conversationalist
(
) He's gay
Since when are straight guys under the age of eighteen able to converse
call beeps in on the other line
(') Shit
Hold on
She clicks over

It's Brandon

Speak of the devil

() Okay
Yeah

) Okay
See you soon
Olive clicks over to Rhiannon
Dude, that was Brandon
He wants to talk to me about something
(
) Probably wants to borrow an outfit
That's so mean
(
) Any word from George
Rhi,  told you
It was a one night stand
Which is now a night stand
(
) You're being awfully cavalier about this

Aren't you supposed to be eternally in love with him and shit
If  was a character on a  show, then, absolutely, 'd be blubbering all over my Teen Vogue
Hey, we should start a rumor that 'm having a pregnancy scare
Olive is stoked by her idea

She has no idea who he is
Hi
Is there an Olive here
( ) There's a whole jar of them in the fridge
Sorry,  must have gotten the address wrong
Just kidding
Come on in
Brandon walks in and Rosemary shouts -- (') Olive, sweetie, there's a young man here to see you
He said something about asking for your hand in marriage
Brandon's eyes bulge and Olive descends the staircase
Oh happy day, Mama
thought  was going to have to spend my dowry on booze and pills to numb the loneliness
Olive grabs Brandon by the hand and leads him upstairs to -- '  - She closes the door behind them
My mom's an acquired taste
know this because 've only just recently begun to appreciate her myself
She gestures for him to sit down
(') Welcome to my boudoir
This is where the magic happens
42
( ) Do you wanna go out with me
She looks at him, strangely
(') mean, like -- Do you want to be my girlfriend
Brandon, just a few hours ago, you told me you were Kinsey Six gay
True
But you said  should pretend to be straight
Well,  didn't mean with me
You're a sweet guy and all, but you're not really my type
You're not really my type either
should say not
Okay
Well, do you wanna have sex with me
You're serious
He nervously nods
(') Oh my God, dude
You totally missed my point
All  was saying was that -- No,  know what you were saying should play it straight until  get out of this hell and then  can be whoever  want to be
No,  got that
Brandon,  didn't  have sex with a college guy
just told people  did
() 43
(') ( ) Well, actually,  just told one person and - well - you know how these things work
So, you're saying  shouldn't really have sex
should just say had sex with someone

Now, you're cooking with gas
It's his turn to smile slyly at her
She sees where he's going with this and instantly gets defensive
(') Oh no
Oh no no no no no no no no
No
Really
No
No way
No
No
Think about it
We could help each other out
You want to maintain this floozy facade
want to not get my face pummelled weekly
You are on crack
All it would take is one good imaginary fuck and you'd be saving the bone structure of my face
Think of how happy my parents would be
This is not the answer
Why don't you just do what  did and make someone up
Who would believe me
( ) Listen, Olive,  don't want to do this

She sees tears forming in his eyes
She walks away from him and is silent for a long few moments

(Spinning around to face ) It'll have to be a public event
Melanie Bostic is having a party tomorrow night
All of your tormentors will be there
You and are going together
You have to do everything  say  you have to tell people that  was sensational
Brandon wipes his tears away and is the happiest gay you've ever seen
He throws his arms around her and won't let go
can't believe you're doing this
Afterwards, it's up to you
You're committing to something

It seems as if that last statement was more for herself than it was for him

Olive falls against Brandon laughing
He hoists her up, as their host,   (17), a fairly pretty girl, approaches
Hey Olive
( ) Hi Brandon
OhmiGod, Melly
hope you don't mind, but we had a few pre-cocktail party cocktails
() Party
Cocktails
Well, glad you could make it
(Whispering and slurring in her ear) Soooo, here's the thing
() 46
(') Brandon was in the middle of telling me this funny thing
Is there a quiet room we can go to where he can finish telling me -- () -- About his thing
That's funny
She stares glassy-eyed at Melanie
Brandon just smiles
Sure
You can use the guest room
Down the hall

You are -- Just, yeah
She gives her a drunken punch on the shoulder
She spins around to the entire party, who is looking at them with complete interest
(') (Loudly; to all) Hey everybody
They raise a glass to them and Brandon and Olive stumble down the hallway, laughing
(Shocked; Mouthing to a ) What the fuck
The bully who emerged from Gibbons's office with Brandon, goes up to Melanie
Was that Olive with Brandon
know
Right
They, with a big group, race down the hall where Brandon and Olive have just retreated to
- Olive locks the door and drops the drunk act
She's completely sober and so is Brandon
47
() Draw the shades
Brandon runs over and pulls the blinds down
They giggle, conspiratorially
Olive plops down on the bed and stretches out
Brandon lays beside her
She moans for the benefit of the audience she knows has assembled outside
She moans again and it's very convincing
She leans over and whispers in his ear -- (') Grunt
Make it really convincing
And manly
He does so
She extends her palm, impressed
He slaps it with his
- Sure enough, it seems as if most of the party is listening at the door - falling all over each other to hear
Nearest to the door is the bully, who is pleasantly surprised by the noise inside
- Olive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of `The Scarlet Letter' and reads it while she makes sex noises
Brandon laughs at this and Olive smacks him with it, prompting him to stop
She puts her finger over her lips, giving him the `Shhhh' sign
She continues to read as she thrusts her hips, making the bed squeak ever so slightly
() How long do we have to do this
() Depends
Do you wanna be a normal adolescent boy or do you wanna be a stud
He moans in his deepest voice
She continues to read, crescendoing her moaning like a pro
48
(') Oh God, Brandon
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
She takes the top of the headboard and lightly taps it against the wall, over and over
(') () Now that  think about it, we probably don't want to do this for too long
It'll give the impression that you're having difficulty finishing
That's not the desired effect
() Are you sure you're a virgin
( ) Of course  am
( ) Oh, fuck me
Fuck me
Don't stop fucking me
Brandon suppresses a laugh
- Olive is disheveling herself
Brandon musses up his hair
Hold on
She unbuttons Brandon's shirt and rebuttons it incorrectly
(') Go forth, my son
You're a man now
Thanks Olive
He kisses her on the cheek and she smiles
- The whole crowd, leaning against the wall, quickly disperses when the door opens
49
The bully immediately hands Brandon a beer and throws his arm around him, leading him drunkenly down the hallway, with a crew of guys after the dirty details
Olive looks at this and smiles, satisfied
Then she realizes that, though the guys have gone, there are a whole slew of girls looking at her completely differently
They avoid her eye contact, as one would ward off Medusa
Olive finds Melanie pretending not to be interested in her
Is there a --
Back entrance is through the kitchen
Thanks
She begins her walk of shame down the corridor into the -- -- Where she runs smack-dab into the well-developed chest of () Sorry

She glares at them

She rushes off

She's genuinely touched by this gift

This is serious
Did you really bang Brandon last night at Melanie Dipshit's party
Olive sighs as she slumps into her pillows
Is that what people are saying happened
That's what  is saying
Then  guess it's true
Does this mean you guys are dating
God no

Rhiannon screams in frustration, attracting the attention of passing shoppers
Just because you lost your virginity doesn't mean you can go around screwing everybody
(-) Uh, thanks Mom
Good talk
You're getting a reputation
'know, you're really coming off as a little pious right now and you're kind of pissing me off
Please forgive my rectitude, but think that a best friend's duty is to let her know that everyone - and do mean everyone - is calling her a cum dumpster
Well, do  think 'm a cum dumpster
Look, baby,  call a spade a spade

Secondly, fuck you

Griffin pokes her head out of her office
Hey Olive
Wanna come in
67
Olive, in no mood for this, drags herself up dramatically and follows Mrs
Griffin into -- - Mrs
Griffin sits behind her desk and Olive sits opposite her
So, the reason  called you down here is just so that we could - sort of, y'know - chat about what's going on
(Beat
) There's been some concern from faculty members
( ) Your husband
Mrs
Griffin shifts uncomfortably in her chair
There's something a little unnerving about this kid's awareness
Olive, you're attempting to make a statement
We get that
'm just confused as to what exactly it is
Am  in trouble
promise the hem of my dress isn't higher than my fingertips
You're not in trouble, Olive just wanted you to know that if there was something you maybe needed to talk about, that you could trust me
If  open up to you, do you promise this stays in confidence
Yes

' Do tell anyone

Mrs
Griffin rolls her eyes

Don't you, though
Olive assesses this statement from her
We done
If  can think of any angsty things to report, you'll be the first to know
She winks at her
(') This has been so much fun that 'm actually - at this very moment - considering meth addiction, just so can come back and we can jaw some more
() Or you could always get pregnant
'm probably closer than either of us thinks
Mrs
Griffin digs in her purse and pulls out a handful of Feigning excitement -- (') Propho-tastic
Please don't tell anyone  gave you these
The school board is -- Puritanical and oppressive
Conservative
Olive sees that Mrs
Griffin is genuinely concerned
don't need those
69
() But you do
Olive starts to confess, but then just takes the rubbers and puts them in her own purse
Thank you
Remember: our little secret
And, hey, would you send in the next person
Mrs
Griffin smiles at Olive as she leaves
-     - Marianne is talking to Micah, who seems distressed
He rubs his eyes, like he's been crying
Olive is surprised to see him there
You're up, hoss
(Concerned; To Micah) It's going to be okay
She gives him a reassuring smile and he walks into her office
( ) Let me guess: drugs
Marianne gives her a `go away' look
(') didn't know Christians believed in guidance counsellors
(Beat
) Ooo
Ooo
Is your boyfriend struggling with his sexuality
Marianne begins crying
No, you insensitive rhymes-with- witch
His parents are going () 70
(') () divorce
She begins sobbing uncontrollably
Olive, not sure what to do, goes around the counter and hugs her
Marianne just cries on her shoulder
It's okay, Marianne
(Not sure what to say) Sometimes our boyfriend's parents get divorced
It's just important to know that it's not your fault
(Through her tears) They go to our church
Imagine what people will say
Olive didn't expect this embrace to last this long
have to go now
Are you going to be okay
Into Olive's shoulder -- Mrs
Griffin is going to fix everything
She's amazing
know that she's going to help Micah through this time and everything's going to be okay
Yeah
Everything's going to be okay
Marianne pulls away and wipes tears from her eyes
Why are you being so nice to me
Isn't that what we're supposed to do
Hey, it's your boss's rules
This triggers even more wails from Marianne , who grabs Olive and squeezes her tightly
'm sorry, okay
'm sorry for everything  said
() 71
(') want to be friends
be my friend
Olive is really confused by this display and is about to say something snide, but thinks better of it and replies with a very heartfelt -- Absolutely
Marianne pulls away again and manages to smile at her, warmly
(
) (') And for a day, we were actually really good friends
was really starting to think that things were going to turn around
- Marianne, angry as hell, stomps through the hall with hatred burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins
(
) But then  unwittingly gave her boyfriend a venerial disease
Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks
It's the slap heard `round the school
- Olive bursts into Mrs
Griffin's office
Tear-streaked, Mrs
Griffin is packing her things into a cardboard box
It's as if her world has just collapsed
(
) And caused the break-up of Mr
and Mrs
Griffin
() What
What do you want
Olive starts to say something, but Mrs
Griffin can't even look at her
(') Just go
72
She throws a framed photo of her and Mr
Griffin into the box
It shatters
Mrs
Griffin falls apart
Olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave
- The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school, with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on wooden stakes that say things like: 20:14 , Rhi is among them, as riled up as any
(
) So,  guess  shouldn't be too shocked that these people wanted my diseased, home-wrecking ass out of there
The scene is a maelstrom of anger and piety
'  - Olive laughs
The funny thing is: the whole time this shit was going down - people calling me something  knew wasn't true, my best friend included - couldn't help but think how  could have come up with better signs
No one even bothered to use alliteration or, God forbid, irony - not even a single acronym - and that seems a lot more unforgivable than my sins
73
- Olive enters a Catholic Church
It's empty, but there are a few  burning
She sees the   and makes a beeline toward it
She takes a deep breath and enters
- She sits down and begins to talk to the screen
Forgive me, father, for  have sinned
think that's how you're supposed to start these things
'm only going on what 've seen in the movies
Then,  think 'm supposed to tell you how long it's been since my last confession, but that's kind of my first confession
'm not Catholic
really don't know what 'm supposed to do, except sit here in this booth and tell you what 've done wrong
Where do  even start
(Beat
) 've been pretending to be a -- how would one phrase it in Catholic words
harlot
It's not like 've actually been doing the things that people are saying 'm doing, but - then again - 'm not denying them, so 've just been wondering: is that wrong
There's a lot of shi -- `crap' going down at my school which may or may not be indirectly because of this masquerade
(Beat
) 'm lying
may have caused the end of a marriage
thought, in my own perverse way, that  could help it
mean, in my defense, am merely an adolescent
should never have been propositioned in the way  was propositioned by an adult
But then again,  should never have consented
It was just that a lot of people had been asking me to do things and thought it was okay, because it wasn't real
() 74
(') It was make-believe and no one was getting hurt
But a lot of people hate me now
kind of hate me, too
There's a long silence
Olive tears up and wipes them away
(') could be wrong, but aren't you supposed to say something or ask me questions
Tell me to say `Hail Marys'
Hello
She looks through the screen
There's no one there
(') Oh, come on
She throws the curtain to the booth open and stomps out
- Olive, upset at herself, gets into her car and drives off
But just a few blocks down the street to -- - She parks her car and gets out to try a different denomination
- Olive enters to find a ,   (50's) searching through  - on her , attempting to find the perfect image for the church newsletter
The lady smiles, acknowledging Olive
Hi
was wondering if the minister was around
Pastor McGreevey is on vacation this week
But our associate pastor is in
Would you like to speak to him
For her own entertainment, Olive matches the receptionist's enthusiasm level
75
Actually, that would be fantastic
Can  tell him what this is regarding
Absolutely
'm looking for a church to join and  thought he might be able to sell me on this fine establishment
The receptionist joyfully snatches up the phone
Don, there's a young lady here who would like to speak with you about joining
She listens and then hangs up
(') (Pointing to an office) You can go right in
If everyone here is as friendly as you,  think we might be in business
She winks at the receptionist and enters -- '  - (40's) is a gangly, unattractive - borderline creepy - man
He invites Olive to have a seat
Hello there, young lady
My name is Don
He extends his hand, which she shakes politely
(') How can  help you today
'm new to the area
Looking for a church - hopefully something with a strong fellowship, a firm foot in the soil of
() 76
(') divinity and was wondering what your church's stance on lying and adultery was
Don seems taken aback by the question
Well
It's not a good thing
Oh,  agree
Wholeheartedly
But tell me: assuming there is a hell -- Ma'am, the Presbyterian Church recognizes the existence of hell
Right
Okay
Let's say hell exists
Which is worse - lying or adultery
Or is lying about adultery like a double whammy
'm sorry, ma'am,  -- What did you say your name was
At that moment, Olive looks at his desk and sees a Smiling big are Associate Pastor Don, his wife,          and his lovely -- She jumps up from her chair and recoils at the sight of the picture and the stupid mistake she made by coming there
You know what
think 'm just going to go and check out Judaism
Backing up toward the door
(') The Jews and  have a lot in common
Fashion-wise
And stuff
So, thank you for your time
She bolts from his office
'  - Olive speaks into her webcam -- 77
Yes
had unwittingly sought advice from the father of the leader of my lynch mob
Who else can say that's happened to them
(Beat
) As much as  want to say  hate Marianne
don't
get her
Well,  get certain things about her
She's passionate
Like myself
She always thinks she's right
Like myself
And, yeah, can kind of understand why she slapped me that day
Here's what happened
-   - Marianne, excitedly, runs over to Olive who is just getting to school and throws her arms around her
(
) Remember how  said that we were BFFs for, like, a day
Well, that's true
It was like we were sisters all of a sudden
Marianne can't seem to break the embrace and Olive just goes with it
- Olive sits in class
Marianne passes a note back to her
(
) She wrote me a note in first period
Olive reads it
It says: Hey girlie
You wanna hang out after school today
Kisses
Marianne Marianne looks back and Olive gives her the thumbs up
Across the room, Rhi sees this exchange and sneers
- Marianne is working with her partner, Evan
She turns to Olive behind them and makes a gagging signal behind his back and laughs silently
78
(
) By second period, it was like we had private jokes
Olive, unaware of how to respond, gives another thumbs up
- Olive sees Marianne come into class, tear-streaked
She runs over to Olive and again throws her arms around her
(
) Tragedy struck in third period
Micah's in the hospital
He's in so much pain
The nurse didn't know what was wrong
Olive just holds her new friend, as she had the day before
He'll be okay
(Tears glistening in her ) Really
Olive guides Marianne's head back to her shoulder
- Marianne's boyfriend, Micah, writhes in pain on a hospital bed, clutching his crotch
His worried  (40's) is beside him, clutching her chest with one hand and trying to soothe him with the other
It hurts so bad
enters, with a satisfied smile and a diagnosis
Chlamydia
Micah and his mother both look up in shock
His mother takes both of her hands and begins slapping him, uncontrollably
79
' How did you get chlamydia
Who have you been sleeping with
Tell me
Micah, in pain from the burning sensation and his mother's hands flying at astonishing speed shouts out: Olive
Olive Penderghast
His mother's face fills with satisfaction
- Micah's mother is on her cell phone
' () Olive Penderghast
She folds her phone up and slips it into her purse
- The woman on the other end of the phone -- -- who we've seen in the Bryant family photo, hangs up
Only this time, her smile is a disgusted grimace
She picks up the phone and dials a number
She is, animatedly, talking to the person on the other end of the line, while Olive narrates
(
) Fourth period was when Marianne had office duty
Her duties included typing, stapling, filing and -- - Marianne is on the phone, listening, with mouth agape
Undoubtedly, she's just heard from her mother that her boyfriend has chlamydia
(
) -- answering the phones
80
She screams so loud that Mrs
Griffin comes out of her office, a panicked expression on her face
- Seething, Marianne's mother says into the phone -- Olive Penderghast
She hears a slam and then a dial tone
- Marianne clutches the phone in the cradle with enough force that it looks like the receiver will shatter in her hands
Mrs
Griffin looks worried
Are you okay, hon
Like a teapot about to start expelling steam, Marianne quivers in rage
Finally, at boiling point, she shouts -- -- But her long string of profanities is muffled by the long ringing of the school bell
Mrs
Griffin is taken aback by Marianne's umbrage
As we saw before -- - Marianne, angry as hell, stomps through the hall with hatred burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins
(
) Okay,  exaggerated
We were just BFFs for, like, a half-a-day
Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks
(') (Clutching her face) MutherFUCKer
81
Rhi, who was loading books in her locker, sees this and happily slams her locker shut
Breezing past her -- My sentiments exactly
() Oh, grow up
But Rhi keeps on walking
- Micah's on his cell phone, anxiously talking to someone - checking every few seconds to see if his mom is on her way out
(Into the cell phone) didn't know what to say panicked
said  got it from Olive Penderghast
(Pause
) know, but what was  supposed to say
And then my mom called her mom
(Pause
) No, not Olive's
Marianne's
(Pause
) already tried to blame it on their divorce, but my mom's not buying it
have to tell them
(Pause
) Okay
But  love you
don't care if you gave me chlamydia and  want to be with you and no one can stop us
Not my mother, not Marianne, not -- There's a dial tone
- Mrs
Griffin has just hung up on her teenage lover and begins freaking out
She grabs a cardboard box and begins throwing items into it
Olive bursts into Mrs
Griffin's office and sees Mrs
Griffin packing her things
As we saw before -- 82
() What
What do you want
Olive starts to say something, but Mrs
Griffin can't even look at her
(') Just go
She throws a framed photo of her and Mr
Griffin into the box
It shatters
Mrs
Griffin falls apart
Olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave -- -- and then feels awkward
'm sorry,  was just looking for Marianne
Did she say something about being mad at me
She just smacked the shi -- `crap' out of me
This makes Mrs
Griffin cry even harder
She attempts to pull herself together
It's my fault
'm so sorry, Olive
Olive looks at her, quizzically
(') ( ) fucked up
fucking fucked up fucking bad
'm a fucking
Fuck
Don't get me wrong
love it, but don't think you're supposed to use those words around a student
Yeah, well, you're not to supposed to fuck them, either
But it didn't stop me
Olive puts two and two together in her head
She gasps a little louder than she planned
83
You and -- Oh my God
'm not judging you or anything, but oh my God
( ) Wait
What does that have to do with me
Mrs
Griffin walks over and locks her office door
She fights back more tears, as she tries to explain to Olive
(
) (') My guidance counselor, who had only days before armed me with a latex bulletproof vest, told me that she had chlamydia and that she had been screwing around with her office aide's boyfriend under the guise of divorce counseling
She confided in me that she and her husband - my favorite teacher - were having marital problems, that they hadn't slept together in months
She assured me that she had never meant for anything to happen with Micah
She confessed to me how when she was a child she always dreamt of being Maria Von Trapp, not Mary Kay Letorneau
Micah had panicked and used me as a scapegoat - to save her job and her marriage
She assured me that she would make sure everyone knew the truth and apologized
Mrs
Griffin stops talking and waits for Olive to speak
(
) (') And  bought it
Olive gives her a reassuring smile, steps up to the plate and offers up a solution
(') could have chlamydia
And could easily have given it to Micah
That time we slept together
Who knows
Often times women don't have symptoms and have been whoring around
No you haven't
84
Olive looks at her, puzzled by her knowledge
(') ( ) Because a real whore can't admit it to herself, let alone others
She begins to weep
Olive puts her hand on Mrs
Griffin's shoulder
Call Micah
Tell him  said he's an asshole and that he owes me big for this and also the time pretended not to see him during a third grade game of hide and seek
Tell him  still remember that
But tell him that  confessed to giving him chlamydia
Mrs
Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her
(') And it's not really my place to say this, but  figure after the conversation we just had,  can speak candidly
Your husband is and while the male adolescent can fuck like a bunny
who really wants to fuck a bunny
If  was you, 'd go home and seduce him and pretend this never happened
Olive strokes her guidance counselor's hair
() Do you want some more condoms
() No, you keep them
She strokes her hair
'  - Into the webcam -- So, really how could  be angry at Marianne
() 85
(') Dude, if some bimbo gave boyfriend an , 'd have swung, but 'd have balled my fist
() My boyfriend
(She gets lost in the ) With all the mythical play  was getting, it's a wonder - and probably a miracle - that  still hadn't actually been asked out on a real date
Guys were clamoring to claim that they'd slept with me, but no one was putting the real moves on me
Until finally
- Two  5    (Olive and Rhiannon) chase a all over the playground, desperate to kiss him
They plot and plan to corner him, but he's just too fast
(
) It was really Rhiannon who had a crush on him
She has since we were kids
Rhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the cheek
Repulsed, he wipes his face
Rhiannon and Olive high five each other
- Olive eats her lunch and yuks it up with a table full of guys
Rhiannon sits at a different table, mostly comprised of girls, and glares at her from across the room
The bell rings and the students begin getting up and making their way toward the exit
Anson (who we saw earlier with Rhiannon in the hallways) approaches Olive
Hey Olive
Olive smiles sweetly at him
86
(') was wondering if you were busy tonight
Maybe wanna go out or something
() What did you have in mind
dunno
was thinking about chartering a hot air balloon, taking along a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit and then trying to impress you with an overzealous reading of Emily Dickinson
() Why, Anson, are you inviting me to accompany you to a romantic dinner at the Red Lobster
Unequivocally
() Nice
Yeah
'll have dinner with you
Olive walks off - Olive and Anson sit in a booth at a dimly-lit
Olive looks beautiful
The `' on her shirt is sequined
can't believe you brought me to the nicest restaurant in town
This is swank
was beginning to think that there was no such thing as class
Yeah
What's better than getting to select your dinner and have nice conversation while they boil it alive in the back
87
think Anson Jr
doesn't mind making the sacrifice
You don't mind that  named him Anson Jr
, do you
Not at all
'm actually kind of honored
Do you believe this whole thing about lobster being an aphrodisiac
(Lying out his ass) didn't know it was
'know, medical science has not substantiated claims that any particular food increases sexual desire or performance
It's so funny when guys ply women with food that they think is gonna get them laid

You know, native people believed that you gained the strength of the animal by consuming it
Some people grind up rhinoceros horn, because it's thought to stiffen the male sex organ
It's all bullshit

The server leaves them and Olive digs in
Anson is feeling nauseous and can't touch his
From across the restaurant, a    enters from the back, enthusiastically clapping and holding a cupcake
88
Leading the brigade is Meerkat Todd, who's wearing a With as much spirit, as he has as a meerkat -- don't know but 've been told
don't know but 've been told
He leads them through to another part of the restaurant

And he's a lobster wonder if  should start calling him Lobster Todd
Marguerite is getting old
Marguerite is getting old
They land at the table of the birthday girl
Olive cranes her neck to see -- Rhiannon, miserable of course, sitting with her parents at a table in the next room
Olive immediately becomes uneasy
Shit
The best thing is her dessert is free
The best thing is her dessert is free
The worst thing is  sing off-key
The worst thing is  sing off-key
Olive is visibly squirming in her seat
Sound off
89
Happy
Sound off
Birthday
Sound off
Happy birthday to you
The whole place applauds, unenthusiastically
Anson sees Olive's discomfort
What's wrong
Rhiannon's over there
So
So
She's been in love with you since the first grade
So
Well, she's my best friend
thought you two weren't speaking
We're not, but it doesn't mean should be out with you
Then why are you
don't know
You asked me out
Exactly
have no interest in her
mean, we're friends, but -- 90
She can't see us
() Do you want me to get the check
() Would you mind
He gestures for the server who appears
Could we get our check
() Is everything okay
just remembered 'm allergic to shellfish
always forget that my respiratory system would collapse and 'd die
It sucks  know
Even more confused, the server obliges and gives them their check
(') (Digging in her purse) Let me get it
have a gift certificate
She pulls it out and hands it to the waitress, who leaves
But  asked you out
And  ruined it, so let me bear the financial brunt
(Beat
) 'm so sorry about this
But she really likes you
She and  just don't have much in common
And you and  do
91
think so
For instance, , too think Nina Howell's a twat
Yeah, well, if that's our magical connection,  should date the entire school
Haven't you
Olive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit pissed
(') Kidding
Yeah, about that -- The server reappears with the check
You have a remaining balance of fourteen dollars and thirty six cents
Keep it
Tip
The sever smiles and leaves them again
Let's get out of here
They duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down, but Olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if Rhiannon sees them
She does
Olive and Rhiannon make eye contact
Whereas, Olive looks remorseful, Rhiannon looks like she's just been stabbed in the back -- which she has
The Abernathys see her, as well, and wave
It's painfully obvious to Olive that Rhi hasn't told her parents about their differences
She starts to go over, but Rhiannon's face is turning vermillion in anger
Olive just waves, sheepishly and leaves with Anson
92
/
'  -     - Olive's face is painted with guilt
She feels like shit, but doesn't want to externalize it
Anson puts his hand on her knee
have something for you
Olive manages a smile
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a $500   to  and hands it to her
Olive is disappointed, but tries not to show it
Oh
didn't realize -- Snapping out of her guilt
(') Okay
So, what did we "do" on this date
Whatever $500 gets me
He leans over and kisses her
She pushes him off
Wait
This isn't how it works don't actually -- But he's kissing her again, a little too forcibly
She pushes him off again
(') You don't get it
'm not technically having sex with people for money
You know that, right
Besides, even if  was, we're in the parking lot of a Red Lobster
We can go wherever you want, but think it would be kind of hot here
He takes off his shirt
Dude,  gotta go
It's been -- sad
93
She gets out of the car
He rolls down the window
Olive, you're being stupid
'll take you home
No thanks
He drives off, leaving her outside in the parking lot
(') Fuck
As luck would have it, Meerkat Todd, is coming out the back exit
He sees her and gives her a surprised, toothy grin
Hey Olive
Hey Todd
What are you doing here
Oh, 'm just hanging out in the parking lot
do that sometimes
Not necessarily just here
The one outside of Applebee's is fun, too
(Laughing at her oddness) You want a ride somewhere
Nah
'm fine
Your friend Rhi is inside
It's her Mom's birthday
Tears begin to glisten in Olive's eyes
She's not my friend anymore
Todd walks over and puts his arm around her and leads her to his car
He opens the door for her and she sits down
94
/
'  - Olive is trying to pull herself together but she can't stop crying as Todd drives her home
Todd doesn't know what to say to her
Finally -- You wanna talk about it
What's to say
'm a horrible person
Everyone thinks 'm a whore and, for the first time, 'm starting to believe it
Huh
Oh, don't act like you don't know what people are saying about me
know what people are saying
Doesn't mean  believe them
Why not
Olive, contrary to popular belief, 'm not an idiot
know exactly what's going on and  know exactly what you're doing
She stops crying
Who told you
No one had to tell me
All  know is once upon a time, there was a scared little kid in a closet at a party who wasn't ready for his first kiss and there was this amazing little girl who lied for him
She smiles through her tears
You remember that
95
Yeah and after  ran out, you pulled Brandon in
Yeah,  know about that, by the way
And look how he turned out
Sometimes  still pretend you were my first kiss
() Yeah
Who was
Your friend
Rhiannon
Olive's laughter turns to rage
What
Yeah
About a year later
It sucked
(Blurting it out) She knew how  felt about you
How do you feel about me
( ) She did it first
And here  am feeling  bad and
Wait
How do you feel about me
( ) Felt

() Oh
He stops the car
They're at her house
96
(Off his look) mean, it's not that  don't still feel that way
There's an awkward moment between them
Olive
If  promise not to tell anyone, could  kiss you
Despite the fact that this is positively the most romantic moment of her young life, Olive looks down
No
Not tonight
don't want you to kiss me when mascara's running down my cheek or some shithead has forced his tongue down my throat only a half-hour ago
've wanted to kiss you since the eighth grade, but  want it to be perfect
And right now, my life's a mess need to get it under control before drag you into it
What if  told you  wanted to be dragged into it
Maybe  could help
He holds out his hand and she takes it
Now  have a reason to fix this catastrophe 've brought upon myself
And 'm going to
Okay
He smiles his goofy grin and she embraces him
She hops out of the car and goes to her front door
'  - Into her webcam -- You see, now  had a reason for things to go back to the way that they were
() 97
(') The truth needed to be told and knew  had to go the one person who could help me
The one person could count on to set the story straight
Brandon
'd helped him and, even though it would destroy his new reputation for being a stud,  knew he would help me
- Filling the frame, a   in braces says -- Oh my God, did you hear that Brandon ran away from home
Yeah
Totally
He left his parents a note that said: `Eff you, 'm gay
' And then he skipped town with a big, hulking black guy
We spin around to see Olive's stunned reaction
( ) My apologies to Mark Twain
Huh
The reality of the situation begins to weigh on her
Nothing
Defeated, Olive makes her way through the crowded halls
(
) (') It gets worse
Due to his `condition,' Micah was sent on an extended visit to his grandparents in Mississippi
- Micah, beyond miserable, sits between his  , who read the Bible to him
98
(
) No telephone, no television, no computer, no internet and - most importantly - no diseased sexual partners
Micah settles in for a very long visit
-  - Where they had previously met, Olive pleads with Evan
(
) went to everyone 'd helped and begged them to say it wasn't true
No way
gave you money
Please, Evan
He walks off, leaving her alone
- Olive waits for Mrs
Griffin's response
There's a long moment of contemplation on Mrs
Griffin's part
Then -- Olive, life is full of choices made a bad one
But then, so did you
We both acted unwisely, but don't see any other alternative than to live with the guilt
My guilt stems from my indiscretion, yours for lying
We've made our choices
Now, we have to ride them out
(Pissed as hell) Or  could just tell everyone Fine, Olive
Let's play the `who do you believe' game
But, first, ask yourself, if you were an adult, who would you believe

With all due respect, Mrs
Griffin, you're a fucking cunt
Because you helped me once, 'm not going to report that to Principal Gibbons
Now, we're even
They're locked in a Mexican standoff
(') You can go now
Furious, Olive throws the door open and exits
'  - Mr
Griffin is erasing the blackboard, when Olive storms into the room
Your wife has chlamydia and she's been sleeping with a student and she gave it to him and now she's trying to blame me
Shocked, Mr
Griffin drops the eraser
What
The gravity of what she's just done sinks in and she stumbles
-- 'm sorry
-- Not knowing what to say, she runs from his classroom
'  - Olive is mirthless, as she proceeds with her story
Looking back, that's the thing regret the most
That's the thing that sent me to the church, er, churches
And that's the thing that made me realize how profoundly 'd fucked up
() 100
(') And that's something 'll have to live with for the rest of my life
With my words, even though they were true,  ended a marriage
No kid should have to be burdened with that
She contemplates this
- As we saw before, Olive sits and plays ` ' with Mr
Griffin, at his desk
Both are looking beaten down and very depressed and their minds are on everything but the game
Mr
Griffin puts his hand on Olive's
It's not your fault
Olive gets a tear in her eyes
She puts a   in at the top and loses the game
She reaches over and presses the lever, causing all of the chips to fall on his desk
: - There's a ridiculously tall tower of blocks and they all fall down
: He rakes the chips and the game into his own cardboard box, full of his things
He smiles and she hugs him -- intensely, tears quickly welling up in her eyes
'm so sorry
No
It's not your fault
They just hold each other
Finally, Mr
Griffin pulls away and takes his things and starts to leave
But then he turns and says -- 101
(') hope that you and Todd end up okay
Me too
Where are you going
Not sure yet
Away from her
Can  come
They share one last, pained smile and he leaves
'  - Hearfelt, into the webcam -- Mr
Griffin, if you ever see this, just know -  was wrong to tell you that
In that way
At all don't know
shouldn't have done it
don't feel bad for lying for your wife
But  hate myself for telling you the truth
'm so sorry
She wipes away a tear, pulls herself together
(') Part Five: Not With a Whimper But With a Bang
- As we saw before -- The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school, with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on wooden stakes that say things like: 20:14 , Rhi is among them, as riled up as any
102
Olive steps out of the school to see the demonstration
her jaw drops
Oh fuck me
Things have gotten  too out of hand
'  - Olive cries on her bed, clutching her teddy bear
Rosemary listens, as a good mother does
So, now everyone who knows the truth is either gone or won't fess up
The Cross Your Legs Club is demanding my head
And the messed up thing is that  wouldn't put it past Gibbons to expel me
had a similar situation when was your age
( ) Everyone called you a whore
Yes
had a horrible reputation and people said awful things about me
But it was true
was a slut
Olive gives her a suspicious look
'm waiting for you to say (Imitating her mother) `Just kidding
' () No, it's true
slept with a whole bunch of people
Mom
Well
It was a different time
103
Ewwww
did
got around
Before  met your father,  was a garden variety floozy
Why are you telling me this
Because  endured a similar lynching because of a certain dalliance
promise that it was no worse than Marianne Bryant's attack on me
Wanna bet
It was her mother
Wait, what
Yep
Don Bryant and  got caught in a very compromising position in the locker room during a basketball game
That's disgusting
He's disgusting
He wasn't back then
He was actually pretty handsome
All 'm saying is that  the reason that Bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told her about me
So, the sins of the mother are revisited on the daughter
There's something else you should know
This is hard to say but -- Don Bryant is your father
Marianne is your sister
104
Olive turns white
(') Kidding
Well, about the sister thing, but not about the Don thing
That happened
Actually that happened a couple of times before we got caught
Olive punches her mother on the arm, who's laughing hysterically
hate you so much right now
Can't you see 'm a mess
No, you're not, Olive
You're wonderful
And you're going to handle this the same way that did
With an incontrovertible sense of humor
They embrace and Olive gets an idea
Thanks for the pep talk, Mom
Now get out
need to make some phone calls
Rosemary looks slightly concerned by the grin on Olive's face
- We join a pep rally, already in progress
The   attempts to rile up the school with a rousing rendition of Michael Jackson's `
' In the stands, Rhi sits with Marianne and Nina
So, Olive wasn't at school today
She extends her palms to Nina and Rhi, who both slap them
Marianne puts her arm around Rhi
(') 'm so glad you're with us now
Me too
You guys fucking rock
105
We don't say that word, Rhiannon
() Just say `effing' instead
We effing rock
Marianne nods in agreement, however Rhi is confused
But isn't that just implying the same word
Oh, Rhiannon
We have so much to teach you
It's okay to imply things
Rhiannon looks at her new best friends, who just smile at her
The song ends and there's a drum roll
Yay
It's time for Meerkat Todd
() just want to rip that costume off him and -- Marianne puts her hand firmly on Rhi's knee
Why don't you just not talk for a while, okay hon
Rhi puts her head down
The drum roll ends and Meerkat Todd bounces out in costume
He jumps around enthusing the student body -- But then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a The familiar chords of the James Bond theme `Nobody Does It Better' plays from the band
Meerkat Todd opens the lid of the dumpster and Olive, dressed in a glittery and slinky  , with a  draped around her bare shoulder, pops up and croons with a handheld mic and slightly different lyrics: 106
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as me
Baby, 'm the best
Todd lifts Olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass off - and she's quite good
(') wasn't lookin,' But somehow they found me
tried to hide from Your love light
But like heaven above me The guys who loved me Are keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
She winks at the audience
The guys begin to wolf whistle and howl at her sheer brilliance
She begins to rub her hands seductively over Meerkat Todd's furry costume, eventually unzipping it and taking off the head to reveal: The crowd goes wild
(') And nobody does it better Though sometimes  wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way  do
Why'd  have to be so good
She saunters over to Rhi and kisses her on the cheek, leaving a big, red lip mark
(') The way that they hold me Whenever they hold me There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin', But just keep it comin'
How'd you learn to do the things you do
She sees that Gibbons is not amused, but that doesn't stop her
(') Oh, and nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
() 107
(') Nobody does it half as good as me
Baby, baby
Darlin', 'm the best
She walks over to a couple of  , and runs her fingers seductively over their (uh) instruments
The crowd goes wild - some appalled, but most enthused
Olive sashays through the crowd as the   scream and stuff money down her bodice
(') Baby you're the best
Darlin', you're the best
Baby, you're the best
The song ends and Olive takes Blue Devil Todd's hand
(') (To the student body) This is just a free preview

Now,  know this conflicts with tonight's basketball game, but c'mon would you rather be here cheering on the Meerkats (Looking at Todd, ) or watch me do one
There are audible gasps, but excitement nonetheless
Gibbons angrily storms over and takes the microphone
(Through gritted teeth) Young lady, to my office
Yeah,  can't
'm gonna go bang my boyfriend while the whole school watches
But good luck with the game-thing
Go Meerkats
She plods out, triumphantly
'  - The sun is setting as Olive speaks into her webcam
But this time, we're not seeing it through the lens, but from a different point in the room
108
And here you all are
Waiting outside the closet door for me to kiss Todd, listening to me pretend to have sex with Brandon, paying me to lie for you, calling probably the last virgin in school a whore
Guys
Seriously
All of a sudden -- from outside and downstairs -- James' `' begins to play
Olive goes over to the window and sees Todd below, holding up a  (a la John Cusack) and there's a - (a la Patrick Dempsey) behind him
Upon seeing this, she bursts into laughter, but it couldn't be more romantic
(') ( ) Who told you that  loved this song
( ) guessed
see you've been watching my live webcast
It's still going on, you know
Fuck them
They've had enough of you
Well, figuratively speaking
borrowed my neighbor's John Deere
Come down here
That rhymed
Intentionally
Be right down
Olive can't get the smile off of her face as she goes back to the camera
We see her through the lens
109
(') That's Todd
Not that  owe any of you any more confessions, but 'm really in love with him
And  am going to lose my virginity to him
'm not sure when
It could happen five minutes from now or tonight or six months from now or maybe on our wedding night, but the really amazing thing is that it's nobody's business
(As an afterthought) Like, totally
She turns the camera off
- Olive runs out of the house and tackles him, kissing him - in the front yard, in broad daylight, for the world to see
- The basketball game is going on to an almost empty gymnasium
We see, from the perspective of their computer screens, various reactions to Olive's webcast -- --  proud Brandon watches from a hotel room in a towel comes up behind him and kisses his neck
-- The Abernathys watch with the same demented glee they derive from watching anything
-- Mrs
Griffin watches with the face of a person who's been found out and who's days are numbered
They are
110
-- Rhi seems contemplative
Maybe it's because she's been in love with Olive since grade school
Duh
-- Evan, the fat kid, is doing jumping jacks while watching
-- Melanie Bostic (the host of the party) watches with a group of girls
() Told you guys
Pay up
-- Marianne feels regret
But a little bit impressed
-- Mr
Griffin is proud of her
-- Micah watches in his dark bedroom
'  (
) Micah
What are you doing in there
() You had better not be on the sin- ternet
-- Rosemary and Dill are too busy making out to watch
-- Anson has a jar of vaseline and is ready to jerk off, but is upset that she isn't `exposing herself' in the aforementioned way
( ) thought she was going to take her clothes off
- Olive and Todd are still kissing on the lawn underneath the stars
