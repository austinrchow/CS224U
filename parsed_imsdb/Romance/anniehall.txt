No sound
: credits : Abrupt medium close-up of Alvy Singer doing a comedy monologue
He wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt; the background is stark
There's an old joke
Uh, two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of 'em says: "Boy, the food at this place is really terrible
" The other one says, "Yeah,  know, and such
small portions
" Well, that's essentially how  feel about life
Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly
The-the other important joke for me is one that's, uh, usually attributed to Groucho Marx, but  think it appears originally in Freud's wit and its relation to the unconscious
And it goes like this-'m paraphrasing: Uh
" would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member
" That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women
Tsch, you know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind, 'cause  turned forty, tsch, and  guess 'm going through a life crisis or something,  don't know
, uh
and 'm not worried about aging
'm not one o' those characters, you know
Although 'm balding slightly on top, that's about the worst you can say about me
, uh,  think 'm gonna get better as  get older, you know
think 'm gonna be the- the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know
'Less 'm neither o' those two
Unless 'm one o' those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism
(Sighing) Annie and  broke up and - still can't get my mind around that
You know, - keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and-and examining my life and tryin' to figure out where did the screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we were
tsch, in love
You know, and-and-and And it's funny, 'm not-'m not a morose type
'm not a depressive character
--, uh, (Laughing) you know,  was a reasonably happy kid, guess
was brought up in Brooklyn during World War
: ' - Alvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his  mother in an old-fashioned, cluttered doctor's office
The doctor stands near the sofa, holding a cigarette and listening
(To the doctor) He's been depressed
All off a sudden, he can't do anything
(Nodding) Why are you depressed, Alvy
(Nudging Alvy) Tell Dr
Flicker
(Young Alvy sits, his head down
His mother answers for him) It's something he read
(Puffing on his cigarette and nodding) Something he read, huh
(His head still down) The universe is expanding
The universe is expanding
(Looking up at the doctor) Well, the universe is everything, and if it's expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything
Disgusted, his mother looks at him
(shouting) What is that your business
(she turns back to the doctor) He stopped doing his homework
What's the point
(Excited, gesturing with her hands) What has the universe got to do with it
You're here in Brooklyn
Brooklyn is not expanding
(Heartily, looking down at Alvy) It won't be expanding for billions of years yet, Alvy
And we've gotta try to enjoy ourselves while we're here
Uh
He laughs
: Fall shot of house with an amusement-park roller-coaster ride built over it
line of cars move up and then slides with great speed while out the window of the house a band shakes a dust mop
' My analyst says  exaggerate my childhood memories, but  swear  was brought up underneath the roller- : Alvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading a comic book while his father sits on the sofa reading the paper
The house shakes with every move of the roller coaster
' -coaster in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn
Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous, think
: Young Alvy at the food-stand concession watching three military men representing the Army, the Navy and the Marines arm in arm with a blond woman in a skirted bathing suit
They all turn and run toward the foreground
The girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss
The sign over the concession reads "Steve's Famous Clam Bar
Ice Cold Beer, "and the roller coaster is moving in full gear in the background
' You know,  have a hyperactive imagination
My mind tends to jump around a little, and have some trouble between fantasy and reality
: Full shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each other as Alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic
' My father ran the bumper-car concession
(Alvy as a child moves into the frame driving a bumper car
He stops as other cars bombard him
His father continues to direct the traffic) There-there he is and there  am
But --- used to get my aggression out through those cars all the time
Alvy backs up his car off screen
- The camera pans over three austere-looking teachers standing in front of the blackboard
The chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures
While Alvy speaks, one of the male teachers puts an equation on the blackboard
- "2  10 = 20 " and other arithmetic formulas
' remember the staff at our public school
You know, we had a saying, uh, that "Those who can't do, teach, and those who can't teach, teach gym
" And uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't do anything,  think, were assigned to our school
must say- : female teacher standing in front of an old-fashioned schoolroom
The blackboard behind her reads "Transportation Administration
The camera pans her point of view: a group of young students sitting behind their desks
Alvy as a child sits in a center desk wile all around him there is student activity; there is note-passing, ruler-tapping, nose-picking, gumchewing
' always felt my schoolmates were idiots
Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little face, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss Perfect all the time
And-and Ivan Ackerman, always the wrong answer
Always
Ivan stands up behind his desk
Seven and three is nine
Alvy hits his forehead with his hand
Another student glances over at him, reacting
' Even then  knew they were just jerks
(The camera moves back to the teacher, who is glaring out at her students) In nineteen forty-two  had already dis- As Alvy talks, the camera shows him move from his seat and kiss a young girl
She jumps from her seat in disgust, rubbing her cheek, as Alvy moves back to his seat
1ST (Making noises) Ugh, he kissed me, he kissed me
(Off screen) That's the second time this month
Step up here
As the teacher, really glaring now, speaks, Alvy rises from his seat and moves over to her
Angry, she points with her band while the students turn their heads to watch what will happen next
What'd  do
Step up here
What'd  do
You should be ashamed of yourself
The students, their heads still turned, look back at Alvy, now an adult, sitting in the last seat of the second row
( ) (First off screen, then onscreen as camera moves over to the back of the classroom) Why,  was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity
(The younger, Alvy standing next to her) Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds
( ) (Still sitting in the back of the classroom) did
The girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy, she gestures and speaks
1ST For God's sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks of a latency period
( ) (Gesturing) Well,  never had a latency period can't help it
(With young, Alvy still at her side) Why couldn't you have been more like Donald
(The camera pans over to Donald, sitting up tall in his seat, then back to the teacher) Now, there was a model boy
( ) (Still standing next to the teacher) Tell the folks where you are today, Donald
run a profitable dress company
' Right
Sometimes  wonder where my classmates are today
The camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, the teacher standing in the front of the room
One at a time, the young students rise u from their desks and speak
1ST 'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company
2ND sell tallises
3RD used to be a heroin addict
Now 'm a methadone addict
2ND 'm into leather
Close-up of a  screen showing Alvy as an adult on a talk show
He sits next to the show, host, Dick Cavett, a Navy man sits on his right
Static is heard throughout the dialogue
lost track of most of my old schoolmates, but  wound up a comedian
They did not take me in the Army
was, uh
Interestingly enough,  was- was four-
Sounds of  audience laughter and applause are heard
Four-
Yes
In-in-in-in the event of war, 'm a hostage
More audience laughter joined by Dick Cavett and the naval officer
Alvy's  mother sits at the old-fashioned dining-room table peeling carrots and talking as she looks off screen
You always only saw the worst in people
You never could get along with anyone at school
You were always outta step with the world
Even when you got famous, you still distrusted the world
' - pretty Manhattan street with sidewalk trees, brownstones, a school; people mill about, some strolling and carrying bundles, others buried
The screen shows the whole length of the sidewalk, a street, and part of the sidewalk beyond
As the following scene ensues, two pedestrians, indistinguishable in the distance, come closer and closer toward the camera, recognizable, finally, as Alvy and his best friend, Rob, deep in conversation
They eventually move past the camera and off screen
Traffic noise is heard in the background
distinctly heard it
He muttered under his breath, "Jew
" You're crazy
No, 'm not
We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew
" Alvy, you're a total paranoid
Wh- How am  a paran-
Well,  pick up on those kind o' things
You know,  was having lunch with some guys from , so said
uh, "Did you eat yet or what
" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo
" Not, did you, didchoo eat
Jew
No, not did you eat, but Jew eat
Jew
You get it
Jew eat
Ah, Max, you, uh
Stop calling me Max
Why, Max
It's a good name for you
Max, you see conspiracies in everything
No,  don't
You know,  was in a record store
Listen to this -so  know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner
" Wagner, Max, Wagner-so  know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner
Right, Max
California, Max
Ah
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city
Forget it, Max
-we move to sunny
All of show business is out there, Max
No,  cannot
You keep bringing it up, but don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light
(Checking his watch) Right, Max, forget it
Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie
'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman
think  have a few minutes left
Right
- Alvy stands in front of glass doors of theater, the ticket taker behind him just inside the glass doors
The sounds of city traffic, car horns honking, can be heard while he looks around waiting for, Annie
man in a black leather jacket, walking past the theater, stops in front of, Alvy
He looks at him, then moves away
He stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at Alvy again
Alvy looks away, then back at the man
The man continues to stare
Alvy scratches his head, looking for Annie and trying not to notice the man
The man, still staring, walks back to Alvy
1ST Hey, you on television
(Nodding his head) No
Yeah, once in a while
You know, like occasionally
1ST What's your name
(Clearing his throat) You wouldn't know it
It doesn't matter
What's the difference
1ST You were on
uh, the
uh, the Johnny Carson, right
Once in a while, you know
mean, you know, every now- 1ST What's your name
Alvy  is getting more and more uneasy as the man talks; more and more people move through the doors of the theater
(Nervously) 'm
'm, uh, 'm Robert Redford
1ST (Laughing) Come on
Alvy Singer
It was nice nice
Thanks very much
for everything
They shake hands and Alvy pats the man's arm
The man in turn looks over his shoulder and motions to another man
All excited now, he points to Alvy and calls out
Alvy looks impatient
1ST Hey
2ND (Off screen) What
1ST This is Alvy Singer
Fellas
you know-Jesus
Come on
1ST (Overlapping, ignoring Alvy) This guy's on television
Alvy Singer, right
Am  right
(Overlapping 1st man) Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break
Jesus Christ
1ST (Still ignoring Alvy's protestations) This guy's on television
need a large polo mallet
2ND (Moving into the screen) Who's on television
1ST This guy, on the Johnny Carson show
(Annoyed) Fellas, what is this-a meeting o' the teamsters
You know
2ND (Also ignoring Alvy) What program
1ST (Holding out a matchbook) Can  have your autograph
You don't want my autograph
1ST (Overlapping, Alvy's  speech) Yeah,  do
It's for my girl friend
Make it out to Ralph
(Taking the matchbook and pen and writing) Your girl friend's name is Ralph
1ST It's for my brudder
(To passersby) Alvy Singer
Hey
This is Alvy- 2ND (To Alvy, overlapping 1st man's speech) You really Alvy Singer, the
the star
Nodding his head yes, Alvy shoves 2nd man aside and moves to the curb of the sidewalk
The two men follow, still talking over the traffic noise
1ST -Singer
2ND Alvy Singer over here
cab moves into the frame and stops by the curb
Alvy moves over to it about to get in
(Overlapping the two men and stuttering) -i-i-i-it's all right, fellas
(As Alvy opens the cab door, the two men still behind him, Annie gets out) Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal
(Overlapping Alvy) Alright, alright, 'm in a bad mood, okay
Annie closes the cab door and she and Alvy move over to the ticket booth of the theater as they continue to talk
Bad mood
'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather
" You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it
Deal
'm dealing with two guys named Cheech
Okay
(They move into the ticket line, still talking
billboard next to them reads " ' ' ,' ") Please,  have a headache, all right
Hey, you are in a bad mood
You-you- you must be getting your period
'm not getting my period
Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that 'm getting my period
They move over to the ticket counter, people in front of them buying tickets and walking off screen
(Gesturing) li-little louder
think one of them may have missed it
(To the ticket clerk) 'm, has the picture started yet
It started two minutes ago
(Hitting his hand on the counter) That's it
Forget it
- can't go in
Two minutes, Alvy
(Overlapping Annie) No, 'm sorry,  can't do it
We-we've blown it already
-you know, uh, - can't go in in the middle
In the middle
(Alvy nods his head yes and let's out an exasperated sigh) We'll only miss the titles
They're in Swedish
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something
We'll go next- Two hours
No, u-uh, 'm going in
'm going in
She moves past the ticket clerk
(Waving to Annie) Go ahead
Good-bye
Annie moves back to Alvy and takes his arm
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that
(Watching people with tickets move past them) Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause  get embarrassed
Alright
All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do
don't know now
You-you wanna go to another movie
(Annie nods her head and shrugs her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, gesturing with his band, looks at her) So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity
Oh, come on, we've seen it
'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis
Well, 'm sorry, - can't
--'ve gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause-'cause 'm anal
(Laughing now) 'h, that's a polite word for what you are
lined-up crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater, Alvy and Annie among them
bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the ensuing scene
(Loudly to his companion right behind Alvy and Annie) We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday
It is not one of his best
It lacks a cohesive structure
You know, you get the feeling that he's not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say
'Course, 've always felt he was essentially a-a technical film maker
Granted, La Strada was a great film
Great in its use of negative energy more than anything else
But that simple cohesive core
Alvy, reacting to the man's loud monologue, starts to get annoyed, while Annie begins to read her newspaper
(Overlapping the man's speech) 'm-'m-'m gonna have a stroke
(Reading) Well, stop listening to him
(Overlapping Alvy and Annie) You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another
You know what 'm talking about
(Sighing) He's screaming his opinions in my ear
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon,  found it incredibly
indulgent
You know, he really is
He's one of the most indulgent film makers
He really is- (Overlapping) Key word here is "indulgent
" (Overlapping) -without getting
well, let's put it this way
(To Annie, who is still reading, overlapping the man in line who is still talking) What are you depressed about
missed my therapy
overslept
How can you possibly oversleep
The alarm clock
(Gasping) You know what a hostile gesture that is to me
know-because of our sexual problem, right
Hey, you
everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse
- It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- admire the technique but he doesn't
he doesn't hit me on a gut level
(To Annie) 'd like to hit this guy on a gut level
The man in line continues his speech all the while Alvy and Annie talk
Stop it, Alvy
(Wringing his hands) Well, he's spitting on my neck
You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks
And then, the most important thing of all is a comedian's vision
And you know something else
You know, you're so egocentric that if  miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of how it affects you
(Lighting a cigarette while he talks) Gal gun-shy is what it is
(Reacting again to the man in line) Probably on their first date, right
(Still going on) It's a narrow view
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books
"Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy
" (He sighs; then to Annie) Whatta you mean, our sexual problem
Oh
-- mean, 'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn
Okay, 'm very sorry
My sexual problem
Okay, my sexual problem
Huh
The man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away
never read that
That was-that was Henry James, right
Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw
My Sexual
(Even louder now) It's the influence of television
Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand
hot medium
as opposed to a
(More and more aggravated) What  wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure
as opposed to a print
Alvy steps forward, waving his hands in frustration, and stands facing the camera
(Sighing and addressing the audience) What do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind you
mean, it's just maddening
The man in line moves toward Alvy
Both address the audience now
Wait a minute, why can't  give my opinion
It's a free country
mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud
mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that
And-and the funny part of it is, -Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's
work
(Overlapping) Wait a minute
Really
Really
happen to teach a class at Columbia called " Media and Culture"
So  think that my insights into Mr
McLuhan-well, have a great deal of validity
Oh, do yuh
Yes
Well, that's funny, because  happen to have Mr
McLuhan right here
So
so, here, just let me- mean, all right
Come over here
a second
Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back of the crowded lobby
He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster
Oh
(To McLuban) Tell him
(To the man in line) hear- heard what you were saying
You-you know nothing of my work
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong
How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing
(To the camera) Boy, if life were only like this
-
Credits appear over the faces of the soldiers
5
, 1972 ,  , 1969 Chronicle of a French town during the Occupation ' (Over credits and soldiers) June fourteenth, nineteen forty, the German army occupies Paris
All over the country, people are desperate for every available scrap of news
: - Annie is sitting up in bed reading
(Off screen) Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know
Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much
'm,  don't know, sometimes  ask myself how 'd stand up under torture
(Off screen) You
You kiddin'
(He moves into the frame, lying across the bed to touch, Annie, who makes a face) If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything
That movie makes me feel guilty
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to
He starts kissing Annie's arm
She gets annoyed and continues to read
Alvy,
What-what-what-what's the matter
-you know,  don't wanna
(Overlapping Annie, reacting) What-what- don't
It's not natural
We're sleeping in a bed together
You know, it's been a long time
know, well, it's just that-you know, mean, --- gotta sing tomorrow night, so  have to rest my voice
(Overlapping Annie again) It's always some kind of an excuse
It's- You know, you used to think that  was very sexy
What
When we first started going out, we had sex constantly
We're- we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records
(Patting Alvy's band solicitously) know
Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that 'm going through a phase, that's all
'm
mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get
You were very hot for Allison at first
: -
Allison, clipboard in band, walks about the wings, stopping to talk to various people
Musicians, performers and technicians mill about, busy with activity
Allison wears a large "" button, as do the people around her
The sounds of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard, occasionally, interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience
Allison stops to talk to two women; they, too, wear "" buttons
(Looking down at the clipboard) Ma'am, you're on right after this man
about twenty minutes, something like that
Oh, thank you
Alvy moves into the frame behind Allison
He taps her on the shoulder; she turns to face him
(Coughing) Excuse
excuse me, when do  go on
(Looking down at the clipboard) Who are you
Alvy
Alvy Singer
'm a comedian
Oh, comedian
Yes
Oh, uh
you're on next
(Rubbing his hands together nervously) What do you mean, next
(Laughing) Uh
mean you're on right after this act
(Gesturing) No, it can't be, because he's a comic
Yes
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row
Why not
No, 'm sorry, 'm not goin'-  can't don't wanna go on after that comedian
It's okay
No, because they're-they're laughing, so (He starts laughing nervously) --'d rather not
If you don't mind, prefer- (Overlapping) Will you relax, please
They're gonna love you,  know
(Overlapping) prefer not to, because
look, they're laughing at him
See, so what are yuh telling me- They move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings
(Overlapping) Yes
(Overlapping) -that 've got to
ah
ah
They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then  gotta go out there, gotta
get laughs, too
How much can they laugh
(Off screen) They-they they're laughed out
(Off screen) Do you feel all right
As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai Stevenson
The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in clusters around the room
The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage
Alvy is swinging his hands nervously
(Off screen, onstage) You know
Alvy starts looking Allison up and down; people in the background mill about
(Above the chatter around him) Look, what's your-what's your name
(Off screen) General Eisenhower is not
(Looking out at the stage) Allison
Yeah
Allison what
(Still looking off screen) Portchnik
a group from the
(Coughing) Thank you
- don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally 'cause
(He clears his throat) Excuse me, 'm not essentially a political comedian at all
The audience starts to laugh
interestingly had, uh, dated
a woman in the Eisenhower Administration briefly
and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh
tsch
'cause was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years
The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage
Allison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing
There are books all over the room; a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls
Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits on the edge of the bed
Allison looks at him
'm, 'm sorry,  can't go through with this, because it- can't get it off my mind, Allison
it's obsessing me
Well, 'm getting tired of it
need your attention
Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, gesturing with his hands
It-but it-it
doesn't make any sense
He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound
So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once
It doesn't make sense
Alvy
Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs
He then snaps his fingers and starts walking again
'll tell you this
He was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range
But
(Clears his throat) if there was a second assassin
it- That's it
Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf
We've been through this
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle
(Moving back to the bed and lighting a cigarette) Okay
All right, so whatta yuh saying, now
That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right
Well, why not
Yeah, Earl Warren
(Moving toward the bed) Hey
honey,  don't know Earl Warren
Lyndon Johnson
(Propping one knee on the bed and gesturing) --Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician
You know the ethics those guys have
It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy
(Nodding his head) Tsch
The , and the , and
Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House
Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking again
--- would leave out the men's-room attendant
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me
Oh, my God
(Then, to the camera) She's right
Why did  turn off Allison Portchnik
She was-she was beautiful
She was willing
She was real
intelligent
(Sighing) Is it the old Groucho Marx joke
That-that - just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member
- Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach house in the Hamptons
As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the house
Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters crawling on the floor
Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of groceries sit on the counter
There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator
Alvy, now don't panic
Please
Look,  told you it was a
mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house
Stop it
Don't
don't do that
There
The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor
Annie, bolding out a wooden paddle, tries to shove them onto it
Well, maybe we should just call the police
Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up
Oh, all right
All right
It's all right
Here
She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail
Laughing, she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly
Don't give it to me
Don't
(Hysterically) Oooh
Here
Here
(Pointing) Look
Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator
It'll turn up in our bed at night
(They move over to the refrigerator; Alvy moves as close to the wall as possible as Annie, covering her mouth and laughing hysterically, teasingly dangles a lobster in front of him) Will you get outta here with that thing
Jesus
(Laughing, to the lobster) Get him
(Laughing) Talk to him
You speak shellfish
(He moves over to the stove and takes the lid of a large steamer filled with boiling water) Hey, look
put it in the pot
(Laughing) can't
can't put him in the pot can't put a live thing in hot water
(Overlapping) Gimme
Gimme
Let me do it
What-what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies
Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on
(Overlapping Alvy and making sounds) Oh, God
Here yuh go
Oh, good, now he'll think- (She screams) Aaaah
Okay
(Overlapping Annie) Okay, it's in
It's definitely in the pot
All right
All right
All right
She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster
Smiling, she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to push it from the wall
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator
can't get it out
This thing's heavy
Maybe if  put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what  mean
(Overlapping) Yeah
'm gonna get my
'm gonna get my camera
You know, - think
if  could pry this door off
We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs
They don't run around
Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle
Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the chandelier
Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink
Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him
Great
Great
(Screaming) Goddammit
(Screaming) Ooooh
These are
p-p-p-pick this lobster up
Hold it, please
All right
All right
All right
All right
Whatta yuh mean
Are yuh gonna take pictures now
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful
Ooooh, lovely
(Picking up the lobster Annie placed on the counter earlier) All right, here
Oh, God, it's disgusting
Alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and making a face
Don't be a jerk
One more, Alvy, please, one more picture
(Reluctantly Alvy picks up the lobster again as Annie takes another picture) Oh, oh, good, good
-
The camera pans Annie and Alvy as they walk along the shore
So, so-well, here's what  wanna know
-what
(He clears his throat) Am  your first big romance
Oh
no, no, no, no, uh, uh
No
Well, then, w-who was
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School
: - Behind him is a movie theater with " , '' " on the marquee
He looks at his watch as the younger Annie, in a beehive hairdo, moves into the frame
They kiss quickly and look at each other, smiling
' (Off screen) Dennis-right, uh, uh
local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night
' Oh, God, you should've seen what  looked like then
' (Off screen, laughing) Oh,  can imagine
-p-probably the wife of an astronaut
' Then there was Jerry, the actor
: -  - The younger, Annie and Jerry lean against the wall
Jerry is running his band down Annie's bare arm
Annie and Alvy walk into the room, observing the younger Annie, in jeans and -shirt, with Jerry
' (Laughing) Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown
' look pretty
' Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you
Acting is like an exploration of the soul
-it's very religious
Uh, like, uh, a kind of liberating consciousness
It's like a visual poem
(Laughing) Is he kidding with that crap
(Laughing) Oh, right
Right, yeah,  think know exactly what you mean, when you say "religious
" (Incredulous, to Annie) You do
(Still watching) Oh, come on- mean,  was still younger
Hey, that was last year
It's like when  think of dying
You know how  would like to die
No, how
'd like to get torn apart by wild animals
' Heavy
Eaten by some squirrels
' Hey, listen- mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat-looking and he was emotional
-hey,  don't think you like emotion too much
Jerry stops rubbing the younger Annie's arm and slides down to the floor as she raises her foot toward his chest
Touch my heart
with your foot
' - may throw up
: - It's now sunset, the water reflecting the last light
The camera moves over the scene
The off screen voices of Alvy and Annie are heard as they walk, the camera always one step ahead of them
He was creepy
Yeah, - think you're pretty lucky came along
(Laughing) Oh, really
Well, la-de-da
La-de-da
If -if anyone had ever told me that  would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la-de-da"
Oh, that's right
That you really like those New York girls
Well, no
not just, not only
Oh, 'd say so
You married- : - cocktail party is in progress, the rooms crowded with guests as Alvy and Robin make their way through the people
waiter, carrying a tray, walks past them
Alvy reaches out to pick up a glass; Robin reaches over and picks it of the tray first
There is much low-key chatter in the background
(Off screen) -two of them
There's Henry Drucker
He has a chair in history at Princeton
Oh, the short man is Hershel Kaminsky
He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set
Why are you so hostile
(Sighing) 'Cause  wanna watch the Knicks on television
(Squinting) Is that Paul Goodman
No
And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book
Hi, Doug
Douglas Wyatt
" Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart
" They move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them
(Taking Robin's hand) 'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery
Commentary
Oh, really,  heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery
No jokes-these are friends, okay
Alvy sits on the foot of the bed watching the Knicks game on television
(Off screen) Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New York Knicks
Robin enters the room, slamming the door
Here you are
There's people out there
Hey, you wouldn't believe this
Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now
(Clears his throat) they're ahead two points
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop
(Looking at Robin) What's fascinating is that it's physical
You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on
But on the other hand
(Clears his throat) the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know
Alvy reaches over, pulls Robin down onto the bed
He kisses her and moves farther up on the bed
Stop acting out
She sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the sprawled-out Alvy
No, it'll be great
It'll be great, be-because all those Ph
's are in there, you know, like
discussing models of alienation and we'll be in here quietly humping
He pulls Robin toward him, caressing her as she pulls herself away
Alvy, don't
You're using sex to express hostility
"'Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories
' (Clears his throat) he said as he removed her brassiere
" (Pulling away again) There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine
My God
What would they think
She gets up and fixes the zipper on her dress
She turns and moves toward the door
- Robin and Alvy are in bed
The room is in darkness
Outside, a siren starts blaring
Oh, 'm sorry
Don't get upset
Dammit
was so close
She flips on the overhead lamp and turns on her side
Alvy turns to her
(Gesturing) Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn
mean, the city can't close down
You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too
No more flights so we can have sex
(Reaching over for her eyeglasses on the night table) 'm too tense
need a Valium
My analyst says  should live in the country and not in New York
Well,  can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time
The country makes me nervous
There's
You got crickets and it-it's quiet
there's no place to walk after dinner, and
uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and
uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry- (Interrupting) Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks 'm too tense
Where's the goddamn Valium
She fumbles about the floor for the Valium, then back on the bed
Hey, come on, it's quiet now
We can-we can start again
can't
What- My head is throbbing
Oh, you got a headache
have a headache
Bad
Oswald and ghosts
Jesus
He begins to get out of bed
Where are you going
Well, 'm-'m gonna take another in a series of cold showers
'
Rob and Alvy, carrying tennis rackets, come through the door of the locker room to the lobby
They are dressed in tennis whites
They walk toward the indoor court
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers- Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism
Max, the city is terribly worried
But the- 'm not discussing politics or economics
This is foreskin
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out
Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism
Don't you see
The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers
think of us that way, sometimes, and - live here
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun
Sun is bad for yuh
Everything our parents said was good is bad
Sun, milk, red meat, college
Annie and Janet, in tennis whites, stand on the court holding tennis rackets and balls
They are chattering and giggling
(Laughing) know, but ooh- here he comes
Okay
Rob and Alvy enter the court and walk over to the two women
Rob kisses Janet and makes introduction
You know Alvy
Oh, hi, Alvy
(To Rob) How are yuh
(To Alvy) You know Annie
'm sorry
This is Annie Hall
Hi
Hi
Annie and Alvy shake hands
(Laughing) Alvy
(Eager to begin) Who's playing who here
Alvy Well, uh
you and me against them
(Overlapping Alvy) Well
so
can't play too good, you know
(Laughing) 've had four lessons
The group, laughing and chatting, divide up-Rob and Annie moving to the other side of the net, Alvy and Janet standing where they are
They start to play mixed doubles, each taking turns and playing well
At one point in the game, Annie starts to talk to Rob, then turns and sees a ball heading toward her
(Hitting the halt back) Holy gods
Alvy, dressed, puts things into a gym bag
One knee is on the bench and his back is turned from the entrance
Annie walks toward the entrance door dressed in street clothes and carrying her tennis bag over her shoulder
Seeing Alvy, she stops and turns
Hi
Hi, hi
(Looking over his shoulder) Hi
Oh, hi
Hi
(Hands clasped in front of her, smiling) Well, bye
She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door
(Clearing his throat) You-you play
very well
Oh, yeah
So do you
Oh, God, whatta- (Making sounds and laughing) whatta dumb thing to say, right
mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away
have to say well
Oh, oh
God, Annie
(She gestures with her hand) Well
oh, well
la-de-da, la-de-da, la-la
She turns around and moves toward the door
(Still looking over his shoulder) Uh
you-you wanna lift
(Turning and aiming her thumb over her shoulder) Oh, why-uh
y-y-you gotta car
No, um
was gonna take a cab
(Laughing) Oh, no,  have a car
You have a car
(Annie smiles, hands folded in front of her) So
(Clears his throat) don't understand why
if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car
"
like you wanted a lift
don't
(Laughing) don't
Geez,  don't know, 've
wa- This

(Laughing and gesturing toward the door) What a jerk, yeah
Would you like a lift
(Zipping up his bag) Sure
-w-w-which way yuh goin'
Me
Oh, downtown
Down- 'm-'m goin' uptown
(Laughing) Oh, well, 'm goin' uptown, too
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown
Yeah, well, 'm, but
Alvy picks up his bag and moves toward the door
As he turns his bag around, the handle of the tennis racket bits Annie between the legs
(Laughing) So sorry
(Laughing) mean,  can go uptown, too
live uptown, but
uh, what the hell,  mean, it'd be nice having company, you know mean,  hate driving alone
(Making sounds) Yeah
They walk out the door
- Alvy and Annie in the  as Annie speeds down a city street near the East River
So, how long do you know Janet
Where do you know her from
(Laughing) Oh, 'm in her acting class
Oh - you're an actress
Well,  do commercials, sort of
She zooms down the wrong lane, cars swerving out of her way
horn blows
, uh
well, you're not from New York, right
No, Chippewa Falls
Right
( pause) Where
Wisconsin
(Finally reacting) Uh, you're driving a- Uh, don't worry, 'm a very- ( car moves closer to the , almost on top of it in the wrong direction
Annie swerves away at the very last minute) -a very good driver
(Alvy rubs his head nervously, staring out the window as Annie speeds along) So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway
Annie looks down beside her, searching for the gum
No, no thanks
Hey, don't- Well, where is it
- No, no, no, no, you just
just watch the road
'll get it- Okay
They both fumble around in her pocketbook
Alvy looks up to see the entire front of a truck in Annie's windshield
She swerves just in time
-for yuh
Okay, that's good
Alvy continues to look for the gum while Annie zooms down the city streets
All right
'll getcha a piece
Yeah
so, listen-you drive
Do  drive
Uh, no,  gotta- gotta problem with driving
Oh, you do
Yeah
got, uh,  got a license but have too much hostility
Oh, right
Nice car
( bit rapidly) Huh
You keep it nice
(He pulls a half-eaten sandwich out of her bag) Can  ask you, is this-is this a sandwich
Huh
Oh, yeah
- Cars are parked on both sides of the street as the  rounds the corner
live over here
Oh, my God
Look
There's a parking space
With brakes squealing, Annie turns the  sharply into the parking spot
Annie and Alvy get out, Alvy looking over his shoulder as he leaves the car
That's okay, you
we-we can walk to the curb from here
Don't be funny
You want your tennis stuff
Huh
Oh
yeah
You want your gear
Here you go
Alvy reaches into the back of the car and takes out tennis equipment
He hands her her things
People pass by on the street
(Laughing) Yeah, thanks
Thanks a lot
Well
(Sighing) Well, thanks, thank you
You-you're a wonderful tennis player
(Laughing) Oh
Alvy shakes hands with Annie
You're the worst driver 've ever seen in my life
that's including any place the worst
Europe, United
any place
Asia
(Laughing) Yeah
And  love what you're wearin'
Alvy touches the tie Annie is wearing around her neck
Oh, you do
Yeah
Oh, well, it's uh this is, uh
this tie is a present, from Grammy Hall
Annie flips the bottom of the tie
Who

(Laughing) Yeah,  know

She-she was	too busy getting raped by Cossacks
(Laughing) Well

Oh, yeah, yeah

(Overlapping, gesturing) Hey, well, listen

and have a glass of wine and something
Aw, no, mean

No, no, that'll be fine

Sure

(Overlapping) No,  got time
Okay
Sure,  got

They move toward Annie's apartment building
Oh, you see an analyst
-y-yeah, just for fifteen years
Fifteen years
Yeah, uh, 'm gonna give him one more year and then 'm goin' to Lourdes
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're
yeah, really
' Alvy, standing, looks around the apartment
There are lots of books, framed photographs on the white wall
terrace can be seen from the window
He picks up a copy of Ariet, by Sylvia Platb, as Annie comes out of the kitchen carrying two glasses
She hands them to Alvy
Sylvia Plath
'hm
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality
Oh, yeah
Oh, sorry
Right
Well,  don't know,  mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know
Neat
Neat, yeah
Uh,  hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out,  would say, at the turn of the century
(Annie laughs) Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall
(Moving over to the photographs) Oh
oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my
brother, Duane
Duane
(Pointing) Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie
Well, who's Sadie
Sadie
Oh, well, Sadie
(Laughing) Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George
Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing
What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it
Uh
Uh, narcolepsy
Narcolepsy, right, right
Right
So, anyway, so
(Laughing) George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was
(Annie points her fingers to each side of her head, indicating George was a little crazy) shell-shocked, you know what  mean, in the First World War
(Laughing hysterically, she opens a cabinet door and takes out a bottle of wine) Anyway, so, so
(Laughing through the speech) George is standing in line, oh, just a sec uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up
So, so
(Laughing) so, he's dead
(Laughing) he's dead
Yeah
Oh, dear
Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say mean, that's pretty unfortunate
Annie unscrews the bottle of wine, silent now after her speech
Yeah, it's a great story, though, mean,
it really made my day
Hey,  think  should get outta here, you know, 'cause  think 'm imposing, you know
(Laughing) Oh, really
Oh, well
uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh
and
uh, yeah, uh
uh, you know, --
They move outside to the terrace, Alvy still holding the glasses, Annie the wine
They stand in front of the railing, Annie pouring the wine into the held-out glasses
Well,  mean, you don't have to, you know
No,  know, but
but, you know, 'm all perspired and everything
Well, didn't you take, uh
uh, a shower at the club
Me
No, no, no, 'cause  never shower in a public place
(Laughing) Why not
'Cause  don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh
(Laughing) Oh,  see,  see
You know,  don't like to show my body to a man of my gender- Yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah,  see
guess- -'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen
(Sipping her wine and laughing) Fifteen years, huh
Fifteen years, yeah
Yeah
Oh, God bless
They	put their glasses together in a toast
God bless
(Laughing) Well, uh
(Pausing) You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew
(Clearing his throat) Oh, thank you
(Smiling) Yeah, well
you-She hates Jews
She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh,  mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever
'm tellin' yuh
(pointing toward the apartment after a short pause) So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what
(Nodding, her hand on her hip) Yeah, yeah,  sorta dabble around, you know
Annie's thoughts pop on the screen as she talks:  dabble
Listen to me-what a jerk
They're
they're
they're wonderful, you know
They have
they have, uh a
a quality
As do Alvy's: You are a great-looking girl Well, -- would- would like to take a serious photography course soon
Again, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks 'm a yo-yo Photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet
And Alvy's:  wonder what she looks like naked
Aesthetic criteria
You mean, whether it's, uh, good photo or not
'm not smart enough for him
Hang in there The-the medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself
That's- don't know what 'm saying-she senses 'm shallow Well, well,
to me-
mean, it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you know
mean,  just try to uh, feel it, you know
try to get a sense of it and not think about it so much
God,  hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others Still, still we- You need a set of aesthetic guide lines to put it in social perspective,  think
Christ,  sound like  radio
Relax They're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping
The sounds of distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace
Annie, laughing, speaks first
Well,  don't know
mean,  guess- guess you must be sorta late, huh
You know,  gotta get there and begin whining soon
otherwise - Hey
well, are you busy Friday night
Me
Oh, uh
(Laughing) No
(Putting his band on his forehead) Oh, 'm sorry, wait a minute,  have something
Well, what about Saturday night

Not-no, no
Oh, you

Gee, boy, what do you have
You have plague

Yeah
You're gonna sing
Do you sing

No, 'm interested
(Laughing) Oh, no- mean, 'm just a-auditioning sort of at club

(Overlapping) -it's my first time
That's okay, 'cause  know exactly what that's like
Listen- (Interrupting) Yeah
(Overlapping) -you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun
- Annie stands on center stage with a microphone, a pianist behind her Bright light is focused on her; the rest of the club is in darkness
There are the typical sounds and movements of a nightclub audience: low conversation, curling smoke, breaking glass, microphone bum, moving chairs, waiters clattering trays, a ringing phone as Annie sings "It Had to Be You
-
Alvy and Annie walk quickly down the sidewalk
was awful
'm so ashamed
can't sing
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless
Whatta you mean, a tad restless
Oh, my God,  mean, they hated me
No, they didn't
You have a wonderful voice
No, 'm gonna quit
No, 'm not gonna letcha
You have a great voice
Really, do you think so, really
Yeah
Yeah
It's terrific
(Overlapping) Yeah, you know something
never even took a lesson, either
They stop in the middle of the sidewalk
Alvy turns Annie around to face him
Hey, listen, listen
What
Gimme a kiss
Really
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right
Yeah
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension
You know, we never kissed before and 'll never know when to make the right move or anything
So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat
Okay
Oh, all right
And we'll digest our food better
Okay
Okay
Yeah
They kiss
So now we can digest our food
They turn and start walking again
We can digest our- Okay
Yeah
- Annie and Alvy sit down in a booth
The deli is fairly well lit and crowded
Conversation, plates clattering, can be heard over the dialogue
The waiter comes over to them to take their order
(To the waiter) 'm gonna have a corned beef
(To the waiter) Yeah
oh, uh, and 'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce
(Alvy involuntarily makes a face as the waiter leaves) Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure
Oh
And your first wife was Allison
My first
Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault
was just
was too crazy
Oh
- Alvy and Annie in bed together
'm, that was so nice
That was nice
As Balzac said
'm
"There goes another novel
" (They laugh) Jesus, you were great
Oh, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, 'm-'m-'m a wreck
No
(She turns and looks at Alvy, then laughs) You're a wreck
Really
mean it
-'ll never play the piano again
(Lighting a joint and laughing) You're really nuts
don't know, you really thought it was good
Tell me
Good

No, that was the most fun 've ever had without laughing
(Laughing) Here, you want some
No, no, --i, uh,  don't use any major hallucinogenics because  took a puff like five years ago at a party and Yeah
-tried to take my pants off over my head
(Annie laughs) my ear
Oh,  don't know,  don't really don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er
relaxes me at first
'hm
(He pushes himself up from the bed and looks down at Annie) You're not gonna believe this, but- What
What
: - Annie and Alvy browsing in crowded bookstore
Alvy, carrying two books, "Death and Western Thought" and "The Denial of Death", moves over to where Annie is looking
Hey
'm
--'m gonna buy you these books, think, because - think you should read them
You know, instead of that cat book
(Looking at the books Alvy is bolding) That's, uh
(Laughing) that's pretty serious stuff there
Yeah, 'cause -'m, you know, 'm, 'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, think
Big- (Overlapping) Yeah
-big subject with me, yeah
Yeah
They move over to the cashier line
(Gesturing) 've a very pessimistic view of life
You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know
-- feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable
'hm
Those are the two categories
'hm
you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh,  don't know, terminal cases, you know
'hm
And blind people, crippled
Yeah
don't-don't know how they get through life
It's amazing to me
'hm
You know, and the miserable is everyone else
That's-that's all
So-so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky
to be
(Overlapping Annie's laughter) to be miserable
-huh
- It's a beautiful sunny day in Central Park
People are sitting on benches, others strolling, some walking dogs
One woman stands feeding cooing pigeons
Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before them
An older man and woman walk into view
Look, look at that guy
'hm
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr
When-in-the-Pink, Mr
Miami Beach, there, you know
(Over Annie's laughter) He's the latest
just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night
He placed third
(Laughing) 'hm
Yeah
Yeah
The camera shows them sitting side by side relaxed on a bench
(Watching two men approach, one lighting a cigar) Look at these guys
Yeah
Oh, that's hilarious
They're back from Fire Island
They're
they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what mean
Oh
Italian, right
Yeah, he's the Mafia
Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what  mean
(Laughing) Oh, yeah
No, 'm serious
(Over Annie's laughter) just got my mustache wet
Oh, yeah
(As another man walks by) And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest
- Alvy and Annie walk almost in silhouette along the dock, the New York City skyline in the background
Alvy has his arm around Annie and they walk slowly
No one else is around
You see, like you and
You are extremely sexy
No, 'm not
Unbelievably sexy
Yes, you are
Because
you know what you are
You're-you're polymorphously perverse
Well, what does-what does that mean
don't know what that is
Uh
uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when  touch you
Ooooh
They stop walking
Holding Annie's arms, Alvy turns her to face him
The South Street Bridge, lit up for the night, is in the background
You know what  mean
Like the tip o'your nose, and if  stroke your teeth or your kneecaps
you get excited
Come on
(Laughing) Yeah
You know what
You know, like you,  really mean it
really do like you
You- Do you love me
Do  love you
That's the key question
Yeah
know you've only known me a short while
Well,  certainly
think that's very- Yeah, yeah
(Laughing) yeah
Do you love me
-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what
Yeah
-
love you
(Over Annie's laughter) You know  lo-ove you, - love you
(Over Annie's laughter) - have to invent- Of course  love you
Yeah
(Putting his arms around her neck) Don't you think  do
dunno
They kiss as a foghorn sounds in the distance
' Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures
They both carry cartons
Whatta you mean
You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you
(Putting down the carton) Of course
Yeah, bu-bu-but why
Well,  mean, 'm moving in with you, that's why
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment
have a tiny apartment
Yeah,  know it's small
(Picking up the suitcases and walking into the bedroom) That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs
(Picking up some pictures and following Annie into the bedroom) All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing
You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a
(Annie, reacting, tosses the suitcases and some loose clothing onto the bed
She sits down on the edge, looking away
Alvy walks in, pictures and carton in band, still talking) rapidly growing field
You don't want me to live with you
How-  don't want you to live with me
How- Whose idea was it
Mine
Ye-ah
Was it
It was yours actually, but, uh,  approved it immediately
guess you think that  talked you into something, huh
(putting pictures on the mantel) No-what, what
we live together, we sleep together, we eat together
Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh
He moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in
He starts tossing books off screen
(Looking up at Alvy) How is it any different
(Gesturing) It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment
(Holding a book, he starts walking around the room) Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft
that we know that we're not married
He tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat
(Still sitting on the bed) That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy
(Looking at Annie) That place is four hundred dollars a month
Yes, it is
(Whistling) It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs
Jesus, 'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, 'll pay for it
(Shaking her head) You don't think 'm smart enough to be serious about
Hey, don't be ridiculous
Alvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like  was dumb or something
(Putting his hand to his forehead) 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing
You meet a lotta interesting professors
You know, it's stimulating
- Annie and Alvy, in Annie's , driving to their summerhouse
The camera moves with them as they pass a house with a lighted window, blooming foliage
There is no dialogue, but it is a comfortable quiet
Classical music plays in the background
: - Annie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing through a school catalogue
Alvy lies in bed reading
(Reading) Does this sound like a good course
Uh, "Modern American Poetry"
Uh, or, uh-let's see now
maybe  should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel
" Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf
What
(Laughing) Hey, listen, what-what do you think
Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight
Alvy leans over and kisses her shoulder
No, don't be silly
What-what do we need other people for
(He puts his arms around her neck, kissing her, Annie making muffled sounds) You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something
(Laughing) Well, okay
Well, listen, 'm gonna get a cigarette, okay
(Yelling out to her as she leaves the room) Yeah, grass, right
The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday
(Off screen) Well, have you ever made love high
Me, no
You
--you know, if have grass or alcohol or anything get unbearably wonderful
get too, too wonderful for words
You know, don't- don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love
(Moving back into the room and lighting a joint) It relaxes me
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed
(Closing the door) Well, what's the difference, anyway
Well, 'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal
You can sleep through it
Oh, come on, look who's talking
You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years
(She gets into bed and takes a puff of marijuana) You should smoke some o' this
You'd be off the couch in no time
Oh, come, you don't need that
Alvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her
What are you doing
(Kissing her) No, no, no, what
You can once, you can live without it once
Come on
Oh, no, Alvy, please
Alvy, please
(Laughing and making sounds) 'mrnm
'm, wait,  got a great idea
(He gets up and goes over to the closet, taking out a light bulb
He goes back to the bed and turns out the lamp on the night table) Hang in there for a second
got a little-little artifact
little erotic artifact, that-that  brought up from the city, which  think, uh, is gonna be perfect
(He turns the lamp back on, having replaced the bulb with the red one from the closet) just
there
There's a little Old New Orleans
essence
Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to
There, now there
(He undresses and crawls into bed, taking Annie in his arms) 'mmm
'mmm
Hey, is something wrong
Uh-uh-why
don't know
You- It's like you're- you're removed
No, 'm fine
As Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits down on a chair, watching
Really
-huh
don't know, but you seem sort of distant
Let's just do it, all right
(Kissing and caressing Annie) Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions
' Alvy, do you remember where  put my drawing pad
Because while you two are doing that,  think 'm gonna do some drawing
(Reacting) You see, that's what  call removed
Oh, you have my body
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good
want the whole thing
(Sighing) Well,  need grass and so do you
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass (Clearing his throat) because, you know, 'm, like, a comedian- (Overlapping) 'hm
(Overlapping) -so if  get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count
You know-'cause they're always laughin'
Were you always funny
Hey, what is this-an interview
We're supposed to be making love
: typical old-fashioned theatrical agency in a Broadway office building
Autographed 8  12 is plastered in the sloppy room
The agent, chewing a cigar, sits behind his desk talking to one of his clients, a comedian, who stands with his hands in his pockets
young Alvy sits stiffly in a chair nearby watching
This guy is naturally funny
think he can write for you
(Buttoning his jacket) Yeah, yeah
Hey, kid, he tells me you're really good
Well, lemme explain a little bit o' how  work
You know, you can tell right off the bat that  don't look like a funny guy when  come-you know, like some o' the guys that come out
You know, right away (Gesturing) they're gonna tell yuh their stories, you're gonna fall down, but  gotta be really talented
Material's gotta be sensational for me 'cause  work, you know, with very, very
Come on, 'm kinda classy, you know what  mean
Uh
uh
lemme explain
For instance,  open with an opening song
musical start like (Ad-lib singing) and  walk out (Ad-lib singing) "Place looks wonderful from here and you folks look wonderful from here
(Singing) "And seein' you there With a smile on your face Makes me shout This must be the place
" Then  stop right in the middle and then open with some jokes
Now, that's where need you, right there
For instance, like say, "Hey,  just got back from Canada, you know, they speak a lotta French up there
The only way to remember Jeanne d'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom
" (He laughs
Seated Alvy looks up smiling) "Oh,  met a big lumberjack
" ' (To himself) Jesus, this guy's pathetic
(Overlapping above speech) big lumberjack
' (To himself while the comic continues his routine) Look at him mincing around, like he thinks he's real cute
You wanna throw up
If only  had the nerve to do my own jokes
don't know how much longer can keep this smile frozen on my face
'm in the wrong business,  know it
(Overlapping above speech) "'Cherie, come back
love you
(Shaking his lips and mimicking) But, uh, Cheri, what will  do with this, uh
' He says, 'Aw, Marie, sometime you make me so mad
"' (Laughing) Oh, they scream at that
Now, write me somethin' like that, will yuh
Kinda French number, can yuh do it
Huh, kid
- The darkened auditorium is filled with college students applauding and cheering, excited, as Alvy stands on spotlighted stage holding the microphone
(Gesturing) -where am
- keep
have to reorient myself
This is the University of Wisconsin, right
So 'm always
'm tense and
uh, when 'm playin' a col- 've a very bad history with colleges
You know,  went to New York University and, uh, tsch,  was thrown out of  my freshman year
for cheating on my metaphysics final
You know,  looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me- (The audience laughs; they're with him) -and when  was thrown out, my mother, who's an emotionally high-strung woman, locked herself in the bathroom and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles
(More applause and laughter) And, uh, tsch,  was depressed
was
in analysis, -, uh, was suicidal; as a matter of fact, uh,  would have killed myself but  was in analysis with a strict Freudian and if you kill yourself
they make you pay for the sessions you miss
Students mill around Alvy banding him pens and paper for autographs
Annie is next to him, talking over the chattering fans
Alvy, you were
Alvy, you were just great, 'm not kidding
It was- You were so neat
-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful
Yeah
Yeah
And you know something
think that 'm starting to get more of your references, too
Are yuh
Yeah
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine
(Interrupting) May  have your autograph
(Over lapping above speech) Oh
(To Annie, while autographing) You're so sure about it
Oh, 'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow
mean, you know,  think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father
They start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a flash camera as they walk through the crowd
Yeah,  know, they'll hate me immediately
(To one of his fans) Thank you
No,  don't think so
No,  don't think they're gonna hate you at all
On the contrary,  think- Yeah
It's Easter
You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat
think they're gonna really like you
' ' - The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green lawn, then cuts to: Alvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner
The sun is pouring through a big picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table
Alvy sits, at one end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr
and Mrs
Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane
(Holding her wine glass) It's a nice ham this year, Mom
Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods
(Smiling at Duane) Oh, yeah
Grammy always does such a good job
(Chewing) great sauce
It is
(Smacking his lips) It's dynamite ham
Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike
Alvy tries not to notice
(To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair) We went over to the swap meet
Annie, Gram and
Got some nice picture frames
We really had a good time
Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard
(Lighting a cigarette and turning to Alvy) Ann tells us that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years
(Setting down his glass and coughing) Yes
'm making excellent progress
Pretty soon when  lie down on his couch, won't have to wear the lobster bib
Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning
Grammy continues to stare
Duane and  went out to the boat basin
We were caulkin' holes all day
Yeah
(Laughing) Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual
Oh, that Randolph Hunt
You remember Randy Hunt, Annie
He was in the choir with you
Oh, yes, yes
Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera
(To the audience) can't believe this family
(Making chewing sounds) Annie's mother
She really's beautiful
And they're talkin' swap meets and boat basins, and the old lady at the end of the table (Pointing to Grammy) is a classic Jew hater
And, uh, they, they realty look American, you know, very healthy and
like they never get sick or anything
Nothing like my family
You know, the two are like oil and water
The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father, aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table
They eat quickly and interrupt one another loudly
On the left the Halls in their dining room
Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed
' Let 'im drop dead
Who needs his business
' His wife has diabetes
' Di-diabetes
Is that any excuse
Diabetes
' The man is fifty years old and doesn't have a substantial job
' (Putting more meat on her husband's plate) Is that a reason to steal from his father
' Whatta you talkin' about
You don't know what you're talking about
' Yes,  know what 'm talking about
' (Interrupting) George, defend him
' (Over Alvy's father's muttering) No Moskowitz he had a coronary
' You don't say
' We fast
Stupid Thelma Poindexter
to the Veterans Hospital
My God, he's the new president of the El Regis
Let me tell you, the man is somethin' else
That's Jack's wife
We used to make that outta raisins
Oh, yes, that's right
Did you see the new play
Oh, you remember her, Annie
Yes,  do
The two families start talking back and forth to one another
The screen is still split
How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs
Singer
Fast
' Yeah, no food
You know, we have to atone for our sins
What sins
don't understand
' Tell you the truth, neither do we
: ' - Duane, sitting on his bed, sees Alvy walking past the open door
Alvy
(Walking in) Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'
This is my room
(Looking around) Oh, yeah
(He clears his throat) Terrific
Can  confess something
Alvy sighs and sits down, leaning his arm on Duane's dresser
Duane's face is big lighted by a single lamp
tell you this because, as an artist, think you'll understand
Sometimes when 'm driving
on the road at night see two headlights coming toward me
Fast
have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car
can anticipate the explosion
The sound of shattering glass
The
flames rising out of the flowing gasoline
(Reacting and clearing his throat) Right
Tsch, well,  have to- have t-o go now, Duane, because -'m due back on the planet earth
He slowly gets up and moves toward the door
'
Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them
Now, don't let it be so long, now
No
And look up Uncle Bill, you promise
Okay
Okay
Oh, he's adorable, Annie
You think so
Do you really
We're going to take them to the airport
Oh, no-Duane can
haven't finished my drink
Yes, Duane is
'll be right- 'mmm
just have time to get the, uh- She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss
- Duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead
It is raining very hard, the windshield wipers are moving quickly
The headlights of another car brightens the interior of Duane's car as the camera shows first Duane, then Annie, then Alvy tensely staring straight ahead
- The camera bolds on a quiet New York City street; the buildings, brownstones
It's a warm day-people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted
Annie walks into the frame first, then Alvy, who is walking to her right
They walk quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame
(Off screen) You followed me
can't believe it
(Off screen) didn't follow you
You followed me
Why
'Cause
was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you
That's not following
Well, what is your definition of following
(Gasping) Following is different
was spying
Do you realize how paranoid you are
Paranoid
'm looking at you
You got your arms around another guy
That is the worst kind of paranoia
Yeah-well,  didn't start out spying
- thought 'd surprise yuh
Pick you up after school
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember
It's your phrase
Oh, stop it
But you were having an affair with your college professor
That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"
You're really close
What's the difference
It's all mental masturbation
(Stopping for a moment) Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about
She walks away
(Catching up to her) Hey, don't knock masturbation
It's sex with someone  love
(Continuing to walk quickly) We're not having an affair
He's married
He just happens to think 'm neat
(Still walking next to her) "Neat"
There's that- What are you-twelve years old
That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions
"He thinks 'm neat
" Who cares
Who cares
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know
Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass
They both stop in the middle of the street
You've always had hostility toward David ever since  mentioned him
David
You call your teacher David
It's his name
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name
Right
-What does he call you
Bathsheba
He walks away
(Calling after him) Alvy
Alvy
You're the one who never wanted to make a real commitment
You don't think 'm smart enough
We had that argument just last month, or don't ou remember that day
: Alvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last month's argument
Annie's voice is heard
(Off screen) 'm home
(Turning) Oh, yeah
How'd it go
(Comes into the kitchen and puts down a bag of groceries on the kitchen table) Oh, it was
(Laughing) really weird
But she's a very nice woman
Yeah
And  didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up
So  told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother
'm
And then she mentioned penis envy
Did you know about that
Me
'm-'m one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so
you know
'hm
-go on, 'm interested
Well, she said that  was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children
'hm
And then  remembered when  was a kid how  accidentally saw my parents making love
Tsch
Rea- All this happened in the first hour
'hm
That's amazing
--
've been goin' for fifteen years, -you know, don't got
nothing like that in- Oh,  told her my dream and then  cried
You cried
've never once cried
Fantastic
(Taking groceries from the bag) Yeah
whine
-- sit and  whine
In-in
Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and  can't breathe
Sinatra
Yeah, and he's strangling me
Yeah
and  keep, you know, it's- (Taking a bottle of juice and some celery from the bag) Well, well, sure
because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect
So you're trying to suffocate yourself
It-it makes perfect sense
Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic kind of insight
(Pointing her finger at Alvy) She said, your name was Alvy Singer
(Turning to Annie) Whatta you mean
Me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you
Because in the dream
break Sinatra's glasses
(Putting his band to his mouth) Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses
So whatta you saying that -'m suffocating you
(Turning, ajar in her hand) Oh, and God, Alvy,  did
this really terrible thing to him
Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice
(Thinking) Tsch, what'd the doctor say
(Putting away some groceries) Well, she said that  should probably come five times a week
And you know something
don't think  mind analysis at all
The only question is, Will it change my wife
Will it change your wife
Will it change my life
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"
No,  didn't
(Laughing) said, "Will it change my life," Alvy
You said, "Will it change
" Wife
Will it change
(Yelling out, angry) Life
said, "life
" Alvy turns toward the camera
(To the audience) She said, "Will it change my wife
" You heard that because you were there so 'm not crazy
And, Alvy
and then  told her about how  didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that 'm smart enough
She walks out of the room
(To Annie's back, gesturing) Why do you always bring that up
Because encourage you to take adult-education courses
think it's a wonderful thing
You meet wonderful, interesting professors'
: Annie stands at the open door of a cab, Alvy next to her gesturing as people and cars move by
Adult education is such junk
The professors are so phony
How can you do it
bit rapidly
don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher
(Interrupting) David
David
can't believe this
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway
'm following you and David, if you- (Interrupting) just think we oughta call this relationship quits
Annie gets into the cab; Alvy leans over and closes the door
That's fine
That's fine
That's great
(He turns toward the camera as the cab drives away) Well,  don't know what  did wrong
(Gesturing) mean,  can't believe this
Somewhere she cooled off to me
(He walks up to an older woman walking down the street carrying groceries) Is it-is it something that  did
Never something you do
That's how people are
Love fades
She moves on down the street
(Scratching his head) Love fades
God, that's a depressing thought
Have to ask you a question
(He stops another passer-by,a man) Don't go any further
Now, with your wife in bed, d-d-does she need some kind o' artificial stimulation like-like marijuana
We use a large vibrating egg
He walks on
(Continuing to walk) Large vibrating egg
Well,  ask a psychopath,  get that kind of an answer
Jesus, -, uh, here
(He moves up the sidewalk to a young trendy-looking couple, arms wrapped around each other) You-you look like a really happy couple
Uh, uh
are you
Yeah
Yeah
So
so h-h-how do you account for it
Uh, 'm very shallow and empty and have no ideas and nothing interesting to say
And 'm exactly the same way
see
Well, that's very interesting
So you've managed to work out something, huh
Right
Yeah
Oh, well, thanks very much for talking to me
He continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street mounted policeman comes by and stops near him
Alvy looks at the horse, as if to speak
' - You know, even as a kid  always went for the wrong women
think that's my problem
When my mother took me to see Snow White, everyone fell in love with Snow White
immediately fell for the Wicked Queen
The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her mirror
Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of him
We never have any fun anymore
How can you say that
Why not
You're always leaning on me to improve myself
You're just upset
You must be getting your period
don't get a period
'm a cartoon character
Can't  be upset once in a while
Rob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the Wicked Queen
Max, will you forget about Annie know lots of women you can date
don't wanna go out with any other women
Max, have  got a girl for you
You are going to love her
She's a reporter- The cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen dissolves into the interior of a concert ball
Rob's voice carries over from the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter
It's very crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere
Alvy stands with his hands in his pockets, watching the commotion
' - -for Rolling Stone
think there are more people here to see the Maharishi than there were to see the Dylan concert
covered the Dylan concert
which gave me chills
Especially when he sang "She takes just like a woman And she makes love just like a woman Yes, she does And she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl
" (They move toward the aisles as a guard holds up his hands to stop them) Up to that  guess the most charismatic event  covered was Mick's Birthday when the Stones played Madison Square Garden
(Laughing) Man, that's great
That's just great
You catch Dylan
(Coughing) Me
No, no
- couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis
You have a raccoon
(Gesturing) Tsch, a few
The only word for this is trans-plendid
It's trans-plendid
can think of another word
He's God
mean, this man is God
He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment
Really
It must be a tremendous hem
'm a Rosicrucian myself
Are you
Yeah
can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics
Look- (The Maharisbi, a small, chunky man, walks out of the men's room, huge bodyguards flanking him while policemen bold back the crowds) there's God coming outta the men's room
It's unbelievably trans-plendid
was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember
Yeah, were yuh
was- was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes
' - The reporter is sitting up in bed, lighted cigarette in her hand
Alvy, lying next to her, rubs his eyes and puts on his eyeglasses
(Looking down at him) hope you don't mind that  took so long to finish
(Sighing) Oh, no, no, don't be
tsch
don't be silly
You know, (Yawning) 'm startin' it-'m startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience
Oh, tsch, thank you
'm
mean that as a compliment
(Making sounds) think- think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life
Who said that
(Rubbing his chin and shoulder) Uh, oh,  don't know
It might have been Leopold and Loeb
(The telephone rings
Alvy picks it up, rising up slightly from the bed, concerned, as he talks) Hello
Oh, hi
Uh, no, what-what's the matter
What-what-what
You sound terrible
No, what- Sure - Whatta yuh -what kind of an emergency
No, well, stay there
Stay there, 'll come over right now
'll come over right now
Just stay there, 'll come right over
He hangs up
The reporter sits in bed still, taking in the situation
' Annie, looking slightly distraught, goes to open the door to Alvy's knock
What's- It's me, open up
(Opening the door) Oh
Are you okay
What's the matter
(They look at each other, Annie sighing) Are you all right
What- There's a spider in the bathroom
(Reacting) What
There's a big black spider in the bathroom
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom
My God,  mean, you know how  am about insects
(Interrupting, sighing) Oooh
- can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom
Kill it
For Go- What's wrong with you
Don't you have a can of Raid in the house
(Shaking her head) No
Alvy, disgusted, starts waving his hands and starts to move into the living room
(Sighing) told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray
You never know who's gonna crawl over
(Following him) know,  know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher
Jesus
All right, gimme a magazine
- 'cause 'm a little tired
(While Annie goes of to find him a magazine, Alvy, still talking, glances around the apartment
He notices a small book on a cabinet and picks it up
) You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but 'm prepared for anything
An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake
Hey, what is this
What
Did you go to a rock concert
Yeah
Oh, yeah, really
Really
How-how'd you like it
Was it-was it,  mean, did it
was it heavy
Did it achieve total heavy-ocity
Or was it, uh
It was just great
(Thumbing through the book) Oh, humdinger
When- Well,  got a wonderful idea
Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider
You know, it's a- He tosses the book down on the cabinet
called you; you wanna help me
or not
'h
Here
She hands him a magazine
(Looking down at the magazine) What is this
What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"
What are you turning in to
(Turning to a nearby chair for some gum in her pocketbook) Well,  like to try to get all points of view
It's wonderful
Then why don'tcha get William
Buckley to kill the spider
(Spinning around to face him) Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that
Not only that, you look thin and tired
She puts a piece of gum in her mouth
Well,  was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning
You, uh, you got me outta bed,  ran over here,  couldn't get a taxi cab
You said it was an emergency, and  didn't ge-  ran up the stairs
Hell -  was a lot more attractive when the evening began
Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and roll star
Is that possible
(Sitting down on a chair arm and looking up at Alvy) Would you like a glass of chocolate milk
Hey, what am -your son
Whatta you mean
- came over  --_ (Touching his chest with her hand) got the good chocolate, Alvy
Yeah, where is the spider
It really is lovely
It's in the bathroom
Is he in the bathroom
(Rising from chair) Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay
And flush it a couple o' times
(Moving down the hallway to the bathroom) Darling, darling, 've been killing spiders since  was thirty, okay
(Upset, hands on her neck) Oh
What
(Coming back into the living room) Very big spider
Yeah
Two
Yeah
Lotta, lotta trouble
There's two of 'em
Alvy starts walking down the ball again, Annie following
Two
(Opening a closet door) Yep
didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider
You got a broom or something with a- Oh, - left it at your house
(Overlapping) -snow shovel or anything or something
(Overlapping) think  left it there, 'm sorry
Reaching up into the closet, Alvy takes out a covered tennis racquet
(Holding the racquet) Okay, let me have this
Well, what are you doing
what are you doing with- Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick
He walks into the bathroom, Annie looking after him
Well, okay
Oooh
Alvy stands in the middle of the bathroom, tennis racquet in one band, rolled magazine in the other
He looks over at the shelf above the sink and picks up a small container
He holds it out, shouting off screen to Annie
Hey, what is this
You got black soap
(Off screen) It's for my complexion
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show
Geez
(Alvy turns and starts swapping the racquet over the shelf, knocking down articles and breaking glass) Don't worry
(He continues to swat the racquet all over the bathroom
He finally moves out of the room, hands close to his body
He walks into the other room, where Annie is sitting in a corner of her bed leaning against the wall) did it
killed them both
What-what's the matter
Whatta you- (Annie is sobbing, her band over her face) -whatta you sad about
You- What'd you want me to do
Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em
(Sobbing and taking Alvy's arm) Oh, don't go, okay
Please
(Sitting down next to her) Whatta you mean, don't go
Whatta-whatta -what's the matter
Whatta you expecting -termites
What's the matter
(Sobbing) Oh, uh,  don't know
miss you
Tsch
She beats her fist on the bed
Reacting, Alvy puts his arm around her shoulder and leans back against the wall
Oh, Jesus, really
(Leaning on his shoulder) Oh, yeah
Oh
(They kiss) Oh
Alvy
What
He touches her face gently as she wipes tears from her face
Was there somebody in your room when called you
-w-whatta you mean
mean was there another-  thought heard a voice
Oh,  had the radio on
Yeah
'm sorry
had the television set had the television- Yeah
Alvy pulls her to him and they kiss again
: ' Alvy is lying in bed next to Annie, who is leaning on her elbow looking down at him
He rubs her arms and she smiles
Alvy, let's never break up again
don't wanna be apart
Oh, no, no,  think we're both much too mature for something like that
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know
Better than either one of my marriages
See, 'cause
'cause there's just something different about you don't know what it is, but it's great
(Snickering) You know  think that if you let me, maybe could help you have more fun, you know
mean,  know it's hard and
Yeah
don't know
Alvy, what about
what if we go away this weekend, and we could- Tsch, why don't we get
why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood
Okay, okay
Okay
That'd be fun for yuh
Don't you think- Yeah
Alvy raises up his head and they kiss
Annie is behind the wheel in her , Rob is beside her, Alvy in the back seat leaning forward so that his head is between them
They're driving down the highway
-me, my God, it's a great day
(Interrupting) Hey, can yuh watch the road
Watch the -- (Overlapping) Yeah, watch the road
You'll total the whole car
(Laughing) Hey, you know,  never even visited Brooklyn before
can't wait to see the old neighborhood
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great
We can show her the schoolyard
Right
was a great athlete
Tell her, Max,  was the best,  was all schoolyard
Yes,  remember
(Annie laughs) He was all schoolyard
They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it
Yeah, well,  used to lose my glasses a lot
Alvy Annie and Rob move toward the roller coaster on the screen
The area's deserted
Sea gulls are heard
Oh, look, look, there's that
that's -that's my old house
That's where used to live
(Laughing) Holy cow
You're lucky, Max-where  used to live is now a pornographic equipment store
Annie laughs
have some very good memories there
What kind of good memories, Max
Your mother and father fighting all the time
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things
-
'
Alvy's father sits in his chair
His mother is polishing a door while Alvy lies on the floor playing
Annie, adult Alvy and Rob quietly walk into the scene to watch
' You fired the cleaning woman
' She was stealing
' But she's colored
' ' So the colored have enough trouble
' She was going through my pocketbook
' They're persecuted enough
' Who's persecuting
She stole
Alvy's father gets up and gets his hard hat
He sits back down and starts polishing it
' All right-so we can afford it
' How can we afford it
On your pay
What if she steals more
' She's a colored woman, from Harlem
She has no money
She's got a right to steal from us
After all, who is she gonna steal from if not us
(Yelling into the scene) You're both crazy
They can't hear you, Max
' Leo
married a fool
(Pointing) Hey, Max
Who's that
As the three friends watch Alvy's old living room, the scene has suddenly shifted
huge crowd stands around the room, laughing, eating, chatting and vibrating with the turns of the roller-coaster ride
It-it-it's the welcome-home party in nineteen forty-five, for my cousin Herbie
(Pointing) Look, look, there's-there's that one over there, that's Joey Nichols, he was my- (Young Alvy stands next to Joey Nichols, who's sitting in one of the easy chairs
They smile at each other; people and noise all around) -father's friend
He was always bothering me when  was a kid
Joey Nichols
(Laughing) See
Nichols
See, Nichols
(Joey shows young Alvy his cuff links and a tie pin, which are made from nickels, as Alvy stands with hands on hips, unconcerned
Joey then slaps his band to his forehead and puts a nickel on his forehead) Yuh see, nickels
You can always remember my name, just think of Joey Five Cents
(Laughing) That's me
Joey Five Cents
Joey grabs Alvy's cheeks and pinches them
(Turning away) What an asshole
group of women stands near a buffet table eating and listening to Alvy mother and her sister, Tessie, and a young girl, as the three friends watch
' was always the sister with good common sense
But Tessie was always the one with personality
When she was younger, they all wanted to marry Tessie
She touches Tessie's shoulder
Tessie starts to laugh
(Pointing, to Rob) Do you believe that, Max
Tessie Moskowitz had the personality
She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt
' (To the young girl) She was once a great beauty
Tessie nods her head "yes
" Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality
(Addressing the young girl) was a great beauty
Uh, how did this personality come about
(Grabbing the young girl's cheek) was very charming
There were many men interested in you
(To the young girl) Oh,  was quite a lively dancer
Tessie gyrates back and forth imitating a dancer while Annie and the adult Alvy lean on each other laughing
(Laughing) That's pretty hard to believe
Alvy and Annie walk contentedly down a street; Alvy's arm is draped around Annie
People walk by them on the street as they move toward their apartment building
Well,  had a really good day, you know that
It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday
Ah
Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey,  hate to tell yuh
Yeah, but it's real close
Yeah, but no presents till midnight
(Laughing) Oh, darn it
Annie and Alvy sit on the sofa
Annie's unwrapping a gift while Alvy watches
(Making sounds) This is- (Making sounds) Huh
She pulls out flimsy black lingerie from the box
Happy birthday
What is this
Is this a
Present
(Laughing) Are you kidding
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on
Uh, yeah, uh
t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's- Try it
it'll add years to our sex life
(Looking up at Alvy and laughing) Uh huh
Yeah
Forget it
Alvy leans over and hands her another box as she puts down the lingerie
Here's a real present
(Opening the gift) What
huh
Check it out
Oh, yeah
What is this, anyway
(continuing) Let me see
Okay, let's

(She takes out a watch from the box) Oh, you knew  wanted this
(Laughing) God, it's terrific, God
(Making sounds) Yeah,  know
Just-just put on the watch, and-and
that thing, and we'll just
(Laughing) Oh
My God
(Making sounds) Alvy kisses Annie
Annie, spotlighted onstage, stands in front of the microphone, smiling
She looks downward and sings "Seems Like Old Times
" The audience applauds loudly as the music fades out
(Laughing) Thank you
Alvy sits at the bar, clapping and staring at Annie as she walks over to him and sits down
The low murmur of the night club is surrounding them
(Reacting) You were-you were sensational
mean, -you know, - told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, --you-you were sensational
(Looking at Alvy, smiling) Yeah, well, we have the,  mean, they were just a terrific audience,  mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because can be
huh
Tony, a famous record personality, pushes through the crowd, moving toward Alvy and Annie
An entourage follows him as he makes his way to their table
Excuse me
He shakes hands with Annie, smiling
Oh
Hi, 'm-'m Tony Lacey
Well, hi
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets
(Laughing) Oh, yeah, really, oh
though it was
very musical, and liked it a lot
Oh, neat
oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot
Are you
are you recording
Or do- Are you with any label now
(Laughing) No, no, no, not at all
Uh, well, 'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance
Seated Alvy looks the other way, reacting
Oh
What about
of possibly working together
(Looking for the first time at Alvy) Well, hey, that's, that's nice
Uh
Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer
Do you know Alvy
Uh
and
uh
Tony Lacey
No,  don't- don't know, but - know your work
'm a big fan of yours
Tony reaches over and shakes hands with Alvy
The nightclub crowd surrounds them all with their low chatter and cigarette smoke
Thank you very much
It's a pleasure
(Turning to introduce his entourage) This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh
Bob and Petronia
Hi
Hi
(Laughing) Hi, hi, Bob
Uh

We're staying at the Pierre
and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and
if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you
Yeah
And we could just sit and talk
nothing
Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow
Annie and Tony and his entourage turn to look at Alvy
(Fingers to his mouth, reacting) Remember, we had that thing
What thing
(Staring at Annie and clearing his throat) Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were- (Overlapping) Thing
(Overlapping) -yes, we had, uh
(Looking at Alvy, reacting) Oh, the thing
Oh, the thing
(Laughing) yeah
yeah
Annie turns, looks at Tony as he smiles and gestures with his hands
Oh, well, -if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now
that's fine, too
-w-w-we'll do it another time
Hey- Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and
and we'll meet there
He shakes hands with Annie
(Reacting) Oh
It was a wonderful set
Oh, gosh
(Smiling) really enjoyed it
(Looking at Alvy) Nice to have metcha
Good night
Bye-bye
Nice to see you

Yeah
Bye
She turns and looks at Alvy
(Reacting) What's
you
well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party
(Looking down at her hands, then up at Alvy) don't know,  thought it might be kind of fun, you know what  mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people
(Sighing) 'm just not
you know,  don't think could take a mellow eve- 'cause - don't respond well to mellow, you know what  mean, - have a tendency to
if  get too mellow, - ripen and then rot
You know, and it's-it's not good for my
(Making sounds) All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do
The screen is projecting the beginning of "The Sorrow and the Pity": a street filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats
Subtitles pop on: "The Jewish warmongers and Parisian plutocrats tried to flee with their gold and jewels" as a narrator explains in German
Split screen: Annie and her psychiatrist on the left; Alvy and his on the right
Annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor
The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome
Alvy, talking to his psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him
This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood
The dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously
(To her doctor) That day in Brooklyn was the last day remember really having a great time
(To his doctor) Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem
Well, 've been moody and dissatisfied
' How often do you sleep together
' Do you have sex often
Hardly ever
Maybe three times a week
Constantly
'd say three times a week
Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's- And
don't know
mean, six months ago - woulda done it
woulda done it, just to please him
mean
tried everything, you know, -- put on soft music and my-my red light bulb, and
But the thing is- mean, since our discussions here,  feel  have a right to my own feelings
think you woulda been happy because
uh, uh,  really asserted myself
The incredible thing about it is, 'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and 'm getting screwed
don't know, though,  feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so  do feel guilty if  don't go to bed with him
But if  do go to bed with him, it's like 'm going against my own feelings
don't know - can't win
(Simultaneously, with Annie) You know
it's getting expensive my analyst
for her analyst
She- she's making progress and 'm not making any progress
Her progress is defeating my progress
(Simultaneously, with Alvy) Sometimes  think-sometimes  think should just live with a woman
: Alvy and Annie sit close together on the sofa in some friends' apartment
Their friends, another couple, stand behind the sofa in the background
Excited, they talk almost all at once
Wow,  don't believe it
you mean to tell me you guys have never snorted coke
Well,  always wanted to try, you know, but, uh, Alvy, uh
he's very down on it
Hey, don't put it on me
You kn- Wh-what is it,  don't wanna put a wad of white powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal membranes
They all start talking at once
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy
(Counting on his fingers) How can you say that
mean, (Making sounds) who said --- said that you,  and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome
(Reacting) That's sick
Yeah,  know it's sick, but it's new
You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick
Annie laughs, chatters
Just come on, Alvy
(All four are now sitting on the sofa
The male friend starts to prepare lines of cocaine; Alvy and Annie look at each other, reacting) Do your body a favor
Try it, come on
Oh, yeah
Yeah
Come on
It'd be fun
(Moving forward on the couch) Oh, 'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs
(Laughing) Alvy, come on, for your own experience
mean, you wanna write, why not
It's great stuff, Alvy
Friend of mine just brought it in from California
Oh, do you know something- didn't tell yuh, we're going to California next week
Oh, really
Yeah
'm thrilled
As you know, uh
uh, on my agent's advice  sold out, and 'm gonna do an appearance on
(Interrupting) No, no, no that's not it at all
Alvy's giving an award on television
Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here
You're kidding
It's so phony, and we have to leave New York during Christmas week, which really kills me
(Interrupting) Alvy, listen, while you're in California, could you possibly score some coke for me
Annie laughs
(Over Annie's laughter) Sure, sure, 'll be glad to
-'ll just put it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that have in my boot, you know
(Alvy picks up the small open gold case of cocaine base the man placed on the coffee table and looks at it, reacting) -h-how much is this stuff
It's about two thousand dollars an ounce
God
Really
And what is the kick of it
Because  never
He puts his finger into the drug, smells it and then sneezes
The powder blows all over the room as the man, woman and Annie react silently
: - It's a warm, beautiful day
Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's convertible are moving past the spacious houses, the palm trees
The sunlight reflects off the car
Annie, excited, is taking the whole place in
Background voices sing Christmas carols
(Singing) We wish you a Merry Christmas, We wish you a Merry Christmas, We wish you a Merry Christmas, And a -Happy New Year
(Over the singing) 've never been so relaxed as  have been since  moved out here, Max want you to see my house
live right next to Hugh Hefner's house, Max
He lets me use the Jacuzzi
And the women, Max, they're like the women in Playboy magazine, only they can move their arms and legs
(Laughing) You know,  can't get over that this is really Beverly Hills
(Singing) We wish you a Merry Christmas, And a Happy New Year
Yeah, the architecture is really consistent, isn't it
French next to- (Singing over the dialogue) Oh, Christmas
tree, Oh, Christmas tree, How bright and green Our
-Spanish, next to Tudor, next to Japanese
God, it's so clean out here
It's that they don't throw their garbage away
They make it into television shows
Aw, come on, Max, give us a break, will yuh
It's Christmas
Annie starts snapping pictures of the view
Can you believe this is Christmas here
(Singing) Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree
They pass a large house with spacious lawn
Sitting on the lawn is a Santa Claus complete with sleigh and reindeer
Voices continue to sing Christmas carols; Annie continues to take pictures
You know, it was snowing-it was snowing and really gray in New York yesterday
No kidding
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here
While you're out here, Max,  want you to see some of my  show
And we're invited to a big Christmas party
They continue driving, now in a less residential area, passing a hot-dog stand
"Tail-Pup" concession; people mill about eating hot dogs
(Singing, louder now) Remember Christ our Savior Was born on Christmas day To save us all
from Satan's power As we were gone astray
They pass a theater, the marquee announcing "House of Exorcism Messiah of Evil
Rated
Starts at 7:15
" Several monitors line the wall in front of an elaborate console
Rob and Alvy, along with Charlie, the technician, stand in the small room watching the screens showing Rob as a television star on a situation comedy
They chatter, analyzing the footage, over the sounds of the taped television comedy
(Overlapping the chatter) Oh
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here
limousine to the track breakdown
(Watching) little bigger
monitors go black as the technician turns of the monitors to fix the laugh track
Do you realize how immoral this all is
Max, 've got a hit series
Yeah,  know; but you're adding fake laughs
Technicians turn the monitors back on, showing Rob on the screen with another character, Arnie
Oh, 'm sorry
Arnie
Yeah
(Turning to the technician) Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie
Look, uh
Loud laughter from the  monitors
(To Alvy) We do the show live in front of an audience
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite
You better lie down
You've been in the sun too long
(To the technician) Yeah
uh, now give me a like a medium-size chuckle here
and then a big hand
The sounds of laughter and applause are heard from the
(Removing his glasses and rubbing his face) Is there booing on there
The monitors show a woman on the screen
We were just gonna fix you up with my cousin Dolores
(Overlapping the ) Oh, Max,  don't feel well
What's the matter
don't know,  just got- got very dizzy
(Coughing) feel dizzy, Max
Well, sit down
(Sitting down) Oh, Jesus
You all right
don't know,  mean, - (Crouching before Alvy, looking at him) You wanna lie down
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning
just started getting
How about a ginger ale
Oh, Max
no,  maybe  better lie down
Alvy lies in bed, one elbow propped up, a doctor sitting next to him looking concerned
The doctor bolds out a plate of chicken; Alvy listlessly stares at it
Annie, in the background, is on the phone
(Talking into the phone) Yes
(Holding out the food) Why don't you just try to get a little of this down
This is just plain chicken
(Taking a piece of chicken and holding it) Oh, oh, no,  can't- can't eat this
'm nauseous
(He gasps and makes sounds) If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know - have to go out to Burbank
and give out an award on a show
(On the phone, overlapping the doctor and Alvy) Well
-h huh
Oh, good
Yes, 'll tell him
Well, there's nothing wrong with you actually, so far as  can tell
mean, you have no fever, no
no symptoms of anything serious
You haven't been eating pork or shellfish
Annie bangs up and moves over to Alvy
(Sitting on the edge of the bed) Excuse me
'm sorry, 'm sorry, Doctor
Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show
They said everything is fine
They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you
(Making sounds) 'm nauseous
(He sighs and gasps) Oh, jesus, now  don't get to do the show
Reacting, Alvy puts up his band in disgust, then starts eating the piece of chicken he has been holding
The doctor and Annie watch him, reacting
Yeah
Listen, Doctor, 'm worried
Now, Mrs
Singer,  can't find anything -- Christ
Nothing at all
No,  think  can get a lab man up here
(Grabbing the rest of the chicken from the plate) Oh, jesus
Can  have the salt, please
What do you mean
Do you think he's- (Handing the salt to Alvy) Yes, excuse me
(To Annie) Perhaps it would be even better if we took him to the hospital for a day or two
Alvy begins to eat
Uh-huh
Oh, hospital
Well, otherwise, there's no real way to tell what's going on
(Making sounds, gasping) This is not bad, actually
- Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's car pull into a long circular driveway as an attendant walks over to the car
sprawling house is seen to the right; a couple moves toward the front door, and the driveway is crowded with other parked cars
Loud music is heard
(Getting out of the car) Hey, don't tell me we're gonna hafta walk from the car to the house
Geez, my feet haven't touched pavement since reached Los Angeles
Hollywood Christmas party is in session, complete with music, milling people, circulating waiters bolding out trays of drinks
It's all very casual
French doors run the entire width of one wall; they are opened to the back lawn, guests move from the room to outside and back in
It is crowded; bits of conversation and clinking glasses can be heard
Two men, California-tanned, stand by the French doors talking
1ST Well, you take a meeting with him, 'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy
2ND took a meeting with Freddy
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie
You take a meeting with him
1ST All the good meetings are taken
: man stands talking, people in groups behind him
Two born like gadgets are attached to his shoulders; he's wearing a bizarre space costume
3RD Right now it's only a notion, but think  can get money to make it into a concept
and later turn it into an idea
: Alvy and Rob stand near the French doors leading to the back lawn, eating and drinking and watching the people walking in and out of the house
You like this house, Max
'hm
even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party
What difference does that make
Alvy looks into the room, where Annie and Tony Lacey are having an animated conversation
think he has a little thing for Annie
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max
He goes with that girl over there
Where
Rob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a group of people close-by
The one with the
Visible panty line
Max, she is gorgeous
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're -you're used to twos, aren't you
There are no twos, Max
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering
'hm
And
uh- (Interrupting) How do you like this couple, Max
couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy
The man's arm is around the woman; they stand very close
In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking
And  think they just came back from Masters and Johnson
Yeah, intensive care ward
(Watching the woman in white) My God-hey, Max,  think she's think she's giving me the eye
As Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward them
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole
'll handle it
'll handle it
Hi
You're Alvy Singer, right
Didn't we meet at
(Reacting) No, no,  was never to est
Then how can you criticize it
Oh
Oh, he-he didn't say anything
(Laughing) No, no,  came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so
He's my-my food taster
Have you two met
(Shaking his head) Hi
How do you do
Do you taste to see if the food's poisoned
Yeah, he's crazy
The girl in white laughs
(Looking at Rob and the girl) Hey, you guys are wearin' white
It must be in the stars
Yeah
Right
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace
We're gonna operate together
Rob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie standing by the buffet table
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album
don't know, this is strange to me, you know
just
that's all you need
You can come and stay here
Oh
There's a whole wing in this house
(Laughing) Oh yeah, stay here
-huh
You can have it to use
Why-why are you smiling
(Laughing) don't know
don't know
She picks up an hors doeuvre
: The two men still talking about meetings surrounded by other groups of people milling about
1ST Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings
2ND 'mm
Tony, band in band with the girl in white, is leaving the party room with Alvy and Annie to show them the rest of the house
This is a great house, really
Everything
Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts
You know who the original owners were
Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond
Then you know who lived here
Trigger
Annie and the girl in white laugh
Charlie Chaplin
Hey
Right before his un-American thing
They stop in a den-like screening room
man is slouched back on one of the comfortable sofas that fill the room
It is much quieter in here; a contrast to the noise and crowd downstairs
Yeah, this place is great
Yeah
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers
Yeah,  love it there
(Laughing) Yeah
Well,  used to live there
used to live there for years
You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now
Yeah
'm into garbage
It's my thing
Boy, this is really a nice screening room
It's really a nice room
Oh, and there's another thing about New York
See
you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line
Yeah
It could be freezing, it could be raining
Yeah
And here, you just- We saw "Grand Illusion" here last night
(In unison) Oh, yeah
(Looking over his shoulder at the group) That's a great film if you're high
(The group laughs, looking down at the man on the sofa
He looks up at them, smiling, a joint in his hand, and offers them a cigarette) Hey, you
(Shaking his head no) Come and see our bedroom
We did a fantastic lighting job
Okay
Oh, good
Okay
'm cool
Tony and the girl in white leave the room, Annie and Alvy following
(Taking Alvy's arm) It's wonderful
mean, you know they just watch movies all day
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die
You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- pat on the androgynous side
But it's
They pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway
Yeah, yeah
forgot my mantra
As they come down stairs the party is still in big gear
People are looser now; conversations are more animated, some talk quietly in more intimate corners, some couples are dancing
Alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the huge Christmas tree
tall woman, passing by, shakes his hand, then leaves
He continues to sip his drink, alone, watching Tony and Annie in the center of the room dancing
The screen shows a plane in flight, Los Angeles far below, then: : Annie and Alvy sit, the stewardess behind them serving other passengers
Annie stares out the window bolding a coffee cup; Alvy reads
Both are preoccupied, thinking their own thoughts
' - (To herself) That was fun
don't think California is bad at all
It's a drag coming home
' - (To himself) Lotta beautiful women
It was fun to flirt
' - (As she sips coffee) have to face facts
- adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore
' - (An open magazine lies in his lap) 'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight
Whatta  need this
' - If only  had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him
' - If only  didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out
It'd probably wreck her
But  should be honest
He looks over at Annie
(Looking back at Alvy) Alvy, uh, let's face it
You know something, don't think our relationship is working
Tsch,  know
relationship,  think, is-is like a shark, you know
It has to constantly move forward or it dies
(He sighs) And  think what we got on our hands (Clearing his throat) is a dead shark
'  - lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie move out
(Holding up a book) Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this
(Walking into the room with an armload of books) Well, let's see now
If it has my name on it, then  guess it's mine
(Reacting) Oh, it sure has
You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come
(Putting down the books and flipping back her hair) Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as  do
(Riffling through the books) There's no-no question in my mind think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt
(Holding a framed picture and moving about) Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine
(Looking down at a book) This "Denial of Death"
You remember this
Oh- This is the first book that  got you
Annie goes over to Alvy
They both look down at the book; the fireplace, burning nicely, is behind them
-God
Remember that day
Right
Geez,  feel like there's a great weight off my back
'mmm
Thanks, honey
(Patting Alvy's shoulder) Oh, no, no, no, no, no
mean, you know, no, no, no,  mean,  think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that
She walks away
There's no-there's no question about that, 'cause we've given this
uh, uh,  think a more than fair shot, you know
He tosses the book into the carton
(Off screen) Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me
(Off screen) Yeah, and - tru-  you know,  trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her
(Walking in with another armload of books) Well, why should  put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway
Right
And you-and you know what the beauty part is
What
(Holding a small box of buttons) We can always come back together again
Because there's no-there's no problem
'Cause
Right
(Overlapping) Exactly, but
exactly
Ooooh
You know, -- don't think many couples could handle this
You know, they could just break up and remain friends
(Taking a button from a box) Hey, this one's mine, this button
This one, you rem- (Interrupting) Yeah
guess these are all yours
Impeach, uh, Eisenhower
Impeach Nixon
Impeach Lyndon Johnson
Impeach Ronald Reagan
- People milling about on the sidewalk as Alvy walks out of a store and moves toward the foreground
(Into the camera, to the audience) miss Annie
made a terrible mistake
couple, walking down the street, stops as the man talks to Alvy
She's living in Los Angeles with Tony Lacey
Oh, yeah
Well, if she is, then the hell with her
If she likes that lifestyle, let her live there
He's a jerk, for one thing
He graduated Harvard
Yeah
He may- Listen, Harvard makes mistakes too, you know
Kissinger taught there
The couple strolls away as an older woman walks up to Alvy while others walk by
Don't tell me you're jealous
Yeah, jealous
little bit like Medea
Lemme, lemme-can  show you something, lady
(He takes a small item from his pocket to show the woman) What  have here
found this in the apartment
Black soap
She used to wash her face eight hundred times a day with black soap
Don't ask me why
Well, why don't you go out with other women
Well, - tried, but it's, uh, you know, it's very depressing
-
' Alvy's arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor bolding up a live lobster
He puts it on a grill tray
(Pointing to the lobster) This always happens to me
Quick, g-go get a broom
His date, a girl wearing short shorts, leans against the sink and lights a cigarette
She makes no move to help
(Smoking) What are you making such a big deal about
(As she talks, the lobster drops from the tray to the floor
Alvy jumps away, then gingerly scrapes the tray toward the lobster) They're only lobsters
Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster
(Looking up in stooped-over position) 'm not myself since  stopped smoking
(Still leaning against the sink, her hand on her hip) Oh, when'd you quit smoking
He gets up of the floor with the lobster on the tray
Sixteen years ago
(Puzzled) Whatta you mean
(Mocking) Mean
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said
Oh, - don't understand
Are you joking, or what
: solitary Alvy walking along the  Drive where he had walked with Annie
- The New York skyline is still in the background, the sea gulls go by, the fog horn blows
He walks slowly, moving off screen
'  - Alvy sits on his bed talking on the phone
Listen, honey, Central Park's turning green
Yeah,  sa- saw that lunatic that we-where we used to see
with the, uh, uh, pinwheel hat and, you know, and the roller skates
Listen, - want you to come back here
Well, --then 'm gonna come out there and getcha
: An airborne plane
: People milling about as Alvy, in the outside phone-booth center, talks
Whatta you mean, where am
Where do- where do you think  am
'm-'m out 'm at the Los Angeles Airport
flew in
(Sniffling) Tsch, -well,  flew in to see you
(Muttering) Hey, listen, can we not debate this on-on the telephone because 'm, you know, - feel that  got a temperature and 'm-'m getting my-my chronic Los Angeles nausea
- don't feel so good
Alvy's conversation is still heard as the screen shows him behind the wheel of a car on a busy street; he causes a near-accident by jerking the car too slowly toward an intersection
' - Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, don't care
'll-'ll drive in rented a car 'm driving
that
Whatta you mean
What-why is that such a miracle
'm driving myself -- - People sit at umbrellaed tables with checkered tablecloths at a Sunset Boulevard outdoor cafe
Street traffic goes by while they dine
There's a mild California breeze
The restaurant is somewhat crowded as Alvy makes his way around the tables looking about
He finally sits down at an empty table; nearby sits a woman with a younger man
waitress brings Alvy a menu and waits for his order
(To the waitress) 'm gonna
'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast
Annie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view
Alvy, noticing her, watches as she walks over to his table
He rises and they shake hands
Hi
Alvy wipes at his nose as he stares
He smiles, the street traffic moving behind him
Annie smiles back
You look very pretty
Oh, no,  just lost a little weight, that's all
(Alvy adjusts his glasses, not exactly knowing where to start; a bit uneasy) Well, you look nice
(Nodding his head) You see, -'ve been thinking about it and  think that we should get married
(Adjusting her sunglasses) Oh, Alvy, come on
Why
You wanna live out here all year
It's like living in Munchkin Land
(Looking around) Well, whatta you mean
mean, it's perfectly fine out here
mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well,  meet people and  go to parties and-and we play tennis
mean, that's
that's a very big step for me, you know
mean
(Reacting, Alvy looks down at his hands, then up) 'm able to enjoy people more
(Sadly) So whatta you
You're not gonna come back to New York
(Smiling) What's so great about New York
mean, it's a dying city
You read "Death in Venice
" Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till  bought it for yuh
That's right, that's right
(Still smiling) You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles
(Nodding his head and gesturing) That's right, 'cause it's an important issue
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that
mean, your life is New York City
You're just this person
You're like this island unto yourself
(Toying with his car keys) can't enjoy anything unless
unless everybody is
-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's
you know, -
it puts a crimp in my evening
(Looking down at his hands, sadly) So wanna get married or what
(Seriously) No
We're friends
wanna remain friends
(In disbelief) Okay
(Louder, to the waitress) Check, please
Can  -can
Can
Can
(Interrupting) You're mad, aren't you
(Shaking his head) No
(Then nodding) Yes, of course 'm mad, because you love me,  know that
Alvy,  can't say that that's true at this point in my life
really just can't say that that's true
mean, you know how wonderful you are mean, you know
you're the reason that  got outta my room and that was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap
Anyway, look,  don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh (Laughing) h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh
(Shrugging his shoulders) The usual, you know
Uh, tryin't'write
'm workin' on a play
(Sighing) Jesus
So whatta yuh saying
That you're not comin' back to New York with me
He nods his head in disbelief
(Nodding) No
(Pauses) Look,  gotta go
She starts to rise
You mean that
(He gets up and starts following her past diners at other tables) --- flew three thousand miles to see you
'm late
Air miles, you know
mean, you know what that does to my stomach
They move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony
The Grammys are tonight
The what
The Grammys
He's got a lotta records up for awards
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music
Oh
thought just earplugs
Annie gets into her car
Alvy moves over to his rented convertible
Just forget it, Alvy, okay
Let's just forget the conversation
She closes the door, starts the motor
(Yelling after her) Awards
They do nothing but give out awards
can't believe it
Greatest, greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler
Annie drives away
Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor
Putting the car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with a loud crash
Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has just turned into the parking lot
For a brief moment, the screen shows a flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park
Alvy's father is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping others right and left
Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible, purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper- car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force
Another flashback appears
people in the small cars really racing around the track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car
He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him
(Getting out of the car) Officer,  know what you're gonna say
'm-'m not a great driver, you know, - have some problems with-with-with- (Interrupting) May  see your license, please
Sure
(Searching, he finally fishes his license out of his pocket) just don't-don't get angry, you know what  mean
'Cause - have -  have my-my license here
You know, it's a rented car
And 've
He drops the license and it falls to the ground
Don't give me your life story (Looking at the piece of paper on the ground) -just pick up the license
Pick up the license
You have to ask nicely 'cause 've had an extremely rough day
You know, my girl friend- (Interrupting) Just give me the license, please
Since you put it that way
(He laughs) It's hard for me to refuse
(He leans over, picks up the license, then proceeds to rip it up
He lets the pieces go; they float to the ground) have a,  have a terrific problem with authority, you know
'm
it's not your fault
Don't take it personal
: -
guard moves down the ball to the cell where, Alvy stands with other inmates
He unlocks the door and opens it, letting Alvy out
So long, fellas
Keep in touch
He walks down the corridor off screen
- Policemen are walking up and down the courthouse steps as Alvy and Rob move out the door of the building, down the steps to the street
Imagine my surprise when  got your call, Max
(Carrying his jacket over his shoulder) Yeah
had the feeling that  got you at a bad moment
You know,  heard high-pitched squealing
They walk over to Rob's convertible and get in
(Starting the car) Twins, Max
Sixteen-year-olds
Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities
(Reacting) You're an actor, Max
You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park
Oh,  did Shakespeare in the Park, Max
got mugged
was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard
He puts on an elaborate helmet and goggles
(Looking at Rob's helmet) Max, are we driving through plutonium
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max
You don't get old
: An actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball
They face each other
The actress resembles Annie; the actor, Alvy
You're a thinking person
How can you choose this lifestyle
What is so incredibly great about New York
It's a dying city
You-you read "Death in Venice"
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till gave it to you
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title
The camera pulls back, showing Alvy sitting with two men at a table set up near the actors
mirror, running the whole width of the wall, reflects the two actors, a script lying on the table between them
It is obvious now that they are rehearsing a scene that Alvy wrote
(In mirrored reflection) It's an important issue
(In mirrored reflection) Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life
The camera moves back to actual actor and actress
You're like New York
You're an island
(Rising with emotion) Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you,  guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all
You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here
in a health -food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard
Goodbye, Sunny
The actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair
Wait
'm-'m gonna
go with you
(The actor comes back
They embrace) love you
The camera cuts to Alvy, who turns and looks straight into the camera
(To the audience, gesturing) Tsch, whatta you want
It was my first play
You know, you know how you're always tryin' t' get things to come out perfect in art because, uh, it's real difficult in life
Interestingly, however, did run into Annie again
It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan
Annie, singing "Seems Like Old Times, " overlaps Alvy's speech and continues over the next scene, where Alvy, standing in front of a Manhattan theater, shakes hands with Annie and her escort
The theater marquee reads " : '    '
" ' (Over the theater scene and, Annie's singing) She had moved back to New York
She was living in SoHo with some guy
(Laughing) And when  met her she was, of all things, dragging him in to see "The Sorrow and the Pity
"  Which  counted as a personal triumph
Annie and
(Alvy's voice continues over the scene shot through a window of Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and Annie sitting at a table, laughing and enjoying themselves) we had lunch sometime after that, and, uh, just, uh, kicked around old times
series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to sing: Annie and Alvy going up the  Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich
Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove
Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline
Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home in her car
Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the "Death" titles; Annie and, Alvy in their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts in the red light
The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came over to kill the spider
And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy following, the day she first moved into his apartment
Annie holding up her sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the  Drive, the New York City skyline behind them
The music stops
Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows Annie and Alvy across street
They look about at the city traffic
Lunch is over; it's time
Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like
Annie crosses the street, Alvy watching her go
Then he turns, and slowly walks down the street off screen
His voice is heard over the scene: ' - After that it got pretty late
And we both hadda go, but it was great seeing Annie again, right
realized what a terrific person she was and-and how much fun it was just knowing her and - thought of that old joke, you know, this- this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, "Doc, uh, my brother's crazy
He thinks he's a chicken
" And, uh, the doctor says, "Well, why don't you turn him in
" And the guy says, " would, but need the eggs
" Well,  guess that's pretty much how how  feet about relationships
You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd and
but, uh,  guess we keep goin' through it because, uh, most of us need the eggs
