by Jonathan Lawton &  Stephen Metcalfe -------------------------------------------------------------- - The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house is extraordinary
small outdoor dinner party is in progress
is entertaining guests
Playing cards and coins appear and disappear in his nimble hands
- stands at the window, impassively looking down at the party
Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around forty
He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured by a night's sleep
(a murmur) Left pocket
And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous 's silk blazer
More laughter and applause
The study is in keeping with the rest of the house
Luxurious
Everything the best
, Edward's contemporary, is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host
is an investment banker
His assistant , is a financial researcher
The other men are
They are in dark suits and power ties
On the table are stacks of documents and folders, the name " " is prominent on many of the folders
1 Our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage Harris Enterprises from investing in California
We think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing
With the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk
Look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation
We have over a thousand man hours in this deal
(losing patience) This is a "no brainer"
There's no risk for you
No one has ever lost money backing Mr
Harris
2 Not yet
But ship building is a new endeavor for you
(cuts him off) Come on
You know we're not going to go into ship building
Besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us
3 Bill, be reasonable
If you're really going to digest Kross Industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem
Besides,  don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have
It's unacceptable
Edward turns from the window
He hasn't miss a thing
All eyes are on him
Draymen Heux has offered me seventy-five in the pool at sixteen and a half
can secure the other half personally
You have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer
The bankers speechlessly stare at him
The meeting is over, gentlemen
He turns away
The bankers look at one another
They rise
Silence as they exit
When the door closes
Stuckey explodes with laughter
Hah
Did you see the look on their faces
You don't think we pushed too hard
way
They'll come back
They can't afford not to
Edward, that bluff was beautiful
Maybe  should have made it rhyme
The others stare at him, uncertain
Stuckey laughs
The others follow suit
(looking at his watch) Well
It's late
We've been at this long enough
Stuckey rises
Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door
Gentlemen, enjoy the party
The magician's wonderful
Vance and Jake exit
(calling after them) Watch your left pocket
has entered the room
Phone call, Mr
Harris
It's Miss Charles
Cynthia
Is she coming out
We're about to find out
Go on
Take care of your guests
Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone
(into phone) Where are you, Cynthia
(beat) see
(pausing, getting angry) No,  don't expect you to be at my beck-and-call
Are you coming or not
-  - Edward descends the long, curved stairway
He has Vance in tow
(all business) Prepare the filing papers
Have them ready by the middle of the week
'll tell you when to submit them
The  talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate toward Edward
Edward
(turning on the charm) Yes
Will we see you at the polo matches Wednesday
Wouldn't miss it
(abruptly; to Vance) want this done fast and easy
No slip-ups
want to be back in New York by Saturday
Got it
He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd
-    - Stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful in a tight sheath of an evening dress
An elegant woman approaches from behind him
She taps him on the shoulder and he turns, startled
Bill
(flustered) Oh
Hi, honey
Millicent, uh, uh, Millicent
Lowell
Lowell, right
My wife, Elizabeth
(ignoring her) Is Edward leaving
Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door
Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward
- Edward comes out of the house
Jags, a limo with waiting and two 's pack the circular driveway behind a black Ferrari
The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of Edward
Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his impatience under control
Stuckey comes out of the house and down the walk
What's up, where you going
Give me your car keys, will you, 'm going back to my hotel
At least stay for a drink
This party's for you
Apologize to Elizabeth for me
Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you
(as if delighted) Really
Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than  do
(turning away) No, thank you
just got off the phone with one
Cynthia's not coming
No
Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand
He crosses to a black Ferrari and gets in
Let your driver take you
We'll move the cars
Edward starts the car
Can you drive a stick
The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly stalls
Edward, give me a break
With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway and
stalls again
Love this car
Is it new
Yes
And you don't even know where you're going
Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill
Stuckey watching, throws up his hands
That's the wrong way
: - The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes large, beautiful homes
Edward shifts, grinding gears
- The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt
The  in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly
Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine
The light turns green
Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari
The Colt leaves him in the dust
- Edward drives
He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid himself of his own tired thoughts
- The Ferrari comes to the intersection of  and , stops
Edward gets out of the car
He looks at the street signs
He has no idea where he is
He signs
He gets back in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East
- crumbling old apartment building
Dark alley ways, deserted parking lot
The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building, looking very out of place on the street
building facade of lit windows and metal fire escape
One window in particular
stands there in a short kimono, looking down
And then she turns away
'  - to see her dressing
'  - turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom mirror
She is twenty years old and a prostitute
Make-up applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed
She'd be innocently beautiful without it
She is wearing tiny shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots
She stares at herself, not really liking what she sees
moment
She signs, turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom
- Faded, peeling walls
Thread bare, dirty carpet
Vivian locks the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway
door suddenly opens, startling her
An unshaved, enormously pot bellied  in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig eyes
Vivian
Vivian turns some "tough" on him
Yeah, what
Rent
You're late
Don't give me that
Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash
Kit give me nothin'
(suddenly uncertain) You bullshittin' me
Of rent  do not bullshit
Vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway
By the end of the week or you're otta here
(a beat) By the way, you look very nice tonight
'  - Vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf
She pulls off the top
It's empty
She tosses the can away, starts for the door
She opens it
- Down the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open doorway, talking to a
They both glance up
Vivian quickly closes the door
She doesn't want to deal with them
- Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk
She hurried away
- Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something
someone
- goes by happily talking to himself
He wears an " Love Hollywood" t-shirt
Vivian passes  but doesn't notice them any more than she pays attention to the  she passes further on, huddle in a doorway
-  on a  goes by dropping off little bags to various -
- stands in front of a photo store urging tourists to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie star
Some go in
Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking
in a mini skirt strolls toward her
car passes
The  stares at Vivian with interest
She ignores him
The black prostitute approaches the car
Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date
The Driver looks her over
The Black Prostitute gets in the car and it drives away
, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night coffee shop
They  and make obscene gestures and as Vivian hurries by
She ignores them and goes next door into a falafel stand
Half a dozen  sit at dirty tables inside
- Behind the counter are a  and a , Vietnamese cooks frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the shop
Chan, you seen Kit tonight
1 Hi, hi
No see nothing
You do, tell her 'm looking for her
2 Looking good, bay-bee
Yeah, you too, 'Nai
If Kit comes in here, tell her stay
Both of them nod and smile at Vivian
Vivian exits
- Skateboard zips by a
We  a police car parked at the entrance to an alcove
Also, an ambulance
The bubblegum lights are going
has gathered
The happy man with the " Love Hollywood" t-shirt and a   are engaged in tense conversation
They just pulled her out of a dumpster in the back
Now talk to me
tell you, man,  don't know who she hang with
She have a pimp
Cocaine her pimp, man
She a strawberry
She be out on these streets, day in, day out, tradin' her sorry ass for crack
And now she dead from it
Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body of a   is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried towards the waiting ambulance
For a moment Vivian thinks it's
no, Vivian turns grimly away
Vivian surveys the dark street
And suddenly sees who's she's looking for
Walks
-   - We  a young, tough-looking  and  trying on wigs
The  is a man wearing a dress and wild wig
The girl, , is around 18, is dark haired and thin
The young man, , has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder
They giggle about something, both obviously high
Kit looks up, bleary-eyed
She stops
Vivian is standing in front of her
You spent it on drugs, didn't you
Hi, Viv
Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv
Lookin' good, baby
(ignoring him) Did you blow it all, Kit
Is it all gone
Carlos had some great rock
bet
(beat) That was our rent
Carlos attempts to put an arm around Vivian's shoulders
Calm down, Chica
Vivian throws him off
Ey
What is it you wan', baby
can fix you up
Beat it, scum bucket
You kiss your mother with that mouth
Your frien' still owes me 200
(to Kit) Let's go
Skateboard appears suddenly, blocking Vivian and Kit's path
Get out of my face or 'll have those cops on your ass in two seconds
Carlos glares at her
He looks down toward the lights of the cop cars
One of the  looks towards them, curiously
Vivian waves at the cop
(threatening to Vivian) Don't take no dates tonight, chica, you got one with me
Vivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard
- Vivian and Kit sit at a table sipping tea
Vivian is still mad at her
We worked for that money
We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street
Viv
don't be stupid
We're whores
Vivian looks like she wants to weep
Or scream
She does neither
She slowly nods
Kit's sorry she said that
(cont'd) So  blew our stash
We could make it all back with one good night on the streets
just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster
wonder how much she made tonight
Don't be mad at me
'll pay you back
promise
thought you were giving up that drug shit
will
'm trying
(a beat) Meanwhile  got some crack left, you wanna get high
No, let's go to work
Okay
Okay
(then touches her hand) 'm sorry  said your dream was stupid
- Edward's Ferrari turns onto Hollywood Blvd
, finally out of the Hollywood Hills
- Vivian and Kit are out trying to hustle John's in passing cars
Vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop
Kit is talking to another prostitute,
No no, honey
You see these stars on the sidewalk
Me and Vivian work from Don Ameche all the way up to Roy Rogers
This is our office
We got seniority
Get off our corner
was just taking a rest here
Besides, she's new
(points to Vivian) But 'm old
Go rest up by Monty Hall or Debra Paget where you belong
Rachel walks off
(looks at passing cars) Looks slow tonight
Maybe we should get a pimp
Carlos likes you and -- Forget it
We work for it
We keep it
They keep hustling
can't handle this tonight
'm going home
(stares at her) That crack is burning a hole in your pocket
There isn't even milk in the fridge
The rent's due
Now come on -- -    - (
) (suddenly) Hey, hey -- There's a rent
-    - He's not gonna want us
The Ferrari goes by and stops
(calls out to Vivian) Excuse me
(excited) Don't take less than a hundred
You look hot tonight
And remember, don't mouth off
They don't like that
Okay
Go home
But take it easy on that shit
Kit gives Vivian a quick hug
You're the greatest
'll wait up for you
And then Kit is off, moving quickly away
Vivian turns
She stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents
And then it's as if Vivian turns a switch
She fluffs her mane of hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face
In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious and distracted
Vivian leans over the passenger window
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date
What's that
You looking' for some company
Uh, no
How do  get to Beverly Hills
What
(dropping the come on) You gonna tell me you're lost
Yes
Great
What do  look like a tourguide
Edward takes a good look at her
(a beat) No, you look like a hooker
Actually, 'm a movie star out for a walk
Good
Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills
Sure
For five bucks
That's ridiculous
The price just went up to ten
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart
(sweetly) Sit
and spin
Sit-and-spin
(amused) Alright
why not
He pulls out his money clip
Vivian suddenly freezes
On the sidewalk up ahead, Carlos and Skateboard
Carlos flashes an evil, menacing grin
He motions to Skateboard, they start forward
(holding up a bill) You have change for a twenty
Vivian pulls open the door of the car and jumps in
For twenty, Ill show you personal
Drive
Edward stares at her
She smiles sweetly
(cont'd) Make a "-ee"
Beverly Hills is the other way
The Ferrari pulls away, passing Carlos on the sidewalk
-  - Nice car
Yours
(as he grinds the gears; wincing) No
Stolen
Not exactly
He smiles
Vivian smiles back
Mind if  turn on some heat
If you can figure it out, be my guest
Vivian reaches out, turns on the heat
Very good
You're obviously mechanical
(laughs) You're not from
, huh
New York
What motel you staying at
Hotel
Okay, what hotel
Regent Beverly Wilshire
bet you know it
(annoyed at his tone) Yeah,  peed in the fountain there once
Give me a break
Edward glances over, amused
It hits him that she really is an attractive girl
What's your name
What do you want it to be
(a beat) Vivian, my name's Vivian
You like being a hooker, Vivian
It pays
So do day jobs
(sarcastic) Day jobs, yeah
've tried them
(a beat) Turn right
- The Ferrari glides along a seedy, West Hollywood section of Santa Monica
-  - Must be dangerous
Hooking
Tell me about it
is suffering from a wacko epidemic
And who knows where half the guys pick up have been
mean, use condoms
Always
And  get checked out once a month at the free clinic
Not only am  better in the sack than an amateur, 'm probably safer
Very good
You ought to have that printed up on your business card
(a moment) If you're making fun of me, don't like it
Sorry
If  did,  didn't mean to
Vivian unconsciously bites her fingernails
Ugly habit, biting your nails
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly
But she puts her hands in her lap
She looks out the window
She's safe from Carlos
Okay, pull over
Let me out
've got to get back to work
Edward pulls the Ferrari to the curb and stops
(cont'd) Stay on this street and you'll hit Beverly Hills
What do you charge for company, Vivian
Company would cost you
a hundred dollars
For the whole night
For an hour
You're joking
never joke about money
Neither do
(a moment; amused) hundred bucks an hour though
That's pretty stiff
She reaches across the seat
Her hand goes in his lap
No, but it's getting there
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night
You couldn't afford it
Vivian starts to get out of the car
Try me
moment
Vivian's sexy smile comes on
Three hundred
Fine
What's your name, lover
Edward
My name is Edward
Edward
you got it
Edward gets out of the car
Vivian looks at him confused
Get in
This side
What
You know how to drive a stick
Vivian moves around the car
Better believe it
Then let's go
It's worth 300 just so  don't have to drive
They get in the car
- She starts the car, revs it
Here we go Edward
- The Ferrari peels out, fishtails madly and  up the street
- Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel
Bright flags are illuminated by carefully placed spotlights
The Ferrari  into the driveway and comes to a jarring stop by the front door
- Edward takes a moment to get his breath
He gestures toward the back
My raincoat's in the back
Put it on
Why
You may feel more comfortable
This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour
You mean they don't have hookers
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're
Off the boulevard
Exactly
- As they walk in, Vivian is tying the trenchcoat
Great
Now  took like a hooker in a trenchcoat
She looks up
She stops in her tracks
The lobby is bright and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling
Even at this hour there is a great deal of activity
in business suits and  in furs and jewels are passing by
Vivian's face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of all this luxury
Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes Edward's arm
So let's go
Edward guides them across the lobby
They reach the elevators and go inside
-  - The young   is dressed in a clean red uniform that seems just a bit too tight
As the elevator doors close he nods toward Edward
Evening, sir
Good evening
Penthouse
Penthouse
My, my
She sees the operator glancing at her
The penthouse
And step on it
-  - Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors
Edward pulls out his key and unlocks the doors
With a gentle push the door slide open in unison
Edward gestures to Vivian to go inside
She does
Edward closes the doors behind her
-  - As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling off the top of the building
In front of her is a sunken living room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the city below
For the first time, she is speechless
Edward closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living room
Edward picks up a phone
Vivian checks out the room
(into the phone) Room service
(to Vivian) What do you drink
Diet coke
(into the phone) Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne
Can  have some chips
(into the phone) -- and a bowl of strawberries
Thank you
Vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room
She stares at the view
(to Vivian) Impressed
Vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it
You kidding
come here all the time
As a matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour
Edward smiles
He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans back
Vivian looks at him
(cont'd) Well, now that you have me for the night, what are you going to do with me
Want to know something
don't quite know
hadn't planned this
Do you plan everything
(a small smile) Always
Well, the meter's running, it's your money
Speaking of which, cash'll do
In advance
Fair enough
He rises
Takes out his wallet
Standing over her, he drops crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap
She picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed
She puts the money in her jacket
She realizes Edward is standing over her as if waiting
She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants
He abruptly turns away
Let's talk some more first
Right
(brightly) So
In town on business
(taking off his jacket) Uh-huh
Let me guess, you're a
lawyer
(loosening his tie) And why do you say that
(a small smile) dunno
you have that sharp, useless look
Edward almost smiles
He sits across from her again
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers
've known a lot of everybody
chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door
Champagne
He starts to sit up
Vivian motions for him to stay put
Hey
might as well make myself useful
Edward sits back down
Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the front door
comes into the room with a silver cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl
Where would you like it
Where would we like it
Where would we like it
Here'll be fine
The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle of the living room
He turns and heads back up the stairs and pauses near Vivian, staring
Vivian stares back at him
What are you looking at
The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits
Vivian closes the door behind him
Vivian marches back down the stairs
think he wanted you to tip him
Tsk
Excuse me,  didn't think he had change for a hundred
Edward crosses to the silver stand
Vivian watches with interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket
(cont'd) You have a wife
Girlfriend
have both
Edward lifts the bottle out
He deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop of champagne
Where are they
Shopping together
They should be
They're both good at it
Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and hands one to Vivian
(cont'd) My ex-wife lives in London in what used to be my home
My girlfriend is in New York moving out of my apartment even as we speak
Cheers
He drinks, nods approvingly
It's a very good year
Oooh, thank god
Edward laughs softly
She sips it
To her surprise, really likes it
Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries
Try a strawberry
Why
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club
Vivian
the meter's running
cooperate
moment
She slowly eats a strawberry
The juice of it stains her lips
Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry
His eyes haven't left her
(softly) You really are a very beautiful girl
(husky-voiced) Just a romantic, that's you
Yes
Her mouth is so wet and inviting
he leans closer
Me too
He's about to kiss her
(cont'd) Not on the lips
He freezes
She pulls his head down to her breast
- Edward and Vivian on the bed
He is on his back, his shoulder and head resting against the headboard
She is astride him, hands resting on his chest, rocking
in control, confident
very much liking the fire she's kindled in his eyes
-      - (touching her breasts) What do you like
If  want you to turn me on 'll pay you three hundred
Just lay back and let me drive
Smiling, Vivian reaches behind her, touching him
He tries not to groan
She's moving faster now
Edward suddenly pulls her violently to him, he rolls her over
-  - heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward
He stands there quietly letting it wash over him
He turns off the shower, steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself
- Edward stares
His expensive clothes are on the floor, haphazardly dropped everywhere
Vivian's clothes, as tattered as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair
The incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way
He looks toward the bed
Vivian is fast asleep
Her heavy makeup has long since been rubbed off
Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone
She looks like a sweet, gentle girl
He stares at her a moment longer
He turns, goes into the living room
Vivian opens her eyes
Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living room chair
He is reading contracts
- The sun is coming up as   hoses down the sidewalk in front of the hotel
- is vacuuming the lobby
She sees something and pauses
She pulls a dead leaf from one of the potted plants
- The elevator doors open and   rolls a cart out into the hallway
He takes it to the doors of the penthouse
He rings the bell
(
) It's open
- The Waiter wheels in a table of food, coffee, champagne and orange juice
Edward dressed in suit pants, white shirt and suspenders, stands in the living room talking into a cordless phone
Edward points the Waiter to the dining table
(into the phone) Sorry
Go ahead
'  -  - William Stuckey is behind his desk
Kross knows we're after his company
He wants to talk with you
don't think you should
- The Waiter returns
Edward signs the bill
The Waiter exits
want to
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal
'll see him alone
Everyone knows you're my muscle
We'll make it social
Tell Kross 'll meet him for dinner
Tonight if you can arrange it
You shouldn't go alone
He might claim that you tried to black mail him
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia
'll see you in the office
By the way, about your car
Oh, god, what
(smiling) 'll bring it back
Edward hangs up
He pours a glass of orange juice and takes a sip, thinking
Something makes him turn
Vivian, wearing a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the bedroom doorway
Good morning
You didn't wake me
'll be out of here in a minute
No hurry
Would you like some breakfast
She's hungry and the breakfast looks great
Only if you do
Edward sits
Waits
Vivian sits across from him
Edward serves them breakfast
Did you sleep well
Yeah
Too good
forgot where was
Occupational hazard
She looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense, relaxes
Where'd you go
took the couch
had some work to do
(hesitating) About last night
Oooh, Baby, you were the best
was beside myself
Mmm,  could tell
just hope it was worth three hundred bucks
'd say you give a good dollar value
They share a small smile
They eat
Do you ever
enjoy it
like guys if that's what you're asking
Not that  trust'm
No
Why's that
"Occupational hazard"
moment
Edward chuckles
Vivian grins
(cont'd) what do you do anyway
buy companies
No shit
They expensive
He almost smiles
She almost smiles back
The one 'm buying this week will cost around 150 million
dollars
He nods
This time Vivian is impressed
(cont'd) You are major league, baby
Your mother must be very proud
Edward is oddly pleased at her reaction
- The closet door is open
Edward reaches for a tie
In the closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes, etc
She follows him in
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm
(fumbling with the tie) sell them
What
Why
She undoes his knot and starts over
(cont'd) At ease, let me do that
Part of the all night services
By breaking up a company's assets -- What are assets
Vivian -- 'mon,  might buy a company some day
Assets are anything of value a company owns
Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole
By selling them off, make a profit
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh
Not
quite
There, see
Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot
Where'd you learn to do this
(sarcastic) fucked the debate team in high school
Tsk
had a grampa
He liked ties on Sundays
You mind if  take a swim in your bathtub before  hit it
Don't drown
Vivian turns and heads toward the bathroom
He follows her into the bathroom
- Vivian turns on the water in the tub
It fills the tub in a torrential rush
You could hold a pep rally in here
The phone on the marbled bathroom wall suddenly rings
Edward reaches for it
(into the phone) Yes
'  - Stuckey is walking around his desk
Edward, it's me
Kross is all set for tonight
- Vivian stares curiously at the bidet
Listen,  gotta say this again, don't like you going alone
She turns it on
The water hits her in the face
(stifling a chuckle) 'm a big boy
There are lotions and shampoos and bubblebaths on the edge of the tub
Vivian regards them like a kid in a candy shop
Let me at least get you a date
Keep it social
Edward watches as Vivian smells some bubble bath
She smiles
Her eyes ask Edward if it's okay to
He nods
Edward, did you hear me
'm here
know a lot of nice girls
Vivian pours the bubblebath into the swirling water
There's something about the look on her face
the way she bites her lower lip
curious, sensual
have one
Edward hangs up the phone as Vivian curiously turns on the television
The sound blares
She fumbles to turn it down
Edward reaches over and turns it off
All right
How much for the week
What
'm in town until Saturday
She look at him like he isn't speaking English
Do-you-want-to-stay-here- for-the-week
It takes Vivian a moment to respond
It'd cost you
Of course
How much
Five full nights
days too
Edward nods
Vivian hesitates
it's got to be enough to really change things
She shoots for the moon again
Four thousand
Vivian, may  point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500
But you want days too
All right, two thousand
Three
Done
Holy shit
And then, quickly getting herself back together, she flips on the sexy smile
(cont'd) Sugar, you got it
will treat you like a prince
Anything, anyway you want
'm not just talking about sex
Look butthead, 'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay
Three thousand for five days
And Vivian,  will let you go
- Edward comes out into the bedroom
Vivian quickly follows
They move through the bedroom into the living room
'll be out most of the day
He reaches into his pocket for a money clip
He peels off bills
He hands the cash to Vivian
want you to go out and buy some decent clothes
Vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money
Nothing too flashy, not too sexy
Conservative
Understand
- They're at the front door
Yeah, you want me to dress like your high class girlfriend
You're wasting your money though
All 'm gonna do is hang around the hotel
As a matter of fact, may never get out of that bathtub
Edward opens the door, he starts to exit
He turns back
Think again
'm taking you out to an important dinner with me tonight
The door closes in her face
- (
) (from inside) What
Are you crazy
Edward smiles to himself
Probably
- Vivian is stretched out in the hot bubble bath
The  is on
She clicks the remote control in her hand
Three thousand
She lies back into the soapy water and disappears
She suddenly pops back up, laughing
Three thousand
thought occurs to her
She reaches for the cordless phone
She dials
She waits
She is about to disconnect when the phone is answered
(
) 'Lo
Kit
Where've you been
(
) was asleep
You woke me
You okay
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, 'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks
We can get out of the apartment
We can get out of this town
We can do anything
(silence) Kit
Hey, you there
(
) Why'd he want you
That hurts
Perhaps because Vivian's been wondering the same thing
He
he just does
(
) 'm sorry, Viv'
Carlos has been on my back
(a beat) Did you get the money up front like  taught ya'
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes
Now listen, 'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk
Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent
Spend it on drugs and 'll pull your hair out
'm getting dressed now
'll be over
Bye
Hey Kit, where do  go for the clothes
Good stuff on him
(
) (brightening) In Beverly Hills
Yeah
(
) Baby
Rodeo Drive
- Vivian comes out of the elevator and crosses the lobby
She is back in her hooker clothes
She leaves an envelope at the front desk
, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, steps out from his office
He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees Vivian exit out the front door
Vivian doesn't notice the odd stares she gets from two well-dressed -  who are just entering
- Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than a bit overwhelmed
She passes store windows
and and still
Each display is more beautiful and expensive than the one before
Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks
From '
Two beautiful dressed  her own age look at her, turn away and giggle
The uniformed  that stand at attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her suspiciously
Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh woman's boutique
She hesitates for a moment
She enters
- Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the disapproving stare of a  standing behind the counter
(cooly) May  help you
'm just looking, thanks
Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with delicate glass objects
She cautiously examines a dress
The Saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her
Are you looking for something in particular
Yes
Something
conservative
Yes
Vivian eyes the Saleswoman, puzzled at her tone
She examines a dress
You have beautiful things
(no reply) How much is this
don't think it would fit you
(beginning to get the drift) didn't ask if it would fit
asked how much it was
It's very expensive
Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman
What is with you
(unblinking) Excuse me
'm going to spend money
don't think we have anything for you here
You're obviously in the wrong place
Vivian is speechless
She turns and stomps toward the door
She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman
Vivian flips her off
She throws the door open and storms outside
The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns to her place
- Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost
She takes a deep breath, trying to control herself
Two , in elegant designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a freak
Vivian suddenly feels naked
She turns and hurries away
- Vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid
She feels an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury around her
She hurries toward the elevators
At the front desk, Mr
Thomas, once again spots her
He crosses the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator
May  help you Miss
Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror
'm just going to my room
You're a guest here
'm -- 'm with a friend
And who is that
Edward
Vivian's face is filled with confusion
She doesn't know his name
The elevator doors open behind them
She spots the Operator
(blurting it out) He knows me
Mr
Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously
The Operator looks back at them innocently
With a smooth gesture Mr
Thomas waves the Operator over
Do you know this young lady
The Operator nods
She's with Mr
Harris
(surprised) Mr
Harris
She apparently joined him last night
Mr
Thomas waves the Operator away
Why don't you come with me
We'll chat for just a moment
He takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off
- In a richly furnished office, Mr
Thomas places Vivian in a comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk
What's your name
Vivian
Miss Vivian
things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire
Vivian says nothing
(cont'd) Mr
Harris, however, is a very special customer
And we like to think of our special customers as friends
As a customer, we would expect Mr
Harris to sign in any additional guests
But as a friend, we're willing to overlook it, 'm assuming you're a
relative
Vivian finds herself nodding
(cont'd) thought so
You must be his
Niece
Of course
Naturally when Mr
Harris leaves,  won't see you in this hotel again
Vivian bites her lower lip, nods
(cont'd) Good
We understand one another
(as a gentle afterthought:) would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner
Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry
That's what  was trying to do
She can't help it, the tears come
Vivian pulls out the money Edward gave her
She drops it on the desk
It's a moist- looking wad now
(cont'd) was trying to get some other clothes
but
they wouldn't
they made me feel like shit
She can't go on
Mr
Thomas politely glances at the money
He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her
He sighs
He picks up the phone
He dials
(into the phone) Women's clothing
(beat) Bridget, please
Vivian is staring at him
(cont'd) Bridget, hello, this is Barnard Thomas over at the Regent Beverly Wilshire
Well, thank you, that's flattering
'd like to ask a favor of you
'm going to send someone over
Her name is Vivian
She's a guest of ours
very special guest
He glances at Vivian
With those simple words, he'd made her feel better
(cont'd) She's from out of town and she needs a little help in dressing
Perhaps you could help her out
Thank you very much
She'll be right over
He sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian
(cont'd) There you are
If you have any other problems, come ask for me personally
'm Mr
Thomas
Barney
She smiles mischievously
- sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port
- Edward, Vance, Stuckey and Jake walk toward the building's edge
They look out over the empty shipyard as Vance describes it
Okay
this is the jewel in Kross's crown
We can strip out all the heavy equipment
Some of the cranes are very valuable overseas
The Japanese are salivating for them
Prime industrial property straddling the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles
It gives me a hard-on
Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard
What's that long building over there
Storage,  think
Not with those smokestacks it's not
Let me check
Vance pulls out a notebook
The real estate possibilities are endless
Most of the yard we'll just level
talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said -- You what
talked to some developers about the land
What kind of an idiot are you
You don't talk about this to anyone
They're close friends, they'd never breathe a word -- (to Vance) Where did you dig this moron up
He's right, Jake, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do
It won't happen again, Edward
'll pull him off the project immediately
Don't bother
What
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed
Besides
(not unkindly, to Jake) You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you
It won't happen again, Mr
Harris
Vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook
This is interesting
That building is storage now, but it used to be a smelting plant
They closed it down after World War want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them right away
want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them
Jesus, yes
It's a long shot but if the permits are still in effect, they're worth a fortune
He turns away
The other follow Edward back toward the stairs
What time's diner tonight
Eight o'clock
Kross is bringing his son
Very bright kid, watch yourself with him
Who's this girl you're taking
No one you know
-   - The elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room nervously
She walks toward the women's clothing section
, a large friendly woman, spots her and quickly approaches
You must be Vivian
Vivian nods
(cont'd) Let's look at you
She steps back, regards Vivian with a professional eye
(cont'd) Where are you from, dear
(pause) Georgia
No wonder
For starts, you should know that hot pants are horrid, even when you do have the legs to carry them off
What are your plans while you're in town
Well
might be going out to dinner
You'll want a cocktail dress then
Turn
You have a beautiful figure
little too out in the open but simply lovely
Size six
Do you need shoes
dunno
Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress
(calling out) Philip
We'll need shoes
Bridget leads Vivian towards the racks of clothes
She pulls out a dress
Your uncle will like this
He's not really my uncle
They never are, dear
- Mr
Thomas is behind the desk
He looks up
Vivian is standing there, a happy look on her face
She holds up a garment bag
got a dress
(dryly) rather hoped you'd be wearing it
didn't want to get it messed
got shoes too
Wanna see
That's all right
'm sure they're quite lovely
They were real nice to me there
They treated me, y'know
nice
Thanks, Barney
Mr
Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity
You're very welcome, Miss Vivian
She smiles at him
He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward the elevator
The provocative way her hips move just naturally attracts the attention of a
And the white gloved literally leaps to press the elevator button for Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile
Mr
Thomas sighs
- The phone is ringing Vivian enters
She hurries to pick it up
Hello
The phone keeps ringing -- it has more than one line
Vivian frantically punches buttons
(cont'd) Hello
What
Hello
'  -   - Edward is in a private office
Never answer the phone
Ever
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time
Did you buy some clothes
got a dress, yeah
Just one
Christ
hope it's appropriate
It's very tasteful
think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch
(silence) 'm -- joking
Let's hope so
You'll get some more clothes tomorrow
'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp
Got it
No,  don't "got it"
Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date
This isn't a date
Go by yourself then
Where you taking me anyway
The Rex
Any good
think you'll approve
all right
'll meet you in the lobby
But only cause you're paying me to
Thank you very much
Vivian slowly sets the phone down
The phone rings again
Vivian, very carefully, punches the flashing button and picks it up
Hello
thought  told you not to answer the phone
Oooh
Edward hangs up
He smiles to himself
Vivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous
The doorbell Vivian looks up, startled
She rises, moves to answer it
It's the Spanish
She nods politely at Vivian
Housekeeping
come to turn down the bed
5:00,  turn down the bed
What
The Maid points to her hotel badge, trying to explain
Housekeeping
come to turn down the bed
Okay
The Maid enters
Is there a trick to it
- The Maid turns down the bedspread
Is that all
You just fold back the bedspread
also place las chocolates on the pillow
Oooh,  love those
leave extras, miss
Thanks
Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own
Consuelo shrugs
- Mr
Thomas is still behind the desk, working when a soft voice startles him
Barney
He looks up
He sighs
Vivian still hasn't changed
What is it, Miss Vivian
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner
The Rex
Ever been there
It's a bit beyond my
range, shall we say
Yeah, mine too
Is it like, y'know, normal
think you'll find it normal enough
Will  like it
You'll like it fine
Okay
Thanks, Barney
You're the best
She turns away
Just mind which fork you use
Vivian turns abruptly back, a horrified look on her face
Fork
- - An elegant formal placesetting complete with a myriad of different size forks, spoons, stacked china plates and crystal glassware
sit across from one another at a fully set table
In fifteen minutes  can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen
First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand
But  always eat like this
Either you're European or badly brought up
Hmmm
vonder vich
(giggles) Actually, some of the richest people  know have the worst manners
Of course, Mr
Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table
All right now, pay attention please
Salad fork
What if they serve soup
They will serve salad
But what if they serve soup
Then you use your soup spoon
(smiles) like steak
(picking up the appropriate utensil) Then you would use your-- Steak spoon
(laughs) Mr
Thomas swallows his exasperation
from their table to reveal the cavernous, empty banquets room, each table is set and ready for the dinner service
Miss Vivian -- Maybe 'll just order a burger, Barney, that way  can eat with my hands
Miss Vivian
there's a salon here in the hotel
Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead
Professionally
- Vivian sits in a salon chair
The last customer, , a young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a pony tail, tilts her head one way and then another, eyeing her professionally
have a friend who has a friend who does Cher's wigs
hate him already
(a beat) All set
Yeah
what a ya say we chop it all off and bleach the tips
Darling
Trust me
- Edward enters and looks around the lobby
No Vivian
Annoyed
Edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up
He's about to dial when: Good evening, Mr
Harris
Edward looks at him blankly
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel
Of course, yes
If you'll excuse me just a moment -- have a message for you from your "niece", sir
My what
The young lady staying in your room
Edward's eyes narrow
He hangs up the phone
think we both know she's not my niece
Mr
Thomas looks uncomfortable
(cont'd) Does this hotel have any problem with that
Mr
Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly
The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge
Thank you
He starts towards the lounge
Very intriguing young woman, Miss Vivian
His tone stops Edward in his tracks
(cont'd) Have a good evening, sir
And off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell transpired during the afternoon
- Edward enters the lounge
He looks around, not seeing Vivian
And suddenly his eyes go back to
the beautiful girl with the beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress at the piano bar
Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian rises, moves elegantly towards him
She smiles
You're late
Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so, without thinking: 'm sorry
You're forgiven
She waits expectantly
He holds out an arm
She takes it
- Vivian comes out of the ladies room
She walks forward past the '' station
She stops
She takes a breath
and then walks forward
-   - Vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant restaurant toward a far table
Her beauty and natural grace draw approving stares
She is like a queen moving through a ballroom
At a secluded table, Edward sits in conversation with two men
, in his early 70's, a bulky self-made millionaire industrialist
Sitting next to him is his son and second in command,  , a handsome man in his early thirties
All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table
David Kross holds out Vivian's chair for her
Surprised, she nods her thanks
In front of her is an enormous placesetting
She smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence
Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of them
Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork
But then she sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and is digging into his salad with that
Vivian looks to see what Edward will do
He doesn't seem interested in eating yet
Neither does David Kross
Feeling a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down
So young man,  understand you are trying to take over my company
moment
The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for a moment
But then he almost smiles
Please don't patronize me, Mr
Kross
Our ages mean nothing here
Kross and David look at each other
Mr
Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock
We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share
Twenty-five percent
Mr
Harris,  built Kross Enterprises myself
know every man who ever worked there by his first name
know their wives
and their children
If your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again
Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins to eat
Relieved, Vivian picks up hers
They all eat for a moment
What do you suggest, Mr
Kross
approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put down the next course
Vivian, thinking she's got to finish, quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad
She is reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork
What would it take to buy our stock back
Name your price
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what  paid
But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract
Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares
We would give you a promissory note
You're not getting any navy contracts
Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this news
There's no way you could know that
But  do know
also know your lines of credit are over-extended
If  don't buy your company, someone else will
(looking up) Ah, the escargot
Escargot are put down in front of everyone
Vivian stares at them dubiously
She picks up what she assumes is the next "right" fork
She picks up a snail
The two do not fit
Flustered, she doesn't know what to do
No one else seems to be eating
And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks at each place
Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief
(softly, to the Waiter) Scume me, what are these things
(bending to whisper) Escargot, mademoiselle
(leaning close to whisper) Snails
Vivian stares at them, horrified
She, like James and David Kross, no longer seem interested in eating
Edward eats with pleasure
Mr
Kross, 'm not here to sell you my stock
On the contrary, 'm here to buy yours
(angry) You've got a lot of nerve
No
What  have is a lot of money
know all about you, Mr
Harris
When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing
Even the pension funds are stripped clean
The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks
(calmly) What  did with those companies was perfectly legal
don't question the legality of what you do
It's your morality that makes me sick will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you
(angry now) It is not your company
It's a public company
And  am going to acquire it
Either  buy from the other stock holders, or  buy from you
Vivian struggles with her escargot
(cont'd) would suggest that you and your board cooperate with me, rather than fight a battle you don't have the ammunition to win
Vivian suddenly  her snail across the table
Everyone looks to her
Slippery little suckers
Kross rises
If you'll excuse me young lady, Mr
Harris
(turns to David) Deal with this, David, you know where we stand
need to go someplace and puke
He rises
He exits
(to Edward and Vivian) Men like my father built this country
He was no saint
He screwed people
But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job
Edward is silent
He seems like a nice man
David looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time
We can reach an understanding on this
don't think so
You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have
Do what you have to do
don't take it personally
do
take it all very personally
(to Vivian) Very nice meeting you, Vivian
David Kross gets up and leaves
Vivian and Edward sit in silence
(a beat) And that's the way the game is played
Some game
Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement
Edward says nothing
But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve
Snails for dinner
No wonder everybody is in such a bad mood
Waiter appears at the table
Are we ready for the next course, sir
No
Bring a check, please
- Edward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of the glass window down at the city lights
He quickly drains his champagne glass
Vivian moves to stand next to him
She refills his glass from the bottle
Thank you
He drinks
Silence
You're upset, huh
Upset
No
never get upset about business
You liked the guy, though
Whether  liked him or not is irrelevant
It's business
There's no emotion involved in business
if you want to survive
(excited) We're the exactly the same
Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal
The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when 'm with a guy, 'm a robot, just do it
(realizing what she's saying and quickly recovers) Except with you
At your price give my all
Edward laughs
(cont'd) Let's not talks about this heavy stuff
Come on, relax
Vivian comes up behind him
She begins to rub his shoulders
That
is very good
moment
Edward is silent
Turns him, unknots his tie, unbuttons his collar
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then
We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza
We're gonna eat it in bed
We're gonna veg' out and watch television
Television
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound
You don't have to use your brain at all
have work to do
Uh-uh
No work
Smiling, she softly kisses his throat
(cont'd) See
what you haven't figured out yet
She kissed his neck
She fumbles with his belt
(cont'd) Is that while you're the boss everyplace else
'm the one in charge here
She kisses his chest
(cont'd) You
just think you are
She starts to kneel down
He stops her
They stare at one another for a moment
He releases her
She smiles
She starts to undress him
- Vivian is asleep
She turns over, slowly waking
Her hand goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed
Vivian comes awake with a sudden start
She look around momentarily frightened, not sure where she is
Sighing with relief, she lies back down
She sees Edward's American Express card on the pillow next to her
(
) Wake up, Vivian
Time to shop
Edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed
He is tying his tie
Vivian sits up and ties it for him
He smiles at her
still don't understand why you only bought one dress
wasn't as much fun as thought it was going to be
Why not
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you
It works
Was someone rude to you
had a little problem in one store
wasn't dressed right
don't know what to say
don't belong there
Maybe 'll just go back to Bridget
She was cool
Vivian, you belong wherever you are
don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you
Edward sits on the bed
(cont'd) People aren't going to respect you unless you respect yourself
(a beat) The next time someone is rude to you, you stare at them right here
He softly touches her, right between the eyes
(cont'd) It's an old trick  use, especially with bankers
Works every time
Will you try it
(confidently) Okay
Good
(a beat) Come with me
Edward looks at his watch
Vivian covers it with her hand
Please
- beautiful, chic women's shop
The haughty approaches Vivian near a rack of dresses
Edward hovers in the b
g
(nervous) Hello
Can you help me
The Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down
Pause
Vivian gives her "the stare" and straightens up
We see the Salesgirl's reaction change
(confidently) 'm looking for a dress, nothing too flashy, not too sexy, conservative
In a size six
(uncomfortable under Vivian's stare) Do
do you have a charge account with us
Vivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card
The Salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to find Vivian's size
-  - Vivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the Salesgirl's supervision
Vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low cut, spangled and fringed outfit
Edward shakes his hand
The Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit
Vivian scowls
(sighing) look like fucking Nancy Reagan
- The Salesgirl shows Edward clothes by Ann Taylor
He turns to find Vivian happily holding up a tiny, low cut leather dress
Edward shakes his head in mock disapproval
Vivian scowls
-   - Vivian is wearing an elegant pastel dress
Edward is standing at the store's bar, watching and talking on the telephone
'  -  - Stuckey and Vance are pouring over stock reports, talking to Edward on the speaker phone
Kross came out of his corner swinging
He started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened
(almost to himself) He's a tough old son of a bitch
Edward is watching Vivian
She pulls the hem of her skirt up to mid thigh
She looks hopefully over to Edward
Edward shakes his head
It's up to ten and a quarter
Offer nine and a half
Bring them back down to earth
Goddamit
Where is he getting the money to fight
Someone's loaning it to him
Get on it right away
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds
There's another forty million there
We can bleed'm dry
There is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes
He watches as Vivian tries on a hat
She preens for him
He smiles
(to Vance & Stuckey) Put the pension funds on hold until  say otherwise
(surprised) We're letting them slide
want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now
But, Edward
Do it
Edward hangs up and takes a long look at Vivian
She moves to him
(looks at his watch) You're on your own now, Vivian
've got to get to work
Be sensible and you can keep everything
Spend too much and it all goes back
Vivian hugs him again
- Vivian walks along Rodeo Drive
She looks lovely in the pink dress and new, white shoes
pretty, white hat is the final touch
She carries a bag containing her old clothes
She stops at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away
- We  Vivian in each department within the store with different
She happily and confidently tries on a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc
1)  Vivian is in a dressing stall
She tosses a dress out to a waiting
Not me
2)    holds a long, purple evening gown
(imitating Bridget) Horrid
3)  Vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps
Her attention is drawn to the ' exotic hand-painted tie
Where'd you get your tie
4)  Vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the Salesman, a dozen wild, swirling designed ties are hanging over his outstretched arm
Vivian picks out the brightest one and smiles
- Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags
She feels like she owns the block
well-dressed  passes by, smiling politely
Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores him
Suddenly Vivian stops
She's about to pass the shop she was thrown out of
Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop
- Vivian enters
The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's courage leaves her
The saleswoman is waiting on a
(to the customer) Isn't this lovely
think it would look wonderful on you
Vivian musters her courage
She takes a deep breath and starts forward
(to her customer) Would you like to try it on
'Scume me
Both the saleswoman and her customer look up
The saleswoman smiles pleasantly
Yes
Do you remember me
No, 'm sorry,  don't
was in here yesterday
Vivian slowly raises her middle finger
The recognition starts to dawn in the saleswoman's eyes
Vivian's courage begins to return
Yeah
That's right
It's me
want you to know something
You made me feel terrible wasn't dressed right and you said didn't belong here
Well, do
You're the one that was wrong, not me
And  want to tell you something else
'm never gonna shop here again as long as live
And with that, Vivian turns and walks out
The saleswoman is stunned
beat
The customer thrusts the dress into the saleswoman's arm as if offended by Vivian's speech and leaves the store also
- Mr
Thomas looks up from the desk
And stares
Vivian and a stroll through the hotel entrance and across the hotel lobby to the elevator
The bellhop's arms are packed with boxes and shopping bags
Mr
Thomas can't help it
He smiles to himself
- Vivian opens the front door for the Bellhop who carries in her packages
She motions for him to place them on the couch
He does
Vivian happily tips him with a five dollar bill
He exits
The door closes
Wheee
Vivian does a giddy spin and falls onto the couch
- Stuckey enters
Edward is standing at the end of a long meeting table
He is serving himself coffee from a tray
(gloating) You were right
Kross mortgaged everything he has down to his grandson's college tuition to secure loans from a bank
Not just any bank
One we do business with
Edward just sips his coffee
(cont'd) It goes without saying that your business means a great deal more to them than our friend Kross's
(a beat) All you have to do is make a call
Edward is silent
Stuckey is again surprised
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week
First, you go soft on the pension funds
Now, you're giving him the chance to get away
As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars -- Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved
It's my money
And some of it's mine
Edward, his jugular's exposed
Edward hesitates
Then: Get the bank on the phone for me
- Edward enters
He closes the door
He turns
And stops beautiful, candlelit, food laden table has been set up in the middle of the room
Champagne and wine chills in a bucket
fire burns in the fireplace
Music is playing
(
) Hi
Edward turns
And stares again
Vivian stands in the bedroom doorway
She is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown
She looks incredibly beautiful
thought maybe you'd like dinner
Thank you
would
(he fingers her dressing gown) Nice
Wait till you see what  have on underneath
Please
She opens the dressing gown
What she has on underneath is absolutely nothing
Edward crosses to her
Taking her in his arms, he lifts her up and kisses her breasts
What about dinner
Dinner can wait
- The bathroom is lit by candles
Vivian and Edward are in the marble tub
Vivian sits behind Edward
She lazily washes his shoulders and back with a large sponge
You always been rich
No
Seems like it
guess it's easy to get used to, huh
Easier than learning how to be poor
(a moment; and then:) My father's family was wealthy
When  was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies
But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman
And he took his money with him
Silence
Keep talkin'
like hearin'
Not much to tell
went to public school
Went to university on scholarship
Went to work for an investment firm
In eight years  owned it
(and then; growing very quiet) My father was chairman of the board of the third company  ever went after
swallowed that company and shit out the pieces
One of the pieces was him
Vivian softly traces small patterns on Edward's shoulders with a finger
You still mad at'm
He died a long time ago
She gently rests her head on his back
- People are sunbathing by the pool
Overweight
lobster red
old and stretch-marked
fishy white
and then gorgeous
The gorgeous is Vivian
She is wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses
(
) Miss Vivian
She looks up
young , looking a little dry-mouthed at the sight of her, is holding a telephone
You have a call
Mr
Harris
(taking the phone) Hi, baby
(a moment) 'll be ready
Bye
She hangs up
She looks at the Waiter, confused
What do you wear to polo
- Horses and riders crash and careen on the playing field
An enthusiastic crowd cheers
a tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in progress
Horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very well-dressed, successful-looking people -- celebrities, execs, socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game
They are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo match
- Vivian and Edward make their way towards the party
Edward is wearing his new tie
Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful in one of her new outfits
Not that it's helping -- the place, the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her overwhelmed
She suddenly stops
You're really pushing it, bringing me here
think it's exciting
What id we run into someone know
really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard
You did
calls out
(
) Edward
They turn
William Stuckey is with a group of people
He waves them over
(cont'd) Come on
Over here
Edward takes Vivian's arm and leads her forward
- Stuckey grins and shakes Edward's hand
(looking at Vivian) Well, well, well
Vivian dislikes this guy on sight
Dislikes the frosty looking woman at his side
Bill, 'd like you to meet Vivian
(holding out a hand; smiling) Bill Stuckey, Vivian
My wife, Elizabeth
Hi
Elizabeth Stuckey stretches her thin lips in a cold smile
Lots of fun people here
Let me get you two some champagne
He moves quickly away
Excuse me
She moves to greet someone else
Vivian and Edward survey the milling
(sarcastic) Real genuine guy
He's good at what he does
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass
She anything like your ex
(a small smile) Shall we mingle
-    - goal is scored
Edward watches and guides her, Vivian sips champagne and meets and chats and wins over different
-   - group of
simply love your dress, Vivian
This old thing
Of course, a figure like yours can wear anything
You must work out constantly
lead a very physical life
Are you into running, Vivian
'm into walking
walk a lot
-   - In another group of
You look awfully familiar, Vivian
Haven't we run into one another at the spa in La Costa
Well,  do often spa there
-   - Edward and Elizabeth Stuckey watch Vivian laugh and chat with a group of
Edward, she's marvelous
Warm and witty and down to earth
(with pleasure) She is, isn't she
So unlike your usuals
Where on earth did you find her
Edward smiles enigmatically
Taking an hors d'oeuvres off a passing 's tray, he starts forward
-   - We're good together
He has to admit it
've been just what he wants me to be
say the right things,  know the right people,  give wonderful parties
No question, no arguments, no embarrassments
It works for both of us
That makes Vivian think
And then she smiles as she sees Edward approaching
Vivian moves to him
Edward, these women here,  don't think any of'm like the guys they're with
They're just into it for the money
'm sure that's true for some of them
thought  was the pro
These women make me feel like an amateur
(a beat) Ready to stomp sod
-    - The  engages in sod stomping
They drink champagne
They make a dance out of it
They laugh
Shoes get stuck in the mud
It's ludicrous -- these people in their suits and fancy clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit
In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in disbelief
Vivian is having a wonderful time
And then, as she moves towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses
David Kross smiles at Vivian
She hesitates
and then she crosses towards him
-   - Hi
Hi
never thought stomping in grass could be so much fun
(laughs) like your hat
Huh
Oh
yeah
'okay
(pleased; a moment) Uhm
how're
business things going
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing
Come on, 'll show you Thunder
Please, we hardly know each other
Thunder's a horse
Come on
-   - They approach the sweating mount
David Kross caresses the horses muzzle
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet
am
This is Vivian
(a beat; and then:) You two been together long
You and Edward
No
Hope to be
To Vivian's surprise, the question causes a pang inside
It's
it's not like that
see
Well
Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then
Vivian is suddenly silent
She looks away
(cont'd) 'm sorry, am  being too forward
You don't know anything about me
'd like to find out
You don't know anything about me either
That's why people have lunch
But something holds Vivian back, a feeling
-    - William Stuckey turns
stops
stares
He sees Vivian and David Kross standing together
He stares, his mind racing, and anxious, angry look on his face
- Stuckey has Edward off to the side
He is talking to him in a low, earnest voice
Fill me in on this
How'd you and Vivian meet
We just did
(grinning) Come on, you can tell me
sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this
The night  left your house, was lost
was looking for directions
And you just happened to run into her
Great
What's she do
She work
Yes
Doing what
Vivian's in sales
Sales, really
That's great
What does she sell
Edward's eyes narrow
Why do you want to know
Hear me out
've known you a long time
see a difference in you this week
Like that tie
'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference
Especially when  see her talking with David Kross
- Vivian turns away from the bar, now holding two glasses of champagne
She scans the crowd for Edward
- She met him at dinner last night
like this tie
So now they're best friends
Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now  see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy
It's too convenient
You're being ridiculous
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous
Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker
picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard
- as she hear loud sudden
She turns
She sees that it's Stuckey laughing
Smiling, Vivian starts towards them with two glasses of champagne
- swear to God, you are the only millionaire  ever heard of who'd go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker
Edward sees Vivian coming
Let's drop it, shall we
Edward turns
He smiles gently as Vivian quietly approaches and hands him his glass of champagne
group of  are standing a short distance away
One of them calls out: Edward
May we have your opinion on something
(to Vivian and Stuckey) Excuse me a moment
He moves to join the group of men
Stuckey gives Vivian a broad smile
Having a good time, Vivian
Yeah
Thanks
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard
Vivian looks as if she's been struck
What
It's okay
Edward told me
Your secret's safe with me
Stuckey runs his hand up her arm
(cont'd) What do you charge, Vivian
Maybe you and  could get together after Edward leaves
(forcing a bitter smile) Yeah
Sure
Why not
Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire
just might do that
He moves away
Vivian turns
Edward looks up from his conversation, sees her looking at him
He smiles, raises his glass in a small toast
moment
Vivian toasts him back
- They enter
Edward switches on a light
Vivian comes down the steps into the room
Edward follows after her
You're awfully quiet
You haven't said a word since the party
As Edward touches her shoulder, Vivian suddenly spins and explodes with anger
You asshole
can't believe what a --
Vivian, what the -- Tears well in Vivian's eyes as she yells at him
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh
What are you trying to prove
'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends
don't know what you're talking about
've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but 've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight
Would you please calm down
Tell me what happened
Stuckey
He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave
You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own
Edward looks guiltily away
What was  supposed to do
(a beat) told the truth
Why should the truth upset you
It's not as if you're from a convent
want my fucking money
'm getting out of here
don't want anything more to do with you
Can we talk about this
Can you just try to calm down
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason 'm with you is for the money
tear falls from Vivian's eyes
(defiantly) Well, it's true
Just pay me what you owe me and 'm gone
Vivian
Pay me
Before  pick up this chair and smash your face in
Fine
'm only here a couple of more days and 'm not going to spend them fighting with you
Fuck off
'll call you a cab
If you want the clothes, pack them up
Vivian stands quietly for a moment
And then she turns and walks into the bedroom
- Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light of the bedroom
As she does she starts crying
With each item of clothing the tears come down harder
Edward appears at the doorway
His face is genuinely concerned
Vivian
'm sorry
wasn't prepared for questions about us
It was an idiotic and insensitive thing  did
should have known that it would hurt you
'm not hurt
It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off
really am sorry
Vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms
Sobbing, she stands limply
You hurt me
Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders
She touches his hand
He sits on the bed
He pulls her to him and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight
'll make it up to you
- Edward, carrying a briefcase, moves jauntily down a long hallway
Stuckey trails after him
This is no time to disappear
We're in too far
Bill
Stop panicking
Kross isn't going anywhere and  don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down
'll be in the office tomorrow
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then
Goodbye, Bill
Stuckey stops
He calls after Edward
Shit
By tomorrow, Edward
Edward hurries on
- Edward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors
- Edward smiles, moving jauntily to the elevators
Mr
Thomas at the front desk notices Edward's happy mood
Good afternoon, Mr
Harris
Afternoon
Edward's attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display in the hotel jewelry store window
He detours from the elevators and moves to the window for a closer look
He thinks a moment and enters the jewelry store
- Vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing an elegant red sequined evening dress
She looks incredibly beautiful
She sees the phone
thought occurs to her and going to it, she picks it up
Waits
'mon, Kit
No answer
She hears someone at the door
She hangs up
Edward enters
He is carrying a small case
He stops at the sight of Vivian
Do  look okay
(a small smile) Hmm
let's see
no, there's something missing
He holds up the small case
What's that
don't want you to get too excited
these are on loan
however
Vivian's jaw drops
Edward is holding a diamond and ruby necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he breathed too hard
Edward behind Vivian, fastens the necklace around her neck
This is made for a princess
think she'd approve of you wearing it tonight
There
Come look
He leads her to a mirror
She stares at her reflection
Edward,  can't
Shush
Of course you can
What if  lose it
You won't
What if someone tries to steal it
'll guard them and you with my life
- limo pulls onto the tarmac at Burbank Airport
in a leather jacket and sunglasses hurries forward to open the limo door
Edward -- now wearing evening clothes -- and Vivian climbs out of the limo
Your plane is ready to go, Mr
Harris
Very good
Plane
Taking her arm, Edward leads her across the tarmac
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you
don't
Where are you taking me
To meet some friends
Rudolpho, a poet
Benoit, a landlord
Mimi, a flower maker
Huh
The opera
Up ahead is a waiting private jet, its engines already
She is speechless
Edward grins, loving the look on her face
- The corporate jet takes off down the landing strip
- Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet
Vivian can't believe the cabin
It is a comfortable room featuring a long couch that curves across two walls, built in bar, television and stereo
Edward is once again, going over papers
've never been on a plane before
'm glad you like it
Now be quiet, 've really got to read these
Vivian fluffs her hair up
She makes a happy, excited growling sound -- Rrrrr
wicked gleam comes to her eye
She walks over to Edward and stands in front of him
He looks up
She parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken quarters
She begins to unfasten the garters one at a time
Vivian, what do you think you're doing
Edward watches silk stockings slide down Vivian's lovely legs
Being quiet
She reaches out and gently caresses Edward's face
Edward sets down his papers
- The setting sun casts an incredibly glow over the city and the coast
(
) You ever been in love with anyone
- Vivian is at the window, looking out
She carefully puts her earrings back on
She stares, mesmerized by the skyline, the golden gate bridge in the distance
She turns
Edward is buttoning his shirt
He is silent
Sorry
You're not paying me to ask you question like that
Vivian
'm paying you to be you
Be you
(a beat) Have you
Ever been in love with anyone
You mean, besides Elvis
(turning back to the window) 'm a human being
Sure
Once
First time  ever ran away from home,  got as far as Atlanta
met this boy
He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago
They stopped at a gas station
He went to the john
When he came back they'd split
We sorta started looking out for each other
Aw, he was sweet
And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes
The chicken hawks were on him all the time
He hated that
Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things
The two of us getting married someday
Having kids
Stupid stuff
What happened to him
moment
Vivian shrugs
My father found me
Dragged me home
don't know why, he never seemed to like me much when  was there
(a bitter smile) 'Cept when he was drunk, then he liked me a whole lot
(a moment) made it back to Atlanta a year later
Andy was gone
Silence
Vivian stares out the window
Aw, but things sure look fine when you're sitting way up high
Edward moves close to Vivian and putting an arm around her shoulders, stares with her out at the view
Vivian rests her head against him
- An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco Opera House
The  walks around back and opens the passenger door
Edward emerges and helps Vivian out
- Edward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through the elegant lobby
Some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but  don't believe it
You can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time
They either love it or hate it
Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it
Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit fountain with several graceful statues in its center
Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed  and prosperous looking
It makes her nervous
Without realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace
She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and steal it
Viv
really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it
Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands
-   - crowd of  mill around the lobby, heading toward their seats
Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes -- curious, even envious looks from the , appreciative glances from the
Her hands again rises nervously to her necklace
They all think you look very beautiful, Vivian
Vivian gives him a grateful look
Relaxing, she lowers her hand from the necklace
With a flourish, he offers his arm
She takes it
They start forward
- Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the stage
If it's in Italian, how will know what they're saying
'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you
But you'll be surprised how much you understand
The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words
But don't they have it in English
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know
That's the fun of it
The lights dim
(resigned) Okay
Even if  hate it, 'm glad you brought me
The orchestra begins to play
Vivian's eyes focus intensely on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her
- -   is performed
The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face
Edward leans over to translate the tenor's aria
What am
am a poet
Not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams
You have come to replace my vanished dreams
dwell now only in your eyes
The  ebbs and swells
The sets and costumes change
The story continues
Edward again leans close to Vivian
And now she asks Rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful -- Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth
Her eyes are fixed on the stage
She doesn't need his help
The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is reaching its tragic climax
Her lips tremble
Her eyes fill with tears
Edward glances at her
He studies her a long moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face
Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand
As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it
- As the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined mascara
She sighs, happy
The  in the next box smile at her
Did you enjoy the opera, dear
(tearfully) It was so beautiful  just about pissed my pants
Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he and the still misty Vivian exit
-  - Edward and Vivian sit side by side
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, 'm not sure 'd have believed you
more than liked it
know
'm glad
Did you
Yes
've never enjoyed it more
Thank you
Vivian looks at him a moment
And then, leaning slowly forward she kisses him gently on the mouth
He looks at her surprise
He puts his arms around her and kisses her back
It is the first time they've kissed and they make it very special
- The plane flies in the night
Back to
- Edward and Vivian make love
Equally giving, equally taking
No masks, no shields
-  - In the darkened bedroom, Edward and Vivian lie together
Edward cradles Vivian
Her back rests against his chest
His arm is over her body
She takes Edward's hand in her hands and carefully examines it; marveling at the fingers, the tiny hairs on the back
She gently kisses the palm
Love you
She clutches Edward's hand tightly to her breast
She closes her eyes, ready to sleep now
-    - His eyes open
Vivian's whispered endearment has filled with him with sudden confusion and uncertainty
He stares into the dark, wondering what to do with the woman in his arms
-   - The phone rings
Edward immediately reaches out and picks it up
He is dressed in a robe
Breakfast is on the umbrella'd table in front of him
Yes
'  - -  - Stuckey, not even dressed yet, paces around his desk
Did  wake you
'm up
had to call
jus got off the phone with James Kross
Get this
He wants to see you
Today
Why
He wouldn't say
Edward think we got him
His nuts are on the block and we got him
(silence) You there
Give me twenty minutes
We'll be there
Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office
want him to commit his stock to us this morning
Edward hangs up
His mind seems on other things
He rises
- Vivian is still asleep
She is face down on the bed, the sheets just covering her to her waist
Edward stares down at her
He gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line of her spine
Vivian murmurs contentedly
Mmm
(opening her eyes; looking at him) Hi
Edward smiles at her softly
And then: Better get dressed
We're having guests
- Vivian is wearing her yellow dress
She stares at herself in the bedroom mirror
Her hair
her make-up
she realizes how different she is now, realizes that she likes it
Edward comes out of the bathroom
He crosses to the closet for a tie
Here
Let me
She comes over, starts to tie his tie for him
He is very aware of the closeness of her
She smiles at him
He smiles; puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment
Looking up, she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes
He releases her hand
(quietly) One more night and you're finally rid of me
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take
have to go to New York tomorrow
Vivian says nothing
(cont'd) But 'll be back in Los Angeles
Soon
'd like to see you again
thought we could work out something
An arrangement
Vivian is silent
(cont'd) 'll get you an apartment, buy you a car -- Vivian sighs, letting something go inside
Finished with his tie, she turns away
(cont'd) What is it
(not unkindly) What else
You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town
It wouldn't be like that
want to get you off the street
You'll have a different kind of life
What's wrong with that
'm sorry
That's very sweet, Edward, and  know you mean it
She is silent
Vivian, 've thought about this a lot
This is the best solution
(shakes her head "no," then continues tying his tie) When  was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when was bad, which was pretty often
'd stare out the window up there and make believe  was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen
Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up
Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off
but never, ever in all the times  had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, 'll put you up in a great condo
" She finished his tie
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale
(softly; to herself) know
(a beat) Hey, don't mind me
'm being stupid
(more) 'll think about it, okay
It's a real good offer for a whore
've never treated you like a whore
(not mean) You just did
The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room
- Edward enters the living room
Vivian slowly enters behind him
Edward opens the front door
Mr
Kross slowly enters
He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask his surprise
Mr
Harris
How are you, Mr
Kross
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights
'll get used to it
An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father
Stuckey brings up the rear
Edward and David give one another perfunctory nod
Stuckey smugly winks at Edward
Edward closes the door and leads them all down the stairs
Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance
He gently nods at Vivian
Young lady
Hello
(to David) Hi
Hello, Vivian
Let's not waste time here, shall we
Mr
Kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with Mr
Harris
Mr
Harris is now listening
Kross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone
He turns to Edward
Yes
'm here to tell you that 've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer
Expected
offer
Of course, yes
After the expected filing period is over, 'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid
(a moment) You're making the right decision, sir
Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward
He is surprised to see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face
Edward is silent
Kross interprets his silence as second thoughts
'll see you on one condition
'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me
Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man
(quickly) They'll be taken care of
Won't they, Edward
Kross ignores Stuckey
He looks to Edward
Edward slowly nods
'll sign anything you want then
Today
Kross nods tiredly
His voice is very soft
Today
Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom, obviously upset
The men all watch her go
Edward hesitates
He turns to Kross: Excuse me, please
He heads to the bedroom
- Vivian is sitting on the bed, on the phone
Hello
Is Kit DeLuca there
When she comes in will you have her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000
Yes
Okay
She hangs up as Edward comes in
What did you do to him
What do you mean
Last time  saw him he was this strong guy
Now he's beaten
And you liked him
Vivian,  want you to listen to me
The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated
Right
It's not your concern
It's
business, that's all
Business
Yes
The man made a business decision
It's all just business to you
Him
Me
Your life
Everything's business
It's what  do for a living
It's how  make money
Silence
'll be back in a few hours
We'll talk about this later
- Edward enters the living room
The men look at him expectantly
We'll continue this down at the office
He heads for the door
- Vivian stands at the railing, unhappily looking out at the city beyond
The phone
She turns and hurries inside
- Vivian answers the phone
Lo
-  - Mr
Thomas is standing behind the front desk, a rather strained expression on his face
Barnard Thomas here
Miss Vivian,  wonder if you might come down to the front desk
There's someone here to see you
Me
'd send them up, but sadly, don't trust the young lady to find you on her own
hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from Mr
Thomas
Kit, heavy make-up, skimpy outfit, chewing gum, cigarette and all, keeps her voice just below a bellow
Viv
Where are you, babe
(glaring at Mr
Thomas) The sphincter-police won't let me through
- Kit finishes slurping on a big, frosty ice cream soda
She smacks her lips like a happy, little girl
Vivian isn't having anything
Yes, 'm glad you're clean but 've been calling and calling
Was that you
Who did you think
Carlos
still owe him two hundred bucks
Kit,  left that money for you days ago
Yeah
just got it
An   walk past the table
They stare at Kit
Fifty bucks, grampa
For seventy-five, the wife can watch
Horrified, the elderly couple hurry away
Kit
Everybody keeps starin' at me
Yeah
know what you mean
What do you know
You look good
All dressed up
(meaning it) You clean up real nice
(giggling) You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do
Not that you ever did anyway
You think  fit here where they just about chew your food for you
Where do you fit
Vivian is silent, then
(suddenly) kissed him, Kit
On the mouth
Honey, you're not supposed to do that
know
stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real
Oh, my god, you mean it was good
(miserably) It was great
Dummy
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money
pray for that
(nods) All 'm doing is feeling lousy about it
don't know what to do
What do  do, Kit
Go for the bucks
don't care about bucks
(a beat) might love this guy
Wow, are you in deep shit
(a sigh) You know he'll break your heart
Vivian is silent again
(cont'd) blame myself here
First time laid eyes on ya',  knew you were too complicated to be a whore
Vivian nods
Her face is filled with confusion
-   - Edward stands at the window looking out
There is something about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of the story
Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm
He begins laying them out on the conference table
Congratulations, sir
What
Mr
Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker
It's finished
You've won
Edward says nothing
Who are you going after next, sir
Who indeed
He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter the room
They surround a conference table
Kross sits, the papers laid out in front of him
Stuckey hands Kross a pen
lays out finger food
They wait for her to leave before they speak
If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now
Mr
Harris and  would like to ask you some questions about your company
Dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate
You're under no obligation to answer any questions at all
Could we at least wait till after the filing period
Stuckey glances to Edward for help
Edward is silent; indeed it's as if something is twisting inside of him
Stuckey plunges ahead
Mr
Harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth
The price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid
The more we know, the higher our bid can be
It's in my best interest to cooperate, David
If he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh
David stares at him
That's unfair
You bed it is
(to Edward) You're everything he said you were
(to his father) Do what you have to do, Dad
Just don't expect me to watch it
He exits
moment
Kross looks at Edward with a resigned smile
He's young
He hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet
'll sign your papers
And 'll answer your questions
Whatever you want
He sighs
He picks up the pen
He's about to sign
Stop
For just a moment
(a moment) Mr
Kross, 'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign
You realize that you're a target
If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct
Yes
If you had a
reprieve, what would do
(quickly) don't think there's any sense in -- Let him answer
would take advantage of it
How
Kross looks uncertain
He gropes for an answer
don't know
There
there wasn't time
suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you
The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that
Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckey's eyes
Oh, my god
Edward, no
suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you
Have you lost your mind
(to Stuckey) Quiet
(to Edward) Would  get the loans
This time  imagine you would, yes
(as if thinking about it) Hmm
(a moment) With all this in mind, Mr
Kross, can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can
(a small smile) You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr
Harris
You're very right
think the best thing we could all do is go home
What
Have a good day, gentlemen
He exits from the room
Stuckey follows
- Edward is walking down the hall
Stuckey comes out of the office and calls after him
(calls) Edward, what happened
What kind of move was that
Edward silently goes into the elevators
The doors close
(yells) Dammit Edward, speak to me
Stuckey heads back to the conference room
- Edward comes out of the building
His Chauffeur leaps to open the limo door
No
take the car back to the hotel
need to walk
He sets off across Century Park East
- Vivian is in the living room, pacing, edgy, the doorbell rings
She turns
It rings again
She opens it
Stuckey is standing outside with a small briefcase
He looks agitated
He tries to hide it
Well, well
Hello again
'm looking for Edward
Vivian just stares at him
Edward's not back
thought he was with you
Stuckey walks past her and down the steps into the living room
No, 'll just have to wait then, won't
There is a bar set up
Stuckey sets his briefcase down
He crosses to the bar
(cont'd) Mind if  have a drink
No
He pours liquor in a glass
He fires it down
It seems to calm him a bit
Do you want to know what he did
Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did
He handed the whole thing back to Kross
On a silver platter
For no reason
What was he thinking, mean, what was going through his goddam head
Why
(pours another drink) What was all that benevolent crap
What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation
'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities
think it's great
Stuckey glares at Vivian
bet
lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal
(mocking) Aw, come on, Bill
It's just business
He looks at her a moment
But what do  know, maybe you're worth it
Come on, show me
Let's see your act
He grabs her wrist
Get out
Don't worry
'll pay for it
What a you charge
Huh
Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe
Are you a fifty dollar whore
He tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top of him
Are you crazy
She bites his hand
Stuckey slaps her
Vivian starts flailing back
But Stuckey is too strong
Vivian staggers back at the force of another slap
Stuckey slams her up against a wall and starts rubbing up against her
You got a mean streak in you, don't you
He tries to kiss her again
(cont'd) Is that what he likes about you
Huh
Answer me
And suddenly a  lands on Stuckey's shoulder
Stuckey turns his head, startled
-   - '
Edward, murder in his eyes, belts Stuckey across the room
-  - Stuckey falls on the ground
Edward rushes forward, berserk with rage, to hit Stuckey again
His fist hits the top of Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull
Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom
Again Stuckey tries to rise
Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into the bar
Glasses and bottles  to the floor
Stuckey again tries to rise
And collapses
Edward rubs his fist
They're not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting
You broke my nose
think  broke my hand
(a beat) You're fired
Edward, we've been together ten years
And  don't like what we've become
'll cover any losses you have on this one
Now get out, you asshole
All this because of that whore
Yes
Edward pushes Stuckey out the door and throws his briefcase after him
Edward, think about what you're -- Edward slams the door in his face
Edward stands there, reflecting on what he's done
(to himself, almost proud) Well,  didn't plan that
-  - Edward holds an icepack to Vivian's cheek
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman
Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode
What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how
It pisses me off
Not all men hit
And no one is going to hit you anymore
Right
(softening) You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'
(a beat) heard what you did with Kross
It was a business decision
Vivian looks at him
got tired of hating my father
(a small smile) It was good
It felt good
Edward looks on the bed at her suitcases
You're packing
(nods) 'm leaving
(a moment) Don't ya see
If  stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that
thinkin' they're allowed to
What are you gonna do, fight'm all
No
'll take my money now, please
moment
Edward reaches for his wallet
He counts out bills
He places them in Vivian's suitcase
He puts his arms around Vivian
Aw, don't
no
Stay with me tonight
Not because you're being paid to
Stay with me because you want to
do
do want to
That's why 'm leaving
(turning to him) That's what you given me, see
know what  want now
want a guy like you for real
Not because you buy me things and give me money
The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand
You gonna give me that
Edward is silent
didn't think so
Vivian
It's not your fault
You're right
Kit's right
(looks him right in the eye) But  want the fairy tale
- Vivian comes out of the elevators
sees her and springs forward, reaching for her bags
Let me take those, miss
Thanks
Vivian sees Mr
Thomas behind the front desk
'll be out front in a minute
got a cab comin'
The bellman moves away
Vivian walks to the front desk
Hi, Barney
(looking up) Miss Vivian
Look  just wanted to say goodbye
Mr
Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow
Yeah, well,  check out today
You're not accompanying him to New York
(lightly) Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world
(a beat) You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr
Thomas
Certain ladies make that very easy
Vivian
(turning to the desk clerk) John, call a limousine for our guest, please
Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go
Bill the hotel
(turning back to Vivian) See you again sometime soon
Vivian smiles softly at him
She turns and walks for the door
- long silver limo drives down Hollywood Blvd
- The   pushes the button that rolls down the screen between back and front seats
You're sure this is the right street, ma'am
Yes
1312
It's a big apartment building
'   - The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment building on a dirty Hollywood side street
The Limo Driver, a large Latino man, steps out of the car and walks around to the passenger door
As he does, he surveys the surroundings uncomfortably
Ths is rough neighborhood
He opens the door
Vivian steps out
Maybe  should go with you
This doesn't look like a good place for a lady to be alone
Several  pass
All of them stare at the car, at the driver, at Vivian in her lovely clothes
'll be okay
'm home
Thank you
The driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the apartment building
He drives off
- Vivian walks toward her apartment
The Landlord is sitting at the front desk in a dirty undershirt
Hey, we announce guests here
You a relative of somebody
Vivian lowers her sunglasses
(cont'd) Viv -- is that you
Yeah, it's me
She keeps walking
You lookin' good, Viv'
Nice threads
gotta find time to shop
- Edward stands at the penthouse window, looking out
He is dressed now, ready for travel
There is something about his expression, his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw him at the very top of the story
enters from the bedroom, rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him
Is that everything, sir
(turning from the window) That's everything
The Bellman exits, closing the door behind him
The phone rings
Edward crosses to it, picks it up
The Maid comes in, looks around
The lady, she go
Yes
She go
- Edward with the Bellhop heads to the front door
He's leaving
Do you have a car taking you to the airport, sir
Yes
'  -  - Vivian, looking fresh scrubbed without make-up, is wearing clean jeans, a nice looking shirt and a suit jacket
Her bureau's are open
She is packing
Kit is watching
She takes the photo of her and Kit dressed up hot in hooker clothes and packs it
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco
Get a job and probably go back to school
Figure out what 'm gonna be
What kind of school
School, school
Regular
used to get pretty good grades in school, you know
So did
made it with the principal
(recites) Study hard And get a "
"  Lift your dress and an "" you'll see
They both laugh but too hard
Want a pair of boots
Do
Momma
Taking them, she sits on the bed and puts them on
You sure you won't come with me
And leave all this
Not in a million
They laugh together
(cont'd) What time's your bus
Couple a hours
Yeah
Well
gotta split
Goodbye's make me crazy
Cool your jets a second
(going to her purse) Here's some money
No
You took care of rent, that's enough
want to
For food, got it
Eat something before the wind blows you away
'm gonna pay you back next time see ya, babe
Just wait, 'm gonna do something real nice for you some day
They hug
(cont'd) Shit, 'm gettin' all weepy now
Kit begins backing out of the room
(cont'd) Take care of you, okay
Take care of you
Love ya
Kit turns and hurries out of the apartment
- Kit enters the falafel stand on Hollywood Boulevard
- Kit enters, sits at the counter
Coffee, Chan
And maybe a grilled cheese on white, okay
very young  is sitting just down the counter from Kit
Kit nods at her
Hey, how you doin'
You new, huh
Yeah
Got a cigarette
Sure
She passes the girl down the pack
She strikes a match, lights her cigarette for her
The girl inhales deep, lets it out with a sigh
She looks towards the window
Jeez, did the wacko in the suit
Kit turns to look
'
-
Outside, across the street, Edward has accosted two ; one blonde, one a red haired black one
-  - Kit rises
Chan
Keep the sandwich warm, 'll be back
She heads out the door
- Edward is still talking to the prostitutes
'm looking for a girl, Vivian, young, dark hair, big eyes
They shake their heads
She's mouthy
Sort of difficult
1 Ain't seen her, wouldn't know her
2 What's wrong with us, man
Two for the price a one, what ya say
(disappointed) Thank you
No
They turn and walk away
Edward stands there, not knowing what to do next
He looks discouraged and lost
(
) Edward Harris, as  live and breathe
Edward quickly turns to find Kit staring at him
Kit smiles, triumphantly
(cont'd) Yeah
Boy, you're just like she said
She turns and starts away
She stops, turns back
(cont'd) You comin' or not
don't got all day,  got a grilled cheese waitin'
Edward follows Kit
'  - Vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought
Her bags are packed, ready to go
With a sigh she rises
She picks up the bags, exits the room
Vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking it all in for the last time
She suddenly looks more than a little bit frightened to be leaving
She musters resolve
She goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her
Silence
Vivian suddenly comes back in
She puts down her bags
She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee can/piggy bank from the shelf
She puts some more bills into it, places it back where Kit will find it
She turns and starts again for the door
She stops
She hears something
An aria from La Boheme
Faint
Seemingly coming from nowhere
She dismisses it -- she's hearing things
She opens the door
Stops
The music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her imagination
She hurries over to the window
'   - Vivian comes out onto the fire escape
She stares in wonder
snow white limo comes up the street
necktie has been tied to the antennae like a knight's token
The  from La Boheme is  from the car's stereo
Edward is standing on the car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof
The wind blows at his hair
He is smiling
Everywhere on the street people are staring; the , the , the ', the
Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry
The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building
Vivian's landlord comes out the front door
His eyes go wide in disbelief
Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the sunroof
He leaps nimbly to the ground
He crosses to the entrance of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape
You are really lost this time
Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her
With a sudden cry of joy, Vivian comes down the fire escape
She stops at the bottom stair
Edward comes forward and sweeps her into his arms
They kiss
He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless
Her feet never touch the ground
The car door closes behind them
The limo drives away
The people of the street watch it go
