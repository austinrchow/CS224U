Written by Michael Hogan & Paul  Fix Story by Gordon Ray Young 1944 - -- station signboard
It reads: " " to show the dusty platform of a typical small Arizona town of the late nineties
platform  a line of sleeping figures, consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans and a mongrel dog
on the window of the ticket office
Inside the office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window
The clicking of the signal indicator is heard
The agent opens his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily
line of sleeping figures, with dog in f
g
The sound of a distant train whistle is heard o
s
The dog, which up to now might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera
railway track with the three-car train approaching
line of sleeping figures
The dog jumps up barking furiously and runs out of shot past camera
The sleeping figures come to life and look toward camera
At the same time, the door of the ticket office opens and the agent appears
railway track
The train is now almost at the station
- -- with the line of men now standing on the edge of the platform looking toward camera
Train steams slowly in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f
g
standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands
Behind Rocklin a conductor
baggage car
The baggageman is standing at the open door of the car with two sacks of mail
He drops them to the platform and waves to the conductor o
s
and begins to close the doors of the baggage car
on Station Agent and conductors
The latter signals the engineer
The train whistle sounds again o
s
and the shadow of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's face
As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene
The station bums look at Rocklin curiously
His expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again
At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly
(at office door) Expectin' someone
(after a second's pause) guess not
Where's the stagecoach office
(pointing) Back of the depot
- The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a sign -- Harolday Proprietor Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses
He pauses close to one horse's head
Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink
The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head
The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground
Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness
Old Dave rants and snorts -- beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally
(to horse) Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- jus' lookit what you done -- (some more pantomime) 'm tellin' you, Blossom that -- (indicating broken bottle) -- makes you the most aggravatin' female as ever  had a despise fer -- 've got a good notion to pizen you -- an' what's more -- He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has forgotten in his anger
most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view
He uncorks it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the bottle
(to Blossom) Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't
-- (chuckles) Fooled myself, too
who has been watching Dave's performance
He smiles his amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office
- Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble- lens glasses
During the scene, the character who picked up the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks on the counter and leaves
(to Rocklin) Howdy
(indicating stage) That the stage for Santa Inez
(nods) Leaving any minute
Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad of bills, drops them on the counter
The Stage Agent counts out the fare
Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty -- (returning the balance) Name
Rocklin
The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket
Rocklin takes some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances outside
Mind if  ride alongside the driver
(over his specs) It's all right with me -- if it's all right with Dave -- He's mad -- His last trip -- Had a row with Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss
(soberly) like grumpy old cusses -- Hope to live long enough to be one
(puzzled) Yeah
He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand
- The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of climbing up to the driver's seat
Here's your mail, Dave -- Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat
(as he steps up to the seat) -- and a passenger
Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down at him and asks rather wistfully -- Mind if  ride up here
Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does things first, then asks permission
His only answer to Rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough
And now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his pent-up wrath
Where's them wimmen
Up at the hotel
(yanking mail sack from Agent) Why ain't they here
-- This is the stage depot, ain't it --
(heaves sack into boot) Ain't it
You can pick 'em up there -- it's only up the street -- On'y up the street -- an' they cain't walk it -- What's the matter -- don't Easterners have laigs like other folks
Dave stalks around the rear of the coach
The Agent meantime stretches himself up toward Rocklin
(so Dave won't hear) Hold tight when you git in the mountains, mister -- When he gits riled you can hear the passengers prayin' for miles
Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away, leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously
- From the porch of the hotel
We see the stage approaching as the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from the hotel to the street
The coach pulls up and stops
(to handyman) Whar's them wimmen
-- They waitin' for you to carry 'em out
Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by someone calling his name from across the street
Meantime, an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow, etc
Rocklin buys bow and arrow
(as he comes to Dave) Dave -- Dave -- tell Arly Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet, will ya
(getting to the ground) ain't tellin' that crazy female nothin' -- Last time  seen her she threatened to rip the hide off'n me and bat me dizzy with it
Dave goes to the rear of the coach
(looks up to Rocklin) Mister -- will you tell the Agent at Santa Inez to tell Miss Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet
(nods) 'll say that
Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk
The women are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste of the period
Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching middle age
Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive girl of twenty-one and completely under the influence of the older woman
(as group comes through door) By next year, madam, we expect to have a bathtub on each floor
Miss Martin stops short and looks o
s
having a time lifting the trunk up into the boot
Miss Martin and the others come into the scene
Now don't drop it -- Dave pauses to see who is talking
At your age you'd best not be lifting things so heavy
(grimaces) Mebbe you're young enough to hoist her up your own self
(tries to lift trunk again) on Clara
She is looking rather timidly up at Rocklin
on Rocklin
He is grinning appreciatively at old Dave
Now he notices Clara and regards her soberly a moment
Dave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it
Miss Martin, about to enter the coach, notices Clara staring up at Rocklin
Clara
Clara snaps her attention from Rocklin to her aunt
The Clerk steps to the side of the coach and opens the door
He assists Clara inside -- and now Miss Martin
- Miss Martin and Clara
Miss Martin is just sitting
She looks coldly at Clara
(in low voice) Staring as though you'd never seen a man before
- Dave, Rocklin and Clerk
Dave is at the moment climbing to his seat on the other side of the coach
The Clerk swings the door closed and looks up to Rocklin and speaks more or less confidentially
Try to hold him down or he'll scare the women to death
He is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually, but loud enough to be heard by the women
never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman
- window of door -- Miss Martin and Clara
The women have obviously overheard Rocklin's remark
Miss Martin smiles vindictively at Clara, who flushes
to include the Clerk, who moves to the coach door
Well,  hope you have a nice trip, ladies
hope we get there -- wouldn't surprise me if we didn't
- On Dave and Rocklin
(mutters) Wait till  get you on the road, you old buzzard, you'll be surprised all right
He takes up the reins and shouts the team away
- -- with the stage hardly more than a black dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole broad expanse
As the coach disappears from shot, the two mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in the same direction as the coach
'    - -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring straight ahead
As they roll with the roll of the coach, Dave steals a look at his companion
wonder why a young feller who don't have to wants to come into this God danged country
Rocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead
Dave glances down toward the women
Say -- did you mean what you said back there about wimmen
(grimly) Every word of it
(chuckling) Then you're smarter than most
Maybe  seen more of 'em than most
(looking at him admiringly) Shouldn't be surprised
Shouldn't be a leetle bit surprised
(reflectively) All the same
He breaks off and chuckles again
(unsmilingly) All the same -- what
Dave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail
(offering bottle to Rocklin) Take a slug
Rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all but empties it in one pull
(holding up the bottle and squinting through it) Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how much alike they are
Both fool you, but you never figger out how to do without 'em
Rocklin makes no reply
Dave offers the bottle again
Take another
Not just yet
(unoffended) Well
(putting the bottle to his lips) Here's to her
Who
The next one that fools you
He empties the bottle and shies it away
At the same time, the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is muffled exclamation from inside the coach
Dave leans over and looks down o
s
- -- Clara and Miss Martin
The former is showing the effects of the rough ride, but the old lady is hanging on grimly
'  - Dave straightens up, grinning
(with relish) Mighty rough stretch along here
He whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little unsteadily in his seat
Like me to speel you a while
Nope
've had a few snorts but that don't make no difference
Leas'ways, never has
(after a second's pause) Don't ever git wore out, and useless, like me
Who're them as say you are
Harolday, for one
Oh,  ain't belly- aching
Reckon he's entitled to his opinion
But him and me never did see eye to eye
What's wrong
It's constitootional,  reckon
Like that step-daughter of his is crazy -- he's too sane
Believes In law and order
(grinning) What's wrong with law and order
Depends on who's a-dishin' it out
Never was good at takin' orders meself
As for the law -- well, you'll soon find out what that means 'round these parts
The coach hits a particularly bad bit of road and there is an exclamation from inside
Dave grins and urges the team on cheerfully
-   - -- as Dave pulls up the stage at the top of a long downgrade and looks out appreciatively at the view
From this crest of the rim, a vast expanse of country is visible
stage
Miss Martin thrusts her head out of the window
Driver
Driver, what's the matter
Nothin'
Restin' hosses
Git out and stretch yore laigs if you want
Resting horses
What for
can see with my own eyes it's downhill
Dave brightens visibly at this challenge
You in such an all-fired hurry, lady
Certainly, we are in a hurry
(beaming) Well -- we'll hurry some
His whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the grade
grade, with the stagecoach bounding and reeling down the narrow road and around the sharp bends
Dave and Rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill
Dave is leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from within
None come
Rocklin is hanging on with both hands and mildly amused
- The two women are really being scrambled
-   - -- Dave and Rocklin
Rocklin is as calm as if he were walking
Dave is more and more pleased with himself
He again leans out to listen

In f

the road narrows and makes a sharp turn at the very edge of a precipice
There is no possible way of getting the coach safely around this turn except at a walk
road, from point of view of driver's seat, establishing the same menace ahead
Dave and Rocklin, as Rocklin glances out of the corner of his eyes as if wondering whether or not Dave is too drunk to perceive the disaster
He makes no move, however, to advise or interfere
road; at danger corner, as stage comes in
At the very last second, Dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in safety
stage
Dave grins at Rocklin, then listens for the outcry he expects from the women within
The old lady's head bobs out of the window
(fiercely) Now what's the matter
Why are we stopping again
Old Dave's mouth drops open, and as Rocklin begins to grin at his discomfiture
'  - of lonely adobe which serves as a combination roadhouse, stage station and bar
As the coach rolls into f
g
, a little Mexican boy (Pablo) runs out to change the horses
(as Rocklin swings down) Buenas noches, senor
Buenas noches, amigo
(grinning at the friendly tone) Ha llegado anticipademente, senor
Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado
He glances pointedly at Dave who is climbing down unsteadily and Pablo bursts out laughing
on door of coach
As Dave comes into shot, Miss Martin's head pops out of the window
(gruffly) We stop here
Why do we stop here
If you wanta eat and stretch yore laigs
Will you please stop referring to my legs
You got some, ain't you
He turns and lurches toward the roadhouse
'  - from doorway
It is a large barn-like room on one side of which is a bar
On the other side is a fireplace and a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches
Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged garments of unrecognizable origin
On the counter is a travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and shovel
As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and reveals a face even hairier than Dave's
(holding out his arms) Dave
(letting out a yell and rushing to Zeke) Why, Zeke, you two-legged old coot
Zeke and Dave as they beat one another on the back
Whar you been all these months
Up in the hills workin' my way down the biggest hole you ever seed
Good -- What's at the bottom of it
Nothin'
(roaring with laughter) What, again
Rocklin has entered and moved to the fire
Miss Martin and Clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at the bar
pale-faced, dyspeptic-looking man of about 45 (Stan) comes from the kitchen and approaches them ingratiatingly
Good evening, ladies
How about something to eat
(with a dubious look toward the pair at the bar) Well -- if it won't take too long
(leading the way toward the partition) This way, ladies
bar
Dave has just fitted a cylindrical record of "She Was Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage" to an old-type phonograph
Yep -- this is my last trip
Why
Old Harolday won't take back what he said
What'd he say
"You're fired
" They both yell with laughter and slap one another on the back
from fireplace
Rocklin is standing in f
g
looking down at the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket dip
Seated at the table are Clara and Miss Martin
From o
s
comes the sound of Zeke and Dave singing to the phonograph record
Miss Martin glares indignantly in the direction of the bar, obviously about to make a protest
At this moment Stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in his hand which he dumps on the table
There you are, folks
Dig in and help y'rselves
Miss Martin, sitting forward eagerly, suddenly sees the dish of meat and freezes
dish of meat
It is swimming in greasy brown gravy
Miss Martin as she shudders dyspeptically and closes her eyes
bar, as Stan comes from the table to Dave and Zeke
Supper, Dave
(noisily) 'm drinkin' mine
Set 'em up
table
Clara has filled a plate with food, which she offers to her aunt
Auntie -- With my dyspepsia
Do you want to kill me
Clara hesitates for a second, then looks across to Rocklin
Aren't you going to have any supper
Reckon so
He comes to table and begins to help himself
There is a loud burst of laughter from the bar
Young man, that driver's had all the liquor he can take
Has he
You know he has
You're not a complete fool, are you
Frequently
(to Clara, furiously) The rudeness of people in these parts is appalling
Clara looks apologetically at Rocklin, then away again nervously
Suddenly, she sees something o
s
and drops her knife and fork with a little start
window
thin, unpleasant-looking face is seen through the glass
The windowpane is defective and so distorts the lower part of the face into a hideous smile
It is the younger of the two men who were watching the coach outside the hotel
on kitchen door as Stan comes through with a dish of potatoes
man's voice is heard o
s
and he pulls up abruptly
' Well, well -- smells like a mighty nice bit of veal
include the side door next to the window and almost opposite to the dining table
The owner of the face at the window (Bob Clews) is now standing in the doorway
Behind him is the man with the sheriff's badge on his dirty vest (Jackson)
As they come forward toward Stan, the latter shows obvious signs of nervousness
Doin' yourself well these days, Stan
friend of mine was by an' sold me a quarter of beef
(insinuatingly) The same friend as sold you that hide Bob, here, found stashed in your barn yesterday
Hide -- What hide
The one that might send you to the penitentiary
(smugly) What did you do with it, Stan
never had no hide stashed -- (harshly) saw it yesterday under the hay
Then it must still be there
No it ain't -- we looked -- Where is it
tell ya -- (who has been an interested witness) What is all this
Jackson, as though noticing the women for the first time, raises his hat
Afternoon ma'am
Miz Caldwell ain't it
No -- Martin -- Miss Martin -- This is Miss Caldwell
(to Clara) Glad to know you, miss -- Been expectin' you at Santa Inez
'm Sheriff Jackson
Any relation of Red Caldwell's a friend of mine
(that oily smile) You're sure gonna brighten things up considerable around the
Ranch
Miss Martin gives Clews an icy stare and snaps her eyes to Jackson
(indicating Stan) What's going on with him
Just a little matter of the law
(hastily) Rustlin'
Wrestling
Rustlin' -- cattle stealin'
Oh -- a thief -- (visibly worried) tell ya  never -- (quickly) Save it -- (to Miss Martin) Matter of fact -- Bob, here, says that the hide he saw yesterday had the
brand on it
Oh -- hmmm -- well, what do you intend doing about it
(looking at Stan) Law's pretty harsh 'round here on cattle thieves
(being the kind man) Course, we don't want to make a mistake with an old-timer, but -- Rocklin speaks from where he leans against the wall, casually smoking
How about the owner of that beef -- mightn't he have somethin' to say about it
There's a pause in which all have turned their attention to Rocklin
Meanin'
Red Caldwell -- he's the owner of the
, ain't he
(after a short chuckle) You're 'way behind the herd, mister -- Red Caldwell died three weeks ago
(glaring at Clews) Was murdered, you mean
That's right -- shot in the back -- not far from here
(significantly to Stan) Maybe he was gettin' on to things about the cattle that's been missin' from the
lately
tell ya  ain't never had any hide -- (quickly) Well, you got beef -- (meekly defiant) Yes -- an'  got a bill of sale fer it, too
Jackson and Clews exchange a quick glance
'pose you let me see that bill of sale
(starts for kitchen) It's right out here
Jackson follows, looking at the women
Like  said --  wouldn't want to make a mistake with an ole-timer
Jackson follows Stan into the kitchen
Clews moves to the fire and lunges there picking his teeth and eyeing Clara, who stirs uneasily under the man's gaze
as Rocklin comes out of the thoughtful mood in which he has been plunged by the information about Red Caldwell and notes the by-play between Clews and Clara
He frowns and makes a movement as if about to rise
At the same time, Dave and Zeke, whose voices have been heard throughout In the b
g
, stagger into the shot
(chuckling and pointing to Miss Martin) See that one
(confidentially) She ain't got no laigs
Hold your tongue
(to Zeke, who is gaping at her) And you -- stop staring as if we were monsters
Zeke takes it and staggers into the b
g
near Bob Clews
(to Rocklin) Where's Stan
We got to have another drink
He's outside tryin' to explain away a hide
Eh
(indicating food) Seems we're eatin' stolen beef
Somebody's loco
Stan might have given house-room to bit o' dead beef, but he'd never be fool enough to leave the hide lyin' around
(to Zeke) How 'bout it, Zeke
Zeke opens his mouth to speak, and slowly folds up, sliding down the wall to the floor
as Clews comes from the fireplace and joins the group
That's the way it is, Dave
Dave has gone to Zeke's aid and now peers at Clews closely, recognizing him for the first time
(disgustedly) Oh -- it's you
That's right -- your old pal Bob Clews
(shoves Clews) Git away from me -- you two-timin' horse thief
(grinning) Them's fightin' words, pardner
Stan and Jackson come from the kitchen
Dave is again picking up Zeke, but seeing Stan, lets Zeke drop
(moving to Stan) Hey, Stan -- don't let 'em hang nothin' on you, you ain't done
They're just a couple of fourflushers -- the pair of 'em, everybody knows that
Jackson addresses everyone present with an indulgent Smile
Crazy drunk
(wheels on Jackson) Mebbe  am drunk -- mebbe that's why 'm tellin' the truth -- 'm drunk an' 'll say what  think -- 'll say what  know
Zeke, on the floor, takes up Dave's belligerent mood for a flash
So will --  -- (goes out again) Jackson goes to Dave
Don't act up this ways, Dave -- They's women watchin'
Clews moves in to Jackson and Dave, and now both men urge Dave toward the door
(attempting to throw them off) Git your hands off me -- (to company in general) What he needs is a short lay-down
(taking a step forward) 'll lend a hand
(brushing past him) Me an' Bob'll look after him
We're his friends -- come on, Bob
(as they steer Dave through door) Careful now -- don't hurt him
They exit
Rocklin stands frowning a second, then turns toward the table where Stan is making a show of clearing dishes, etc
(quietly to Stan) How are things standin' now between you an' the law
(indicates direction Jackson went out) (not wanting to talk about it particularly) All right,  reckon -- (looks at Rocklin; more confidently) guess this bill of sale -- (indicates it in Vest pocket) -- kinda winded him
Rocklin's lips curl in a wise smile
Good thing you saved it
Zeke is discovered on all fours crawling around on the floor near the table where the women sit
He seems to be looking for something
(mystified) What are you doing
Zeke turns his hairy face up toward Miss Martin
Musta been dreamin' -- Thought  was sittin' on a pot of gold
(wearily) There ain't no gold here
(takes it) There ain't even a pot
The door leading from the barn opens and Jackson enters followed by Clews a few steps behind
How is he
Went to sleep soon's we laid him down
(pulling off hat again) Sorry to have a ruckus in front of you ladies
Dave's an ornery old cuss when he gets goin' -- No shape to drive on, 'm afraid
(this is a fine kettle of fish) Hmmm -- Don't worry, ma'am
Bob, here, 'll take you on in -- knows every inch of the road -- Don't you
(grins) You bet
Rocklin has been listening intently
'm drivin'
of the group, with Clews looking significantly at Jackson, who is obviously checkmated by Rocklin's remark
(finally speaks) But if anything was to happen to the ladies, 'd feel -- to blame
Don't
He turns abruptly and walks out the front door to the coach
Jackson stares after him a moment, uncertain
Now he turns to the women
You ladies want he should drive
Miss Martin hesitates
'll be more'n glad to accommodate you -- (smiles at Clara) (resenting Clews' familiarity) He's going with us anyway -- he may as well drive
Anything you say, ma'am
'  - -- coach as Rocklin moves toward it from the house
crudely made arrow shoots in and hits Rocklin lightly warning hiss is heard o
s
and he turns quickly in the direction of the sound
- '  - -- door of stable
The little Mexican who attended the horses is peering out from the stable
(in a whisper) Venga con migo, senor
The kid disappears inside the stable
Rocklin comes into shot from the direction of the coach and enters the stable
- '  - Rocklin comes through the door and moves toward the boy, who is standing looking downward into some hay
to show Dave unconscious, with a nasty cut in his scalp
Rocklin kneels into the shot
Over the scene comes the sound of retreating hoofbeats
'  - -- from Rocklin's  in the stable, of Jackson and Bob Clews riding away
- '  -
(to boy) Did they do it
(nods) Si, senor
They hit him with a pistola
(matters) His friends, eh
He kneels again, picks Dave up, and prepares to carry him out
-     - of stagecoach traveling
Rocklin on the driver's seat, handling the reins expertly
- -- with Miss Martin and Clara now seated next to one another
Clara is half asleep with her head against the side of the coach
Miss Martin is sitting bolt upright but her eyes are closed and her head nods
to include the other side of the coach where Dave is sprawled in the seat, his head on a cushion, his mouth open, sound asleep
Suddenly he snores violently, and Miss Martin wakes with a start and glares at him angrily
-   - on sign on window which reads: Proprietor --
Harolday to show the coach pulled up outside, with Rocklin lifting his saddle from the top of the coach, whilst a stableman holds up Dave
What happened
Bumped his head
(skeptically) Where -- on Iron Mountain
Where's the best chance of a cheap room
(pointing) There's Cap's place across the Street -- the Sun-Up Saloon
(with valise, indicates saddle) 'll pick that up later
group, to include the window of the coach
Miss Martin's head appears
(to stableman) This isn't the hotel
No'm, lady
Hotel's up the street a piece
Are we expected to carry our bags at this time of night
(to Rocklin) Want to drive 'em on up
(flatly) Nope
(offering a shoulder to Dave) Here -- catch aholt
The two move out of shot across the road, followed by the indignant gaze of Miss Martin
-  - -- opening on the sign over the door, which reads: - to show Rocklin and Dave coming along the boardwalk in front of the saloon
them to the swing-doors, which Rocklin pushes open, passing through into the saloon
-  - --    the bar toward the swing- doors as Dave and Rocklin enter
The bartender (Cap), a lean, tallish man of about 50, studies them as they enter, then turns and calls across the room
Hey Doc
to show a group of poker players seated around a table
This consists of a well-dressed, powerful-looking man of about 45 (Judge Garvey), with a smooth face and an impressive manner; a flashily-dressed young man with a weak face (Clint Harolday); a tough-looking cowboy of about 35 (Ab Jenkins); a pleasant-faced storekeeper of about 50 (Pap Fossler); and a little man with a weather-beaten face and intensely blue eyes (Doc Riding)
Watching the game are Sam Haynes and Shorty Davis, the former a townsman and the latter a cowboy
As they all look toward the door, Cap's voice continues
' Customer -- Doc Riding looks quickly toward the door, taking in the situation
(to Haynes) Take my hand, Sammy
Rocklin and Dave come to the bar
At the same time, Doc Riding comes into shot from the poker table
What happened
Bumped his head
(dryly) see
(examining the head) Looks like he's going to need a couple or so stitches
(to Cap) Better get him upstairs
The bartender looks dubious
(nodding) Okay
You can book me a room, too
As Rocklin and Doc Riding begin to lead Dave toward the Stairs
'  - -  - -- starting on big head of Dave, as he lies in bed, with his eyes closed
His head is swathed in a clean bandage
He stirs and gives a little chuckle
(muttering) No laigs
to show Doc Riding at the bed and Rocklin beyond, standing in the connecting doorway between two bedrooms
The latter has a face towel in his hands and has evidently been washing up
As Dave settles down comfortably in the bed, Doc Riding closes his bag, nods to Rocklin and moves toward the second bedroom
'  - -  - -- as Doc Riding comes through the doorway from Dave's room
He'll be all right in the morning
Rocklin closes door behind him
How about a snort
Don't mind if  do
He moves across the room, followed by Rocklin, who throws the towel down on the bed as he passes
For a second, he hesitates as if about to pick up the gun-belt which is lying on the bed
Then, deciding to leave it, he follows the doctor through the door
-  - -- at bar, with Cap Setting up glasses for Doc Riding and Rocklin
He nods to indicate the bedroom upstairs
(with a grin) Will he make it
Sure he'll make it
Can't kill off a salty old hairpin like Dave that easy
You're right
Reckon Saint Peter must be gitten' mighty tired of dustin' off that doormat for him
(to Rocklin) By the way, how did you say it happened
(stolidly) didn't
(with a slight nod of approval) That's right; you didn't
(casually) Reason  ask is, a couple fellers was in saying how Dave was kickin' up a ruckus up at Stan's place
(to Doc Riding) Sheriff Jackson it was and one of the Clewses
(with a look of distaste) Oh
Cap reverts to Rocklin, still casually, but with an undertone of friendly warning
Tough customers, the Clewses
Yeah -- don't pay to start something with 'em you don't intend to finish
(to Doc Riding before Rocklin can answer) By the way, Doc, they tell me George'll be out again
(to Rocklin, with the same casual air) That's Bob Clews' brother
Jest done a stretch in pen 'tentiary for horse stealin'
They string 'em up for that where come from
(muttering into his drink) Pity they didn't string him up while they wore about it
That's what Arly Harolday was sayin' only this mornin'
(to Rocklin) You ain't met our Arly yet,  reckon
He will, if he stays here long enough
(chuckles) Hell-fire in skirts
(raises his glass; grinning) Well, here's now
They down the drinks
There is a burst of excited comment from o
s
and they all look around toward the poker table
Poker table from bar
The flashily-dressed youngster is raking in the stakes triumphantly
What did  tell you
They gotta be big to beat me
Group at bar
Clint Harolday's in luck tonight
They're certainly running for him
About time, too
He's taken a beating this last week would shake a better man
Poker table and including bar
Sammy Haynes has risen and is pushing back his chair
Include me out
Aw -- come on
Can't you take it
Not that sort o' luck,  can't
Besides,  on'y came in to oblige
(turning to bar and shouting) Come on, Doc
still got to take something from you
(shaking his head) No more tonight, son
've a full day ahead
Judge Garvey in foreground has been watching Rocklin, as if trying to sum him up
He now leans forward with an ingratiating smile
How about you, sir
Care to sit In
'm warnin' you, though -- our young friend here has been holding phenomenal cards
Rocklin smiles and begins to shake his head
(with a cocky grin) Have a heart, Judge
This ain't no two-bit saddle-tramp's game
This is for real money
Rocklin turns very slowly and stares at Clint
The others watch curiously
Without taking his eyes off Clint, he comes forward slowly and stands looking down at him
Then, unbuttoning the flap of his pocket, he takes out the wad of bills and drops it on the table, at the same time sinking into the chair vacated by Sammy
The tension amongst the onlookers relaxes and Clint grins at Garvey and winks significantly
Fine
Oh -- this is Pap Fossler; Shorty Davis; Ab Jenkins; Mr
Harolday, and my name's Garvey -- Judge Garvey
didn't get your name
didn't give it
(to Pap, who is holding the cards) Deal
-  - -- poker table, including Cap, who is watching
Pap Fossler is dealing
There is an atmosphere of tension around the table, and it is obvious that Clint has been losing
As he picks up his cards, he is unable to restrain a smile of triumph
Rocklin makes a bet
Pap Fossler and the man next to him fold immediately
Raise you twenty
This is more than Rocklin has in front of him
(quietly) Table stakes, Clint
Not if he wants to dig
He stares challengingly at Rocklin
Rocklin takes out a wallet, from which he removes a bill and sees the raise
(folding) No place for me
Cards
One
(eagerly) One for me
He reaches for it almost before it is dealt and as a result the card, a Queen, falls face up
Clint looks at it gleefully, snatches it up and puts it in his hand
Rocklin watches him impassively
Don't you know that Queen is dead
can take it if  want it
Sure -- if you want -- but you'll have to beat my hand with four cards
(hotly) 'm playing these, mister
Rocklin glances inquiringly at the other players
All are dead-panned, unwilling to interfere
Rocklin looks toward Cap, who stands near him
(shaking his head) 'm not settin' in
(smoothly) Why don't you split the pot
'm not splitting -- 'm betting
He shoves all the money in front of him into the pot
Are you calling
(calmly) No
Clint excitedly starts to rake in the pot
'm raising
He shoves in the money in front of him, which is more than Clint's and in addition takes from his wallet more bills
Dig
Clint, very excited, empties his pockets, which is not enough
(to other players) Let me have some money (speaking for all) You're in deep enough, Clint
(disgusted, to Rocklin) 've called for all 've got
(spreads out his cards) Full house
No good
(spreads his hand) Kings up
Your third queen is dead
Rocklin starts raking in the pot
Clint, almost hysterical, jumps up, draws his gun and thrusts it almost into Rocklin's face
The other players roll away from the line of fire
(screaming) You -- mister -- get away from that table
And get out of here
Maybe from now on you'll know a full house beats two pairs -- four-flusher
Rocklin, his hands outspread, slowly straightens up, rises and backs away
At the foot of the stairs, he turns deliberately and walks upstairs
When he disappears from view -- - Clint breaks the tension, looking from one to the other
No man can run a bluff on me
There is a cold silence
(finally) He wasn't armed
don't like to tell men how to play cards unless 'm settin' in -- but mebbe ought to have spoken up
(directly to Clint) That Queen was dead, Clint -- and you know it
(arrogantly) When anybody plays poker with me, they play my game or not at all
You can't just go makin' your own rules, Clint -- (starts for the bar -- stops and turns) -- an' if  was you 'd hightail outa here before he comes back
(jolted) Comes back
(wearily) He's the kind
Cap turns and resumes his trek to the bar
Suddenly he stops before reaching it and is looking up, o
s
' Rocklin is standing there grimly surveying the situation
As he starts down the stairs
They are staring o
s
Clint is very uneasy
And now Rocklin moves slowly into the scene
(with deadly calm) 've come for my money
(nervously pleasant) It's all yours, mister -- Cap, there -- Cap is an old gambler -- he says you were right all the time
Clint again looks around for approval, but gets no response
Rocklin comes slowly forward, picks up the money from the table and turns back to the stairs
As he reaches the foot of the stairs, he turns and looks straight at Garvey with a peculiar expression
By the way, Judge -- the name is Rocklin
'  - -  - -- on a small cracked mirror in which can be seen the reflection of a man shaving
voice is heard singing, atrociously off key
' She was only a bird in a gilded cage
(etc
) to show that the owner of tie voice is Rocklin, who has almost finished shaving
As he scrapes his chin and whistles, peering at himself in the little cracked mirror, he hears the sound of the door opening and turns, then ducks quickly as a boot flies past him, just missing the mirror
There is the sound of the door slamming and Rocklin grins
He picks up the boot and goes to the door leading to Dave's room
'  - -  - As Rocklin enters, Dave is discovered almost dressed sitting on the bed
Rocklin, glad to see him, smiles and tosses the boot to him
How you feelin'
After that singin'
-- Thirsty
(pulls on his boot) How's your head
(evidently not aware of what happened) Oh -- a mite hungover -- but 'll feel better once  git downstairs
He hurries out the hall door
Rocklin, amused at the old coot, starts back into his room
'  - -  - Rocklin is just coming through the door and sees something o
s
, stops and freezes
to include Bob Clews leaning against the open ball door leading into Rocklin's room
He smiles as Rocklin sees him
knocked, but guess you didn't hear me
(closing door to Dave's room) What do you want
(grinning) Looks like you stirred things up around here last night, stranger
That all you came to say
No
got a message for you
(getting no response) From Old Man Harolday
Wants to see you out front
What about
Maybe he wants to thank you for teaching that pup of his a lesson
(after a second) 'll be down
Clews hesitates for a second as if anxious to wake sure he is coming, then, turning, he disappears into the hall
Rocklin wipes the last of the lather off his chin, buckles on his gun-belt and picking up his hat goes out, closing the door
-  - -- Dave, at the bar, grabbing a bottle, pours himself a drink which he sinks in one draught
He shudders and repeats the dose
During this, an excited murmur of voices has been heard o
s
Dave turns and looks toward the far side of the saloon and suddenly gapes
- with Dave in f
g
, and   the street
group of men, including Cap, the bartender, is gathered round the window looking out into the street
Dave staggers across to them and begins to push his way to the window
group at window as Dave pushes them aside to get a view of what is happening outside
What's goin' on here
Arly Harolday's on the warpath
-   - -- including Arly and Juan mounted in front of the stagecoach office, which is situated diagonally across the street from the Sun-Up
one group standing in front of Pap Fossler's store, opposite the Sun-Up
Here he comes
Watch the fun
This should be good
Etc
-  - the window
The men inside, including Dave and Cap, are pressed against the glass
and   the alleyway at the side of the saloon
Rocklin is coming toward the street
Rocklin, as he comes out of the shadow of the alleyway and stands blinking in the full sunlight
Sensing something unusual, he looks quickly around
from Rocklin's
the groups in the street,   one which includes Bob Clews
As Clews sees Rocklin, he nudges a bystander and looks toward the stagecoach office with a grin
to include Arly and Juan
Rocklin as he takes in the situation
With a grim look, he begins to move along the sidewalk,    him
Suddenly, there is the clatter of a horse's hooves and Arly gallops into shot, forcing the mare up onto the sidewalk and barring Rocklin's progress
(imperiously) Is your name Rocklin
(coldly) Yes
(contemptuously) want that money you took from my brother last night
(quietly) Are you crazy
Or just ignorant
(flaming) You took it at the point of a gun -- (suddenly whipping a revolver from her saddle holster) -- and 'm taking it back the same way
of group at window of Sun-Up Saloon
of group including Bob Clews, as Clint Harolday rides in and stares o
s
Rocklin, as he looks coldly from Arly to the run and back again
Calmly taking the reins, he forces the mare's head up and moves on
Furiously, Arly spurs the mare alongside, them
(furiously) Stop
You
stop, or 'll kill you
Arly and Rocklin
Rocklin continues along the sidewalk
(pulls up her horse) Turn around
Arly
She raises her gun
shot comes from o
s
and strikes the building close to him
He stiffens but keeps on walking
Another shot comes even closer this time
He keeps walking
- - As he puts out his hand to push open the door, Rocklin's hand on the door as four shots in quick succession spatter a line down the door close to his hand
-  - -- Rocklin, as he continues his forward movement through the swing-doors
in front of him into the saloon until it reaches the bar
Cap moves from window with crowd and goes behind bar
Whiskey
-  - -- Arley with the smoking gun still in her hand
She stares wildly after Rocklin for a second, then wheels her horse violently toward the group which includes Cling Harolday and Bob Clews
group surrounding Clews and Clint Harolday
The clatter of hoofs is heard and Arly gallops furiously into shot
What happened
You lied to me, didn't you
Don't think 'll forget this
Making a fool of me in front of the whole town
Before Clint can reply, she wheels the mare and gallops out of shot
-  - -- as the customers, with Dave in f
g
, mill around Rocklin
Boy, oh boy, was that a near thing
She'd just as soon have hit you as missed
You don't know how lucky you were, son
Don't
(indicating whiskey with a sickly grin) Why d'you think  need this
He sinks the whiskey and begins to pour himself another
At the same time, the swing-doors open and Bob Clews comes through
Rocklin raises the glass to his lips, Bob Clews hits him on the back, causing him to spill the whisky
Funniest sight  ever seen
There is a moment's pause
Then with a slow, grim smile of satisfaction, Rocklin turns and knocks Bob Clews off his feet
with Bob Clews on the floor, tugging at his gun
As it comes free of the holster, Rocklin brings his heel down on Clews' wrist, grinding on it with his whole weights
Then, kicking the gun out of reach, Rocklin steps back
Bob Clews sits up, clutching his wrist and weaving back and forth
(moaning) You broke it
You broke it
Try another trick like that on me and it'll be worse
never played you no trick
You broke my wrist
to include the bystanders
They look at Bob Clews without sympathy
He gets to his feet and stumbles back, collapsing in a chair
at bar, Dave has taken the bottle from Cap and is refilling Rocklin's and his own glass ecstatically
(gurgling with delight) Oh boy -- has somebody come to town
He sinks both drinks quickly and is about to refill them when Cap takes the bottle from him
(to Cap) Where'll  find Judge Garvey
He rooms behind his office down the street
Don't usually pull up the blinds till around noon, though
(putting down money) He will this morning
(to Dave) See you later, old-timer
As he moves toward the door
'  - Clint Harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward the Sun-Up Saloon
He suddenly notices something o
s
which prompts him to say something which we of course cannot hear
Now Garvey appears at the window
-   - Rocklin,  Garvey's  as he leaves the Sun-Up and starts toward the Judge's office
'  - Garvey and Clint, at the window
From their expressions it is apparent that anxious words are passing between them, and now Clint suddenly drops from sight
-     - -   - Arly and Juan, mounted
They see Rocklin going into Garvey's place
'  - --  door, with Garvey at desk in f
g
The door opens and Rocklin enters
(effusively) Oh, come in, Mr
Rocklin
Come right in
Rocklin looks him over for a second, then comes quietly to the desk
understand you were Red Caldwell's lawyer
(immediately on guard) was
Know anything about this
He takes out a letter and hands it to Garvey
The latter takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous
He looks from the letter to Rocklin and back again
Then reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read
-- It reads: Dear Mr
Rocklin: Glad you have made up your mind to take the job
Enclosed find train fare and $150 advance on wages
Yours faithfully, Caldwell Rocklin and Garvey
The latter looks up from the letter completely bewildered
don't understand
Job
What job
Foreman
(gaping) On the "
"
(trying to take it in) But -- but why should he want you
Why not
Good foremen don't grow on bushes
There is a little pause, with Garvey still bewildered
(thinking hard) Is that your only motive for coming here
What other motive could  have
don't know -- It's just that Red Caldwell was a peculiar man -- had a funny way of doing things
He studies Rocklin a short moment, then sits back comfortably and relieved
Well, 'm sorry, Mr
Rocklin, that you've been brought all this way on a fool's errand, but -- 'm afraid the deal's off
Off
don't want to be too hard on you, but as executor of the estate  have to consider the interests of the new owner
How about, say, a hundred in full settlement
(thoughtfully) Well -- There is a knock on the door
Garvey rises and speaks on his way to the door
That's my last word -- think it over
Garvey opens the door, and Miss Martin stalks in followed by Clare
(graciously) How do you do, ladies -- (icily) You are Judge Garvey,  presume
(nods) Yes -- and you are -- Miss Martin -- and my niece, Clara Caldwell
(reaching for a chair) Of course -- of course -- Miss Martin sits stiffly as she eyes Rocklin coldly
You came at a very opportune moment, madam
This gentleman claims to have some sort of a letter from the late Mr
Caldwell, engaging him as foreman of the "
" What
(to Garvey) What do you mean -- claims to have
-- You saw it, didn't you
(before Garvey can answer) You can't hold us to account for every promise made by that man
Everyone knows he wasn't responsible for his actions half the time
And if you think 'd have you as a foreman -- (finds it hard to control himself) Listen, lady -- 'd rather walk for somebody else, than ride for you
(taken aback) Well -- the impudence -- All  come for this morning was to pay beck the hundred and fifty Red Caldwell sent in advance
Oh, no They all turn and stare at her
Don't interfere, Clara
Of course he must pay it back
The railway fare -- well,  reckon we can check that up against the time lost and call it quits
(throws down a roll of bills in front of Garvey) (summoning up her courage) But, Mr
-- er --  don't know your name
(raising his hat) Rocklin, miss
Mr
Rocklin, it isn't fair for you to pay anything back
That's how 'd prefer it, If you don't mind, miss -- never did care fer owing favors to no one -- especially women
(as if she had been struck) Oh
The sound of rapid steps approaching from outside is heard and they all look toward the door
on door, as it opens to admit Arly
Ignoring everyone in the room except Garvey, she comes abruptly to the desk, with the riding quirt dangling from her wrist
've just heard they let George Clews out of penitentiary and that he's headed this way
You might tell him from me, if he sets foot on the Santee Ranch, 'll shoot him on sight
But really, Miss Arly, why should you deliver your message through me
You have mutual friends
If you're referring to Sheriff Jackson
am
But that's absurd
The fact that he employs one of the Clews brothers doesn't make the other his friend
(contemptuously) Have it your own way; but it'd be fair to warn him, because  mean it
For the first time, she appears to be conscious of the presence of the other women
(hastening to change the conversation) Oh, Miss Caldwell, this is Miss Harolday -- Miss Martin, Miss Caldwell's aunt
You should know one another, seeing you'll be neighbors
Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch for her stepfather
She's a famous -- ah -- horsewoman in these parts
(with ingenuous enthusiasm) know
saw you ride into town this morning
You looked lovely
Just what 'd like to be
Arly stares at her unbelievingly for a second
(slowly, a bit flustered) Yes
She looks slowly from Clara to Rocklin, as if suspecting collusion
(completely innocent) Oh, this is Mr
Rocklin
He drove us in from Garden City last night
He
(dead pan) already met Miss Harolday
Oh
(stonily, to Rocklin) 've a message for you -- from Harolday
(murmuring) What, again
He wants you to come down to the office
What for
He's got a proposition to make -- about riding for him
Sixty a month
Hmmm -- That's a foreman's wages
(suddenly exploding) wouldn't offer you a red cent
(controlling herself) But it's his money
(bitingly) And the way things are shaping, maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you around the ranch
(pushing her way forward) warn you, you're making a great mistake
This man is no good
Auntie
(to Rocklin ignoring Miss Martin) Well
'you want the job
Rocklin, as he stares at Arly with an enigmatic expression
Suddenly, he seems to make up his mind
(indicating the door) Lead the way
as Arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she came
Rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his hat and follows
As he goes, Juan, who has been leaning against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him
(after they have gone) Auntie, why did you have to say that
simply don't understand you
(cutting in, grimly) But  understand you
(scathingly) 'd be ashamed of myself
Throwing myself at a man like that
(suddenly bursting into tears) Oh, you're horrid -- horrid
wish 'd never come
She turns abruptly and drops onto the couch by the window
of Garvey and Miss Martin
You must excuse her
She's young
And inexperienced
Garvey leans back in his chair and smiles
(significantly) And young people must be protected from themselves at times -- don't you agree
Miss Martin throws him a quick look, which he returns steadily
(at last, with a grim echo of a smile) Exactly
-   - Arly and Rocklin walking along the street, not far from Harolday's office
Rocklin glances back toward Julio, who is following a few paces behind them
He rides his horse and is leading Arly's
(to Arly, indicating Julio) Does he always follow you
(defiantly) He's not following me -- he's with me -- he's always with me
(takes it mildly) Oh -- just an old Indian friend
(straight at him) The best friend 've got
Rocklin nods, looks back again at Julio, then back to Arly as they go out of shot
- -- as Arly comes to from the street, followed by Julio and Rocklin
(abruptly to Rocklin) Wait here
her over to a door marked "," which she opens without knocking
'   - as Arly comes through from the outer office toward Harolday, who is seated at desk in f
g
At Arly's abrupt entrance, he looks up, startled
've just hired a man named Rocklin and said you made me do it
Sixty dollars and he 'll earn it -- while he lasts
There is a little pause
Harolday's face is completely dead pan
He looks out of the window for a second, then back at Arly
(quietly) Why did you do it, Arly
So  can fire him
hate him
Clint and he quarrelled last night
Clint lied about it and  made a fool of myself
(nodding toward the outer office) He's outside now
(with a little sigh) All right
Send him in
Arly goes to the door and opens it
(calling) Come in
Rocklin comes in and Arly exits without a word, closing the door behind her
as Rocklin comes from the doorway into f
g
of shot, facing Harolday, who is seated on the far side of the desk
Mr
Rocklin, what happened between you and my son last night
Poker
Hmmm
About this suggestion of you working for me
It's your suggestion, not mine
Ye-es
Sixty dollars is big money
(turning to go) If you've changed your mind
No, no
Wait a minute
take it you've had the experience
Enough for Red Caldwell to hire me as foreman
Oh -- had Caldwell hired you
Yeah -- but  won't ride for the new owners -- so that leaves me open
see -- Were you a friend of Red's
No --  guess he just heard about me
sudden clatter of feet is heard and all eyes turn toward the door
as Dave, followed by Arly and Juan, bursts in
His eyes go around the room quickly until he finds Rocklin
(as excited as a schoolboy) George Clews is in town
He's seen what you done to Bob and he's a- lookin' for you
They all look quickly toward the window
- -- from stagecoach office window
The center of the street is clear and men's heads are peering from doorways
'   - -- group at window, looking into street
The street is clear
Dave turns and looks curiously at Rocklin, who frowns impatiently
(to Dave irritably) Tell him 'll be out in the street in front of the saloon
(dashing out, radiant) Uh-huh
-  - The place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office
At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging doors
The bar supports other customers engaged in various private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of him
He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the others, but regards them all with disdain
He downs his drink, and speaks his thought to Bob
'm gonna get his ears
Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and halts with the swinging doors half open
(loudly) Hi you, George Clews -- George Clews turns
Rocklin says if you don't come out, he'll come in here after you, an' tear you apart
George Clews frowns
His eye catches sight of a king-size glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, standing alongside him
That quick, Clews beats Shorty to the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out
Cap, anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty
(taps Clews) That was my beer, you know
(nastily) If he comes in again -- 'll throw you
Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him struggling to get his hat off
The crowd resents this, but doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun in sight
(to the Clews) That does it, boys -- you know where the door is
(to Bob) Com-mon -- 'll get his ears
Not until  get my money -- George and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar
They have turned as Cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun
There's three drinks and a broken beer glass
(to Bob, after a second's deliberation) Pay 'im
George turns and starts for the doors as Bob comes back to the bar to settle up
'll get his ears
- (quietly) That Rocklin'll kill him for sure
Le's hope
-  - As George Clews steps outside, a mangy mongrel dog, basking close by, evidently recognizes him and tails it away, leaving George blinking at him
Rocklin --  George's
He is walking slowly forward down the middle of the street
George, looking baffled by the steady approach
(yelling) 'm coming -- and you'd better run
He steps down from the sidewalk into the street and then stands still again
Rocklin --    him as he comes slowly and steadily forward
George
His hands are on his guns, but drunk or not, he has too much sense to draw too soon
- -- Harolday watching from behind the window of his office
Behind Harolday are Julio and Arly
The latter makes a step as if about to move to the door, but Julio restrains her
'  - -- as Garvey, Miss Martin and Clara watch the scene below -- Garvey and Miss Martin excitedly and Clara in great distress
- -- men in hotel doorway, taut with excitement
Rocklin --   George, whose hands are on his gun butts
Rocklin's thumbs are hooked in his belt as he continues slowly forward, his eyes fixed on George's
(quietly) Draw a gun and 'll kill you
George, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed
Rocklin enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it crashing down alongside George's head
The barrel strikes though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole- axed steer
'   - -- group at window
Arly gives an involuntary exclamation of pleasure, which she instantly checks, then she moves abruptly out of shot, followed by Juan
Harolday continues to stare frowningly out of the window
'  - -- group at window, with Garvey obviously disapponted, Miss Martin bridling and Clara showing obvious relief
-  - -- Rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him offering congratulations
Dave pushes his way through the crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm
At the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and Jackson comes into shot
(to Rocklin) Hey, you
What's this you been up to
just laid a gun barrel over the head of a drunk friend of yours -- same as you did over Dave's here yesterday
(surprised) Eh
(blustering) don't know what you're talking about
(calmly) You're a liar
He turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside blusteringly
Now you lookee here, young feller
You go on talking that way and you'll find yourself in trouble
The crowd which has been following now begins to razz him openly
He turns and glares, but without effect
He gives a final shout to Rocklin
Don't say you ain't been warned
Pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street
as Miss Martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed by Clara, until she is face to face with Rocklin outside the stage office where Arly and Juan are mounted ready to move off
(ignoring everyone but Rocklin) saw you
saw you strike that poor man
Yes, ma'am
As hard as  could
You ruffian, you
Clara pulls her sleeve imploringly
Let me go
(to Rocklin) knew the sort you were the moment set eyes on you
You can't fool me
You're nothing but a common adventurer
Come, Clara
She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the hotel
Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and then up at Arly, who has been listening intently
She returns his look steadily for a second
Then, with a mocking smile, she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by Juan
He looks after her for a second; then with the same grim look, enters Harolday's office
'  - Harolday is standing at the window, looking toward the door, having seen Rocklin approaching
The door opens and Rocklin enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly interrupted
-- Now what was that you were sayin' about Caldwell
You being hired by Red Caldwell only confirms what 'd suspected -- he was getting ready to fight
(trying to get information) Fight
Who
Organized rustling
Well at least -- that's my belief
Red was no friend of mine
Too fond of taking the law into his own hands
But he had my sympathy
He'd been harder hit than any of us
And on top of it all, he lost his foreman
You mean, he quit on him
He was shot -- in the back -- with a bullet from the same caliber rifle as got Red
Got any ideas
No -- Except that the man you just pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere
(bitterly) Pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance
Rocklin realizes that maybe Harolday is trying to throw a curve -- trying to get him to talk
Say -- it don't sound as if it's goin' to be too easy for them wimmen at the
(watching him keenly) Want to go back and work for them
No, sir
And  ain't jumping at this offer o' yours either because  don't hold with working for wimmen
(quickly) Oh, you mean my step-daughter
Well don't worry
She won't interfere with you
Rocklin --  figure we've been losin' cattle over a place called Table Top -- it's the back way into the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route for rustlers -- 'm going to send you up to the line camp -- you don't mind working a lone hand -- do you
(measuring) --  like workin' that way
(rising and holding out a hand) Good -- be ready to move out this afternoon
-   - On Dave and Pap Fossler engaged in conversation in front of Pap's store
In the b
g
-- across the street, we carry the entrance to the Sun-Up Saloon
(in his best sales talk) -- now Pap -- 'm givin' you first call on me services
They's lots of other folks lookin' fer a good man, too -- you know
So if you want me, you better hurry and speak up because -- During Dave's speech Rocklin has come from the Sun-up carrying his valise
He pauses a moment, looking around
Dave sees him
'scuse me, Pap -- Be right back to find out when  start
He hurries across the street toward Rocklin
-  - On Rocklin just stepping off the curb
Dave comes in to him
Whar you off to
'm riding for the Topaz Ranch
They start across the street, slowly toward the stage office
What
-- Have you gone plumb loco
Good money -- sixty a month There ain't enough money in this town to make it worth your while to work for that gal
Rocklin gives Dave a quizzical look, which Dave mistakes for weakening
When she gits goin' she can be meaner'n a skillet full o' snakes
She ain't goin' to forget the way you made a fool of her today -- in front of the whole town
'  (
) Hey, Dave
Be right with you
(to Rocklin) It's pizen that's what it is -- jus' plain --- What you want to hang around this town for anyways
-- Dave and Rocklin have reached middle of the street
Pap Fossler's voice comes again from o
s
' Hey, Dave
Dave reacts with a squint in Pap's direction
He runs out toward Pap, but would rather stay with Rocklin Rocklin  the street To the stage office, where see Arly and Tala sitting on their horses apparently waiting for Rocklin
third horse is standing by with Rocklin's saddle on it
Rocklin, upon reaching the front of the stage office, pauses a moment, to look over the horse carrying his saddle -- glances up to Arly
Be right with you
He goes into the stage of office, as we - -- as Rocklin, Arly and Juan canter along a dirt road over open country with the mountain ranges in the distance
to show a buggy on the road ahead, approaching a wooded dell where the road divides
of the buggy, showing Miss Martin riding in front, beside Shorty Davis, who is driving, and Clara with her back to the driver, facing the oncoming trio
Miss Martin hears the sound of the approaching horses, and looks over her shoulder
Arly, Juan and Rocklin, with Miss Martin in
g
The latter scowls and looks quickly to her front as the riders draw level with the buggy, Rocklin coining to the right, alongside Clara
Good afternoon, Mr
Rocklin
(looking at the sky) Lovely day, isn't it
Reckon it is pretty nice
So you're moving in on the "
" eh
(hesitating and throwing a look toward Miss Martin) We-el, not exactly moving in
You see
with Miss Martin in f
g
and   her shoulder to include Clara and Rocklin
(acidly, locking straight ahead) Do you have to discuss our private affairs with every rag-tag-and-bobtail cow-person we meet, Clara
(in a low voice) Auntie
Sorry if  butted in, ma'am
Jest passing the time o'day
We can do very well without it -- thank you
(with a look over her shoulder) And you're keeping your lady friend waiting
Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction
from Rocklin's , with Arly and Juan at the fork in the road
They are looking back towards the buggy which has taken the lower road to the right of the copse
with Arly and Juan in f
g
and the buggy in the distance
Rocklin raises his hat to the women in the buggy and canters back to Arly, who has been watching with a peculiar expression
(coldly) thought maybe you'd changed your mind again
(cheerfully) Nope
She looks at him angrily for a second as if about to say something sarcastic
Then, repressing herself, she wheels her horse and canters off along the side of the copse
Rocklin throws an amused glance, at Juan, who has been watching with an enigmatic expression
He returns Rocklin's look with a stern, menacing frown
Then, with a gentle flick of the rein, he urges his horse after Arly
Completely baffled, Rocklin scratches his head for a second, then follows
-   - -- as the three canter up the driveway to a smart- looking ranch house
Arly dismounts and throws her reins to Juan
(over her shoulder to Rocklin) Juan'll show you the bunkhouse
'll talk to you about your duties in the morning
Before Rocklin can speak, she runs quickly up the steps of the verandah and disappears into the house
Leading Arly's Horse, Juan moves out of shot to the left of the ranch house and Rocklin follows
-   - -- as Juan comes into shot leading the mare, followed by Rocklin
They both dismount and begin to off- saddle
How far is the line-camp at Table- Top
Twenty-five -- thirty mile
'm moving out there first thing in the morning
(as Juan turns and stares) Boss' orders
Care to show me the way
There is a moment's pause
Then, what almost amounts to a smile of relief, crosses Juan's face
will show you
- -- as Rocklin and Juan ride out from the ranch through the early morning mist and turn off in the direction of the distant line of mountains
- -- as the two leave the open country and enter the mouth of a steep and narrow gorge at the foot of the mountain range
as Juan pulls up and dismounts, followed by Rocklin
(pointing ahead) The trail is straight ahead
You will find the cabin at the top
(turning back to his horse) Adios, Senor
(challenging, but perfectly friendly) Senor Romerez, it appears that you do not like me
For a second Juan does not reply
Then, as he speaks, he takes a tobacco pouch from his pocket
Rocklin, his mind on other things, does not take particular notice of the pouch, but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament -- a steer's head of hammered silver
(during the above business) Senor, that is true
do not like you
Why
(extending the pouch) Permit that  offer you a cigarette
Rocklin shakes his head
Juan, having spilled tobacco in a paper, now puts away the pouch and rolls his own
It is not your fault that your shadow is black
But you will only bring unhappiness to my senorita
do not blame you, but  fear  must hate you
He turns abruptly and mounts the waiting horse; then looks down from the saddle
Adios, Senor
He rides quickly out of the shot
- - -- as Rocklin forces his horse up the last few feet of the steep trail at the top of the canyon, and pulls up at the top of the rise with a look of amazement
-  ' rich meadow stretches ahead with a stream running through it, and a cabin at the far end
Steep escarpments surround the lush meadow land, making an idyllic scene
As Rocklin comes slowly into shot with the same look of startled appreciation on his face and begins to move toward the cabin, - -- of Juan, as he canters across open country toward the ranch
to include the road from Santa Inez along which approaches a smallish freight wagon, pulled by two horses
As the driver sees Juan and waves his whip, the Mexican swerves from his course and canters toward the wagon
wagon, which we now see is being driven by Dave
On the side of the wagon is written:  &   -- Pap Fossler and Sons
Juan canters into shot and pulls up alongside the wagon
Hiya there
Buenos dias, Senor Dave
(looking at name on wagon) You have found new employer, eh
Yeah
Haulin' freight for ole Pap Fossler
Got a letter here for that crazy galoot, Rocklin
(with a little Wink) From the little Caldwell girl
Seems mighty took up about sumpin'
Made me promise to deliver it personal
(indicates letter) But Senor Rocklin is not here
Lordy -- he ain't quit already
(shakes head) have just accompany him to Table- Top
- Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is discovered sweeping the front porch
Behind him we see Clint open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch to its edge when he looks o
s
as though searching for someone
Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with his sweeping
His only reaction is a disparaging glance over his shoulder
(turning to Shelley) Have you seen Arly
No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly today, but Ah seed her las' night, and she shore was mad
To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a whistle
Plenty mad
Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for him
Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune of the period
Clint's strained features relax in a can-that- be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o
s
From their  we first see only the corner of the house, while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side
Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and Shelley watching her
She seems more attractive, in a feminine way, this morning
It may be the skirt and blouse she is wearing
Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, adjusting in her hair
The presence of the two men suddenly startles her
The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall quickly away from the flower
As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life and resumes sweeping -- but furiously
Clint regards the girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is
(not too definitely) 'Mornin', Arly -- Arly is coming toward Clint
(pleasantly) 'Mornin', Clint
She steps close to Clint, and he slowly backs up a step, for he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her jacket lying on the ground near the step
(as Arly leans down to pick up the jacket) You must be feeling pretty good
Arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand, and the corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile
She turns now and starts along the walk, and takes only a few steps when Clint comes to her side
(as he joins Arly) Say, Arly -- about that poker game, night before last,  --- (tossing it off) Forget it
(did he hear correctly) Forget it
Arly pays no attention to Clint
She is looking o
s
and stops walking
- Tala, on his horse, as seen by Arly
Over the scene comes Arly's voice calling from a distance
(calling) Tala
Tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly different angle
Arly is looking o
s
toward Tala
Clint is now eyeing his sister up and down quite openly
She turns her head now and catches Clint looking her over
(after a stilted pause) Well -- (with a perplexed smile) What is this
-- gesture of his hand indicates the way Arly has gotten herself up
That quick, Arly's hand goes to the flower in her hair
And, that quick, she guiltily withdraws it
(bravely nonchalant) What do you mean
What do  mean
-- Before he can explain, Tala pulls up in his horse and we hear his voice over the scene
' Good morning, Arliete
, Tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl
Good morning, Tala
You have make yourself very pretty today
Arly is jolted by Tala's innocent remark, and she can't help giving Clint a little side glance in the way of reaction
Clint has not missed Tala's crack nor Arly's glance, and when she gives it to him he says: (pleasantly) See what  mean
He tosses her an altogether knowing look now, and leaves, going up the walk toward the house
Arly turns to Tala
Have my horse saddled and sent around right away -- will you
(then as a casual afterthought) You can have that Rocklin bring it
She glances over her shoulder toward Clint going up the walk
And then, looking back to Tala, finds he hasn't moved, but remains smiling down at her
What's the matter
(easily) Rocklin is not here
(breathlessly) He quit
He has gone to the line camp at Table Top
What
It was Mr
Harolday's orders
Arly looks away
Her eyes stare blankly into space as she struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment
Tala, aware of her plight, slowly dismounts and comes to the girl's side
(in a fatherly manner) Why do you make your heart heavy with thoughts of him, little one
-- He is not for you
(bitterly) Be quiet
He has made the choice, Arliete
With your own eyes you saw it yesterday
(impatiently) Oh -- And she, too, has opened her heart to him -- Already she has summoned him to her
(this turns her around) What do you mean
Dave -- of the white beard -- carries a letter to Rocklin -- It is from her
How do you know that
have just now met Dave, and he tell me
-- So now he rides to Table Top
Arly is quiet a moment
Little one you -- (quickly, as she starts for the house) Oh, leave me alone
entrance to ranch
Entering the driveway from the direction of Santa Inez, comes Harolday, still looking the distinguished citizen
- Good morning, Julio -- morning Arly
(to Julio as he dismounts) Fetch my briefcase -- it's on my desk
Julio exits
still smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin, seems lost in thought
After regarding her a moment Harolday speaks
Looks like we're going to get that land we've been wanting along the river bottom
Arly turns her eyes on Harolday, who continues
didn't tell you -- but  bought the mortgage on the Hardman ranch, and it's due today -- On my way over there now
Arly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly
Did you send that Rocklin to Table- Top
did
(furiously) Well, let's get things straight
This place was my mother's -- now it's mine and Clint's -- It's true you've been helping out -- but the way things are going we'll soon be able to pay you back every penny we owe
Meanwhile, 'm running this outfit and  expect to give the orders
You generally do
Why did you send Rocklin up to Table- Top
It seemed to me a good idea -- what with all this rustling going on -- Who'd ever try driving cattle over Table-Top
-- Unless they were crazy
(coldly) don't agree with you
In any case -- if you must have it -- 'd no intention of engaging a man at foreman's wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman
(dangerously) You take care what you're saying
(very controlled) It's you should take care, my dear
'm afraid there's one man you can't rawhide into jumping the way you want
You've made a fool of yourself over him once
Better watch out you don't do it again
He turns abruptly and walks off the verandah
as Harolday comes from the verandah to his horse
Juan is standing there with the briefcase which Harolday takes with a yank, mounts his horse and rides out
The     on Arly, who stands in furious silence watching Harolday ride away
- - Old Dave is jogging along in his wagon
rumble of thunder echoes through the canyon
Dave reacts with a look toward the sky
of storm clouds gathering
- - night shot of the mountain road near Table-Top
It is a wooded section of the plateau, and occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the big trees skirting the road
Dave, in his wagon, looms out of the b
g
, and as he nears the camera we hear him urging the team through the downpour
As he passes and continues hurriedly on his way, we - on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table
It is addressed to: Mr
Rocklin c/o Santee Ranch The    and Rocklin is revealed at the table, looking down at the letter
His hat is tipped back on his head, and his sleeves are rolled up
He is mixing dough in a bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are all gooey
Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where his outer shirt and socks are drying
It is dark outside, but the storm has abated
Rocklin goes to a shelf near the fireplace to get a pan
(during the above) Durn funny -- that storm quittin' just about the time  get here
No funnier than you sloggin' through it, just to deliver a letter from a woman
(disgustedly) Reckon 'm gettin' to be more of a fool the older  get
Dave watches Rocklin at the table shaping the dough for biscuits and putting it in the pan
When are we gonna get around to readin' it
Rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes himself in
Thought 'd wait till mornin' -- might be bad news an'  wouldn't be able to sleep
Dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his attention to his drying clothes
Rocklin, meanwhile, takes a flour sack from the table, wipes the dough from his hands and picks up the letter
He goes over to the fireplace, opening the letter the while, and sits on the bench
Dave, seeing this, edges discreetly around in back of Rocklin in order to see over his shoulder
The letter open, Rocklin takes out a roll of bills along with the folded message
He lays the envelope on the bench
Mmmm -- dineroo
Rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment, and opens the folded message
It begins with the usual Dear Mr
Rocklin
Rocklin's voice is heard over the insert as he reads from here
' (reading) Forgive me if this letter is a trifle incoherent, but  am terribly worried and unhappy
Who wouldn't be -- livin' with that ole screech owl
(continues to read) am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom  feel can trust, and  am appealing to you, because  regard you in the same way my Uncle surely must have
heartily dislike and distrust Judge Garvey -- (interrupting) Huh -- Smart girl -- (going on) But my Aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him, and now wants me to place all my affairs in the Judge's hands and return east
Such is certainly not my wish
(significantly) Looks kinda like she's formed an attachment
Rocklin glares up to Dave
(quickly) For the locality,  mean
(continues reading) wanted so much to give ranch life a trial, but fear circumstances are against me, especially in view of the recent Indian trouble -- (explosively) Indian trouble -- (in normal tone) Good Lord, they ain't been any Indian trouble around here in -- (caustically) You want to hear the rest of this
(getting the inference) Might's well -- come this far
(reading) want to apologize for what took place this afternoon
And  am returning the 150, because  feel it is rightfully yours
You must take it
Faithfully yours, Clara Caldwell
The letter finished, Rocklin regards it a moment, then slowly returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully into the fire
Dave meantime straightens up -- scratches his shaggy top, and turns his attention once more to his drying clothes
(feeling his socks) Well -- what do you make of it
Rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the letter back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a cigarette
Somebody's sure bustin' to get her out of there
Dave sits alongside Rocklin and begins putting on his socks
Indian trouble -- (after a pause) Wonder why the old lady's playin' along
(sourly) Baaa -- Wimmen -- Who can ever figure 'em
(pause) Got to admit though,  feel a mite sorry for the young'un -- nice little tyke
Too nice for this country
(after a slight pause) She's shore a pretty thing
Rocklin has been mulling things over
Don't know how  could help her -- even if  wanted to --  don't know any thing about this Garvey -- or Caldwell -- or -- Well, now --  could mebbe help you out some, there -- Fact,  could tell you somethin' 'bout ole Red that might be interestin'
You must have known him pretty well -- What kind of a man was he
Rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits
Dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer shirt
Caldwell
-- The best -- cantankerous cuss -- but a real cowman, believe me -- He was a big feller, like yourself -- Fact, you coulda passed fer a blood relation, come to think of it
(casually, as he busies himself with the biscuits) Was the Judge and Red friends
(anigmatically) That's what you'd say
Garvey managed all Red's business
Besides which they was regular drinkin' pals -- played poker together most nights -- tho' they do say Red got the worst of it
Red was a gambler, eh
Oh, yeah -- reckon a pretty poor one, tho' -- still you'd say him and Garvey was friends
(after a side glance to Dave) Anything ever happen to make you think they weren't
(moves close to Rocklin) Rock -- 'm gonna tell you somethin' ain't never told anybody
(with a slight smile) Think you can trust me
Dave grimaces his confidence
The last time  seen Red was the day he died -- In the pause Rocklin remains silent
-- 'Twas in town -- he jus' come out of the stage office
Tried to book passage to Garden City but couldn't on account  had a full load
-- Well, sir, he took me aside and give me a printed sheet of paper and says, "Read it
"  looked it over and fer as  could see it was a paper from one of them Chicago sportin' firms, tellin' how to manipulate trick playin' cards
Marked cards
(nods) Reckon so
-- Seems Red found some cards and this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night
Whose was it
Well, now that's just what  asked -- but all he said, was that it belonged to a good friend
Then he said he wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, but was ridin' over to see the district judge about it alone
That's when they got him
Yes, sir -- 'bout a mile or so from Stan's place
bullet in the back an' his pockets empty
How come you never told this before
Who was there to tell
-- Sheriff Jackson
-- Him an' Garvey's thick as thieves
How about what's his name -- Harolday
-- He's no friend of the Judge's, is he
Hates his guts -- sure riles him to see young Clint hangin' onto the Judge's coattails
All the same, jus' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open
(after a pause) Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin' about -- it don't follow that he killed him
No -- general opinion is that it was rustlers
Why would rustlers take the evidence Caldwell had with him
Rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as Dave talks
Looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards, you get the killer
(drinking) Funny tho' -- first the
foreman -- then Caldwell -- an' now these women
Lordy -- you ain't thinkin' somebody might try bumpin' them
(slowly, to himself) 'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried already -- (to Dave) Remember, when we stopped to change horses on the way Over from Garden City -- Shore -- you told me how Jackson and Clews tried to frame Stan
(nods) Yeah
Like they wanted to be sure he'd keep his mouth shut about something
Dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly under the large earthen jug of water
And layin' that gun across my skull -- an' offerin' to drive the coach themselves
- dark, mysterious figure on a horse raises his rifle -- - (nods) It was almost as if -- shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug on the shelf directly above Dave's head
The contents pour down on Dave and he topples over
Rocklin meanwhile has wiped the lantern off the table and ducked
They are both on the floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace
(going to Dave) You all right
(blustering) Will be if  ever get dry
Rocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two holes drilled by the bullet
Lookit that -- Good Lord -- Rocklin puts the hat aside -- crawls over to his gun belt -- straps it on
Come on -- He opens the door cautiously
Then sneaks out, followed by Dave
-  - Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness
Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl hoots in a near-by tree
The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the corral
Both men re-act
My team
Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time from another direction entirely -- and from a distance
That's not your team
He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave
and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at the edge of the clearing
Only the lower part of the animal is seen, along with the legs of the rider
And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent toward the deep blackness of the trees
Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- Dave close behind
Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again
Dave fires
The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night
Dave starts after him again
Looking back, he sees Rocklin has not moved
Come on -- No use -- he's gone
Mebbe we winged him
He starts through the wet grass alone
Rocklin turns back toward the cabin
- He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight embankment leads to the level of the trees
He is just starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something on the embankment, shining in the moonlight
It proves to be a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver
It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped
Dave pockets it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail
- He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses
and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form moving in the faint glow of the dying fire
- Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk
He sees the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in the light of the fire
He sees him suddenly stop and pick up something hidden from his view
At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut
The intruder whirls around
It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant
The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same cage
Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it
And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly -- but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his
When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist
He tries to open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand
But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses it across the room, where it lands on the bunk
Arly relaxes her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her feet
He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the floor
Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation
And Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any
He picks up his hat and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the bullet holes
(smiling wryly) Not bad shootin'
(right back at him) You think  did that
Sure -- to draw us away from here
(looks at his hat) You know, you cut it mighty close -- Good thing  ain't got brains enough to fill it
Rocklin puts his hat on
He sees Arly looking down at the torn letter
(suppressing smile) Too bad you had to come 'way up here through that storm for nothin'
(affectedly) haven't minded a bit -- (harshly) -- because  came up to fire you
Oh -- (nods) see
Rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag
Get out of here -- get off the Santee and don't ever come back
Mind if  wait for Dave
He ought to be along any minute -- Be funny if he winged that shadow of yours
If you mean Juan -- you're loco
He's not even up here
(mildly surprised) You came up alone
Yes
(half believing her) Then who was that we took out after
The man who shot at you
Rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up Arly's knife
Who was he
don't know
You mean you won't tell
mean  don't know -- Why should lie to you
That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklin's face -- a smile that says in effect -- "Are you kidding
" He gets up from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still holding Arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly casual manner
It passes too close to Arly for comfort and, Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back -- that close to his ear he feels the breeze
He looks at it, quivering in the door
Then, moving to Arly in what could be construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms and kisses her
Arly is caught completely unaware
Rocklin's action disarms her
But it is, after all, what she really wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine themselves around Rocklin's neck
In the middle of the kiss Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his neck and puts her from him
guess you forgot -- you jes' fired me
He goes to the bunk -- picks up his saddlebag, coat, etc
, and starts for the door
Arly has been silently watching
(turning near the open door) So long
Dave's voice is heard just outside the cabin door
' Hey, Rock -- Dave now rushes through the door, puffing and excited
-- He got away -- but guess what,  -- He sees Arly and pulls up abruptly
(slowly to Dave) You guess -- Rocklin gives Arly a disparaging side glance and starts out
(to Dave, who is trying to figure things out) Come on
- Rocklin is headed for the corral as Dave catches up to him
(glancing back to the cabin) Fer a man who's got a despise fer wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled up with 'em
- Arly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching the two headed for the corral
Her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly slams shut the door
As she turns and leans against it, we see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs
Her eyes light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously
-   - -- of Rocklin as he comes riding into town
As he nears the corner where the stage and Harolday's office is situated, the   , getting Rocklin and one of the Harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near the hitching rail
(as he dismounts) You work for Harolday
The man nods
Here's one of his horses -- 'll pick up my saddle later
He enters the building
'  - on Harolday as he sits at the desk working on a ledger
The sound of a door opening is heard
Harolday looks up casually as if expecting a customer, then suddenly gapes
to include doorway in which stands Rocklin
Howdy
(frowning) thought  sent you up to Table- Top
That's right
(slowly) What happened
(taking off his hat) Well, this, for one thing
He pokes a finger through the hole in the crown
Harolday's eyes narrow
(after a little pause) told you you'd regret letting that rat Clews off so easy
Rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying
What's the matter
Don't you think it was him, then
(slowly) been figgerin'
Don't seem reasonable Clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone
Besides -- how could he have known was up there -- that soon
And -- George Clews ain't the only one 've run contrariwise to in this town
There's that Mexican, for instance
Juan
He as good as told me yesterday that him and me was due for a run-in one of those days
(suddenly nodding toward window) And then there's him
Harolday looks sharply toward the window
-   - from office window
Clint is hurrying across from the direction of the Sun-Up Saloon toward the office
- on Clint as he enters from street and crosses to the door of Harolday's office
'  - on door of inner office with Harolday at desk in f
g
As the door opens it conceals Rocklin from Clint
(excitedly) just heard that -- that Rocklin was -- (sees Rocklin) (slowly) Was what
(subdued) Was shot at last night
(very calm) Mr
Rocklin was just telling me all about it
(significantly) Any idea who might have done it
Clint looks quickly at Harolday and back at Rocklin with frightened eyes
Not me
Rocklin makes no reply
You ain't trying to pin it on me
(his courage returning) 'Cause if you are, you're in for a big disappointment
was over at the Sun-Up playing poker with the Judge and the rest of the boys till early morning
If you don't believe me, ask for yourself
(after a pause) All right
believe you
But that don't mean you couldn't tell a thing or two as would help -- if you wanted
(very nervous again) What d'you mean
(sharply) Yes
What sort of thing would Clint here know about, that would help identify the man who tried to kill you last night
This for one
He pulls out the tobacco pouch which Dave found at Table- Top
Ever seen it before
Clint as he stares wide-eyed at the pouch
group, with Rocklin and Harolday both watching Clint intently
(harshly) Well, go on -- speak up
Did you ever see it before
(avoiding Harolday's eye) No
Course  didn't (suddenly raging at Rocklin) Quit riding me
don't know nothin' about it  tell you
Jest because had a run-in with you over a game o' cards, that don't mean 'd sneak up on you in the dark and
Rocklin's disdainful smile takes the speech out of Clint, who just sort of runs out of words
Rocklin hesitates for a second then moves toward the door
Harolday and Clint are at window looking past camera toward the street
They see Rocklin carrying his saddle, walking toward the Sun-Up
Shorty Davis hails Rocklin, says something to him and points to the Sun-Up
Rocklin leaves, walking faster
(frowning deeply) He means trouble
He turns from camera toward the desk
(still at window) Aw, what do  care
(turning on him with cold fury) Listen,  never did have much use for you
You're a poor specimen at the best; but as a would-be bad man you're nothing but a laughing stock
Why, the way you lied about that pouch just now wouldn't have deceived a six-year old
(harshly) All right, let it go at that
But got myself to think of
It wouldn't suit me at all just now to have you shown up in public for what you are by that trouble-shootin' cowhand
My advice to you is to get out of the district and stay out
(taking a key from his vest pocket) You'll find some money in the safe at the ranch
Take what you need and put the key in the desk drawer
Now get
- -  - Rocklin comes down the hall carrying his saddle and looking at the room numbers
As he nears the f
g
he locates the room he is looking for (it is a room facing toward the rear of the Sun-Up)
He knocks
Almost immediately the door opens and Clara stands there -- flushed and embarrassed
Oh, Mr
Rocklin -- '  - -  - This is the room in which Clara has arranged to meet Rocklin, who later takes it as his own
at door as Rocklin steps into the room
'm so glad 've found you --  was on my way to the Santee and learned you were in town
(putting his saddle, etc
, aside) Just got in
feel perfectly awful, running after you like this, but -- You got trouble, eh
My aunt found out  wrote you and made a terrible scene -- You haven't signed everything over to that Garvey, have you
No -- and because  refused, Auntie said she would sign an affidavit that 'm still underage, and then, as my guardian she can do what she likes
Got anything to prove you're not underage
(after a slight pause) No -- but Mr
Garvey has a letter that would prove it
My aunt wrote it before we came out here
'pose we could get it
He'd never give it to me
(starts for door) Wait here
(with a slight start toward Rocklin) Oh, please -- you -- (she hesitates, not quite sure what to say) You won't go getting yourself in trouble --  -- 'd rather give up everything --  mean -- Rocklin notes her confusion
He regards her with a slight sympathetic smile
Then opens the door and exits
'  - -- a letter written in a bold feminine hand
It reads: : In answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that my niece, Clara Caldwell, became of age January 11th of this year
And, although  am no longer her legal guardian, it behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest in her affairs -- The     for the letter to be read
And now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand
He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn
Garvey finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the stove
He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and smiles to Miss Martin
That takes care of that -- (crosses to his desk) Now, 'll draw up an affidavit right away and everything will be taken care of as we want it
(not too enthusiastic) certainly hope so -- it's not myself 'm concerned about -- (getting out the papers) -- Of course not
can't say 'm very happy about doing this --  only hope it works out for the best
It's the better choice of two evils -- now let's see -- (begins to write) , Elizabeth -- (looks at Miss Martin) It is Elizabeth, isn't it
Yes -- -- Elizabeth Martin, of Danvers, Massachusetts, do hereby -- The door opens and Rocklin enters
Miss Martin, who has been pacing nervously, stops in her tracks
Garvey, taken completely by surprise, feigns an affected casualness
Rocklin eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door
(leaning back in his chair) Well, Mr
Rocklin, this is indeed a surprise
Didn't expect to see you so soon
understood you were riding for the Santee
(coldly) That's right
It is quite obvious to Garvey that Rocklin is here on business
He turns to Miss Martin
(to Miss Martin) Perhaps you'd better come back later -- Miss Martin is in accord with that suggestion, and after giving Rocklin the frigid eye, flounces out, slamming the door
Garvey shakes his head, wipes his brow, and is returning to his desk
'  - -- door to Garvey's office
Miss Martin has her ear glued to the panels
Over scene comes Rocklin's voice
' came for that letter
Miss Martin reacts
'  - -- Garvey and Rocklin
(calmly) Did you say letter
That's right -- the one Miss Caldwell's aunt wrote from out east sayin' she was of age
Remember
No -- 'm afraid  don't
'  - -- door
Miss Martin reacts with nod of satisfaction and leaves
'  - Rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer marked "
" As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits back in his chair, watching
What is your interest in this letter
My only interest is getting' it
You realize what this is, don't you
-- Robbing -- armed robbery at that
Rocklin pulls open the "" drawer
warn you, you're in for a disappointment
Not finding the letter in the "" drawer, Rocklin goes to the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers
It is locked
Open up
(has had about enough) Listens, you -- (suddenly controls himself) There's nothing in there that'd interest you
(grimly) 'd like to make up my own mind about that
(forces a chuckle) All right -- 'll open it -- just to convince you 'm not hiding any letter
Garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it
It is found to contain nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards
The
Garvey seems a little too anxious to close the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand inside
Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin
What's the idea
Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks
These cards -- (attempting to bluff it out) Anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession
Depends on what kind they are -- 'specially when they're under lock and key
The two regard each other silently a moment
Now Rocklin casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket
(too politely) You're taking those,  presume
That's right
He takes a step away
Garvey turns him by touching his arm
(has had almost enough) Now, you look here -- (soberly) You're the one who better start lookin' -- lookin' for a way out for killin' Red Caldwell
(blanches) Caldwell -- (takes up one of the decks of cards) He found out about these -- and you went and killed him
(with an affected smile and unnatural calmness) And you believe a story like that
will until  hear a better one
(puts deck he holds, in his pocket) 'll just take this along -- the district judge at Garden City should be mighty interested
He starts around the desk toward the door
From the corner of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle drawer
Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove
Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury
The chair crashes against a window
'  - The sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers- by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy, the
China-boy
'  - The two are now fighting in earnest
of the fight, intercut with townspeople gathering outside
'  - Dave pulls up in his wagon
'  - It is pretty well wrecked
Rocklin has Garvey just about done in
He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes down and stays down
At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler enter followed by other curious natives
Say -- looks like you two been disagreein' 'bout somethin' -- (to Fossler, who has gone over to Garvey) He ain't daid, is he
Not permanently,  don't reckon
-- What happened, anyways
(to Rocklin) You musta found out somethin'
(with a wink to Dave) reckon the Judge did, too
They exit, and almost immediately Miss Martin enters, and after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place, sees the Judge, who, having regained consciousness, bestirs himself on the floor
Oh, dear -- dear -- are you hurt
(getting up painfully) Get out of my way -- Garvey, on his feet now, makes for the door leading to his living quarters at the back of the office
Miss Martin follows him
(haughtily) Now don't you use that tone of voice to me -- (going through doorway) 'll have you understand  -- She sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is, and backs out quickly, almost catching the door which Garvey slams in her face
-   - Rocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office
Dave has a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides
-- Find out who owns that tobaccy pouch yet
(staring straight ahead) No -- but get hold of Clint Harolday
Clint -- Is he in on it
Can't say for sure -- Bring him to the Sun-Up, and don't take no for an answer
Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage office
Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up
-  - Juan is lounging against the corner of the building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach
As Rocklin comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as though deciding whether or not to question him
During this, Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his pocket and begins to roll a cigarette
The   Rocklin to the side of the building and up the outer stairs
- -  - Rocklin comes through the door and down the hall
He reaches his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a familiar voice inside
He listens
' -- So now you know the truth
And if you think you can steal him away from me, you're welcome to try it
Rocklin frowns and enters
'  - -  - Rocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as he focuses his attention on Arly
Clara, who has been sitting in the rocker near the window, gets up and is the first to speak
(anxiously) Did you get it
Rocklin closes the door
No -- but  don't think it's gonna matter much -- you go on back to the and 'll be out in the mornin' and take you with me to Garden City to see the district judge
But  hate putting you to that trouble
No trouble at all -- 'm going anyway
(casually) You look like you've been fighting
(soberly) What are you doin' here
was just telling Miss Caldwell about -- well -- you and me
(his eyes narrowing) What about, you an' me
(sensing the static in the atmosphere) think 'd better be going
(turning quickly from Arly) Just a minute -- (glances at Arly) What all has she been tellin' you
(embarrassed) Oh -- oh, really 'd rather not -- (interrupting) Go ahead, tell him -- (looks at Rocklin and goes on defiantly) -- and  dare him to deny it
Deny what
That she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains
Well -- why should  deny it
(quickly) And didn't you make love to me
(this is getting a bit thick for him) Make love to you -- (forcing her point) You didn't kiss me --  suppose
Did you expect me to deny that, too
(smiles at Clara) You see
(to Clara) Now, maybe you ought to hear what 've got to say -- Clara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown-up about it
Please -- you needn't explain
After all, it really isn't any of my business, is it
(in the pause he looks at Arly) You little -- (quickly) That's it -- start swearin'-- (to Clara) Just like a man
If there wasn't a lady here, 'd do more to you than swear
don't know how  can ever thank you for trying to help me
do appreciate it ever so much -- (to Arly) Don't think too harshly of me, will you --  -- Clara can say no more without breaking
So she turns away quickly and hurries out the door
Rocklin does a slow burn as he glares at Arly
(sincerely -- after a pause) She's lovely, isn't she
-- So sweet -- honest, and helpless
Rocklin makes no reply
Pity you didn't fall in love with her, instead of me
Arly is being ridiculous now
He ignores her remarks and concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may have sprained it slightly in the fight
You might's well know right now that you or no woman is ever goin' to get me
Don't be so sure --  don't think 'm doin' so badly
Don't you
Don't you know
know there ain't a dirty trick you wouldn't play to get what you want
(smiling) always get what  want
She takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her
-- See
(opens the door) -- 'Bye now -- The door closes
Rocklin stands a moment
Now curiosity brings him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds it
'
The torn pieces have all been sorted and pasted together on a sheet of paper Rocklin holds the letter
He is mad
He shakes his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost
He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket
Takes off his gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and stretches out on the bed, as we - Clara hurrying toward the front door in a suppressed state of excitement
She has presumably just arrived at the ranch in advance of Miss Martin
She enters the house after a glance toward the gate
-   - Clara enters hastily and beats a path to the door of her room
'  -   - The door flies open
Clara bursts in, closing the door in the same movement
Her eyes swing to someone o
s
and she freezes to the spot
Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening
She has not taken the time to remove her hat
After a moment's pause, she moves slowly toward Clara
The    her into a
Clara, her back pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more terrified at the other's approach
Miss Martin appraises the girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across the face
Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt
(quietly but viciously) Whatever is to become of you
Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell
Have you no sense of pride, or decency
Throwing yourself at that -- that wretch, like any shameless hussy
Clara hasn't moved
thought we'd done with him -- but no -- you have to run to him and tell him all our business -- Clara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin, thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now
Don't you dare deny it -- you know very well you told him about that letter  wrote Mr
Garvey
Clara remains silent
Didn't you
-- Clara, now utterly broken, moves away
Miss Martin, her eyes still rivited on the girl, follows
Didn't you
'  - The office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight
Garvey is discovered near the window
He has cleaned himself up but bears some evidence of the fight
He is reading a letter as Sammy, the
China-boy, stands waiting near the door
The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss Martin already seen in the previous letter: Mr
Garvey, have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to have you investigated
thought you had better know about it
Garvey puts the message in his pocket as he addresses Sammy
Tell Miss Martin that 'll take care of everything
-- You take clare of evelything
'  - On Rocklin, stretched across the bed, examining the cards in the light of a lamp
-  - Garvey comes from around the building's corner and peers furtively through the darkness toward the lighted windows of Rocklin's room
-   - The area in front of the Sun-Up
Dave's wagon pulls up to the hitching rail in front of the saloon
Clint, stripped of his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him
They get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner of the building
-  - Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's window
We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun- Up's second floor
He starts up the steps and stops almost immediately and stares o
s
From Garvey's  as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around in front of the building toward the stairway
Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position around the roar corner
He watches the two men approach the stairway and go up
He moves out of the shot now, going toward the street
The   on the corner, and we see Tala come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a moment before
It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of the scene
'  - -  - on Rocklin asleep
He is fully dressed, as we last saw him, with the exception of his boots
He is stretched full length on top of the covers
His gun-belt still hangs over the rocker, close to the open window
knock on the door brings him to a sitting position
Come in -- door as Clint enters reluctantly, followed by the triumphant Dave
Here he is, Rock
Caught him jist in time near the Santee
Headed fer out, 'd say
Sit down, Clint
(to Dave, as he reaches into his pocket) How about goin' down below an' havin' one on me
He tosses Dave a coin, who catches it
Then Rocklin puts on his boots
(delighted) Well, now -- that's right thoughtful -- Holler if you need me
Dave exits
(belligerently, as he stands near the window) What's this all about
(calmly, as he stands up) It ain't gonna do you any good to get all het up and tough, kid -- Rocklin begins rolling a cigarette as he moves toward Clint
just want to ask you a few questions -- that's all
-  - An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness toward the outer stairway
As it nears the stairway, the so that as the mysterious figure begins stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the rungs
The           of Juan, across the alley
And now through Juan's eyes we watch the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear portion of the verandah
'  - -  - Rocklin finishes rolling his cigarette and lights it
told you once,  don't know who owns that pouch-- and  don't know who shot you
(calmly) Forget it -- that's not what  want to talk to you about, anyway
(harshly) Well, what do you want to talk about
Come on, get it over with
-   -  - The mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along the verandah and is nearing Rocklin's lighted room -- stops close to the open window
'  - -  - -- Rocklin and Clint
Clint --  want you to tell me why Garvey murdered Red Caldwell -- Clint tenses -- stares -- finds breathing difficult
You know -- don't you
(shaking) Me
No
Oh yes you do
(advancing on him) And you're going to tell me all about it
don't know nothing,  tell you -- -- Rocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off balance, then grabs him by the shirt front
Talk
tell ya,
(hitting him again) Talk
Completely terrified, Clint opens his mouth as if about to speak
Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes
Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction
window
gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is hanging over the chair
Clint and Rocklin
The latter is still looking toward the window
With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head
As Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a triumphant smile
Suddenly his expression changes
(in a hoarse scream) No
No, don't
There is a shot from o
s
and Clint's hands go to his stomach
With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor
window
The hand of the killer pitches the gun toward Rocklin and disappears
- -  - Lined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and a few others
Cap is in his usual place
At the poker table are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others
The shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward the ceiling, as are others
Now Dave snaps back to life -- gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs
As he starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction
'  - -  - Rocklin is on the floor, groggy
He shakes his head, and as his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his feet as Dave rushes in
Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in Rocklin's hand
He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out
All he can do is stare and grimace
The sound of hurrying feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, crowding the room and the hall
Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels over Clint
During this, there are general ad libs from the crowd
What happened
Who is it
Clint Harolday -- Etc
Where's Doc Riding
Get the Doc
Hey, Doc -- He was down below
Here he is
Doc's voice is heard from the hall as he makes his way through the jam
' Here  am -- Look out, men -- Let the Doc through
Etc
Doc riding comes through the crowd, kneels beside Pap Fossler
He needs only a glance to know he can be of no use
(breaking the silence) Somebody better fetch Harolday
Shorty's already gone for him
(getting up) Better get Arly, too
voice is heard from the hall
She was at the hotel a while ago
(looking down at Clint and shaking his head) He was only a kid
Rocklin, still holding his gun as he stares down at Clint's body o
s
Now he studies the faces of the mob
of the crowd
There is nothing but a sea of hostile faces
' What's goin' on here -- gang way -- The crowd parts to admit Jackson, who comes stalking in followed by Judge Garvey
What's the trouble here -- He stops abruptly as he sees Clint's body
Now he levels his eyes on Rocklin
(with a bitter smile) warned you, didn't
-- Well, guess this is the last trouble you'll ever make in this town
(extending his hand) Hand over that gun
Just a minute, now -- He steps back so no one is behind him
And there is something about his manner and tone that urges Jackson to use discretion
(to the crowd, generally) know it looks bad -- but  didn't kill the kid
The crowd stares in skeptical silence
Even Dave thinks Rocklin is lying, and now does his best to protect his friend
believe you
(to the others) His gun was layin' over there on the floor when  come in and -- (cutting in) No it wasn't -- It was right in my hand -- like it is now
Dave winces
If you didn't know him -- then who did
don't know -- (looks at garvey) But 'm going to find out
- -  - Harolday, followed by Shorty Davis, is making his way down the hall from the inner stair landing
As he nears the crowd gathered at Rocklin's door, Juan comes into view down the hall, having just entered through the door leading out onto the verandah
(as he nears Rocklin's door) Where is he
-- Where's my boy
'  - -  - Harolday enters, over the ad libs of the mob, followed by Shorty Davis
During the following action, Juan enters and stands near the door, silently taking in everything
Harolday, as he sees Clint's body and stops dead in horror
He turns to Rocklin
(with cold violence) You murderer
didn't do it, Mr
Harolday
(quickly) Then who did
(from crowd) He had a gun in his hand when we come in
(smoothly) And 'll bet it's the same one the bullet that killed Clint came out of
Rocklin gives Garvey a hard, slow look
Well, what do you say to that
He's right
You admit it
Yeah -- but that still don't say killed him
Aw, take him away -- Liar -- Lock him up, Sheriff -- The yellow-bellied -- Etc
She stares down at Clint
An expression of pity comes over her
Now she looks coldly at Rocklin
(softly) Why did you do it
with Rocklin in f
g
didn't
He admits it was his gun that shot him
(whose eyes haven't left Rocklin's) But you didn't fire it
That's right
What happened
(slowly) Clint and me was having a bit of an argument
(quickly) What about
(searching for words) About whether he was going to help clear up a few things that's been bothering me and some others 'round these parts
(looking at Garvey) For instance -- who it was shot Red Caldwell
Caldwell
(still at Garvey) And the
foreman
And who took that shot at me up at Table-Top last night
And why certain people are so anxious to get rid of the Caldwell girl
How would Clint know about all that
(harshly) He's lying
He's trying to cover up for killing my boy
(encouraged by the support) Quit stalling, Rocklin
He makes a tentative movement toward Rocklin but Arly intervenes
Wait a minute -- he's get a right to be heard
(to Rocklin) Well, we're listenin'
Well -- Clint was getting' all set to talk, when -- somebody snuck up along the verandah there and pulled the gun out o' my belt
(indicating the belt on chair) and let him have it
There is a moment's amazed silence
Then the crowd breaks into derisive comment
What a story
What an alibi
String him up, the heel
Etc
(grinning) You'll have to think up something better than that Rocklin
with Garvey in f
g
(smoothly) Don't be a fool, Rocklin
You know you can't get away with a yarn like that
Why don't you save yourself and everyone else a lot of trouble by surrendering to the Sheriff
After all, it isn't such a crime in these parts to kill a man in self-defense
Self-defense
Everyone knows what Clint was like
He probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you, like he did at the Sun- Up that night
Wasn't that it
(grimly; after a little pause) No, that wasn't it
And till  do what  got to do,  ain't surrenderin' to anybody -- least of all to your pal here
(indicates sheriff) If  got to be shot for knowing too much, it ain't going to be in the back, in a framed-up jail-break
Arly, who has been staring at Rocklin in frowning bewilderment
But if someone's trying to kill you, why didn't they do it just now
Why did they have to kill Clint
Rocklin
Guess they wanted to get Clint, too
Doin' it this way they get us both
Clint first -- an' me afterwards -- like  jus' said
with Garvey in f
g
Close beside him are Pap and Dave, who watches Garvey closely
Quit fancy talk
Who's "they
" might be able to tell you that later
(quickly) No you won't -- because you're comin' with me
(raises his gun) Am
The crowd tenses
Rocklin eyes them grimly
The first one that moves -- gets it
He moves over to the open window, and with his gun leveled on the mob, steps out onto the verandah
Once outside, he suddenly lets the window fall and disappears
shot from Jackson's gun shatters a pane, during which time there has been a rush to the window
It is Arly and Dave who reach it first, and feigning an attempt to raise the window, they momentarily delay pursuit
There is the inevitable jam as the pushing, yelling crowd all try to exit at once
-  - Rocklin, as he picks himself off the ground, having dropped from the verandah
He starts quickly away
'  - the room, we see Arly and Dave shoved to one side by Jackson and Garvey
The window goes up and Jackson steps out, followed by Garvey, Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others
- -  - The human jam has been broken, and now the mob dashes wildly toward the stairway, and verandah exit in the b
g
-  - The hitching rail in front of the Sun-Up
There are a dozen or so horses tied up to it and close to it is Dave's team and wagon
Rocklin comes from around the corner of the building and races to the hitching rail
Jackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others
At the stairs they collide with some of the men who have raced down the hall, only to reach the stairway at the same moment
There is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down at once
He has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail
We see him cutting the last line and fire into the air
The horses rare and stampede
-      - And now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and horses rush in all directions as the men try to retrieve their mounts
Rocklin is no where in evidence
-      ' (sarcastically) Well, Sheriff -- you certainly are to be congratulated
(harassed) Look, Mr
Harolday -- you saw what happened -- (deeply concerned) Never mind that -- Let's get going for Garden City -- that's where he's headed for
You sure
'm positive
Dave climbs into his wagon behind the group as Jackson exits quickly
-   - At hitching rail
There are four or five horses tied up here
Arly and Juan enter and mount their horses, and almost immediately Garvey and Harolday come hurrying into the scene after two of the other horses
(shouts from her horse) Where do you think he's gone
Before either of the two men can answer, Jackson's voice is heard shouting o
s
' All right, men -- follow me -- The   , getting Jackson, now mounted, as others come riding in
He rares his horse around and starts away followed by the mob, including our principals
They do not get very far when Dave's wagon comes into the shot, going hell-bent in pursuit
- The posse riding hard, with Dave's wagon following
Dave, half standing as he urges his team on
Behind him are the closed flaps of the wagon top
as a hand reaches out from between the flaps and grasps the reins
Dave takes it, and looks wildly around -- falls back on the seat
- to include Dave, smiling broadly
Rocklin is pulling hard on the reins
mighta knowed you'd do somethin' like this
(as Rocklin slows the team) What are we doin'
Headin' for the
With that Rocklin starts swinging the team around
-   - Sammy, the China-boy, is nervously knocking on Miss Martin's door
It opens and Miss Martin is seen slipping a robe over her long Mother Hubbard nightgown, with cap to match
(impatiently) Now -- what is it
Sammy points o
s
-- Miss Martin looks and freezes
As she moves down the hall, the    her until it gets two men standing near the entrance door
Now the        and we recognize George Clews and his brother, Bob
Bob, his wrist bandaged, takes off his hat at Miss Martin's approach, and George noticing, does likewise
The name's Clews, ma'am -- Mr
Garvey sent us out -- (eagerly) Said you were expectin' trouble with that Rocklin
am
(acidly to George) -- But 'm wondering if you're up to it
noticed you didn't fare so well with him yesterday
He was drunk -- (quickly) Yeah -- But 'm sober now
Well, see that you stay that way
Don't worry, ma'am -- 've jus' bin waitin' to get even with that saddle- bum
He opens the door
(with that oily smile) We'll be close-by
(confidently) You bet
They start out
'  -   - Clara is seen in her nightgown, listening at the door to her room
The sound of the outer door closing comes over the scene and she hurries to her bed and feigns sleep, and just in time, for the door opens and Miss Martin sticks her head in, and satisfied that Clara is sleeping, exits
-     - raspy voice is heard coming out of the darkness singing a ribald song of the periods
And now Old Zeke, riding his burro, comes into view
As he passes close to the camera, we and get the posse coming out of the darkness in the opposite direction Zeke is travelling
As the posse pulls up to Zeke, the    on a group including Zeke, Jackson, Garvey, Harolday
Seen anybody ridin' hard for Garden City
Bin on the road since sundown -- ain't seen a livin' soul -- be he man or beast
He mighta taken the cutoff through Jaw Bone Canyon
After that storm
-- He'd never make it
There's only one other place he might have gone -- the
You think so
(very definitely) 'm positive
That's what you said before
(shouting to the posse milling around) To the
, men
The posse swings around and starts back toward Santa Inez
Arly watches the posse, then turns to Juan
(excitedly) Take me through the canyon
It is dangerous, senorita
But if we get through we'll beat them to the
You would risk your life for Senor Rocklin
Arly does not answer in words
But Juan sees the answer in her eyes
Now she tosses her head defiantly and swings her horse off the road in the direction of the canyon
Juan watches a moment, then spurs his mount after her, as we '  -   - On Clara, tossing fitfully in her bed
Suddenly she sits up as an idea begins to take form in her mind
Now she hurries out of bed, moves stealthily to the door and goes out, leaving her door open
-   - door to Miss Martin's room
Clara comes down the hall to the door
She puts her ear close and listens
Now she opens it cautiously and peers inside
The door to her room is slammed o
s
by a sporadic draft
It startles the girl and she quickly closes Miss Martin's door and hurries away
- the posse, riding hell-bent
- Arly and Julio, as they slowly pick their way along the difficult trail, skirting a roaring torrent
Julio is leading and close behind him Arly is having a time negotiating the unsteady ground of a landslide
She notices Julio staring o
s
and slowly shaking his head
Afraid
Julio nods his head slowly, deliberately
Only for you -- you must not do this -- will go through from here alone
faint smile of admiration brushes Arly's face
No, -- we're going through together
Arly lashes her horse away
Julio realizes the futileness of further pleading and now moves his horse out after Arly
- The wagon with Dave and Rocklin coming out of the night
Dave is driving the team for all it is worth
Rocklin is looking back
He turns to Dave
You can ease up now
We're just about there
- wooden gate is swung closed across the roadway
On the gate is a crudely printed weather-beaten sign:
Over the scene comes the  of the wagon approaching
Rocklin hops out, opens the gate
Dave drives the wagon through
As Rocklin lets go the gate, it swings closed of its own accord
-   - The shed is a short distance from the Caldwell house
Bob Clews is standing at a corner of the shed looking o
s
Over the scene comes the  of the wagon
(peering into shed) Hey, George -- George, get up
- The wagon moving slowly through the cottonwoods, along the drive not far from the house
It stops now, and the to get Dave and Rocklin as they leave the team and start stealthily toward the house seen in the moonlight in the b
g
'  -   - We pick up Clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat in the dim light of a small lamp
She is fully dressed, and once the hat is on, she looks around anxiously for her top coat which she finds in the closet
She takes the coat and starts hurriedly toward the lamp, sitting on a small taboret near the door
As she bends over to blow it out, her eyes raise and she freezes
Now she snaps the door closed without removing her eyes from Clara, and starts forward
The    to include the two
Clara stands as one under an hypnotic spell
(in a very low tone) You vile, ungrateful strumpet -- running away in the night, like a deceitful sneak-thief -- (unrestrained) Yes -- 'm running away -- and it's all your fault -- you're the one who's been deceitful and sneaking -- and don't think  don't know what you intend doing
(very controlled) -- And don't think  don't know what you intend doing
(crying, as she moves away) don't care -- 'm not ashamed of it -- and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me
(hardly above a whisper) You little fool -- if you go to Garden City with that man -- you stand to lose everything
(stops pacing) But why
-- Why are you being so secretive
-- If you know something, why don't you tell me
(nods and mumbles to himself) Yeah -- why don't you
-- Rocklin quickly shushes Dave
(Unmindful of the presence of the men) All right, 'll tell you -- Rocklin is a nephew of the late Mr
Caldwell
And, as nearest of kin, he stands to get everything -- according to the will
Because you are not the old man's niece, but only his grand-niece
-   - - ' Rocklin turned up unexpectedly -- ' And you and Mr
Garvey knew the truth all the time
' Yes
If Dave keeps quiet any longer he'll burst
He spins Rocklin around and speaks in his natural voice
-- And you knew the truth all the time, too -- didn't you
-- No wonder you stuck around -- From Rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to Dave that he is right
Both women are staring dumbly toward the window
Now the realization that she has been overheard staggers Miss Martin
She utters a stifled scream and, seeing Rocklin starting through the window, runs from the room
-     - Get in here and take care of her
Dave scrambles through the window and hurries in pursuit of Miss Martin
Rocklin is at Clara's side
- Bushes near the house
George and Bob Clews are crouched, watching
Come on -- They move out
- The posse riding hard
- We see Arly and Julio as they descend a steep embankment toward the raging torrent
They both are riding Julio's horse
Arly and Julio; Arly seated behind Julio, considerably disheveled and sobbing
(comfortingly) You are crying, senorita --
(lying bravely) No
(knows she is) It is too bad we lose your horse
She was good horse, for sure
If only we make it in time
As they move away into a longer shot, a huge boulder comes crashing down the canyon side, across their path, and tumbles with a great roar and splash into the torrent
'  -   - Clara is talking feverishly to Rocklin
-- And  heard one of them tell my aunt not to worry, that he was just as anxious as she was to get even with you
Dave enters from the hall carrying Miss Martin over his shoulder
He has her wrapped in a sheet and bound up in tassled curtain cord
(as Clara and Rocklin react) This is the only way  could handle her
The Clews are around here some place -- Garvey sent 'em out
George and Bob Clews at the window
George has his gun leveled, and a dirty smile twists his face
You bet we're around
The    as George Clews climbs into the room, followed by Bob
They disarm both Rocklin and Dave as Clara watches helplessly, and Miss Martin struggles in her wrapping
(to Bob) Untie her
(to Dave) Untie her
Dave puts Miss Martin down and begins undoing her as Bob covers him with his gun
- The posse riding
-   - Arly and Juan leave the hazardous trail behind and now start across the flat on a run
'  -   - Dave has unwrapped Miss Martin and she gets to her feet bristling
(to Bob) Now tie him up
(indicates Dave) (quickly, as she picks up the tassled cord) 'll take part in this -- you -- you hairy beast
Bob Clews tosses the sheet over Dave's head
And as Dave struggles, Rocklin thinks he has George off guard and makes a pass at him
But George is on the alert and strikes Rocklin on the head with his pistol
She utters a choked cry and falls to the floor in a faint
as Miss Martin comes to Clara and kneels beside her
Help me get her to the bed
of the room
Bob Clews has Dave securely tied, and now assists Miss Martin in getting Clara to the bed
(indicating Rocklin on the floor) What'll we do with 'em
Take them in to Mr
Garvey and tell him  must see him at once
(triumphantly) We'll dump them right in the Judge's lap
George Clews picks up the unconscious Rocklin
(still administering to Clara) Hadn't you better tie him, too
(to Bob, after a second's pause) Get some more rope
Bob hurries to do so
- The posse riding
- Dave's wagon
Bob Clews is seen dumping Dave into the rear of the wagon
George Clews stands near him with Rocklin's unconscious form over his shoulder
Now he puts Rocklin in
Get our horses and meet me at the gate
Bob runs after the horses
George gets onto the wagon seat -- swings the team around and heads for the gate
- Arly and Juan riding hard
- George Clews sits in the wagon waiting for Bob, who now comes out of the darkness with their horses
He dismounts, ties the horses to the back of the wagon, comes around in front to the gate
He is about to swing it open when he looks past the camera at Arly and Juan, who now pull up to the outside of the gate
Arly dismounts quickly, her gun in her hand
Bob Clews backs up toward the wagon as Arly walks through gate
of Arly
George Clews on the wagon seat
He is smiling and is going to try to bluff it out
(to Arly) What are you doin' with that gun, Arly
Arly
Get down from there before  show you
- Rocklin has regained consciousness and listens
' Now listen, Arly -- this ain't your wagon -- ' Neither is it yours -- Get down out of there -- before  knock you down
Rocklin recognizes Arly's voice
Now he raises himself up over the tailboard and falls out
- The horses tied in back shy as Rocklin falls to the ground
- Arly, as she takes it and starts toward the rear of the wagon
-     - - He no more than gets it out when a knife whirls in from o
s
, getting him in the small of the back
He sits calmly astride his horse, his gun leveled on George Clews
- Arly is cutting the rope binding Rocklin
-- And they're headed this way and should get here any minute -- Rocklin gets to his feet
Arly notices something shining on the ground where Rocklin lay
She picks it up
It is the tobacco pouch with the steer's head of hammered silver
Where'd you get this
(taking the pouch) That belongs to the man who shot at me on Table-Top -- Dave found it
- On Dave's Wrapped form, kicking the wagon tailboard
Arly's head appears between the flaps above the tailboard and as Dave groans and kicks, she takes her knife and slits the rope binding him
- Rocklin has come to George clew and we see him wrest the gun from his hand and yank George down from the wagon seat
Once down, he lets him have a hard right that sends him sprawling
They start fighting viciously
Arly rushes in crying wildly
(trying to stop Rocklin) You've got to get away -- they'll be here -- they'll catch you -- Rocklin
There is but one thought in his enraged mind -- Clews
He tears into him again
(frantically) You've got to stop him -- he's got to get away
- - The posse approaching
- Rocklin, Arly, Dave, Rocklin is about done in from the fight
(anxiously) Come on -- let's git goin' -- (as he walks to wagon) Where's the girl
Back at the house -- We've got to get her
You haven't time -- they're coming -- don't you believe me
-- (to Dave) Come on -- Arly's plea goes unheeded and he starts away toward the house on the run
(mutters) Stubborn as an ole mule
(shouts) You're puttin' a rope around your neck -- Dave runs after Rocklin
- Get him -- (indicates Bob Clews) -- out of sight, and follow me
She takes up the reins now and swings the team around and off the road into the thickness of the trees
- Rocklin and Dave
They are approaching the house warily
(softly) But what'll we do with the ole lady
Anything you like
'd like to pizen her
- Arly is seated on the wagon seat looking toward the gate as Juan comes in on his horse
(pointing o
s
) Look
- At gate
The posse rides up
The gate is swung open and they ride through
- At wagon
Arly jumps to the ground and speaks to Juan
Come on
As she starts toward the house, Juan dismounts and follows
- The posse comes riding in
Jackson, Garvey, Harolday, and a few others dismount and go toward the door
as they move stealthily into a spot shielded by undergrowth, which gives them full view of the front and one side of the house
'  -   - Miss Martin is coming into the room with a glass and a pill for Clara, who is still stretched on the bed
If you'll just take this -- you'll go to sleep -- The sound of someone knocking on the front door comes over the scene
Miss Martin exits hurriedly
- At front door
Miss Martin opens the door, confronting Jackson and the group
She is bewildered
Evenin' ma'am -- hate to bother you like this, but -- (seeing Garvey, interrupts) 'm so glad you've come, Mr
Garvey, the most awful -- (as though seeing the crowd for the first time) -- Why -- what are all these people doing here
We're after Rocklin -- has he been here
(smugly) Oh yes -- here and gone
What
(astounded) Gone -- (triumphantly) Yes -- the two men you sent out are taking him and that horrid old man back to town
The Clewses -- funny we didn't see them
Somethin' musta gone wrong -- We better fan out and see what's goin' on
(quickly) Don't leave, Mr
Garvey -- 've got to talk with you, privately -- As all but Garvey and Harolday go back to their horses, Garvey speaks
But, madam -- It's very important
Garvey looks at Harolday in a manner evidencing his distaste and impatience
We'll go on and meet you in town
Perhaps you'd better
(calls to Jackson o
s
) 'll meet you in town, Jackson
' Right -- come on, men
The sound of running horses comes over the scene as Harolday hurries away and Garvey enters the house
He starts to mount, but instead leads the horse into the bushes close to where Juan and Arly are watching
- -   - Miss Martin and Garvey have been talking
Garvey paces nervously
(quickly, as he turns to Miss Martin) -- And you're positive he knows everything
Absolutely everything -- He was standing at the window all the time -- the scoundrel
'  -   - Rocklin has his ear glued to the door
He can't help but smile at Miss Martin's reference to him
Dave is behind the curtain at the window, watching the outside
Clara is close to Rocklin
(whispers) You better get back on the bed -- in case they come in here
Clara tiptoes away
- Arly and Juan, as they watch Harolday approach the house and go to the hall window
-   - Garvey and Miss Martin
Garvey is still pacing very nervously
He is trying to think of his next move
If you were to ask me,  think the best thing to do is -- Garvey stops and glares
(irritably) 'm not asking you -- and don't bother me with your silly questions -- we've got to do something besides talk
(drawing herself up) You mean -- you have to do something
Garvey stops and looks at her again
-- This was all your idea, remember
(tossing it off) My idea -- that's all you know about it
' It is open and Rocklin stands there looking o
s
If there's anybody else in on it -- speak up, Judge
-  - Well --  do declare -- She can say no more
Rocklin steps away from the door, where Dave and Clara now stand
He has Garvey covered
Dave is pointing his gun, and grimacing at Miss Martin
- At hall window -- on Harolday watching
-   - Garvey is stepping back, in a cold sweat, toward Miss Martin, as Rocklin advances toward him
(to Garvey, quite casually) Talk
Miss Martin opens her mouth, about to speak
of Dave
(blasting, to Miss Martin) Not you
Miss Martin
Her mouth snaps shut like a trap
Garvey, Rocklin, Miss Martin
Rocklin takes the tobacco pouch out of his pocket
(to Garvey) Ever see that before
(blanches) No -- it's not mine
Tell me whose it is
(shaking) No -- no --  don't know -- - Harolday at hall window
He raises his gun -- he is about to fire when a knife whirls out of nowhere and sticks in the window frame, inches from Harolday's head
He spins around and stares wildly here and there at the darkness
-  ' There is no one in evidence
' Drop that gun
-   - He drops the gun
Arly and Juan come in to him
Arly has him covered
The    to a  , getting the front door as it is opened by Rocklin, who evidently heard Arly
Arly is prodding Harolday into the scene
(to Rocklin) He was just getting ready to finish you off, through that window
-   - Harolday is herded inside, close to Garvey and Miss Martin
(almost enjoying this) You seem to like to do business through windows, Mr
Harolday
In the pause Harolday remains sneeringly silent
You're not Clint's killer, by any chance -- (cutting in) By one bad chance -- (glares at Harolday) Juan saw you do it
Harolday looks at Juan, who slowly nods
Well, now we're gettin' some place -- He brings up the tobacco pouch
But before he can ask about it, Arly speaks
That pouch is his -- (indicates Harolday) Juan made it for him a long time ago
(to Juan) Didn't you
Juan nods
Rocklin, with a sudden transition, speaks to Harolday in a hard, threatening tone
(to Harolday) Why did you kill Caldwell
Harolday doesn't answer
He finally looks at Garvey in desperation
Perspiration runs down Garvey's forehead
Suddenly Harolday makes a mad dash for the door
Rocklin shoots, but Arly pushes his arm and sends the shot wild
Rocklin looks at her in amazement
Julio hurries out
- On Harolday as he rushes madly across the clearing toward the bushes where his horse waits
The    to the porch in time to catch Julio crossing it in pursuit of Harolday
Arly and Rocklin come through the open door and stand on the porch watching
'    - ' They see Julio disappear in the brush
For a moment nothing happens; now Harolday's horse bolts out, riderless, and gallops away
Now Julio comes slowly into view
He moves slowly and deliberately back toward the house
Julio comes in to Rocklin and Arly
The three exchange significant glances as we -   - In the hall are Clara and Miss Martin, Rocklin, Arly and Julio, Dave and Garvey
Garvey is seated and has evidently been talking in the way of confession
-- Harolday wanted the
like he wanted the Santee and the Hardman place, for his land scheme -- He planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers
He pretended to be on the outs with me so  could get Caldwell's confidence
And when Red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened to expose me -- Harolday shot him
Why did he kill Clint
An' not me
That shot was an accident -- it was meant for you
We planned on getting the women to let me handle their business -- (interrupting, furious) -- And do us out of everything -- (moves close to Garvey) You vile -- wicked -- despicable -- She is beside herself in her anger -- and taking up a large vase sitting nearby, she smashes it to pieces over Garvey's head
Garvey goes down unconscious
Miss Martin rushes to her room screaming
Clara follows her
- When he wakes up -- we'll have him put everything on paper
Well, you'll have to do the writin' -- 'cause  don't know how to write
(genuinely concerned) Oh, Mr
Rocklin -- please --  think Auntie is out of her mind -- she's in her room -- laughing
(grimaces) What that ole pelican needs is a good spankin'
(who has been silently listening) And 'll bet you're just the one who can do it
(his eyes flash with an idea) Yeah --  believe  am
(looks at the group) know  am
He starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves
Rocklin's eyes wander to Clara, who seems quite at a loss
Now he moves slowly toward her
In the b
g
Arly watches Rocklin's every move
guess there's no rush for you to get to Garden City, now -- After a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of Arly, Clara speaks
No --  don't suppose there's any -- rush -- There is another short pause
Rocklin glances at Arly, and Arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the door, leaving Julio attending Garvey
(after Arly goes) If  was like her, 'd stay in the West
That means you're goin' back East -- Cousin Clara
(smiles, nods) It's where  belong --  know that now -- It's good to know where you Belong, reckon -- Wish  knew
(wistfully) can tell you -- you belong with her -- Rocklin takes it -- a faint smile brushes his face
He turns now and walks out
- - Arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon
The first rays of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck cavorting on the ground close to her
In a moment Rocklin comes into view in the b
g
He spots Arly, who has her back to him, and walks over
His approach frightens the woodchuck away, and turns Arly's head toward him
Neither has anything to say
Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other way
(after a pause) Thanks
For what
Everything
There is another stilted pause
(her eyes sweeping the morning) Beautiful day
(reflecting) It didn't start out so beautiful
That's true of lots of things
Fer instance
(hesitantly) Well -- you and -- me
There is another pause
But worlds are being said in the language of eyes
Their heads move closer and now Rocklin's arms sweep around the girl and they kiss
(shouting) Hey, Rock -- Rock -- get out your pencil and paper -- The two stop abruptly and look o
s
(grimacing) Doggone it -- here Garvey is back in this world -- an' they're out of it
