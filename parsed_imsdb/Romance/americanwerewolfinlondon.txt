"An American Werewolf in London" -- by John Landis 1    ' on the moon
Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins
Once we are high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is superimposed
An American Werewolf in London We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it grows farther from us, continuing credits until the full moon is the size it appears to us from earth
2
- Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans down and we see a truck approaching
We are at a crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to have earned their literary reputation
The truck stops at the crossroads, the , mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler, climbs down
"Moon Shadow" ends
: Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams down
Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened young American boys
They look exhausted
They both carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in Europe
They are both in their late twenties
It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too happily
Pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch
They've been cramped for hours
Here, lads, East Proctor and all about are the moors
go east here
Yes, well thank you very much for the ride, sir
You have lovely sheep
(as he clambers back up on his truck) Boys, keep off the moors
Stay on the road
Good luck to you
Thanks again
He drives off
of the two boys as the lorry pulls away
Surrounding them are the moors
They put on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing towards East Proctor
- As they walk, their breath visible: Are you cold
Yes
Good
They walk on, finally: Jack
David
You're not having a good time are you
Oh,  don't know
mean look around
Isn't this a fun place
The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold, foreboding
Well,  like it here
'm sorry
Northern England first, Italy later
Right
They walk on
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome
think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
She's a jerk
You're talking about the woman love
'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there
don't know
(like an announcer) Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein
The love affair that shocked Europe
See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit
See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican
Never has the screen dared
If you don't stop, 'm going to kill you
have to make love to her
It's very simple
She has no choice really
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade
How many years of foreplay is that
She says she `likes me too much'
David just laughs and laughs and laughs
: 3
- David and Jack entering East Proctor
It is brightly moonlit
East Proctor consists of a few shops, all closed, a petrol pump and a pub
East Proctor has a very small population and the place looks empty
David and Jack enter the middle of town and look about
The camera sees what they see
few shops, dark and shuttered
Light and laughter come from the pub
4
- Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The Slaughtered Lamb"
The Slaughtered Lamb
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb
Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
That's a wolf's head
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb
Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol
That's not a spear
It's a pike
severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol
David, before we go in there want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault
assume full responsibility
Okay
Shall we
5
- The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid- fifties
Its traditional Englishness combines with greasy stainless steel and glass
It is populated by mostly pale young men with longish hair
Several older men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches
Four or five are watching a chess game
Two men are playing darts
The conversation is loud and there is often laughter
But there is something unsavory about these people
look of leanness and poverty
They seem inbred and somehow sullen
We establish the types and the general level of noise in the room
The door opens revealing David and Jack
There is dead silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention
They give each other a "what
" look, then turn to the assembled populace
Hello
Nice to see you
Silent and staring
: (smiles) It's very cold outside
May we come in
The   nods
The boys walk carefully over to a table and very self-consciously remove their packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the table
There is a long, awkward wait
The Woman finally comes over to them
Do you have any hot soup
No
Well, do you have any coffee
No
Hot chocolate
We've got spirits and beer
If it's something hot you want, you can have tea
Then you have some hot tea
No
Oh
But  can heat some up for you if you'd like
& Yes, please
As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess and darts, and the boys breathe easier
Nice looking group
Listen, at least it's warm in here
Look at that
: '
On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed star) and on either side burns a yellow candle
What about it
It's a five-pointed star
Maybe the owners are from Texas
The Woman brings them their tea
(to Woman) Remember the Alamo
beg your pardon
He was joking
Thank you
Joking
remember The Alamo
saw it once in London, in Leicester Square
Jack and David look startled
One of the explains: She means in the cinema, that film with John Wayne
(turns to board) Checkmate
Oh, yes, of course
Right, with Laurence Harvey and everybody died in it
It was very bloody
Bloody awful if you ask me
This sends everyone into gales of laughter
Jack and David smile politely
Here, Gladys, Tom
Did you hear the one about the crashing plane
No, but we're about to
Laughter
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak
(heavy sarcasm) Quiet, everyone
Hush
Shhh
Uproarious laughter
All right, laugh then shan't tell it
Oh, come on, tell us
No
You've had your chance
The men all coax him to tell the joke
(to David) Ask them what the candles are for
(to Jack) You ask them
(to David) Listen, that's a pentangle, a five-pointed star
It's used in witchcraft
Lon Chaney, Jr
and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man
(to Jack) see
You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters
(to David) Right
(to Jack) Wrong
The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would
Oh, all right
There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York
It was full of men from the United Nations
That's very funny, that is
Uproarious laughter
(to David) Go on, ask them
(to Jack) You ask them
Here now, let me finish
So halfway over the ocean the engines run low on petrol so they have to lighten the plane
So they heave out all the baggage, but it's still too heavy
So they chuck out the seats, but it's still too heavy
Finally this Froggy steps up and shouts "Viva la France" and leaps out
Then an Englishman
Hear
Hear
(undaunted) steps up and shouts `God save the Queen
' and leaps out
But the plane is still too heavy
So the Yank delegate from Texas steps up, shouts, `Remember the Alamo
' and chucks out the Mexican
This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of East Proctor have ever heard
The laughter is uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible
As the Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart Player gasps out
Remember the Alamo
causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer causing even harder laughter
Complete hilarity
Excuse me, but what's that star on the wall for
Dead silence
dart lands in the wall
David and Jack are understandably bewildered
The villagers look hard indeed
(angry) You've made me miss
'm sorry
've never missed the board before
Jack, we'd better go
What do you mean
'm starving
There's no food here
The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a bit urgent
Come on, Jack, shall we go
Apparently so
The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the door
(to men) You can't let them go
(worried) How much do we owe you
Nothing, lads
Go, God be with you
Uh, thank you
Wait
You just can't let them go
Go
And stay on the road
Keep clear of the moors
Yes, well, thanks again
Beware the moon, lads
David pushes Jack out
6
- It is very cold
What the hell was that all about
don't know
Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road
Beware the moon
Come on, 'm freezing
They start up the road into the night
7
- It is quiet
You can't let them go
(angry) Should the world know our business
It's murder then
Then murder it is
It's in God's hands now
The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the floor
: 8
-  - walking on the road surrounded by darkness
That was weird
guess leaving was the best idea
don't know
Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, 'm not so sure wouldn't rather face a blood- thirsty mob
Well, not quite a blood- thirsty mob
They keep walking
What do you think was wrong
have no idea
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural
see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly
There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces
The clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling
Please don't rain
Downpour
The boys are walking in a deluge
Of course
They walk getting soaked
Say, David
'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you
Jack spreads his arms and sings
Santa Lucia
Santa Lucia
9
- The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the windows
The gathered continue to drink, play chess and darts, but all are silent and contemplative
Perhaps they'll be safe in the rain
The Chess Player slams his hand on the table
Shouts: No one brought them here
No one wanted them here
You could have told them
Are you daft
What do you think they'd say
They'd think us mad
Listen
The rain is subsiding
There is a very faint howl
Did you hear it
We must go to them
heard nothing
Nor
The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face shows the man's struggle
Another howl
The Chess Player turns suddenly
10
- David and Jack are now completely out of sight from East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet
There is a light drizzle
They are standing, listening
The drizzle stops
Did you hear that
heard that
What was it
David begins to walk, Jack with him
Could be a lot of things
Yeah
coyote
There aren't any coyotes in England
The Hound of the Baskervilles
Pecos Bill
Heathcliffe
Heathcliffe didn't howl
No, but he was on the moors
It's a full moon, `beware the moon'
Another howl, this one long and loud
It is a very inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time
vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb
Yeah
They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from where they just came
Although after a bit of fast walking they are getting nowhere
They stop out of breath
We're lost
Another bloodcurdling howl
Shit
David, what is that
don't know
Come on
Come on, where
Anywhere
think we should just keep moving
growl
low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness
We stay on the boys, but we hear something out there
It starts to walk
It's moving
It's circling us
And indeed it is
The boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly, following it
snarl
Fuck
We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is - we know it's there even though we've not seen it)
It sits breathing heavily
What's the plan
(nervously) Plan
(not too relaxed himself) Let's just keep walking
They do and David keeps talking as they walk
That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors
Tra-la-la, isn't this fun
The thing stalking them seems to speed up
The boys hesitate as they sense it run past them
It stops
It's in front of us
Do you think it's a dog
Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them
'
Something is waiting in the darkness
Its hulking shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily and its breath is visible
Oh shit
What is that
sheep dog or something
Turn slowly and let's walk away
The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster
Nice doggie
Good boy
Walk away, Jack
Walking away, yes, sir
Here we are walking away
They are in a full-out run by now
After a few minutes flight they stop, panting
See anything
No
moment of quiet, then a howl
It sounds far away
Not far enough
Come on
They walk briskly
Jack
Yeah
Where are we going
'll tell you when we get there
Well
'm glad we
David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring Jack, and us, and himself a great deal
He lays startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and Jack laugh
You really scared me, you shithead
Are you going to help me up
Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when - The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop
David falls back on his ass
Jack is screaming and struggling as he is torn to shreds
David scrambles to his feet and runs in complete panic
Jack's screams and the wolf's roars combine
Jesus fuck
David
Please help me
Please
David
Shit
Help me
Oh God
- David runs and runs
Finally he falls, out of breath
Jack
Oh my God, Jack
He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody mess on the ground
He stares in horror
Jack
- The camera adopts David's
as he fights the dark savage shape on top of him
Fangs clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the hulking form rolls off of him
- David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches running towards him
Looking over at his attacker, instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying in the mud riddled with bullet holes
As the villagers crowd around, David falls back and faints
11
- David is in a small, clean and very white hospital room
He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma
There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn't look too bad
He opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain
He calls out
Jack
and passes out
However his shout has fetched a nurse
She is  , very English, very beautiful
She goes to the bed
Mr
Kessler
She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed
Mr
Kessler
David remains unconscious
Another young nurse, , comes in
He all right
Yes,  should think
He called out just now
He's an American, you know
Dr
Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him
Chart says he's from New York
think he's a Jew
Why on earth do you say that
looked
(smiles) Really, Susan,  don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now
voice startles the girls
Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss Price is quite right
enters
He is an older man wearing the customary lab coat
very commanding and reassuring presence
The girls are embarrassed
Dr
Hirsch, Mr
Kessler cried out a minute ago
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital
Yes, Doctor
Then get on with it
Yes, Doctor
She exits
Dr
Hirsch begins to examine David
Alex watches
Dr
Hirsch turns to Alex
Can  be of service, Miss Price
Dr
Hirsch
Go about your duties
Yes, Doctor
She starts to exit
Oh, Miss Price
Yes, Doctor
What exactly did he call out
He said `Jack'
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed
What happened to them
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them
He must have been a very powerful man
Although really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price
No, sir
Of course, sir
Good day, Doctor
She exits as Dr
Hirsch continues his examination, looking into David's eyes
12
- The camera is handheld, running furiously through the almost dense greenery
On the soundtrack are the footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner
The camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about, the panting continuing
The breathing gets louder and harder, then too loud when we: : 13
- David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy
Standing beside the bed are Dr
Hirsch and
Mr
Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase
Hello, David
am Dr
Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr
Collins
Where am
You're in a hospital in London
London
Where's Jack
had a strange dream
should think so after your recent traumatic experiences
The guy  was with
Is he all right
How did  get to London
(quietly) Now, David,  want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead
David jolts up in bed and shouts
What
The sudden exertion and strain hurt
Ow, shit
He sinks back down
Jack's dead
Mr
Kessler,  am Mr
Collins of the American Embassy here in Grosvenor Square
Both Mr
Goodman's parents and your parents have been notified of your injuries and everything's in order
Everything's in order
What are you talking about
Mr
Goodman's body has been air-freighted back to New York for burial and your parents have wired funds for your stay in the hospital until you are well enough to fly home
(controlled tears) You don't crate and ship Jack like some side of beef
(approaching hysteria) Who the hell are you people
What's going on here
Where is Jack
demand to see him
(holds David down, calls out) Miss Price
Miss Price, please
(shouting) Get your fucking hands off me
What the hell is going on here
Alex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion
(distraught, clutching his briefcase) realize how upsetting this must be for you, Mr
Kessler, but please try to refrain from hysterics
David continues shouting and struggling
Prepare a hypodermic, please, Miss Price
The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr
Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more normal
Now, Mr
Kessler, try not to excite yourself
Everything has been arranged
shall come back to check on your progress and send a report to your parents
The police have requested to interview you and have given them permission to do so
Dr
Hirsch walks Mr
Collins to the door
Thank you very much, Mr
Collins
He'll rest now and 'm sure everything will be fine once he's adjusted
He's had quite a shock
These dumb-ass kids never appreciate anything you do for them
Mr
Collins exits
Dr
Hirsch crosses back to the bed
How long have  been here
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
Two weeks
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while
You'll have some dueling scars to boast of
That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow
They say a mad man has the strength of ten
(softly, as the drugs take hold) Lunatic
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now
Miss Price will see to your needs
Rest now
Dr
Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers
(softly) It wasn't a lunatic
(puzzled) beg your pardon
It was a wolf
(bends down close to hear) What
wolf
David passes out
Alex looks to Dr
Hirsch
Did he say a wolf
Yes,  believe he did
Dr
Hirsch regards David thoughtfully
14
'  - Dr
Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk calendar
But Roger is so terribly boring
Yes, dear, but couldn't we
see
(he makes a note) Thursday at eight, dinner with boring Roger
Yes, 'm sure will; if  survived Rommel, suppose 'll survive another excruciating evening with Roger Mathison
Be a good girl
Bye
He hangs up very disgruntled
The intercom buzzes
Yes
(
) Lt
Villiers and Sgt
McManus are here to see you, Doctor
Send them in
He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall, the other rather pudgy
Dr
Hirsch
Come in, come in
Please sit
Some tea
The cops sit down, Lt
Villiers immediately produces a small notebook
No, thank you
McMANUS 'd like some tea, please
Lt
Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look
McMANUS Maybe not
No thanks
Maybe later
It's no problem
No, thank you, Doctor
Well, then, what can  do for Scotland Yard
McMANUS We understand the Kessler boy has regained consciousness
Lt
Villiers glares at McManus
McMANUS Sorry
Has Mr
Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors
The intercom buzzes
Excuse me
Yes
(
) Roger Mathison, Doctor
What here
(
) He's on the telephone
Tell him 'm out
No, tell him 've passed away
An old war wound or something
Tell him 'm dead
And no more calls
He turns from the intercom back to the cops
You were saying
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors
Why don't we ask him
15
- David sits up in bed
Lt
Villiers and Sgt
McManus stand by his side
Dr
Hirsch sits observing
'm sorry if  conflict with your report, but Jack and were not attacked by a man
So you've said
McMANUS He may have a point, Lieutenant
Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man
Sgt
McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret
We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police
We have two witnesses to the crime
You'll forgive me, Mr
Kessler, if  consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock
McMANUS Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and
And what, Sergeant
McMANUS (defeated) don't rightly know, sir
That is precisely my point
David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed
We won't trouble you any further
Good day
The lieutenant goes for the door
The sergeant smiles at David and follows
Doctor
The cops exit
Dr
Hirsch crosses to David's bed
There were witnesses
So they said
How could there have been witnesses
It was so dark
We were running and  fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere
don't understand what they're talking about
In time 'm sure it will all come back to you
Doctor, my memory is fine
It's my sanity 'm beginning to worry about
: 16
- Again the handheld camera is running furiously through the woods
Heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing through the foliage
The camera runs for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree
David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness of a startled cat
His head makes sudden movements, looking about
of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his animalness
takes off and now we run with him
He runs fast and gracefully, taking long strides and leaps
We run with him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration
We see him completely as the animal, study his movement and grace as if watching a gazelle
Suddenly he stops again, alert, listening
He moves with stealth, slowly he pushes some leaves aside
of his eyes
'
Several deer in the forest; they sense something and freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe
The buck turns his head, feeling the danger
: Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders tensing
of David's eyes
of the frightened deer
: of David's eyes
: as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame as David forces it down
David's head reenters frame, his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered with blood
He howls in triumph
17
- The lights are subdued and David's asleep
The door opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room
Miss Gallagher enters with a small tray
She crosses to David, turns on the bed light and touches him
Mr
Kessler
Wake up, please
(awakened) was having a nightmare
Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the pills and pouring a glass of water
Yes, well these should help that
That's right, drink up
David takes the pills
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr
Hirsch in the morning
What time is it
It's nearly eight
'm off duty shortly, then 'm off to the films with Alex
Alex
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you
What are you going to see
An American film about the Mafia called `See You Next Wednesday', and  want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep
(dropping off) Do you have bad dreams, too
Some, everyone does
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi
Bambi
David has fallen asleep
Miss Gallagher turns off the light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway
Kill Bambi
She exits, closing the door plunging the room into darkness
18
'  - The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing appropriate background actions
Behind the Nurses' Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older, obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from the drug cabinet
She is
, the chief nurse
Miss Price
Yes, Mrs
Hobbs
Take these round now, will you please
The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten
Will you be sure of that
Has he been refusing food
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price
He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him
He suffers from nightmares
'd think he just needs a hand to hold
Yes, Mrs
Hobbs
Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her appearance
She enters
19
'  - ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied
She goes to a little Pakistani boy named
Hello, Benjamin
No
No what
No
Well, all right then, be that way
Here, swallow this
No
Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin who promptly takes it and then drinks the water, handing Alex back the glass
Feeling better
No
The doctor will be round later
Would you like a picture book to look at
We have some lovely funny Beanos
No
Right
She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black Jamaican  pushing a cart of lunch trays into Benjamin's ward
20
- Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet
The American
Yes, duck
How did he look
What do you mean, `how did he look'
You know, did he seem depressed
Do you think he'll eat the food
(annoyed) 'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist
push things about, but 've little say what happens to them
Thank you
Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room
She hesitates, then peeks in
21
- The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits patiently on its tray alongside of the bed
David is apparently asleep
Alex enters softly
(softly) Mr
Kessler
(lifeless) Yes
You haven't eaten your lunch
'm not very hungry, thank you
'm afraid you have to eat something
Please, really
'm not hungry
You put me in an awkward position, Mr
Kessler
How is that
(she shakes the paper cup) Well, you're to take these after you've eaten
Now what kind of nurse would  be if failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills
Leave the pills
'll take them later
Sorry
She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room
Aw come on, Miss Price
Call me Alex
Aw come on, Alex
Shall  be forced to feed you, Mr
Kessler
David is getting interested
Call me David
Shall  be forced to feed you, David
This is absurd
'm not hungry
don't want any food
Right
Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits on the edge of the bed
Taking knife and fork in hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces
David watches all this amused
She places a napkin under David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork
David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth
Let's try a little harder, shall we
Will you give me a break
Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly, shoving the fork in it
David is startled, but amused and chews his food slowly and swallows it
Alex holds up another bite
Will  have to take such drastic action again, David
David opens his mouth obediently
Alex almost smiles
She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each other up
Finally: May  have a glass of milk
Alex smiles
22
- Again we are running fast and faster
David again running naked, flying through the green forest
He stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we hear Jack's o
s
screams
The voice of Jack screams: (
) David
David
Please help me
Oh God
David
Oh my God
David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's screams
He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming through the tall trees
Jack's screams halt in mid- word
David looks in disbelief at the clearing
There is a hospital bed with someone in it
It is the same as David's
David walks toward it slowly
The figure in the bed lays still
It grows dark, very dark, and David looks up at the full moon
There is a howl identical to the one heard earlier back on the moors
David approaches the bed slowly, fearfully
We hear ocean noises on the soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf
David reaches out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder cause him to hesitate for a second
Silence
The camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers
His face registers total disbelief and increasing horror
We cut to the bed to find -
He lies there, pale white with purple lips and death pallor
The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David
Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then continue until David's death mask fills the screen
The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in the
: 23
'  - Mrs
Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls out
Orderly
Miss Gallagher
Miss Gallagher and an  appear at once
Orderly, go at once to twenty- one and restrain the patient
The orderly exits
Miss Gallagher, remain here at the desk
'll be in twenty- one
She exits

- It is bright, daylight, and Dr
Hirsch gazes thoughtfully out the window
You've never had bad dreams before
(upset) Sure, as a kid
But never so real
Never so bizarre
Dr
Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you
've told you, it wasn't a man
It was an animal
big wolf or something
rabid dog
(chewing on his glasses) Yes
Look, Dr
Hirsch,  know 've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart
saw him
man can't do that to someone with his bare hands
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of
Did you see Jack
No
In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor
Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb
really don't know
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me
You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that
(rubs his forehead) David, please
The police are satisfied
'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly
You really think 'm crazy, don't you
Believe me
The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake
There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr
Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice
Now really, David
You're far too intelligent to go on this way
When you return to America  want you to seek out a competent psychiatrist or psychologist or something and stop this nonsense
You'll be leaving this hospital in three or four days, please remain sane
At least until you are no longer our responsibility
Dr
Hirsch goes to the door
Dr
Hirsch
(pause) 'd rather not be by myself
Of course not, David
'll fetch in young Miss Price
: 25
- Alex sits next to David's bed
Her shoes are off and she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair
The room is dark except for the lamp by which she reads
She is reading  Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain
David is asleep
Alex reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns
She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and feet, fingers and toes stretch
(quietly) You're a very beautiful girl
(embarrassed) thought you were asleep
was
What are you reading
` Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain
Do you like it
've just started it
My friend gave it to me
They look at each other
What do you dream about
dream of death mostly
'm sorry
shouldn't have asked you
It's okay
want to talk to you
They sit and look at each other for a while longer
How old are you
That's not really a very proper question
How old are you
Twenty-eight
'm twenty-seven
know
Now what do you want to talk about
Was Jack Goodman your good friend
(seriously) My best friend
My very best friend
(embarrassed) Shall  read to you
What
Oh, yes, please
(opens book) Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel
Clemens
This is after the preface but before chapter one:  Word of Explanation
You all right
(settles back) Yes, go on
(clears her throat) Ahem,  Word of Explanation
It was in Warwick Castle that came across the curious stranger whom  am going to talk about
He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking
We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd
: 26
-   - We are at David's parents' house in New York
His sits reading the paper in the living room as his younger  and  watch "The Muppet Show" on television
We can see past the small dining nook where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen where his  is washing the dishes
peaceful lower, middle class setting
All is tranquil and secure
There is a loud pounding on the front door
'll get it
The pounding continues
All right, all right
Hold your horses
(The following happens with shocking speed
)  When he opens the door, four beings open fire with machine guns, blowing him away
The sudden burst of violence is terrifying and unrelenting
The four rush into the room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise for these men are not human at all, but loathsome, bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers
One kicks in the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting David's mother
David rises but is forced back into his chair by one of the things and held there
Stop
He watches in horror as his little brother and sister scream in terror before they are brutally murdered
The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the rooms
The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly slits David's throat
: 27
- David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying desperately to gain his bearings
He sees that Alex is asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee folded on her lap
He makes a deliberate effort to calm himself
He considers waking her, then decides against it
He turns on the lamp by his bed and reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap
David takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up anyway
(yawns, smiles) Hello
You all right
'm sorry  woke you up
Don't be silly
Can  get you something
No, thank you
Just keep me company for a while
That's easy enough
keep having these really terrible dreams
They are getting worse and  can't seem to stop them
David, your dreams will stop
You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away
Will you come with me
(taken aback) What
(smiling) 'm serious
You don't know me and  know nothing about you
We have a perfect relationship
Now, David,  said  would keep you company, but  meant right here and now
Will you think about it
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient
(big grin) Not just a patient -- me
You're being awfully forward, aren't you
Forgive me, 'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it
(smiles) All  am to you is a sex fantasy then
Now 'm embarrassed
Good
thought for a moment was the only embarrassed one in the room
There is an awkward pause
Where were we in the book
Alex is relieved for something to break the tension
(looking through the book) Let me see here
28
- The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the bed
He awakens the sleeping David with his activity
Ah you're up
Good morning and a good day to you
We've quite a meal for you here this morning
Bacon, oatmeal, orange juice, and toast with jam
Good stuff there
Now eat it up and 'll be back for the dishes when you've finished
The Orderly exits
The drowsy David, who has been trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech, notices his exit
Good morning
He looks at his food none too happily
He sticks a spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly
(in mock English accent) Please, sir,  want some more
He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his toast and drink his juice
While he eats, we hear Jack's o
s
voice
(
) Can  have a piece of toast
David looks over to the o
s
Jack
Jack, behaving relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by Alex
However, Jack's appearance makes his casual manner all the more surreal
He is as we left him butchered on the moors
He is covered with dried mud and open wounds
Huge glistening gashes abound on his body
His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn, and his hair is matted with blood
In several spots he has already begun to rot
He is a remarkably gruesome sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him at all
(pleasantly) Nice to see you
(unbelieving) Get the fuck out of here, Jack
Thanks a lot
(horrified) This is too much
can't handle this
'm aware that  don't look so great, but  thought you'd be glad to see me
Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's tray as David watches amazed
Jack returns to his seat and takes a bite out of his toast
David stares at Jack horrified
David
You're hurting my feelings
(astounded) Hurting your feelings
Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me
Listen to me, 'm talking to a hamburger
'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but  had to come
(aghast) Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace
Yeah
Your parents came to my funeral
was surprised at how many people came
(resigned) Why should you be surprised
You were a very well-liked person
Debbie Klein cried a lot
can't stand it
So you know what she does
She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed
Rudy Levine the shmuck
Life mocks me even in death
Jack takes another bite of toast
(to himself) 'm going completely crazy
(loud) David
(louder) What
David, now  know this may be hard for you, but  have to warn you
(shouting) Warn me
Will you get out of here, you meat loaf
'm a grisly sight, it's true; but  love you and that's why 'm here
You've got to know
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead
We were attacked by a werewolf
(covers his ears) 'm not listening
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf
Shut up, you zombie
was murdered, an unnatural death, and now  walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted
(incredulous, furious) What's wrong with you
Shut up
The wolf's bloodline must be severed
The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed
Will you be quiet
Jack rises and comes closer to David
It's you, David
What
You survived and now you shall continue the curse
What are you talking about won't accept this
Get out
God damit
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said
`Beware the moon
' (quietly) Stop it, Jack
Beware the moon
The full moon, David
You've got two days
(quietly) Jack, please go away
Please go away
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night
(flares up) You're talking like Boris Karloff
It's movie dialogue
David, please believe me
You will kill people, David
You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins
(yells) Nurse
Listen to me
Take your own life, David
It's our only chance
Nurse
The supernatural
The powers of darkness
It's all true
Take your own life
Suicide, David
Join me
(losing it) Nurse
Oh God
Alex
It's cold, David, and 'm so alone
The undead surround me
Have you ever talked to a corpse
It's boring
'm lonely
Kill yourself, David, before you kill others
29
- '  - Alex rushing down the hospital corridor
30
- David rocking back and forth weeping
Don't cry, David
31
- Alex rushing down hospital corridor
32
- Please don't cry
33
- Alex rushing to the door
34
-  - (softly in looming closeup) Beware the moon, David
: as she bursts into the room
: laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly
He is alone
Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits on the bed and hugs David
David
David
David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe easier
David, what's wrong
David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss
(quietly) 'm a werewolf
werewolf
Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is and backs off a little
David composes himself
Are you better now
'll let you know the next full moon
You're to be discharged tomorrow
Will you be all right
David takes Alex's hand
My friend Jack was just here
Your dead friend Jack
Yeah
He says that  will become a monster in two days
What do you think
What do  think
You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends
was dreaming again
would think so
(resigned) Yeah,  would think so, too
Alex considers for a while, finally
Do you have a place to stay in London
: 35
- David and Alex walking down the street
Alex points out her flat and leads David up the front steps
She gives him a conspiratorial look and unlocks the door
36
'  - Alex enters and David follows
small, utilitarian apartment, she flicks on the kitchen light
David puts his backpack on the floor
The kitchen
Very nice
She proceeds to give the tour
Closet
Charming
Bathroom
Lovely
The bedroom
There is only one bed
(makes a face) David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while  take a shower
Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking on his heels
37
- David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream of water in the shower
It's nice to see you
It's nice to see you
- sequence of soap and flesh
Van Morrison's "Moondance" plays
montage of soapy hands on slippery skin
Thighs rubbing thighs, arms and shoulders
David and Alex kiss again and again and
38
'  - David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's bed
David pulls out and they lay holding each other
After a moment
Alex
Yes
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes
Of course
(leers) Good
Alex props herself up on one elbow
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you
Do you really
was awake and he was in my room
But, David
(firm) wasn't hallucinating
Pause
(smiles) Tomorrow is the full moon
That's good, Alex
Reassure me
Alex begins kissing David's neck
It's all right,  know 'm being insane
She kisses his shoulders, then his chest
Okay, okay
'm properly reassured
Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually lowers from frame
David reaches back over his head to hold onto the headboard of the bed
(closing his eyes) This is very reassuring
'm feeling very reassured
: '  - Alex is asleep holding David
David carefully lifts her arm and gets out of bed
He is naked
He tiptoes out of the room and goes to the bathroom
39
'  - David lifts the toilet seat and pees
He winces, hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex
When he's finished peeing he goes to the sink
The medicine cabinet door over the sink is open
When David closes it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack reflected standing behind him
(Note: This is a big scare
)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him
David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes tightly and then reopens them
Jack is still there in the mirror
When David turns around Jack is standing in the doorway
(points a trembling finger) You're not real
Don't be an asshole, David
Come here
David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living room
40
' Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also
He does
David's conversation is in whispers, so as not to wake up Alex
What are you doing here
wanted to see you
Okay, you've seen me
Now go away
David, 'm sorry  upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on
understand all right
You're one of the undead and 'm a werewolf
Yes
Get out of here, Jack
David, tomorrow night is the full moon
You'll change, you'll become
(interrupting) monster
know,  know
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late
Jack, are you really dead
What do you think
think 've lost my mind think you're not real think 'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream
You must believe me
What, Jack
That tomorrow night beneath the full moon 'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people
Bullshit
The canines will be real
You'll taste real blood
God damit, David, please believe me
You'll kill and make others like me
'm not having a nice time, David
Don't allow this to happen again
You must take your own life
(shouts) will not accept this
Now go away
41
'  - Alex wakes up from the shouting
David
42
- (quietly) This is not pretend, David
(righteous) will not be threatened by a walking meat loaf
Alex enters the room
David, what's wrong
heard voices
David turns and sees that Jack is gone
(triumphant) It was just me, Alex
It was just me
43
- Dr
Hirsch is driving down the main street in his red He parks in front of The Slaughtered Lamb
44
- The pub is less crowded than when we were here last
The Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the Chess Player is still at the chessboard
Dr
Hirsch enters and crosses to the bar
As he removes his gloves: drink for a very cold man
The Woman comes in from the back
Hello, there
What can  get you
Campari and soda would do nicely
Sorry, love
suppose Guinness will suffice
She serves him his beer
As he lays down his money
thousand thanks
After a few sips
Nasty bit of business with those two young American boys
The Dart Player stops his wiping
'm afraid  don't know what you mean, sir
Yes, 'm sure that's right few weeks ago, the last full moon wasn't it
The Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look at Dr
Hirsch
mean that escaped lunatic
The one that killed the boy
Wasn't that near here
(concerned) And where are you from, sir
Dr
Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his table
London
Knight takes pawn
What
Sees that Dr
Hirsch was talking about his game
Oh, yes, yes
Dr
Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall
What's that
(nervously) Oh, that's been there for two hundred years
We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it
see
You've heard nothing about the incident
Incident
The murder
Are you a police officer
(smiles) No, no, hardly
work in the hospital where the Kessler boy was brought
The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look
He was talking about werewolves and monsters and as was near here  thought
You thought what
thought 'd look into the boy's story
(scoffs) story about werewolves - now really, sir
Dr
Hirsch eyes the Chess Player
Would you like a game of chess
45
'  - We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door
Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has jeans and a -shirt on
He is shoeless and obviously not going out
Alex pulls away
Let me go now, you'll make me late
Do me an enormous favor
Anything
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive
It's silly of you to be apprehensive
Werewolves simply do not exist
(serious) David, do you want me to stay here tonight
Yeah,  do, but go to work
He opens the door and they both go outside
46
-   - walk to the sidewalk
It is rather chilly
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay
Okay
've left those pills for you
doper werewolf
They kiss again
'm off
There's food in the fridge
See you later
Alex goes off, turning for a last wave
David stands looking after her when a   walking a dog passes by
The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl and snarl
(to dog) What did  do
The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl tugging on his leash
Thanks a lot, dog
He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back up the steps to find the door locked
Wonderful
Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone
He mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster
An American werewolf was found frozen to death today in the heart of London, England
He looks around and sees that there is a small window ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall, which he does but not without damage to his bare toes
At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on seeing David
The hair stands up on its arched back and it glares at David, hissing and spitting
David is disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior
What did  do, cat
The cat is really acting fierce
When David goes to pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away
David is, by this time, not amused
David manages to pull himself into the window
47
'  - David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny window
Finally getting both feet on the ground, he steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror
(weakly) Snarl
Growl
Grrrr
He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully
After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen
48
'  - David goes straight to the fridge and opens it
He closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom
49
'  - He lays down on the bed
After a few beats of staring at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the kitchen
50
'  - He reopens the fridge
'm not hungry
He closes the fridge and walks into the living room
51
'   - David turns on the television
On Thames is a soccer match
On  1 is some truly insipid children's program, and on  2 is a soccer match
David switches off the television
He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers and humming
(singing) `Moon River, wider than a mile 'm crossing you in style, Someday
' David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it open
It is getting dark
David views this fearfully, but still not completely convinced
He goes back inside and we note that the front door is not completely closed
He goes back into the bathroom and looks into the mirror
Fee fi fo fum,  smell the blood of an Englishman
He goes back into the living room and paces round and round the room like a caged animal
52
'  - Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani
How are we feeling tonight
No
No what
No
(smiling) Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck
No
thought not
She tucks him in
You sleep now and have sweet dreams
& No
For the first time, Benjamin smiles
As Alex tucks him in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through the window
53
'  - David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly clutches his head in pain
Jesus Christ
He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor
(screams) What
Christ
What
He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of his head
He trembles violently
'm burning up
Jesus
He rips at his shirt, tearing it off
His body is dripping wet
(shouts out in pain and fear) Jack
Where are you now, you fucker
As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in anguish
Help me
Somebody help me, please
Jack
David's hair is wringing wet
He screams and grabs at his legs
(pleading, whimpering) 'm sorry  called you a meat loaf, Jack
New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body
He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning him
Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps for air
He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands
He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment; but it's no use
On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change
The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one
As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain
We can actually see David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue
His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge
His whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes
His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward
The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window
David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls
We hear the four footfalls as the begins to walk
As the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness
54
- taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats
An attractive couple gets out
The Man pays the driver and the cab drives off
Which one, Harry
Number thirty-nine, but let's go `round the back
Why
Come on, we'll give Sean a scare
You're crazy, Harry
Come on
Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of the flats
The apartments back up to a park and the two walk around to the rear
The park is dark and quiet
55
- Did you hear something
Just now
Yes
No
Here we are, Sean's is the one
Before the Woman can scream, the Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat
We can't see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and demonic
The Wolf savagely devours its two victims
56
'  - Sean's wife is looking through their French windows out onto the park - a middle-aged couple
Sean, those hooligans are in the park again
Aren't you ready yet
They'll be here any minute
Something's going on out there
57
- '  - Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs
Hobbs dispense medication into paper cups when Dr
Hirsch approaches
He is still wearing his overcoat
Is Miss Price on duty this evening
Yes, Doctor
Miss Gallagher, do you know if Miss Price has seen the Kessler boy since his release
Miss Gallagher is not sure how to answer
Uh,  don't know if
Alex has walked up and overheard the last
It's all right, Susan
Yes, Doctor,  have
Come to my office, Miss Price
Alex and Susan exchange glances as she obediently follows Dr
Hirsch down the hallway
58
- Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his wife's complaints
She hangs by the door
He walks deeper into the park
(calls out) Is anyone there
59
'  - Dr
Hirsch hangs up his overcoat
Sit down, Alex
Alex sits and Dr
Hirsch leans against his desk
was in East Proctor today
Alex looks confused
Dr
Hirsch realizes the cause of her concern
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me don't give a damn who you sleep with
'm concerned about David
Yes, sir
It's a full moon
Where is he
At my flat
'm off at midnight and
Dr
Hirsch picks up the phone
The number, Alex
Your number
60
- Sean carefully approaches something near the trees
He steps on something and looks down to see what it is
It is an arm
61
'  -  -   - rings loudly
(This is a scare
)  It continues to ring unanswered
62
'  - Dr
Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up
He's not there
Alex grows worried
He's not
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend
Has his friend appeared to him again
Yes
What did he say
David says Jack comes to warn him
Warn him
Dr
Hirsch, what's wrong
Is this more serious than  know
tried to investigate the attack
There are no records
The case was closed and now they've `misplaced' the file
David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before  did
The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us
So went to the pub in East Proctor where  was convinced of two things
Yes
They were lying
There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic
The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there
And what else
think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret
'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf
Alex is flabbergasted
You've absolutely no idea where David might be
No
He knows no one in London, besides me shouldn't have left him alone
Suddenly
Surely you're not suggesting
David has suffered a severe trauma
myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor
If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David
And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon
(bewildered) Dr
Hirsch
Oh,  don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon
But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others
What shall we do
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
63
- The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London are stark and uninviting in the moonlight
Three old are huddled around a trash can fire trying to keep warm
skinny dog is tied up beside them
Its ears perk up and he growls in warning
#1 Old Winston smells something
#2 (calls out) Who's there
The dog begins to whine
#2 Let `im go
Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in terror
#3 Brave dog that
#1 (worried) Here - who's there
An unearthly howl shatters the night
We've heard this sound on the moors
#2 That's not Winston
#3 Look there
He points out into the night
They strain their eyes - something is approaching them
They can just make out its size
#1 Mother Mary of God

- train  to a halt
( scare
)  We are in the tubes of London
Only one passenger disembarks and the train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous hallways
The  is a young man, rather well- dressed
He looks about the platform, then at his watch
He walks up to a vending machine to buy a Cadbury Chocolate Bar
: - as the Passenger puts his coin in the vending machine
The camera is on ground level and as we watch the Passenger, the Wolf's legs flash by us
: of the Passenger eating his chocolate bar
He turns thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something
Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's tubes
He feels he's being followed and turns slowly to look
There is no one and he continues, concerned about his imagination
: - ' watching in the darkness
Our Passenger approaches the first escalator, pauses, then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving stairway
: - ' In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and black tongue
It waits, panting, drool falls from its mouth
The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly down the long tunnel marked "Escalator to Street Level"
He is being followed
He hears it and we hear it
He stops, frightened
Hello
: Long and empty
Is there someone there
We hear the Wolf's heavy breathing
The Passenger is beginning to panic
can assure you that this is not in the least bit amusing
He looks around wildly
shall report this
'
We see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the tunnel towards us
Good Lord
turns to flee, his jog becoming a run
He is terrified
- of the Wolf's running steps
frantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying his nose
He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear
Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving stairs, falling several times
He sits, panting and defeated, the blood trickling from his nose
: '
as it begins to climb the stairs
The camera tracks slowly in on the increasingly horrified Passenger until we are in an extreme closeup of his eyes, when we: : 65    - ( scare
)  The tiger paces in its cage and roars again
We are at: - It is early morning and all the animals are aroused
We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and panicky birds, etc
, until we come to the Wolves' cage where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground by the cage, asleep
David wakes up slowly
He is completely naked, his body dirty, with several scratches on his torso and legs
He yawns and stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks something distasteful from his teeth
He also notices something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel discovering where he is
He puts his hands over his eyes
Wake me up, Alex
He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there
He stands up and looks around
The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle about
David sees them coming towards him, notes his lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all concerned if they did not meet
He looks around for a suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes
He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching himself on a thorn
Ouch
66
'  - Alex sits holding David's torn -shirt
She is trying to read her book, but is just too distracted
The phone rings and she runs for it
(excited, then disappointed) Hello
No, Dr
Hirsch, he hasn't come back yet
Yes, will, doctor, but  just feel so helpless sitting here doing nothing
Thank you, yes, goodbye
She hangs up and looks around the empty flat
She is now more worried than ever
67
- David is still behind the bushes
He looks to see if the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the bushes
He steps out to confront a
Hello
: ' Dumbfounded
Excuse me, won't you
He returns to the bushes
: - with four helium balloons on a string is staring intently at the gorilla
The Little Boy leaves the monkey house and we travel with him as he looks at several other animals
Eventually he comes to the Wolf cage
(
) Pssst
The Little Boy looks around
(
) Hey, kid
Pssst
Little boy with the balloons
The Little Boy pantomimes, "who me
" : David cannot be seen
(
) Come over here
The Little Boy shakes his head
The bush replies: (
) If you come over here, 'll give you a pound
The Little Boy shakes his head
The bush pleads
(
) Two pounds
The Little Boy shakes his head
The bush reasons: (
) Listen, two pounds is a lot of money
It's almost five dollars
(very English) don't know who you are
(
) 'm the famous balloon thief
Why would a thief want to give me two pounds
(
) (losing patience) Come here and 'll show you
The Little Boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery, but stops a few feet away
(
) (pleading) Come on
The Little Boy edges forward
(
) little closer
When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his balloons and uses them to cover his crotch
Thank you
David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his balloons, startling several animal lovers
68
- An   sits feeding birds, their coats folded nearly over the park bench
naked blur darts by, grabbing the top coat as it passes, scaring off the birds
69
- The Little Boy tugs at his ' coat
Yes, love
naked, American man stole my balloons
What
naked, American man -- the famous balloon thief
70
- The signs they always have on London newsstands proclaim "Man or Monster
"  Dr
Hirsch picks up a newspaper with its headline, "London Murder Victims Found Partially Devoured"
'll have one of those, too
He pays for the papers
The second one's headline, "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper
" 71
-  - in another part of town
The camera is on the crowd of fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus
When the bus pulls up, they all crowd in
The camera goes to floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the crowded bus
Passengers are standing in the aisle and the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high heels, rubbers, etc
, until it comes to rest on a conspicuous pair of bare feet
We pan up to find David clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar trying to look as nonchalant as possible
man looks at him oddly
(cheerfully) lot of weather we've been having lately
The man studies David carefully
72
'  - Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading
There is loud knocking on the door
Alex rushes to open it and David enters quickly, closing the door behind him
He is still wearing the woman's coat
David
Where on earth have you been
'm freezing
He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement
David is excited, even euphoric
Alex, 've lost my mind woke up at the zoo
But you know what
feel terrific
The zoo
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane
Having no clothes on
That's insane
What did  do last night, Alex
Don't you remember
said goodbye to you
was locked out of the flat climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window
started to read and then was naked at the zoo
(big smile) guess  am out of my fucking mind
Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his shoulders
worried about you
We didn't know where you were
David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back with equal passion
Where did you get that coat
David laughs
73
' Dr
Hirsch is dialing the phone
74
' The phone rings
'll get it
Alex goes to the phone
Hello
The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and Dr
Hirsch
Alex, have you heard anything
Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her
He's here
(excited) Is he all right
Why didn't you call me
Where was he
He doesn't remember
He woke up at the zoo
The zoo
Is he rational
Yes, he is
He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean
Have you read the papers today
Have you listened to the radio or television
No, why
Is David acting strangely
No, not really
Dr
Hirsch considers
Could you get here without any trouble
Yes,  should think so
Right
Now listen carefully
want you to bring David here
want him in my care
'll notify the police that we've found him
It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital
Do you understand
Yes, Doctor
You're certain he's lucid
You won't need any help
He's fine
We'll come right over
Shall  send a car
No, a cab will be faster
expect you shortly
Dr
Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then dials again
Yes, Scotland Yard
75
- Alex and David are walking
The next corner we can get a cab
(grins) should be committed
Dr
Hirsch will know what to do
(stretches) don't know why  feel so good
haven't felt this good in a long time
Alex is signaling for a taxi
My body feels alive, alert feel like an athlete
taxi pulls up; Alex opens the door
Get in
76
- Saint Martin's Hospital
Right
As they drive
It's like the days of the Mad Barber of Fleet Street, isn't it
beg your pardon
The murders
(concerned) What murders
Last night
Haven't you heard
Six people in different parts of the city mutilated
real maniac this one
Pull over
But
(adamant) Pull over
77
- The cab pulls to the sidewalk
Pay the man
David gets out of the cab
David, wait
She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off after David
David, what are you doing
Six people mutilated
It had to be me, Alex
David, stop
He turns and faces her
am going to the cops
There's a full moon tonight
Jack was right
(angry) Jack is dead
Jack is dead
Look, six people have been killed
'm going to the police
David takes off walking briskly down the street
Alex has to jog to keep up with him
David, please be rational
Let's go to Dr
Hirsch
Rational
'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake
He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner
Officer,  killed those people last night
(interested) You did, did you
Alex runs up
He's playing a stupid joke, sir
(dumbfounded) What
We had an argument
He's being silly
(desperate) swear,  don't know this girl
All right, you two, move along
Hey, you asshole
want you to arrest me
There's no call for that kind of language
(shouts) Queen Elizabeth is a man
Prince Charles is a faggot
Winston Churchill was full of shit
(losing patience) Now see here young man
Shakespeare was French
The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell
Shit
Fuck
Piss
The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians start to gather
That's quite enough
(pleading) David, please
Who is this girl
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or  shall arrest you
(frustrated, yelling) That's what  want you to do, you moron
(to Bobbie) Sir, he's very upset
His friend was killed and
Will you shut up
(losing his temper) That's enough
Now go about your business
Yes, David, let's go
(disbelief) You're not going to arrest me
David approaches one of the
Don't you think he should arrest me
Well, 'm not sure
How does he know this isn't a prank
(despair) prank
(urgently) David
The Bobbie has lost all patience
've no time for this foolishness
(to onlookers) Nothing to look at
Move along
The Bobbie walks away
David is beside himself
Hopeless
It's hopeless
(softly) David, let's go now
David turns in a rage
Leave me alone, dammit
You people are crazy
've got to get away from here
've got to do something
(worried) David, don't lose control
(approaching, hysteria) Control
What control
Get away from me
He begins to cry
Leave me alone
He runs out into the street
Cars slam on their brakes, just missing him
David, wait
It's too late
He's lost in traffic
Alex stands for a moment not knowing which way to turn
78
- David is running in panic
He finally comes to rest in an alley
He sits down and sobs uncontrollably
79
'  - Alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk
Dr
Hirsch is talking to Lt
Villiers and Sgt
McManus
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but hardly think
(interrupts) Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him
McMANUS Before nightfall
Precisely
(harried) Gentlemen, please
We shall find Mr
Kessler as quickly as we're able
He tried to have himself arrested
He
(interrupts) Getting arrested isn't all that difficult, Miss Price
He wants help
He
(interrupts) What can we do to assist you
(rising) Stay here
If we need you, we'll know where to reach you
He and Sgt
McManus pause by the door
cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders
We will find him, however
can assure you of that
McMANUS We'll find him, not to worry
The two policemen exit
Dr
Hirsch looks at Alex
(distraught) What shall we do
(comforting) Tea would be nice
80
- David is in a telephone booth
Yes, operator
'd like to call the United States and reverse the charges
David Kessler for anyone
Yes, 'll wait
Hello
Yes, area code 315/472-3402
Thank you
(pause) Hello
Rachel
Just say yes, you'll accept the charges
Just say yes, Rachel
Is Mom or Dad home
Where are they
Where's Max
You're all alone
Mom and Dad wouldn't leave me alone when  was ten
No, not ten and a half either
'm still in London
'm all better
Look, would you tell Mom and Dad that  love them
don't care, Rachel, just do it for me
Okay
Good
And, Rachel, don't fight with Max
Well, try
Look, kid, please don't forget to tell Mom and Dad  love them
love Max and you, too
Well,  do
No, 'm not being weird, you little creep
You promise
Okay
Be a good girl
love you
Bye
He hangs up in profound depression
Leaving the booth he sees an outdoor clock
It is 4:15
He sighs, then catches sight of something
81
-  - '
There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly
He's pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone revealing the grinning skull
He waves to David
Jack points inside the theater and goes in
David smiles, walks across the intersection, and up to the box office
Two and a half quid, please
David reaches in his pocket
All he has are traveler's checks
Will you take a traveler's check
No, sorry
David signs a $100 check and hands it to her
Keep the change
Well, thank you, sir
She gives him a ticket
David goes in
82
- film (to be determined) plays on screen
The small theater is mostly empty
few snoring  and wide- eyed  are scattered about
Jack sits in the last row in the shadows
He waves to David
David goes and sits next to him
Hi, Jack
Hi, David
They sit for a while watching the screen
What can  say, Jack
You don't have to say anything
Aren't you going to say, ` told you so'
If  was still alive, probably would
You look awful
Thank you
(apologizes quickly) didn't mean it
don't know what 'm saying
'm not even sure it was me who killed those people
don't remember doing it
What about the zoo
Well, even if 'm not the wolfman,  am crazy enough to do something like that mean, here  sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse
'm glad to see you, Jack
want you to meet some people
Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, , completely in the shadow
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly
Hello
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway
We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy
(in shadow; very English) Yes,  do look most unpleasant
The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from the seat to a puddle on the floor
(horrified) Why are you doing this to me, Jack
This isn't Mr
Goodman's idea
He is your good friend, whereas  am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities
(appalled) Mr
Bringsly, 'm sorry have absolutely no idea what to say to you
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless
And  understand that  am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted
Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he glistens
You must die, David Kessler
David, this is Harry Berman and his fiancee Judith Browns
The two victims lean forward from their seats next to Mr
Bringsly
We can just make out that Harry has one arm missing
And these gentlemen are Alf, Ted, and Joseph
The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith
All are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen illuminating their gore
#2 Can't say we're pleased to meet you, Mr
Kessler
(defeated) What shall  do
Suicide
(adamantly) You must take your own life
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead
No, David
Harry and  and everyone you murder are not dead
The undead
(to Jack) Why are you doing this to me
Because this must be stopped
How shall  do it
Sleeping pills
#1 Not sure enough
could hang myself
If you did it wrong, it would be painful
You'd choke to death
#3 So what
Let `im choke
Do you mind
The man's a friend of mine
#3 Well he ain't no friend of mine
Gentlemen, please
gun
#1 know where he can get a gun
Don't  need a silver bullet or something
Be serious, would you
David puts his head in his hands
Madness
've gone totally mad
gun is good
You just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger
If you put it in your mouth, then you'd be sure not to miss
Thank you, you're all so thoughtful
As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back from the grisly tableau
David grabs his head suddenly
: 83
- The clock strikes eleven
The full moon is up
84
- David is dripping wet and shaking violently
Three small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle staring at him
(gasps out in anguish) Go away
Please
Go away
The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow more severe
(his face contorting) Run
Please
run
His hands clutch the arms of his chair
Coarse thick hair splits his skin
The children's eyes widen in fascination
85
- Roars and screams come from inside the theater
The at the door says to the Ticket Lady: 'll check on the house
He goes inside the theater
86
- The Ticket Taker enters the theater
The movie continues on screen, but all else is quiet
He cautiously continues down the aisle
He sees something and makes his way towards it
He looks down in horror
: 87
- From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and single out   running furiously to the cinema through the busy traffic
88
- The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical
It's horrible, horrible
There's a beast
mad dog
It's killing people in there
One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside
89
- The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied corpses
He hears something, looks over to see the Wolf hunched over a victim
The Wolf turns, eyes blazing, mouth dripping with blood
We see it clearly for the first time
It is truly a hound from hell, its wolfen features a hideous sight
Its eyes fierce, burning green
The Wolf roars and starts for the cop
The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him
90 As the cop bolts the door shut
#1 For God's sake, Tom, there's a monster in there
The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them down
The cops strain to keep them shut
#1 Call for assistance and tell them to bring guns
Pedestrians start milling around
The door is bulging
The Wolf's roars continue
#2 Keep moving
Will you people get out of the way
91
'  - Alex is asleep
Dr
Hirsch wakes her
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog
David
doubt it
But it's something to do
92
- An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are distributed to uniformed men
93
- Police cars arrive, sirens blaring
Officers are pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door closed against the Wolf's battering
Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt
Villiers and Sgt
McManus
What the hell is going on here
It's some kind of animal, sir
We
Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the Wolf, eyes blazing
It leaps on Lt
Villiers, savaging him
The crowd falls back in panic
The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling one through a shop window
Mass confusion as orders are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf
It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac
It stops in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall
The Wolf whirls around, defiant, roaring
The cops quickly barricade the entrance to the alley
94
- The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester Square
Police vehicles roar past
David
It's David
She jumps from the car before Dr
Hirsch can stop her
95
- The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the alley
Alex runs to them
Let me through
Stand clear, miss
must get through
Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley
The officers shout after her
Dr
Hirsch reaches the police line
Alex
Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley
David
Is it you
Is it true, David
She's almost to the end
The Wolf lays in wait in the shadows
The police raise their weapons
David
In that brief instant, Alex realizes it will kill her
Fire
The guns blaze
The Wolf falls dead
Alex leans on the wall, numb
The cops, Dr
Hirsch, and Sgt
McManus run to the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and riddled with bullets
Alex begins to weep
