- The hallway is a mess
window opening onto a light well is open
The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open
plain- clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around
They all wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses
Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their way in
They're both holding their noses
In his free hand, the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional flyers
Behind him, comes a female neighbor
- (to the superintendent and the ) Wait Outside please
He signals to a police officer who herds the curious onlookers back out through the door
(to the superintendent, pointing to a pile of mail) What's the date of the last letter
() The 16th from what  can see
Wait
The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the door on the left
It has been sealed up with adhesive tape
- (to the fire officer) Can you try
While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes detective goes into the adjoining dining room
He opens the windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via the double doors
They are locked and the gaps are also taped up
He turns to the right and goes into the living room, where he also opens up the windows
(
) The door is open
and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting firemen
Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the police officer and the janitor
2
no as far as  know
During the whole time, they had a nurse, but it's been a while since  last saw her
My wife has been
The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now accessible
Its windows are open and the draft makes the curtains billow into the room
- (to the firemen who are now curious enough to come and stand by the ) Did you open the windows
The firemen shake their heads
The -  turns toward the big double bed placed against the back wall of the bedroom
On the right- hand bed, there's only the bare mattress
On the left-hand bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman
Where once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes
The corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers that have already dried out a little
On her chest is a crucifix
2 - White letters on a black background: 3 -
- All we see is the audience pouring into the hall
and , both are around eighty, are part of this crowd
They go to their seats in one of the rows near the front
Once everybody is seated, we hear the usual  asking people to turn off their mobile phones
Some people, caught with their phones switched on, hasten to comply
Then the lights go out
Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance here and there
Finally, the  begins
4 -
- The music from Scene 3 continues
The soloist is surrounded by admirers who congratulate him
Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room
(If the soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most of the others)
3
When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly, visibly glad to see them
5 -
- Continuation of the  from Scene 3
Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty bus
Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from time to time, and smiles now and then
They are both relaxed and happy
6 -
-  - The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the outside
Georges comes in, turns on the light
He and Anne observe the open door
Around the lock, one can see the traces of an attempted forced entry
Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep grooves
They used a screwdriver or something like that
it doesn't look very professional
But who would do something like that
No idea
Why do people break in
Because they want to steal something
From us
(laughs briefly out loud) Hey, why not
If  thought about it,  could come up with at least three or four people we know who've been burgled
After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him
4
What time is it
Can't we call the superintendent
'll do that tomorrow morning
Anyway, they didn't see anything
He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet in the hallway
(') Don't let it spoil your good mood now
Or the police
Come on, give me your coat
She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with his in the closet
Imagine if we were here, in our beds, and someone broke in
Why should  imagine that
But it's terrible
think 'd die of fright
() So would
He undoes his shoes
(') Shall we have a drink
'm tired
still fancy a drink
He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his slippers
Anne has gone into the bathroom
5
(
) Go ahead then
Mathilde told me that in her building, the attic apartment was burgled from the loft
They just knocked a hole in the wall, cut out all of the valuable pictures from their frames and disappeared without a trace
He goes toward the kitchen
They must have been professionals
As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears to be looking at Anne
(') Did  tell you, you looked good tonight
: (
) () What's got into you
With a gentle , Georges disappears into the kitchen, where he turns on the lights
We hear him  , apparently getting a glass and some wine
After a short : (') Weren't those semiquavers in the presto incredible
What staccato
Don't you agree
Short
(
) You're proud of him, huh
7 -
- Georges wakes up
He looks with amazement beside him, then raises his eyes
Anne is sitting upright, her back against the headboard
(') Something wrong
No
6
After a while, the  of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to the next scene
8 -
- The egg timer in the kitchen
Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is half set for breakfast
He has mobile phone raised to his ear and a phone book opened in front of him
Anne is getting up from the table
She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas, takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under cold water
Like Georges, she is still in her robe
(on the phone) What about next week
No but still, it would make sense to get it done soon
It might give people silly ideas
And anyway, it's too ugly to look at
Wednesday
What time
Will you bring the paint with you too, to paint over it
But at least some primer
Yes,
Thank you
He hangs up
(') ( ) You can depend on that guy
(who comes back to the table with the egg)  hope so
The last time, he kept us waiting for ages, if you remember
(laughs while acquiescing) Yes, that's true
(Reacting when she places the egg in his egg cup) Thanks
If  call a regular professional, we'll still be waiting two months time
(more to herself) Really
She has sat down
Looks straight ahead
He cracks open his egg, puts salt on it, eats
7
The Frodons waited three days when their toilet was blocked
Not exactly pleasant
He eats
Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is empty
(') The saltcellar is empty
He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal with it
As she doesn't react, he realizes the inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself, heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar
(') don't know if he's going to bring us the
Maybe he won't come at all
In any case, he didn't mention it
'd like to buy it
It was really good and  don't want to wait long for it
We could go to Virgin this afternoon and buy it
What do you say
He comes back to the table and sits down again
(') Hmmm
Anne
What's the matter
She looks at him and doesn't answer
(') What's going on
What's the matter
He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously
(') Helllloooo
Cuckoo
'm here
She continues to look at him without reacting
(') (serious now) Anne
What's going on
He waits, looks at her
No reaction
He stands up slightly, leans over the table to sit beside her
Tries to make her turn toward him
(') Anne, what's the matter
8
He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but her eyes look through him
(') Anne
what's
He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him
(') Anne
She stares into the void
He drops his hands
Then sits beside her, for quite awhile
Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap, wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and places it on Anne's face
Waits for a reaction that doesn't come
Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and applies the cloth there
Then sits down and looks at her imploringly
(') (close to tears) Anne
Darling
please
Once again they both remain seated
In the background, we hear the  of the tap that in his panic he has forgotten to turn it off
Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time
Suddenly, the  of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far as the bedroom
George doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short
(') Anne
Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen
Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him
What are you doing
She turns toward the breakfast
(') You left the water running
9
Georges stares at her
(both aghast and furious) Hey, what's going on
Are you completely crazy
Is this supposed to be a joke, or what's going on
She looks at him with amazement
What did you say
() Is this a joke
Is this meant to be a joke
What joke
don't get it
Why are you talking to me like that
What's got into you
Georges comes from the door to the table
Anne
Please
Stop this game
It's not funny
( ) What game, for Christ's sake
What on earth's the matter
Georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone, but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken
He tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside Anne, sits down and looks at his wife
She doesn't know how to react
What's the matter
Why didn't you react
To what
To what
To me, to everything
When
10
Just now
moment ago
Please tell me what's wrong
What am  supposed to have done
Georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at Anne
He doesn't want to believe that its serious
don't know what to say
Do you really not know what just happened
But what  happen
(almost reluctantly bowing his head as he speaks) You were sitting there, staring at me
You didn't answer me when  asked you what the matter was
He picks up the wet tea towel from the table
(') put this tea towel on your face, and you didn't react
Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her head, perturbed that she can't understand
Georges looks at her
He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe
(') Look
There's still dampness on your collar
Anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the damp marks
She slowly grasps that something is awry
When
When was it
Just now, a few minutes ago
So
There's no "So"
went into the bedroom to get dressed
wanted to get help
11
Help
Yes, and then you turned off the tap
Yes
Because you left it on
(') don't understand
Neither do
(') Don't you think it's best if  call Dr
Bertier
Why
What can he do
don't know
Examine you
'm fine
There's nothing wrong with me
Anne, please
That's absurd
We can't pretend that nothing happened
But what  happen
(') 'm here
'm having my breakfast, and you're telling me things happened that  don't understand
Can you explain how the tea towel got there
12
() No,  can't
Who turned on the tap
You did
Can you remember that
(more and more desperate, close to tears) No  can't
Do you want to torture me
Leave me in peace
Georges looks at her
Don't you think it would be better to fetch Dr
Bertier
No
She takes her cup of tea, as if to show how well she is, and drinks it up
When she wants to re-fill her cup, she completely misses her aim
She notices it, puts down her cup and bursts into tears
9 -
- We see wide shots of the apartment
The hallway
The bedroom
The living room
The dining room
The kitchen
Nobody in sight
10 -
- , around 50, has come to pay a visit
Anne isn't there
You know how he is
Once he's got something into his head, he has to go through with it
In the end, everybody was delighted
And besides, it didn't hurt our financial situation
We're playing until the 28th
() 13
(') Then we have 10 days to rest, then we go to Stockholm for four days, and then to Kumo in Finland
Heaven knows where that is
At the North Pole
But Geoff's already been there few times, and he loves it
We're playing the "Dowland Transcriptions" there and then we're back in London
What about the children
Liz is at boarding school and John is living his own life
He's twenty- six years old
What does he do
He's a student
We rarely see him
He's got his own ideas
Life Geoff
They don't really get along
Geoff wants to advise him on everything, and John doesn't like that at all
Is he good
think so
He's less impulsive
Very industrious
That sounds rather derogatory
No
He's not like Geoff
Quiet, but stubborn
think he'll do all right
At the last Conservatory concert, he played the solo part in the Haydn Concerto
It was very good
Geoff was there and congratulated him at the end
Brief
And you
What do you mean
14
Did you both make up
(with a little laugh) My God, you know him, don't you
Over the winter, he suddenly discovered his passion for a viola player who'd been in our ensemble for years
What can  tell you
It was a huge drama, and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide
That scared him and he came back to me in full remorse
've got used to it now
What's a bit embarrassing is that the ensemble, you can't keep any secrets from anyone
Do you love him
Yes,  think so
Brief
(') What's aphasia
Georges gestures that it's too complicated
What can  say
The carotid artery was blocked
They did an ultrasound scan, two in fact, and they said they had to operate on her
She was scared
She was confused and scared
You know she has always been afraid of doctors
They said the risk was very low and that if they didn't operate, she'd be certain to have a serious stroke
And what do they say now
Just that it didn't go well
It's one of the 5% that go wrong
He yawns
15
(') It's pretty upsetting
He looks at his watch
(') Usually at this time,  take a nap
My blood sugar is somewhere down in my socks
'm so sorry
Yeah
What can  do for you
Nothing
It was nice of you to come despite all of your stress
Brief
She doesn't know what to say
(') No, really
There's nothing you can do
We'll see how things go when she's back here in the apartment
We'll manage
Maybe 'll get a caretaker in, or maybe 'll manage on my own
We'll see
We've been through quite a lot in our time, your mother and
( ) All this is still a bit new
(with a little laugh) It's funny
don't know if should say it
Maybe it'll embarrass you
But when  came here a short while ago,  suddenly remembered how  always used to listen to the two of you making love when  was little
() 16
(') For me, at the time, it was reassuring
It gave me a feeling that you loved each other, and that we'd always be together
11 -
- carpenter and his assistant are raising the base of the double bed
Georges watches
12 -
-   - The door of the apartment is opened
Georges comes in
Behind him is Anne in a wheelchair, pushed by a paramedic
second paramedic (as young as the first) follows with a suitcase and a large bag
Behind them, the superintendent
Georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible
He stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first paramedic
Here
Thank you very much
It's for both of you
You can just put the things down here
There, beside the window, right
We'll be okay on our own
Thanks a lot
The two paramedics exchange a brief glance, say thanks, and leave the apartment, passing the superintendent as they go
(') (to the superintendent) Thank you, Mr
Mery
If you need anything, just call downstairs
If we can help at all
Right now everything's fine
'll let your wife know as soon as we need anything
( ) It's nice to have you back, Mrs
Laurent
Yes
Thank you, Mr
Mery
Thank you
17
The superintendent hesitates another moment
(') Yes, thanks
Yes
So
Goodbye then, ma'am
Welcome home again
Goodbye, Sir
Goodbye, Mr
Mery
Goodbye
He leaves the apartment
There is a brief moment of perplexity
Then Georges says: (with a nervous smile) Where do you want
In the living room
Georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the wheelchair and pushes Anne into the
The doorway is narrow
The wheelchair only just passes through it
Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the armchairs and then steps in front of her
Shall  make some tea
(with a faint smile) First come sit with me
George registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a clumsy way
He sits down in one of the two arm chairs
(') Can you help me into the chair
Georges stands back up
() Of course
18
He extends his hands
She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm to Georges
It's best if you put my arm around your neck and your right arm around me, that way it'll be easy
He does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together the short distance to the second arm chair
Cautiously, he lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight
Because they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward and clumsy
(') Thanks
He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer "Don't mention it"
Then he sits down opposite her
At first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the fact that words do not come easily
After a long while, during which we hear the intermittent sound of the below
(softly almost to himself) 'm glad you're back
(in a voice just as soft) Me too
Another
Then Anne says: (') Promise me one thing
What
Please never take me back to the hospital
What
19
She looks at him
He has understood
You promise
Anne
You promise
Anne,
Don't talk right now
And don't give me any lectures
Please
Brief
What can  say, it's
( ) Nothing
Just don't say anything
13 -
- He helps her into bed, then throws the blanket over her
There
Thank you
Thank you, Darling
Everything
() Everything's fine
He hesitates
20
(') You don't have to hold my hand all the time now
can look after myself, you know
He nods
(') And don't feel guilty
That would be pointless
And a drag
For me too
don't feel guilty
That's good
She smiles
(') Go over there now
'm not a cripple
You can easily leave me alone for two minutes
won't collapse
(with a slight smile) Did you buy the new book on Harnoncourt
've already read it
And
Do you want it
'll get it for you
Sure
He goes out of the room to fetch the book
She remains lying there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the blanket that has slipped out of place a little
After a while, we hear Georges shouting
21
(
) don't know where  put it
Don't worry
It isn't that important
(
) Yes, it is
Hold on, maybe it's in the
Just a moment
Viola
Here you are
Nothing like an infallible memory
She smiles, looks in his direction
He enters with the book in his hand
(') thought 'd left it over there in the other room, but 'd already put it away
Tidy people just can't help being tidy
(taking the book) Thanks
She puts the book on her stomach
Looks at Georges
(') Right now, take care of yourself
And don't wait to see how  hold the book in my hand,
He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom
She waits till he's outside
Tries to relax
Then she remembers the book
She takes it in her left hand and tries to open it
It's not easy for her
Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses
She rests the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on the night stand
In the end, she manages it
Then she opens the book again, and tries to read
14 -
- The superintendent's wife puts the filled supermarket bags on the counter
Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top of one of the bags and puts it down beside them
Then she takes out the receipt and the change
22
' Unfortunately the strawberries were already moldy
'll go and get you some fresh ones tomorrow from the market
My husband will bring you the bottled water this afternoon
'm not supposed to carry anything heavy: my back, you know
Sure, no problem
' It came to 76 euros and 40 cents
There's the till receipt and here's your change: 23 euros 60
Thank you very much
Keep the change
Thanks
' Thank you, sir
Short embarrassed
'  (') Well, 'll be off
Call me if you need anything else
Yes
will
' Is your wife well
Yes, she's
She's recovering
' Fine
Give her my regards
My husband and  are very glad she's back
Yes, we are too
Bye, Mrs
Mery, thanks so much
' Goodbye, sir
She heads toward the front door of the apartment, turns around again toward Georges
23
'  (') 'll bring you the strawberries tomorrow around noon, if that suits you
He nods, she closes the door as she leaves
15 -
-  - He stands in front of the closed door of the toilet, waiting
After a while, we hear the noise of flushing
After a while longer, we hear (
) There
Can you come in, please
He opens the toilet door, goes around Anne, pulls her up, she puts her left arm around his neck, keeps herself upright that way, he pulls up her pants under her skirt
Then they slowly hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the wheelchair
16 -
- They are both lying in their beds
Anne sleeps, Georges lies with his eyes open, listening attentively to her breathing
17 -
- The sun shines in
Georges has cooked something simple
They are both in a good mood, eating and drinking
some banal romance or other about a nobleman and a lower middle- class girl who couldn't have each other and who then, out of sheer magnanimity, decide to renounce their love - in fact  don't quite remember it any more
In any case, afterwards  was thoroughly distraught, and it took me a bit of time to calm down
In the courtyard of the house where grandma lived, there was a young guy at the window who asked me where 'd been
He was a couple of years older than me, a braggart who of course really impressed me
"To the movies", said, because  was proud that my grandma had given me the money to go all alone to the cinema
() 24
(') "What did you see
"  started to tell him the story of the movie, and as  did, all the emotion came back
didn't want to cry in front of the boy, but it was impossible; there  was, crying out loud in the courtyard, and  told him the whole drama to the bitter end
So
How did he react
No idea
He probably found it amusing
don't remember
don't remember the film either
But remember the feeling
That  was ashamed of crying, but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back, almost more powerfully than when  was actually watching the film, and that  just couldn't stop
She looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food
That's cute
Why didn't you ever tell me before
There are still a few stories you don't know
Aha
Don't tell me you're going to ruin your image in your old age
() You bet  won't
But what is my image
She takes a mouthful, eats ponderously
Then she looks at him
() Sometimes you're a rotter
But you're nice
( ) Can  take you for a drink
25
She laughs
18 -
- He does physiotherapy exercises with her
Counts the repetitive movements of the exercises
19 -
- She's lying on the sofa
He's seated in the armchair
They're both reading the newspaper
After a while: Listen to this
My horoscope
Motto: You have lots of verve, but need to be more serious
Love: High-class conversation is what you need
Work: You're motivated again
But proceed with care
Health: Loosen up by doing exercises
It'll give you renewed pizzazz
Then (-) You've only yourself to blame if you read stuff like that
Brief
Then: (') Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's funeral
You have to go
fear  must
don't want to go at all
Who does like going to funerals
Oh,  know a few people who do
Annette can never wait to get all dolled up again
And Francois has
26
You're mean
What would you say if no one came to your funeral
(dryly) Nothing, presumably
She shoots him a glance, smiles at his irony
Then she says: Have you talked to Jeanne since was in the hospital
mean, does she know  can't come
Of course
What did she say
She was shocked
How
(a bit irritated) My God, what are people like when they're shocked
She couldn't believe it, she was speechless don't remember any more
In any case, not exactly
've spoken to a lot of people since
Sorry
No, 'm sorry
didn't mean to be unkind, but  just don't see the point of talking about it all the time
Short
Do  talk about it all the time
27
No
Sorry
Don't worry
20 -
-   - The front door is unlocked from the outside, and Georges enters
He's back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion
He turns on the light
He's wet
Clearly, it's been raining
As he closes the door again, his eyes fall on Anne
With her back to him, she is sitting on the floor in front of the opened window of the light well, half propped against her wheelchair
What
Shaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in the wheelchair
Outside, in the light well, it is raining
(once she's seated in the ) Why are you back already
What time is it
Georges has understood immediately
He closes the window noiselessly
Then just stands there, at a loss
Then (') () Forgive me,  was too slow
Anne
Can you wheel me into the living room
Yes
28
He turns toward her, pushes the wheelchair into the living room between the two armchairs
Turns on the light
Stops beside the switch
They both look exhausted
(') You're always good at surprises
Yes
Why are you home earlier
didn't come home earlier
took a taxi
In August, there isn't a lot of traffic
That's true
How was the funeral
Anne
How was it, go on, tell me
He thinks an instant, then goes and sits down facing her in an armchair
Looks at her
She raises her head and returns his look
He understands that he can't insist right now
Long Then he begins: It was rather bizarre
The priest was an idiot
Then one of Pierre's co-workers made a speech that was embarrassingly emotional
His old secretary came with a radio- cassette player and after the speech she put on "Yesterday" by the Beatles
You can't imagine
Everybody turned round to look at her
Apparently, it wasn't planned
His grandchildren were there
Of course they giggled as soon as the music began
Then the urn was put on a huge stretcher that was obviously designed for a coffin, and out we went into the rain
They placed the urn on a small electric cart that crawled along for what seemed like an eternity to the tiny hole they had dug
lot of people had to stifle their laughter
It must have been terrible for Jeanne
have
29
( ) There's just no point in going on living
know it can only get worse
Why should  inflict it on us
On you and me
You're not inflicting anything on me
You don't have to lie, Georges
Imagine you were me
Didn't you ever think something like this could happen to one of us
Of course  did
But imagination and reality have little in common
But things are getting better every day
We'll
( ) Georges,  don't want to carry on
You're making such efforts to make everything easier for me
But don't want to go on
For my own sake
Not yours
don't believe you
know you
You think you're a burden on me
But what if things were the other way around
What would you do then
don't know
can't be bothered to think about being you
'm tired
You tire me
Everything tires me
can't talk
want to go to bed
He looks at her
Finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair out of frame
21 -
- 30
She is lying in bed
The bedside lamp is on
We hear the  coming from the living room: a program about the fauna and flora of the South Seas, or something similar
22 -
-   - Georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door
On the doorstep stands the soloist (male or female) from Scenes 3 and 4
(somewhat perplexed, but pleased) Oh hello
Nice to see you
Forgive me for dropping in on you like this, Professor
tried to reach you by phone a couple of times, but no luck
'm sorry
only pick up the phone when 've stored the caller's number and  can see who's calling
Why didn't you leave a message
Anyway, do come in
He closes the door behind his guest
just couldn't manage to come by after the concert
was so sorry, because  was so pleased you came along
Come with me
While they pass into the living room, they continue to speak: And now, an unexpected opportunity has arisen because Francois Mitry called me - you know him, he's my agent - to say he'd arranged for me to meet the boss of the Theatre des Champs-Elysees tonight to talk about their new concert series
() 31
(') So  flew to Paris this morning, and while  was in my hotel, thought, 'll just give it a try and drop in
After all, it's virtually just around the corner
Sorry, these are for your wife
He takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and hands it to Georges
(') Isn't she at home
Yes, she is
'll go and get her in a minute
Have a seat
hope 'm not disturbing you too much
No, not at all
'm happy that you came
We were so thrilled by your concert
We hoped we'd see you again soon
Please do have a seat
Can  can get you something
cup of tea
No, no, thank you very much
Hold on, 'll just freshen up the flowers; in this heat they wilt so fast
've only just bought them
They should keep quite
But Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and closed the door behind him
The soloist looks around him
After a few moments we hear the  of Anne and Georges in the distance, without understanding what they're saying
It lasts a while
Finally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne, in her wheelchair, into the living room
32
Martin
What a delight
How lovely to see you
The (male or female) soloist has got up and doesn't quite know how to handle the situation
Mrs
Laurent
Lovely to see you too
Don't get up
Come on, sit yourself down and don't look so shocked
The soloist sits down hesitantly, Georges pushes the wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down
Brief embarrassed
(') 'm so proud of you
We were both in raptures after your concert
Georges wanted to buy your new the very next morning
Oh God
wanted to bring you the , but  left in such a hurry that forgot it
'm so sorry
'll get one today and drop it by
() No, no, don't worry
We want to make a contribution to your success
Even if it's only twenty euros
You've already contributed so much
owe you so much, Madame
You owe it to your hard work and your talent
(shaking his head a little) Do you remember, when you first gave me the Bagatelles to play
was twelve at the time, and in my youthful arrogance  said: "But why the Bagatelles
" And you really gave me a piece of your mind
33
They both smile
Then he goes on: (') So what happened
My right side is paralyzed, that's all
It can happen when you get older
And how
Let's talk about something else, shall we
() Sure
Don't be offended
But  want to enjoy the lovely interlude you've given us with your visit
() Of course
Brief
You haven't told us yet what's been going on since the Paris concert
The soloist is a bit thrown by the couple's behavior
Well, actually 've spent most of the time in London studying
Then went to Copenhagen for two performances, that was Schubert too
My whole life revolves around Schubert at the moment
The concerts with the Impromptus and the Moments Musicaux, and for my bread-and-butter work 'm developing the sonatas
Not the late ones,  think  still need a couple more years for those
34
(The dialogue concerning music will be modified according to the performer chosen
) Could you do me a favor
() Really
Would you play Fur Elise
() Um,  don't know if  remember it very well
Beethoven, it's been a long time since 've
But if you want
Give it a try
() He looks at Georges, then at Anne again, gets up, goes to the grand piano and plays
23 -
- Georges is leaning against the chest, and watches Anne, who is practicing maneuvering her new electric wheelchair
Forward, backward, turning
In the end, she goes round and round in circles several times
He laughs, so does she
24 -
-   - Anne is lying in bed
book rests on her stomach
She listens to the  playing coming from the living room
After a while the music stops
What's the matter
Georges is seated in front of the open piano
His hands in his lap, he looks straight ahead

Georges gets up, irritated, crosses the  and enters the
Anne lies on the floor, beside the overturned night stand, in the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal
(shocked, and hence furious) Good God, what are you doing
He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into the bed
(') Have you lost your senses
don't believe it
How stupid
He points to the broken objects
(') Look at that
Did you need to do that
Can't you call me when you need something
(meekly) 'm sorry
( ) Yes, so am
() Sorry
Georges bends down, and begins to gather up the scattered objects
The lamp is broken too

Bathroom
Georges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth
The doorbell rings
Georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and over to the front door
(') Yes
Who's there
No answer
Georges is very irritated
, Anne calls to : Georges
What's going on
Who is it
Georges opens the door
Outside, however, instead of the usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment
It looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment
couple of ladders are propped against the opposite wall
At the other end of the room, to the side, is a small door
Georges is stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened
Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door
, in the distance, Anne's worried voice: (') Georges
What's going on
Georges opens the small door
Behind it is a narrow, windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room
At the end of the corridor, a door
Georges heads toward this door and opens it too
Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally bright as the others
Everything is very quiet
Georges enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor, crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the hallway of the apartment
But it too is now empty and bright, with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the bedroom is open
Behind that too, it appears to be empty and bright
Georges goes toward it
At the same time, we hear '
At first he groans, but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder
Shortly after, we also hear: ' : Georges, what's going on
29 -
- Darkness 37
' Calm down will you
There's nothing there
It's nothing
She manages to switch on the bedside lamp
Georges is sitting up in his bed, having just awoken, wide-eyed with terror
His breathing is labored
Anne extends her good hand toward him, caresses his back to calm him
He slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow
What was it
He doesn't answer
Continues breathing heavily
She caresses him
(still with labored breathing) didn't understand
thought 'd gone mad
It was something impossible
What was

- Close shot on the screen of a cell phone
We read on it: Coming to Paris on 12th
Plan to stop by in afternoon
Hope all well
So look forward to seeing you
Love Eva
We hear
the voice of Eva
They're coming on the 12th
He crouches down in front of Anne who is seated on the bed, puts his mobile phone back in his pocket and continues to put on her socks and her shoes
Why
No idea
Apparently she's coming with Geoff
When is it
38
don't know exactly
What day is it today
'll go and look
Short
don't want that
What
Geoff doesn't need to come
Georges doesn't agree, but continues to dress Anne
(') don't need any comments on my predicament
can only take his British humor in small doses
31 -
- Once more the set of physiotherapy exercises
Things are going better
Georges smiles encouragingly at Anne, noticing her improvement
She reacts like someone duty-bound, but without conviction
32 -
- Close shot: a  is inserted into a player
As the begins (the concert heard in Scene 3), Georges takes a card out of the envelope that contained the  and reads it to : Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur Laurent, it was beautiful and yet sad to see you
My heartfelt wishes that things will get better
With deep gratitude, your former pupil, Martin
The  makes their  less awkward
Then, after a long while, Anne says: Stop the
He hesitates, looks at her, then stops the music
They remain 39

-   - They eat
Suddenly, Anne says: (') Where are the family albums
The family albums
don't know, there, in the other room
Why
Can you get them for me
What, now
Anne nods
(') Why, Anne
'd like to look at them
Georges hesitates, and doesn't understand the suddenness of this request
(') Please
He finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room
He comes back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away the remains of Anne's meal and sets down the first album in front of her
(') Thanks
(a bit irritated) You're welcome
With her able hand, Anne opens the album, looks at the photos, turns the pages, looks
That's nice
(self-consciously, softly) What

Life
so long
What a long life
Georges looks at her
She continues to thumb through the pages
After a while she turns toward him
(') Stop watching me
(caught in the act) wasn't watching you
Of course you were
'm not that dumb yet

- They are both lying in bed
Georges reads the day's news to Anne from the newspaper
When he looks over to her, she has fallen asleep
He then puts the newspaper on the night stand and turns out the light

-  -  - Bedroom
It's morning
Georges is helping Anne to get out of bed into her wheelchair
As he does it, he notices that the bed and her nightgown are wet
You're soaked through
What do you mean
Brief
Hold on
He sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room
(') 'll be right back
During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed, and waits
He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat of the wheelchair
41
(') It's no big deal
Come on
He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes her through the hallway into the bathroom
He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head
She starts to  inconsolably
He caresses her face
(') Come on, darling
It's nothing serious
Things like that happen
() can't
take it any more
He holds her tightly against him, strokes her hair, feeling helpless
My love
My darling
36 -
- Anne is in bed
She's on a drip
Eva is seated on a chair beside the bed
thinking about whether it wouldn't be better to invest the money in an apartment block
If inflation gets going again, property is the only sure thing
Right now, savings accounts pay 1
75% at best
Four years ago, Geoff bought some stocks with a small sum of money and the whole thing collapsed
So now we're obviously worried
Unfortunately, in the meantime, other people have had the same idea, and property prices are going through the roof
Since we came back from Scandinavia,  spend all my spare time looking through newspaper ads
To put an end to the  that follows, she adds: (') It takes time, that's all
We'll find something in the end

How much is she asking
It's paid by the hour

Geoff nods
Georges shrugs

Sometimes  get the feeling she's totally unaware of the state she's in
And then feel the opposite
It's

And what about the doctor
What does he say
43
He's
Eva comes in through the door
She's in floods of tears
() She only talks gibberish
don't know what
Geoff gets up, hesitantly
Hey, dear
He goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was sitting
(') come here, sit down, it's
She shakes him off, irritated, and sits down
Nothing is
At first he's vexed by her brusque response, but then goes to sit down on the sofa
Meanwhile, Eva turns to Georges: (') What's going on, actually
You can't just leave her lying on her bed like that
She's unrecognizable
It's ridiculous
We can't do anything for the moment
Calm down, darling
She's getting medical treatment, they give her the necessary medication, and there are no other options right now
What does that mean, "no other options"
Why isn't she in a hospital
She had a second stroke
Bertier examined her and felt we could spare her all the hospital inpatient procedures
() 44
(') Anyway, they wouldn't keep her, they'd send her to a care home
What they do in those places, we can do here
Eva looks at him, amazed
(') And she won't be put in a care home
promised her that
Don't you think you're taking on too much
Have you got a better idea
Geoff doesn't know what to say
Eva has composed herself somewhat and blows her nose
can't believe that these days there's no way of handling this efficiently
() No one's stopping you from finding out
Eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window
Georges follows her with his eyes
(') () Believe me,  love your mother as much as you do
So please, don't treat me as if  was a total idiot incapable of doing the obvious
didn't say that
'm simply questioning whether what  see going on here is the answer to everything
( ) Don't you want to get a second opinion
45
Now you two had better stop,
Another doctor did come
He said Bertier was right
From Monday, a nurse will come three times a week
Now can we talk about something else
Like what
38 -
- Georges washes the tea cups that he used for Eva and Geoff
On the radio, the

- With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne down and put an incontinence pad on her
She's now almost incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an object, as tears flow silently down her face
40 -
- Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3
We watch her and listen to her for a while
Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano
Finally he leans over toward the  player and stops it
The suddenly stops
Georges remains silently seated
41 -
-  -  - He prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water and brings both into the bedroom
Sits down on the bed close to Anne to feed her her food
There, my love,  hope you like it
He begins to feed her
added a little orange juice find it tastes quite good
She can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running back out of her mouth
He wipes it with a tea towel, continues to feed her
Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she keeps her mouth shut
46
(') Come on, Anne, you have to eat some more
You've only swallowed three mouthfuls
Anne continues to keep her lips sealed
(') Please, darling
bit more
Anne doesn't move
He puts the muesli on the night stand and holds the sipping cup to her lips
She drinks slowly, one sip after the other
He pulls the cup back between each sip, to give her more time
Suddenly she says: Mom to the concert
Yes
Mom to the concert
no dress
Mom has no dress for the concert
Mom to concert
no
uuu
no
Yes

Georges waits

- Georges and the nurse install Anne on a metal armchair in the shower
As she does so, the nurse keeps talking reassuringly to Anne
Finally, she turns on the tap
(in a monotone) Help
Help
Help
Help
Help
Help
Without being phased, the nurse continues to speak reassuringly
Georges remains standing there, helpless

Kitchen
Georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of coffee
In front of the nurse, on the table, is a sum of money
As they speak, we hear, coming from the room, Anne's we could take turns
She'd come from 8 till 12 and 'd do 2 until 6, or 3 to 7
That would certainly relieve the pressure on you
'll think about it
She just has to know in time so she can arrange it in her schedule
Yes, of course, 'll let you know in the next few days
Very well
have to go now
She takes the money on the table, pockets it and gets up
(') Thanks for the coffee
My pleasure
'll see you out
They both leave the kitchen
As the nurse, in the hallway, takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on, she comments on Anne's continuing
You mustn't take it too seriously
Usually they always say something
She might just as well say "Mom, Mom, Mom"
It's just mechanical
(nodding, softly) know
They've reached the door
Goodbye, sir
48
Goodbye
He closes the door behind her
Remains motionless a moment, then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's   , unaltered, continue
Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand, holds her
After a while, Anne calms down, her become quieter and finally stop altogether
After a long : (') (slowly, softly) 'd like to hire a second nurse
The two could take turns
That would make everything a bit simpler
What do you think

Then: (softly)

Georges  noisily
Anne's eyes are open

-  - The front door
We hear the key in the lock
Georges enters with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent
He carries bigger and heavier bags
Georges holds the door open for him
Would you mind putting them in the kitchen
The superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the bags
Georges calls toward the bedroom: (') 'm ba-aack
He then follows the superintendent into the kitchen
The superintendent has put the bags on the work surface
(') Thanks very much
49
Can  do anything else for you, sir
No, thanks, Mr
Mery
You've been a big help
Oh, it's nothing, sir
Georges has already taken out his wallet and gives some money to the superintendent
(') Thanks a lot, sir
'll let you know if  need you again
With pleasure, sir
He gets ready to leave
He stops again in the doorway and turns around
(') May  say something, sir
What is it
My wife and , we're very impressed by the way you're managing everything
take my hat off to you
As he speaks, Georges' mobile phone has started to ring
(taking the mobile phone from the pocket of his jacket) That's very kind of you
Thanks
See you soon
Give my regards to your wife
certainly will
Thanks

As the superintendent leaves the apartment, Georges looks at the display on his mobile phone and makes a call

Holds it in front of Anne's face

It starts to explore the surroundings
We hear the
Georges comes out of the toilet
The door opening frightens the pigeon
Alarmed, flapping its wings, it flutters about the room
After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back toward the window
But the bird escapes in the opposite direction
George follows it
He closes the doors of the other rooms
Coming from the bedroom, we faintly hear '
52
Georges fetches a towel from the bathroom
He chases the bird
He hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes back out through the window
Georges, visibly exhausted, has to sit down on the chest in the hallway
49 -
- Georges and the second nurse
as you wish, sir
don't know what you were expecting
gave up another job to come and work here
You should have thought it over before deciding whether you wanted a second nurse or not
But 've only just found out how incompetent you are
() What's that supposed to mean
don't want to discuss it with you
Anyway, you wouldn't understand
No one has ever complained
Good for you
(To get rid of her) How much do  owe you
(after a brief calculation) Seven hundred and eighty euros
Georges takes his wallet from his jacket hanging on the armchair and takes out eight one-hundred euro bills
The nurse is hopping mad
(') 've never had anything like this happen to me before
Who do you think you are
've been doing this job for ten years
don't need you to teach me how to do it
Do you have twenty euros
53
The nurse takes out her purse angrily, looks inside
No
Then take the eight hundred euros
You can go now
The nurse pockets the money
You're a nasty old man
feel sorry for you
Georges has put back his wallet, turns to her again and looks at her
hope from the bottom of my heart that one day someone treats you the way you treat your patients, and that you too will have no way of defending yourself
Now get out
She looks at him, at first doesn't know what to answer, then: Go fuck yourself, you old fart
She leaves, slamming the door behind her
few seconds later, we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut
Georges sits down in his armchair, looks straight ahead
Then he lights a cigarette, his hands shake, he smokes

- He tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping cup
She won't loosen her lips
Please, open your mouth

She looks at him
He bends over her again, presents the cup in front of her sealed lips
(') Come on, Anne, please
She doesn't react
He opens her lips with his fingers and tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth
Pours a little tea in
The liquid runs out of her mouth
(') () Goddammit
He puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid, some of which has run down onto the pillow
He tries to mop it up
She watches him the whole time
Finally he puts the towel down beside the cup and looks at her
Tries not to show his helplessness and his anger
(') Anne
You can't force me to let you die of thirst
If you persist, 'll call Bertier and he'll put you in hospital
They can force-feed you there
Is that what you want

But you must help me
'm out of my depth
He takes the cup again and puts it against her lips

Her lips remain sealed
He presses the cup hard against them

It hurts her, so she opens her mouth and lets in a little liquid

She closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup

Suddenly, the
Georges, annoyed, puts down his newspaper, gets up, goes into the hallway and goes to the front door
Who's there
' It's me
56
Eva
' (a bit irritated) Yes
Georges, panicked, thinks for a few seconds
Just a minute
He goes toward the bedroom door, locks it and puts the key in his pocket
He goes into the dining room, also closes the door leading to the bedroom
He comes back
He is about to go toward the front door, but remains motionless an instant, opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby, flushes the toilet, closes the toilet door again and opens the front door
(') Hello
brief kiss hello
Hello
What was going on
was in the toilet
Sorry
He closes the front door behind Eva, indicates the direction of the living room
(') Come in
Eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look
He shakes his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back in the direction of the living room, as if to say: "You understand, huh
"
Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him into the living room
He closes the door
(') Why this unannounced visit
Where have you come from
What's going on with Mom
Nothing
What should be going on
57
Well
(gesture toward the ) Don't you want to sit down first
Eva wants to answer, but finally gives in and sits down
Georges does the same
(') So why are you in Paris
What's going on with Mom
Why don't you answer the phone
After our last conversation,  left four messages on your answering machine
Why don't you call back
Sorry
didn't listen to it
Forgive me
Don't you realize we're worried
Your worries are no use to me
Eva glares at him
(') No, don't get me wrong
'm not criticizing you
just don't have the time to deal with your worries, that's all
Dad
No
Let's stop this conversation right there
'm taking care of your mother
It's a full-time job
And 'm not saying that to complain, just to explain why didn't answer your phone calls and why  don't want to have any pointless discussions on the subject
Your mother is just as could have been expected: bad the whole time
() 58
(') She is turning more and more into a helpless child, and it's sad and humiliating, for her and for me
And she doesn't want to be seen in that state either
Even the last time you visited, she didn't want you to come
You two have your own life
Nothing wrong with that
But let us have our life too
Even though it's a lousy one
Dad, what's the matter
Nothing's the matter; your visit caught me by surprise
And 'm annoyed that you show up here to check that everything's
Who do you think you are
Eva is speechless
Then she gets up and makes to go to the door
Stay here, will you
She stops short, looks at him
(') (softly, but insistently) Please
She hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room
(
) Mom
Mom
Georges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back
She seems upset by the situation, as one would expect
(') Tell me, what's going on
Have you gone crazy
Please, sit down
59
don't want to sit down
What's going on here
() Nothing's going on
want to spare us all a pointless drama
presume your mother is asleep
She mostly sleeps the whole day
And then she wakes up at night
If you really want to, we'll go and see her in a little while
Now, sit down
They look at each other
Reluctantly, Eva heads toward her armchair and sits down
Then Georges goes on in a quiet voice: (') We do our speech exercises every day, or we sing together
Most of the time,  wake up around 5
At that time, she's still awake
Then we change her incontinence pad rub cream on her to avoid sores
Then, around 7,  try to persuade her to eat and drink
Sometimes it works, sometimes not
Sometimes she tells me things from her childhood, then for hours she calls for help, and then an instant later she's giggling away to herself, or crying
Nothing of any of that is worth showing to anyone
Eva looks down
Finally, she says: () You can't stop me from seeing her
( ) No
They remain seated for a moment, finally Eva gets up
Georges follows her into the hallway
He unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom
The bright light from outside filters through the blinds
60
Eva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne
Finally, she caresses her face, shyly and clumsily
Anne opens her eyes
Looks at her
No movement

Georges has remained by the door
After a while, they both leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the living room
Georges closes the door
For an instant he puts a consoling hand on Eva's shoulder
Then he sits down
Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and looks outside
Suddenly she starts sobbing
After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room
Eva, vexed, blows her nose
Shortly after, Georges comes back
He has another teacup in his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down
The tea isn't very hot any more
Eva turns toward him
(') But it does make you feel better
After a short , Eva comes toward the table
Sits down
He fills her cup
Thanks
She takes the cup, drinks
Replaces it
Still can't bring herself to look at him
61
It was silly of me to lock the door
'm sorry
You took me by surprise, that's all
'm sorry
She nods her head, indicating she understands
Finally she looks at him: What's going to happen now
(with a little ironic laugh) What's going to happen now
The nurse comes twice a week, and every two weeks Dr
Bertier and the hairdresser come
That's what you want to know, right
Things will go on as they have done up until now
They'll go from bad to worse
Things will go on, and then one day it will all be over
Brief
You can't go on like this, Dad
Can't
What do you suggest
Can't we have a serious talk, you and me
What do you call "a serious talk"
What do you want to suggest
Do you want to have Mom live with you
Do you want to pack her off to a care home
Do you
What do you want
Go on, talk to me "seriously"
Eva looks at him

Suddenly we hear, coming from the bedroom, ' (loud) Help

Georges wipes his face and, to the sound of Anne's cries, crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom
Anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself
Georges goes over to her bed
(trying to calm her like a sick child) What is it
() 63
(') Are you in pain
What's the matter
Is your pad full
He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then replaces it
(') No
So what's hurting you
He sits down beside her on the bed
Takes her hand
(') It's all right
it's all right
'm here
everything's fine
we'll
Hold on, 'll tell you a story
but you must be quiet, can't talk too loud, it wears me out
Here we go: when  was little
well,  wasn't as little as all that
it was toward the end of primary school, so  was about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a holiday camp
They thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age
We were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape think it was in the Auvergne don't know
in any case it was the opposite of what 'd expected
We had to get up at 6 and go for a morning swim
Not far from the castle, there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream
We entered it running, in a double file
You know,  was never very sporty
They had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud
But the worst thing was the food
The third day after our arrival, there was rice pudding for lunch
hate rice pudding
We sat at long tables in a huge hall
didn't want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me: You won't get up until you've cleared your plate
So after the meal everybody left the room, and remained seated, in tears
had made a secret pact with Mom
was to send her a postcard every week
() 64
(') If  was pleased with the place was to draw some flowers on it, or if not, some stars
She kept the card; it was covered all over in stars
After three hours,  was allowed to leave the table
went up to my room, got into bed and had a fever of 42 degrees
It was diphtheria
They took me to the nearest hospital where  was put in an isolation ward, which meant that Mom, when she came to visit me, could only wave at me through a window
At some point  lost that postcard
It's a pity
Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story
He still holds her hand
Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his pillow and presses it over her face
from Anne
Everything that can still move in her body starts to move
Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's movements stop
Then he sits up, exhausted, and without removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her

-  - Hallway
The front door of the apartment is unlocked
Georges, in city clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut flowers
He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it in the closet
The
Georges takes the bags and carries them in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water
He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water
We watch him doing so for a while
Meanwhile, the 56 -
- Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall closet
He is looking for a specific dress
He takes some out, puts them back inside
One of the dresses slips off its hanger and falls to the floor
He picks it up, hangs it up again
He ends up finding the one he was looking for
He takes it out on its hanger
Closes the closet again
65
Looks at the dress
Then he lowers his arm a little and is about to leave the bedroom
He catches his feet in the dress
He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the wheelchair that is parked there
Exhausted, he flops down into it
57 -
- With wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of the bedroom
58 -
-   -  - Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter
for reflection
, scarcely audible
Suddenly, Georges starts
At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking
Georges stares at it
For a long time
Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room
On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed
He takes the wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen, carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm
Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it over the pigeon
But it manages to escape into the hallway
Georges follows it
This action is repeated several times
The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up, flutters about in all directions
Georges closes the light- well window to cut off its escape route
This lasts an exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it
He cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby
59 -
-  - From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen table, writing
Finally we see what he is writing: you won't believe it
pigeon came in, for the second time already, through the light well
This time  caught it
In fact it wasn't difficult at all
But  set it free again
'm going to

Georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at the ceiling
, we faintly hear the  of running water, and from time to time the
After a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen
He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually: 'm almost done
Georges continues to look at her unwaveringly
' You can put your shoes on if you want
Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her, goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet and puts on his shoes
we hear Anne finishing her work
She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears for a few moments into the bathroom
Meanwhile, Georges has got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is tidying her hair and sprucing herself up
When she comes out again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it on
Thanks
They head for the front door
(') Aren't you taking a coat
Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from the hook and they leave the apartment
61 -
-  -   - - Four long shots: all the windows are open
The sun is shining
It is fairly bright
Hallway
Then the
Eva comes into the apartment
Remains a long time beside the door
Looks around her, ill at ease
Finally she hesitantly goes into the bedroom
67
Anne's twin bed isn't there any more
On Georges' bed lies only the bare mattress
Eva remains there a moment, then goes through the partition door into the dining room
There, everything is as usual
Eva continues into the living room
There too, everything is as usual
Eva stops by the piano stool
Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss
Then she heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner
On the table lie the remains of a snack
Eva looks at the table, turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the armchairs
Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room
