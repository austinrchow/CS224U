-                                1 We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue
As the melody continues to play we  towards a building and into a window

'  -                               2 fifty-year old female therapist (
) sits at her desk, frowning as she takes notes
Books of Jung and Freud line the shelves
young man ( ) sits in a chair in front of her looking impatient
The therapist continues to write notes
Jesus
We've been at this for six months
know
And you haven't made an ounce of progress
know
Sebastian takes out a cigarette
(not looking up) There's no smoking in my office
Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away
Dr
Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking her head
What do you want me to say
That 'm supposed to feel remorse because  act the way  do
The truth is  don't
Dr
Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes
(cont'd) Look, 'm not like all the other kids in high school
don't care about book reports and extra-credit
Teachers are idiots anyway
The only challenge out there for me is women
You see a girl you like
You pursue them
You conquer
You move on
It's exciting
But you said you have the worst reputation
do
Don't you want to change that
Let me tell you something, doctor
Chicks love a guy with a bad rap
They say they don't, but they don't mean it
They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me
" The trick is to let them think it's true
think that's all the time we have for today
Same time next week
No
This is going to be our last session
Why
like spending time with you
You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age
You have killer legs
Killer
This isn't a joke
Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here
'm trying to help you
Don't be insecure, Doc
You're a big help
Sebastian picks up a book of Freud
(cont'd) He was a coke addict, you know
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me
It doesn't work, Sebastian
It works a little
No it doesn't
see right through you
You do
hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase
It's going to get you into trouble
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it
Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up
My daughter, Rachel
Yummy
Don't even think about it
Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall
She's way too smart to fall for your line of b
s
Really
Care to make a wager on that
Good luck, Sebastian
What, nervous 'm going to win
Would you please leave
Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves
(cont'd) Asshole
The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of Benson & Hedges and lights one up
She looks at the photo of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials
(cont'd) Rachel, it's mom

'  -                                 3 , Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk, crying while holding the phone
Hi, mom
Honey, is something wrong
Rachel cries for a moment
He told me he loved me and  believed him
Who told you
You don't know him
'm so stupid
She continues to cry
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom
There's pictures of me on the internet
: -  nudie web-sight
The title reads "Ivy League Bound
" Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her privates
What kind of pictures
Nudie pictures, what do you think
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid
don't know
He was just so charming
All he did was talk about how  had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them
Things just got out of hand from there
(she hears the phone drop) Mom
Are you there
Mom
(screaming) Mother

'   -  -            4 Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots Sebastian standing in the elevator
You son of a bitch
Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several people out of her way
Sebastian stares at her expressionless as the elevator doors close
(cont'd) You're gonna pay for this you little shit
You hear me
peers outside of his office to see what's going on
He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum
(cont'd) Fuck off, Harold
He gasps

Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the steps to the townhouse
You can't park there
Sebastian turns to her and sneers
He takes out a wad of money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering the townhouse

can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall
You've always been an inspiration to Beau and  on raising her
We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her
'll do my best
Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn
(cont'd) (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese) Thank you, Sook-Hee
That will be all
Sook-Hee leaves
What was that
was thanking her
Vietnamese is such a beautiful language
(cont'd) Kathryn is a straight  student at Oakwood as well as being President of the French Club
Listen to whatever she has to say and you'll go far
(in French) You're too kind
How do you do it
mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school
Where do you get your strength
know this sounds corny, but whenever feel temptations of peer pressure, (takes out her crucifix) turn to God and he helps me through the problem
Call me an anachronism, but it works
That's beautiful
What are the boys like
Cecile, is that the best you can do
(to Kathryn) You must forgive her, Kathryn
She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before
Don't worry, it's totally understandable
Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples
Like your step-brother Sebastian
can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse
(
) hear she's recovering quite well
Mrs
Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the doorway
He walks over and takes a seat
(cont'd) Nice to see you again, Mrs
Caldwell
You remember my daughter, Cecile
My, what an adorable shirt you're wearing
My father just took me on a trip to Australia
How are things down under
Blossoming  hope
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall
Outstanding
What year are you in
'm what you would call a fifth year senior
But  thought high school is only four years
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself
He winks at Cecile
think we'll be going now
(to Kathryn) Thanks for all your help
Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile
'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum
Thanks
(to Sebastian) Nice meeting you
Ciao
Let's go, Cecile
Now
Cecile follows Mrs
Caldwell out the door
Kathryn closes the door behind them
Do you care to tell me what Mrs
White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house
'm just taking the poor girl under my wing
Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian
She unscrews her crucifix
The top part becomes a small spoon and the bottom part a small vial of coke
(cont'd) The parental units called while you were out
Lovely
How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali
Zipping through my inheritance per usual
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid
Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a bump
(cont'd) What's wrong with you today
Therapy not going well
It was fine
He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace
(cont'd) 'm sick of sleeping with these insipid Manhattan Debutantes
He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs
(cont'd) Nothing shocks them anymore
He scratches the nude's pubic area
(cont'd) 'm beginning to feel like 'm losing my touch
He kisses it
Oh, poor baby
Well you can relax
have a mission for you

(
) You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret Reynolds
Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him
She is wearing the same sweater
He kisses her forehead and messes up her hair
(
) You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth Of July Weekend
10
-   -                  10 Kathryn throws a sushi at him
Sebastian catches it
He didn't dump me
We had a parting of the ways
Sebastian stares her down
(cont'd) Alright he dumped me
He smiles, then swallows the sushi

'   -        11 drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final swig from his flask
He quickly passes out
(
) went to great lengths to please Court
Huge sacrifices were made on my part to keep him happy
Kathryn rises up  , looks at Court and scowls
(
) Swallow
She spits on him, then wipes her mouth
(
) What do you think
Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca
(
) Sorry
12
-   -                  12 In any event, my feelings were hurt when learned that he had fallen for someone else
Someone chaste
pure
innocent
You don't mean

(
) None other than Cecile Caldwell
She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone
She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet 14
-   -                  14 Sebastian snickers
don't find this very funny, So that's what this is all about
(imitating Kathryn) We'll get together and plan your curriculum
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
When  get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered
Why go through Cecile
Why not just attack Court
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me
can't allow that to happen
Everybody loves me and  intend to keep it that way
see your point
though why should care
need you to seduce our young Cecile
Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery
Sounds intriguing
She's quite cute you know
Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie
Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself
He licks his lips
(cont'd) Be her Captain Picard, Valmont
Boldly go where no man has gone before
Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues to rub herself
He thinks for a moment, then: can't
Kathryn throws his hand off of hers
Why not
Oh come on, Kathryn
It's too easy
"But  thought high school was only four years
"  mean, please
She knows nothing
She's seen nothing
could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived
Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it
have a reputation to uphold
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge
That was just simple revenge
What have planned requires sheer genius
He takes a magazine and throws it on the table
Kathryn picks it up
It's the latest issue of "Seventeen
" 'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas
Shut up and turn to page 64
She turns to the page

"Why  Plan To Wait Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison
Age 17
Kansas City, Missouri
Jesus Christ, is she for real
Oh yes
've read it over and over again
This baby's the real deal
Daddy's little angel
paradigm of chastity and virtue
What do you plan to do
Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore
Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood
She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house
Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation
Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts
It will be my greatest victory
You don't stand a chance
Even this is out of your league
Care to make a wager on that
'll think about it
Oh well, duty calls
Time to add another chapter to my work of art
He holds up a leather bound
Oh gee, your journal
Could you be more queer
Could you be more desperate to read it
Sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door
Oh Sebastian
About that little wager of yours
He stops
(cont'd) Count me in
What are the terms
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine
And if  win
She approaches him
'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married
Be more specific
In English
(whispers in his ear) 'll fuck your brains out
What makes you think 'd go for that bet
That's a seventy thousand dollar car
Because 'm the only person you can't control and it kills you
Sebastian sneers at her
(cont'd) Do we have a deal
No way, that car means everything to me
She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips
(whispering) You can put it anywhere
Even there
(baby talk) It would feel so yummy
Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand
(cont'd) Happy hunting

The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl
The one and only
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs
Rosemond
Thank you, Annette
Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years
Does your family do much riding
My mother and  used to ride a lot, before she got sick
'm sorry about that
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so  would come over and ride all the time
'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west
What's his name
Ben Schwarz
Schwarz
Jewish
German
Doesn't ring a bell
Annette throws her a concerned look
(cont'd) In any event,  want you to consider this your home for the time being
Thank you
It's so peaceful and quiet around here
shotgun sounds in the distance
(cont'd) What was that
Sebastian must be here
Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette

Sebastian searches for the cat

He raises his rifle and takes aim
(
) Sebastian
He lowers his rifle and turns to  Aunt Helen and Annette riding over to him
He waves
Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug
(cont'd) 've been looking all over for you
God, 've missed you
've missed you too
How are your parents
They're coming back next week
write them everyday
She strokes his cheek, lovingly
Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison
She's going to be staying with me for a few weeks
guess that makes two of us
Welcome
He extends his hand and they shake
(cont'd) (to Aunt Helen) Why don't you head in and whip us up some of that ice tea of yours
We'll take care of the horses
Anything for you, my dear
Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse
(cont'd) Stay out of trouble you two
& We will
He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow

So what year are you going into
Junior
Got a boyfriend back home
No
Why not
don't know
Relationships seem too distracting
'd rather concentrate on my studies
You a lesbo
(annoyed) No
She bends over to pick up the saddle
Nice
She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter
was just being honest
You happen to have a nice ass
Sorry
She shakes her head and continues with her chore
read your teen beat manifesto
You did
must say  found it rather appalling
That's a first
Most people praised me for it
Most people are morons
mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced
wasn't knocking anything
It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions
Oh really
Take yourself
You've slept with several women
Are you happier because of it
How do you know 've been with several women
friend wrote me
(pissed) Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip
'm sorry
didn't mean to upset you
but you still didn't answer the question
An uncomfortable silence falls between them, Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me
It's not really important
Fine, forget it
It's obvious that we're not going to be friends
Why are you being so dramatic
Look, 've got a lot of problems and 'm trying to deal with them and the last thing  need is people spreading shit about me
Alright,  said  was sorry
(beat) Can we start over again
think we've gotten off on the wrong foot
She approaches him and they shake
(cont'd) Annette Harrison
Sebastian Valmont
She smiles, but before he releases her hand: (cont'd) So tell me, Annette
'm curious, since you've never had sex do you touch yourself
She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable
(cont'd) What did  say
19
-  -                       19 :  hand stroking the bridge of a cello
(
) That's good, that's good
Cecile sits in front Of a cello
Next to her sits , a well-mannered fifteen year old African American
Holding his own cello, he is giving her a music lesson
(cont'd) Now let's try the  minor scale
Cecile attempts the  minor scale, fucking up badly
Kathryn enters and shudders in silence
(cont'd) Once more, and remember the third note is flat
Cecile tries again and once again screws up
Oh,  suck
suck
Relax
It's okay
Take a deep breath
Cecile takes a deep breath (cont'd) You're concentrating too much on your bowing
Let it flow
He stands and sits behind her
(cont'd) Here, let me help you
He places his hand over hers
(cont'd) Now close your eyes and let's try again
She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale
It sounds much better
Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's face
It's obvious he's smitten with her
: who watches from the door
grin crosses her face
Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing
He closes his eyes as the music takes over him
Now Cecile opens her eyes and gazes into his
The feeling is mutual
: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground
Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray 'm sorry
didn't mean to interrupt
Your playing was beautiful
Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford
He's giving me music lessons over the summer
Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand
Pleased to meet you
Likewise 'm sure
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard
He's composing his first opera
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King
Doctor King is my favorite
Ronald shakes his head, but laughs
Cecile looks at him and smiles
Kathryn rolls her eyes
guess our hour's up
Same time tomorrow
Cecile nods

Sebastian paces behind him
Unbelievable
Some fag, no offense - - none taken - - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me
Any ideas who it could be
Blaine, if  knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now
Where did you say she's from
Kansas
Who the hell do  know in Kansas
Greg McConnell
The football stud
He's from Kansas City
wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat
It would make sense
McConnell hates me
fingered his girlfriend at the game last year
don't think that bothered him
What do you mean
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field
Are you shitting me
shit you not
McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month
We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out
You know - (imitating Greg) "What are you doing, man
'm not a fag
'll kick your ass if you say anything
" (beat) It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it
The only reason why let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer
Not anymore
Football team started practice last week
He's already called me to hook up
Really
You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf
Hmmm
do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight
Outstanding
Don't think it's not going to cost you
No problem
Just make sure your front door is unlocked
Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended
Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills

lavish picnic lies around them
Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and a hat to protect her from the sunlight
She sits behind Cecile and braids her hair
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds
hear he's very nice
He's alright
(giggles) He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July
Really
Bulimic headcase
What a loser she must be
(beat) Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend
That's great
You think so
don't know
guess 'm just scared
What are you scared of
Ah duh
Boys
've never even gone to first base with a guy
What do  do
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends
Eww
No
That's gross
It's not gross
How else do you think girls learn
Here turn around and face me
Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses
(cont'd) Now close your eyes and wet your lips
Are you for real
Do you want to learn or not
guess
It still sounds gross
Cecile does as instructed
Kathryn leans in and kisses her on the mouth
See that wasn't so bad
It was nothing
Let's try it again, only this time 'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth
When  do that  want you to massage my tongue with yours
That's what first base is
(reluctant) Okay
Eyes closed
Cecile closes her eyes
Kathryn leans in and kisses her again, only this time longer
She continues to kiss her then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's
Cecile does as instructed and they start to make out
Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands are now clutching the grass
Kathryn smiles and continues her seduction
She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under her dress
Cecile lets out a soft sigh
Kathryn breaks from the kiss
They look at each other and smile
(cont'd) Not bad
That was cool
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime
What are you saying
Oh come on Cecile
He's crazy about you
Is it that obvious
Kathryn nods
(cont'd) He sends me letters you know
Love letters
That's so romantic
Have you responded
No
Well do you like him
don't know
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park
You can trust me
(beat) do like him
can't stop thinking about him
Cecile starts to cry
Kathryn hugs her
(cont'd) What am  going to do
If my mother found out about Ronald she would kill me
Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye
Listen to me
Your mother must never know
Never
Okay
Did you hide the letters
Yes
They're in this antique doll house in my room
want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me
Why
Cecile if there's one thing 'm great at it's love letters
With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand
Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house
You'd do that for me
Of course  would
We're friends, right
Best friends
Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn

(calling out) Excuse me
Excuse me
You talking to me
Look,  know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down
'm trying to read
What'cha reading
The Fountainhead
Great book
(skeptical) You've read The Fountainhead
Several times
'm not as dumb as  act, you know
When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon
most romantic scene in all of literature
Romantic
He rapes her
That's a matter of opinion
You need help
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it
At this hour
don't think so
Oh come on
Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse
Please

What
Another letter from your friend
This is my favorite part
(reading the letter) Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating
He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention
Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so  might have the opportunity to confront them face to face
How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her
sincerely doubt it
Give me the fucking letter
Annette smiles and tears the letter up
(cont'd) Why did you do that
The last thing  need is you going into my room searching for this while 'm away
(mocking) Is that the last thing you need
My your clever
She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe
She then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece bathing suit underneath
How's the water
Refreshing
She dives in the pool and surfaces
(cont'd) You're right you know
About what
About what you said today in the stable
'm not a happy person
never said that
You implied it
Look,  didn't mean to give you a hard time
No, it's okay
mean  look at you with all your morals and values and well,  seem to be happy in your choices
envy you
No bullshit
(caught off guard) Thank you
Seriously, you're amazing
You have everything going for you
(counts with his fingers) You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined
You're everything  want in a girlfriend
(jokingly) Shut up
wasn't kidding
'd like to take you out
Look, 'm flattered but, seriously it could never work
Why not
Because you act like a pig
He swims towards her
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us
don't
don't want to answer that
look we're friends
You don't find me cute
Come on, look at these muscles
He flexes for her
She laughs
'm sorry, but you're not my type
Fine
Friends it is
can live with that
He extends his arms out for a hug
She moves in and hugs him
Her smile turns to a look of horror
You're naked
It's my house
She pushes him off her
That's repulsive
What's the big deal
We're friends
Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before
Annette climbs out of the pool
Get some manners
She walks into the house
Sorry,  didn't know you were peenaphobic
She flips him the bird as she heads into the house
(cont'd) Oooooo, naughty naughty
Ten Hail Mary's for you
(beat) Good night

(near orgasm) Oh God
Oh God, 'm gonna cum
'm gonna cum
'm gonna
The door swings open and Sebastian enters
Hey Blaine, did  leave my
holy shit
Jesus
Greg throws the covers over his face
Sebastian smiles and sits
He lights a cigarette
No movement from under the covers
Greg, is that you under the covers
(from under the covers) Get out of here
Sebastian stands  the covers off the bed, revealing Greg and Blaine
Whoa
told you to lock the door
thought  did
Look Valmont
This was the first time 've ever done something like this was -- (apathetic) -- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah
Please don't tell anyone
This could ruin my career
Your career
What about your family
Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer
Hey hey hey
Careful Valmont, he's not a fudge packer
Cum chugger yes but not a fudge packer
(to Sebastian) Please
'm begging you
'll do anything
Let's just forget the whole thing
Hmmmmmmm
nah
can't help you there
It's too good to pass up
Greg starts to cry
(cont'd) After all, it is you who's bad- mouthing me to Annette Harrison
Annette Harrison
don't know what you're talking about
Come on Greg
You're the only one who knows her
The truth will save you
(sobbing) swear on my life,  never said a word to her about you
think he's telling the truth Valmont
Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter
Alright,  believe you
Stop crying
Your secret's safe with me
Greg wipes his eyes
(cont'd) However, this whole incident's kind of turned me on
Sebastian unzips his fly
(cont'd) You get my point
Greg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to Sebastian
Blaine shakes his head and smiles
Greg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when - (cont'd) Jesus Christ,  was only kidding
What do you think, 'm gay
My God, haven't you had enough for tonight
Our boy just can't get enough dick
You sick son of a bitch
Blaine and Sebastian laugh
'll leave you guys alone
(macho voice) Score one for the team, Greg
Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters
(cont'd) Come to think of it, there is something you can do for me

-  -                                    30 Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run - a golf cart drives off a meadow and lands on the road
Sebastian is driving
Annette looks back and scowls
Sebastian catches up to her
Need a lift
No thank you
How are you today
Give it up
Oh right, last night
guess  owe you an apology
'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me
said  was sorry
She continues her jog
Sebastian follows alongside
(cont'd) Have a nice sleep last night
It was fine
wish  could say the same for myself
was up thinking about you all night
thought we agreed that we were going to be friends
Yes, well unfortunately  can't just switch the "on" button to "off
" The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me
Annette stops running and turns to him
And that's a bad thing
'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away
'm sorry, but 'm not here to be your savior
Well try this one on for size
think 'm falling in love with you
You don't even know me
Don't you believe in love at first sight
Yes, but only when it's mutual
And this is far from mutual
Ouch
Do you think we could spend some time together this morning
can't
'm seeing a friend
Who
That's none of your business
How about tonight
'm busy
Doing what
That's also none of your business
Tell me what to do, Annette
How can win your heart
'll do anything can't get you out of my mind
You truly want to do something to make me happy
Yes
And you promise to abide by it
Without question
Alright
(beat) want you to leave and go back to New York
What
If that's a problem, then 'll make arrangements to stay with some friends
Sebastian thinks for a moment
He's pissed
'll leave this afternoon
Happy
It's not about being happy
You and can't - He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away

-                                            31 Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the ocean
He told you he's failing in love with you
've never known him to say those words before
Really
thought he said it all the time
That's not his style
one thing  can say about Valmont
He always speaks the truth
Annette looks lost
(cont'd) What's wrong
Nothing
Is there a mutual feeling between you two
No
mean
don't know
(beat) What else do you know about him
Not a whole lot
We take some classes together
He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit
What do you mean
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded
(sighs) don't know
've been hearing some awful things about him
From who
can't tell you
'm sworn to secrecy
Greg takes her hand
Annette, how long have we known each other
Forever
Now it's my job to look out for you
You're like a kid sister to me
Do look like some kind of gossip queen
Annette laughs
You promise not to say anything
On my mother's life
(beat) Okay

-                                            33 Greg talks on a pay phone, out of Annette's sight
Positive
Did you do everything  asked you to
Yes
You told her  never said  love you before
Yes
You told her that people are jealous cause 'm loaded
Yes
And you think she bought it
'm pretty sure she did
Pretty sure or sure sure
She bought it

- Ronald plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" at the piano while Cecile listens and sways to the music
:   - Enough with the music
Fuck her already
She throws a magazine at the television
Sebastian bursts into the living room
You would not believe what-- Shhh
- ( ) That was beautiful
( ) Almost as beautiful as you
Cecile blushes
Ronald checks his watch
( ) Well,  guess it's getting late
Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway
( ) 'll see you tomorrow
( ) Absolutely
He approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand
(
) Idiot
:   - Kathryn   the image
What's wrong with you
You ready for this
've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs
Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me
Interesting
now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag
Any luck corrupting her daughter
No
Call Cecile up and get her to come over
'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat
She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and Cecile on the television
The plot thickens
It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher
Ooo, 'm sure Mrs
Caldwell will love that
Not to mention Court Reynolds
Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder
What's your plan of attack
rat Cecile out to mommy
Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship
Boo hoo
But who will they turn to for help
Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap
Cecile is planning to go away with Court next week
'll need you to speed up her sexual awakenings
Sebastian rubs her shoulders
'm at your service
Thank you
Mmmm, that feels good
Oh sis
You're so tense
Sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra
He's met with no resistance
hate when things don't go my way
It makes me so horny
hate it too
He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her skirt
(cont'd) (baby talk) Oh baby, your soaking
know
She closes her eyes and rubs his crotch
She unzips his fly
(cont'd) (seductively) Any luck with your girl
Moving along quite well
Have you succeeded in your task
Any day now
Well, let me know when you do
Until then
She takes his hand out from under her pants
(cont'd) No pootie
Kathryn smiles
(cont'd) Sorry

No, not at all
Well,  was just calling to see how you're doing
'm
'm alright
How was your date
It wasn't a date
He's just a friend
There's a moment of uncomfortable silence
Well,  was just calling to tell you was thinking about you and  miss you
'll let you go
Wait, don't hang up
Okay
What are you doing
Reading
He crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad twins ( & ) are licking popsicles
What are you reading
Of Human Bondage
Somerset Maugham
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation
You're not gonna start that again
He takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the girls' butts
No
'm through with my childish games when it comes to you
Hold on, that's my other line
(to the girls) Rub
They rub the oil on each other then turn to him and smile
He clicks the phone back on
(cont'd) Annette that's my mom calling
Can call you tomorrow
Sure
Have a good night
will

The saleswoman holds up a beautiful dress
Here's something you might like
Kathryn examines the label
Do you carry any real fur
No
All our fur is faux
Of course
The animals
How silly of me
The saleswoman smiles, then walks away
Kathryn sneers then looks over at a small child, staring at her
(cont'd) (mouthing the words) Fuck off
She "shoos" the child away, when Mrs
Caldwell approaches
got your message and came as quick as  could
hope  didn't keep you from something
Not at all
What's wrong
It's Cecile
What about her
Well
you promise you won't say anything to her
We've developed a friendship and
Kathryn, you have my word
It isn't drugs is it
It's worse
think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher
Ronald
That's crazy
know
She's so young and he's so - Black
Kathryn reacts to her remark
He's been sending her love letters that she hides under her doll house questioned whether or not to tell you, but something like this could destroy her reputation at Oakwood and  don't want to see her get hurt
Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales counter
(cont'd) hope  did the right thing in telling you
'd hate to see Cecile ruin things with Court
can't thank you enough
You will be discreet about this
Absolutely
Will that be cash or charge
Kathryn looks through her purse
Oh poo
left my credit cards at home
Mrs
Caldwell takes out her purse
Let me get that for you
Oh please
can't have you do that
It's the least  can do
Mrs
Caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman
Kathryn turns to Mrs
Caldwell
Thank you

Caldwell bursts into the room
Who the hell do you think you are
Excuse me
'm paying you to give cello lessons
Not to pervert my child
Mrs
Caldwell  think you're misunderstanding something
Is that so
Mrs
Caldwell holds up Ronald's letters
(cont'd) You care to explain this then
Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry
Where did you find those
Margarita found them while cleaning your room
Those are my letters
Don't you raise your voice at me
Go to your room, now
Cecile turns to Ronald
(cont'd) Now
Ronald nods and Cecile runs out of the room
Mrs
Caldwell turns to Ronald
(cont'd) How dare you treat me with such disrespect
got you off the streets and this is how you repay me
Got me off the streets
live on 59th and Park
Whatever
You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and  mean never to see my daughter again
Is that understood
Ronald packs up his sheet music, while Mrs
Caldwell waits
First of all, maam,  never touched your daughter and second,  would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap
My husband and  gave money to Colin Powell
(sarcastic) guess that puts me in my place
Thank you for the hospitality Mrs
Caldwell
It was a true awakening
He storms off

The elevator stops and the doors open
Sebastian and Kathryn stand in the doorway, wearing shades
Kathryn hands Cecile's letter
43
- '  -          43 Ronald sits in a chair and reads Cecile's letter
Sebastian and Kathryn watch
Wow
never knew she had these kind of feelings
You're a lucky guy
(eyes tear up) She really loves me
Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes
(cont'd) What do  do
What do you do
Tell her you love her
But  can't even see her
She doesn't have her own phone,  don't even know her e-mail address
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles
Be romantic
Write her another letter
How will  get to her
& We'll make sure she gets it
Why are you being so good to me
Because we want to see Cecile happy and we know you make her happy
She hands Ronald a pen and paper
(cont'd) Now you just march yourself into the study and start writing
We'll be there to check on you in a minute
Ronald leaves the room
Sebastian closes the door while Kathryn picks up the phone and dials
Who are you calling
Cecile
Sebastian hangs up the phone
(cont'd) What are you doing
Before we go through with this,  just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause
'm aware
She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again
Are you really
mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this
mean, we're destroying an innocent girl
You do realize that
What is that
Oh my God, it's your conscience
She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful of something, throws it to the ground and  on it
(cont'd) Court Renolds is going down and if you're not going to help me, someone else will
You amaze me
Eat me, Sebastian
It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because 'm a girl it's wrong
Well let me tell you something,  didn't ask to be a girl
Do you think  relish the fact that have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so  can be considered a "laaaady
" Do you think  take great delight when  hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful
" "Kathryn is a model child
" "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day
" (beat) 'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes  want to kill myself for it
No,  don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer
So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud
Now are you in or are you out
Sebastian says nothing
Kathryn picks up the phone and dials
(cont'd) Hello, Cecile
It's Kathryn
Alright, stop crying
understand
Hold on for Sebastian
She hands the phone to Sebastian
Cecile
Now  need you to listen to me very carefully
have a letter from Ronald that he asked me to give to you
Now  can't exactly bring it to your house, since your mother despises me so here's what we're going to do
44     - '  -               44 The clock reads 1:30

She finishes the letter while Sebastian fiddles with a camera
Finished
She hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over
Excellent
You think he'll like it
He'll love it
He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo
What are you doing
Just taking your photo
look terrible
Mmmm, you're right
Those clothes don't do you justice
Why don't you take them off
Cecile gasps
'm getting out of here
She stands to leave
Sebastian blocks her path
'm sorry that was out of line
(scared) want to go home
was just kidding
(eyes watering) want to go home
He moves toward the phone Okay, okay
'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up
My mom
Don't call my mom
Why not
Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here
In fact, you're grounded
Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this
think  should call her anyway
Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms around his legs
Please please please
'll do anything
Just don't call my mom
Cecile, all  want to do is give you a kiss
And then  can go home
Of course
'm not a monster
Cecile breathes a sigh of relief
He pulls her up to her feet
Just a kiss, right
swear
She closes her eyes, then puckers up
Sebastian takes the string holding up her sweats and pulls it open
Cecile bolts up
What are you doing
You promised to let me kiss you
But - (pointing at her lips) don't want to kiss you here
want to kiss you there
Sebastian points to her crotch
She moves her hands to her sweats and looks up at him
Sebastian shrugs
Cecile pulls the string to her sweats
They fall to the floor

It was nice of you to invite us up for the weekend, Helen
More the merrier
(to Cecile) Is everything alright my dear
'm just not feeling well
Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket
Afternoon ladies
Cecile is stunned that he's there
Sebastian takes a seat at the table
didn't know you'd be here, Sebastian
wasn't planning on it, but being such a lovely day, why waste it in the city
Anyone for tennis
He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket
Cecile stands and rushes into the house
(cont'd) What's wrong with her
No one knows
(cont'd) Would you excuse me for a minute
Mrs
Caldwell follows her into the house
(concerned) hope she's alright
better go check on them
Aunt Helen stands and enters the house
Alone again

'm doing some volunteer work
Need any company
You
Volunteer
don't think so

Maybe 'd like it

sits in bed, while Sebastian does a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her
He smokes a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies next to her on the bed
Did  ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me - Yes, you already did
did
Sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper
Right after we played backgammon
We played backgammon
Uh huh
You beat me three times
did
Yep
Then  fucked your daughter
Excuse me
He turns to her and extinguishes his cigarette
said, do you want some water
Oh
no thank you
There's a knock at the door
Come in

How we doing in here

Can we do this again next week
Oh please
What
" actually feel good about myself
" do
You must take me for a real idiot
don't
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady
did
We played three games of backgammon and
She throws him a look
(cont'd) Alright
was bored out of my fucking mind
hate doing charity
That's okay
It doesn't make you a bad person
Yes it does
No, it doesn't
'm happy you're being honest with me
(sighs) can't win with you
It's not about winning
You know what your problem is
You take yourself way too seriously
do not
Lighten up
am lighten
Can we drop this
Fine
They drive on in silence
smile comes over Annette's face
She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a face
Sebastian looks over
What are you doing
Stop it, it's distracting
She holds the face
Sebastian starts to laugh
(cont'd) Cut it out
He continues to laugh
She stops making the face
Oh dear, are you actually laughing
No
No
She makes the face again
He laughs
Stop that
She laughs with him
There's hope for you, yet

Kathryn stands there with a worried look on her face
(cont'd) Are you okay
No
Kathryn enters and locks the door behind her
Cecile is crying
Calm down
Tell me what's wrong
Something awful happened last night
What do you mean
don't think you want to know
Cecile, you have to tell me
It involves your brother
He
took advantage of me
Does your mother know
If she knew, she'd kill me
It happened at your house last night
Why didn't you do something
don't know
So, let me get this straight
You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you
Well
not exactly
He made you give him a blow job
No
Well what then
Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear
(cont'd) He ate you out
If that's what you call it
Cecile,  think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did
What do  do then
Well did you like it
Well
don't know - it was weird
At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay
Then,  started getting really hot and then  started shaking and then like,  don't t know
it felt like an explosion, but a good one
Kathryn laughs
Cecile, you had an orgasm
did
'm so proud of you
You're becoming a woman
am
Kathryn nods
Cecile embraces her, happy
Now listen
Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop
Think of Sebastian as a tutor
Let him instruct you
don't love him
love Ronald
So
Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy
Practice makes perfect, Cecile
My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible
But that would make me a slut
(beat) Wouldn't it
Cecile, everybody does it
It's just that nobody talks about it
Cecile takes the information in
It's like a secret society
That's one way of looking at it
Cool

She puts the book down and wipes a tear from her eye
59
- '  -                        59 Sebastian peers out his window with a pair of binoculars
Kathryn enters his room
just had a nice chat with Cecile don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems
Yippy
Who are you spying on
Take a look for yourself
He hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the window
That her
Yeah
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley
(sarcastic) Oh, she's crying
Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book
Sebastian grabs the binoculars from her
Shut up
What's your problem
Nothing
She's really getting to you, isn't she
If you must know, yes
don't know what to do
can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, 'm completely infatuated with her
(beat) She made me laugh
And that's why you're losing your bet
'm not losing the bet
It's just taking longer than  expected
Do you mind if  take my new Porsche for a ride
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me
Now if you'll excuse me,  have some work to do
He storms out of the room

-  -                                  60 Sebastian walks over to Annette, who continues to read her book
She notices him and sets the book down
Am  bothering you
Not at all
Have a seat
He sits down next to her
Don't tell me you finished The Fountainhead already
She nods
He points to her book
(cont'd) Great book
What's the guy's name, Florentino
Florentino Ariza
Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles around
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino
Who's Monsieur Philipe
You don't know Monsieur Philipe
Sebastian takes out a
(cont'd) (low voice) Bonjour mademoiselle
(laughs) Bonjour Monsieur Philipe
(Monsieur Philipe voice) You are very pretty
would like to kiss you
The puppet kisses her on the cheek
(cont'd) (Monsieur Philipe voice) Oooo, that felt good
Thank you
He kisses her on the cheek
(Monsieur Philipe voice) That felt good too
will kiss you all over
The puppet attacks a laughing Annette
She playfully grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him
Sebastian tickles her back
They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on top of her
moment of tense silence passes and Sebastian kisses her
The kissing intensifies until she pushes him off her
Sebastian stands
(cont'd) 'm sorry about that
am too
He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger
You know what
don't take it back
Why are you doing this
Because 'm in love with you
thought you said we were going to be friends
can't handle it
can't keep my feelings bottled up like you
Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me
Tell me
have feelings for you
Then what's wrong
love you Annette
It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus
That's not fair
Why can't we be together
Annette's eyes well up with tears
You really want to know
Yes
It's because  don't trust myself with you
(beat) took a vow and because of you 'm tempted to break it
Don't destroy that for me
Please
She hurries off
61

(frustrated) Shit
He hears the shower running from the bathroom
62
- '  -                    62 Sebastian enters the room
Cecile sticks her head out from the shower curtain
Want to join me
(indifferent) Some other time, Cecile
He leaves the room
Cecile looks confused
moment passes and Sebastian re-enters taking off his clothes
(cont'd) What am , an idiot
Cecile smiles
63
- '  -                      63 Sebastian and Cecile lie in bed
Sebastian smokes a cigarette and writes in his journal
Am  suppose to be this sore
For the first time, yes
It'll pass
moment of silence
like it better when 'm on top
Cecile
This is what  like to call quiet time
This is time when we reflect on what we've done
'm sorry
She looks at the troubled expression on Sebastian's face
(cont'd) Something's bothering you
You think
Is it me
No, you were fine
'
- He looks out on the balcony, where Kathryn is eavesdropping
They make eye contact and she waves
It's that girl, Annette
He stands and walks over to the balcony, where he closes the blinds
(cont'd) You love her, don't you
It's okay
don't love you either
love Ronald
'm getting out of here
Sebastian heads to the bathroom
Where are you going
(
) 'm taking a shower
Need any company
(
) No
Want a blow job
(
) Good night Cecile
(under her breath) Prude
64

There's a knock on the door
Come in
Sebastian enters the room
just came to say goodbye
Where are you going
Back to the city
may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer just can't handle it around here
think that's for the best
Good for you
Sebastian, please
don't want us to end on bad terms
Well, 'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter
You make me sick
You're a hypocrite and  don't associate with hypocrites
Annette's eyes well up with tears
How am  a hypocrite
Oh please Annette
You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love
Well here it is
Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it
'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married
If we were, 'd propose, but that's not going to happen
So  guess we're just fucked
'll move on, but you
you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love
And that makes you a hypocrite
Sebastian heads to the door
(cont'd) Have a nice life
Annette races toward him and throws her arms around him
(sobbing) Please don't go
Get off me
She kisses him passionately
want you
Sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed
She lies down and starts to unbutton her dress
Sebastian stands over her watches her
Her crying does not let up as she continues to undress
Sebastian stands, stunned and watches her
'm sorry,  can't
pained look crosses her face
Sebastian leaves the room and closes the door
65
- '  -                      65 Sebastian closes the door and leans against it
Shit
He wipes his eyes, which are starting to water
He goes over to a mirror at looks at himself

stern look comes over his face
He smiles, then walks away

67

His journal lies beside him
tickles his nose
He stirs awake and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him
Morning
(sarcastic) Morning
So
How'd it go last night
With who
Well  know how it went with Cecile
She won't shut up about it
How'd it go with Mrs
Jesus
Sebastian sits up in bed
If your asking if  nailed her the answer is no
She shot you down
Exactly the opposite
So what went wrong
don't know
She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but --  don't, was
just didn't feel right about it
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't
God are you a chump
momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified
He climbs out of bed and puts on his robe
He starts out the door, when - If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her
Where is she
You don't know
(big smile) She left thirty minutes ago
Where'd she go
She wouldn't say
She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends
(beat) You blew it, Sebastian
That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again
Sebastian throws off the robe and starts to dress
We'll see about that

Bad time
Kind of
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in

Oh yes
Tell me all the details
It was
Fantastic
Oh come on
For her first time

That's the amazing part of it

No, tell me
It was
it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part
Wow
So you made love
Ooo,  hear the birds chirping
Mock, mock, mock
She places her hand on his crotch
So  assume you've come here to make some arrangements
Sebastian stands
Some other time
Excuse me

-whipped, p-whipped
What's wrong with you
Why are you acting this way
Kathryn starts to cry
'm sorry
It's just upsetting
You're in love with her
You don't love me anymore
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger
Kathryn, you know  love you
've always loved you
Not anymore you don't
It's obvious
can't believe you're reacting this way
You're just saying this because you lost the bet
Is that what you think
He nods
Kathryn sits down on his bed
She slips her underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it aside, spreading her legs
(cont'd) Alright, come on, let's get it over with
But mark my words, this is the only time it'll happen
She picks up the phone
(cont'd) Whenever you're ready
Just stick it in me
While you're doing that 'm gonna make some phone calls
That's not fair
You're taking all the fun out of it
Then do me a favor and get rid of her
If not for me, then do it for you
Look at yourself
You're a joke
She's turned you into jelly
What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling
People used to respect you
They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away

" Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her
She flipped and he went on the defensive

Devastated beyond repair

Ronald
Not that it's any of your business but yes
Sebastian holds up a letter
From Ronald
Kathryn takes the letter
(cont'd) haven't had a chance to read it, but 'm sure it goes something like "yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me
Yahdah yahdah yahdah  hope we can be friends
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
" You see,  expected your sort of bullshit so  took the liberty of phoning Ronald and Cecile
Right now they're having a little get together in my love shack at the Grand Central Hyatt

Well done
Thank you
Now, where were we

He fills them and hands one to Kathryn

To my triumph, of course
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call
To your triumph over Annette
Kathryn giggles
(cont'd) What's so funny
Silly rabbit
My triumph isn't over her
It's over you
Come again
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her
But it amused me to make you ashamed of it
You gave up on the first person you ever loved because  called you names
Don't get me wrong, 'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand,  never loved you, Sebastian
You're just a toy
little toy  play with
And now you've completely blown it with her
think that's the saddest thing 've ever heard

Sebastian doesn't drink
He looks ill
In any event, you still owe me my reward
'm sorry, but unfortunately  don't fuck losers

(cont'd) You motherfucker
She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches
They fall to the ground
(cont'd) Nobody hits me
Calm down
He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground
Get off me
Will you calm down
Fine
Get off me

They both catch their breaths
'm very sorry about that
apologize

Now get out
Get out

Didn't you hear what  said

You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy

-   -                101 Ronald sits and listens as a grieving Kathryn tells her story
And when  confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business
Then when  said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid
the n word and that you deserved what you got
And this happened before you and hooked up
It's been going on for a while
(beat) Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me
Racist piece of shit
'd be careful if  were you
God knows what he's up to
He doesn't scare me
'll kick his ass in
Will you stay here for the night
You can leave in the morning
That's when my parents get back and -- Don't worry about it
'll stay
Kathryn hugs him
Thanks Ronald
You're a good friend

Call me an anachronism, but - Oh cut the shit, Kathryn
Excuse me

My brother is dead, have some respect
Kathryn,  know all about you and Sebastian
Sebastian was a pathological liar wouldn't believe a word he - have his journal
You what
His journal

Everything about you is in it
The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you
eww
Let's see, then there's your coke problem
You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you
It's all in there
You didn't show it to anybody

Do you think you could give me ride
You can't do this to me
It could ruin me

You're going to befriend the unpopular, sleep with the insecure
Think of the social ramifications it will cause
You and  are going to turn this school around
And do you know why you're going to do it
