by Marc Norman & Tom Stoppard Over which a title "-- 1593" appears
Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and audiences
North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage
Across the river was the competition, built by Philip Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem
The Rose
Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three- tiered, open to the elements and empty
On the floor, roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date
It says: 7TH & 8TH ' , ' the screams of a man under torture
The screams are coming from the curtained stage
(
) You Mongrel
Why do you howl When it is  who am bitten
The theatre owner,  , is the man screaming
' boots are on fire
He is pinioned in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of a fire burning in a brazier
He is being held in that position by , who is a thug employed by , who is the owner of the
The fourth man, , is ' bookkeeper

Fennyman, including interest

For pity's sake
Take his feet out
Where will you get (the mathematical genius with a notebook) Sixteen pounds, five shillings and nine pence including interest in three weeks

Put his feet in
It's a comedy
Cut his nose off
new comedy
By Will Shakespeare
And his ears
And a share
We will be partners, Mr
Fennyman
(hesitating) Partners
It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant

This time it is by Shakespeare

Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter
Good title

Fennyman,  think you may have hit on something

takes the quill and signs
(') Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter
Almost finished
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment
' small cramped space in the eaves of a building cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged between crumpled pieces of paper
Among those we have time to observe: a skull, a mug that says --
At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper are tossed towards the shelf
The man who is throwing them,  , is bent over a table, writing studiously with a quill
Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his signature, over and over again
"Will Shagsbeard Shakspur
William Shasper
" Each time he is dissatisfied, and each time he crumples, and tosses it away
Suddenly  becomes impatient
He jumps up and goes to the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts to pull on his boots
At this point the door opens and walks in
He is out of breath and his feet hurt
Will
Where is my play
Tell me you have it nearly done
Tell me you have it started
(desperately) You have begun
(struggling with his boots) Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move No, no, we haven't the time
Talk prose
Where is my play
(tapping his forehead and heading out the door) It is all locked safe in here God be praised
(then doubt) Locked
As soon as  have found my muse '
lives in a crowded area of the city
Hawkers are crying their wares, tract-sellers, delivery boys, and merchants go about their business

She is always Aphrodite
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate
Well,  am a dead man and buggered to boot
My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful - What piece

No--it's comedy they want, Will

Mr
Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds
(staggered) Fifty pounds
What for
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men
For fifty pounds my hired player days are over
Cut out my heart
Throw my liver to the dogs

turns down a side street
and  are crossing a crowded marketplace where a Puritan preacher, , is haranguing anyone who will listen
and the Lord shall smite them
Yea, harken to me
The theatres are handmaidens of the devil
Under the name of the Curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children
And the Rose smells thusly rank by any name

What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of analysis
The session is being timed by an hourglass
Words, words, words

And what favour does Mr
Tilney receive from you
Ask him
The Master of the Revels () comes through the curtain officiously

She is to marry Lord Wessex
What should  do
If you love her, you must do what she asks
And break her heart and mine
It is only ours you can know
She loves me, Thomas
Does she say so
No
And yet she does where the ink has run with tears
Was she weeping when she gave you this
Her letter came to me by the nurse
Your aunt
(catching up) Yes, my aunt
But perhaps she wept a little
Tell me how you love her, Will
Like a sickness and its cure together
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat

Since  came to visit from the country,  have not seen her close
Tell me, is she beautiful
Oh, if  could write the beauty of her eyes

He is looking into ' eyes
She holds his look, but belies his words
And her lips
Oh, Thomas, her lips
The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy
And her voice
Like lark song
Deeper
Softer
None of your twittering larks
would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song
She sings too
Constantly
Without doubt
And plays the lute, she has a natural ear
And her bosom--did  mention her bosom
(glinting) What of her bosom
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins
As round and rare as golden apples
think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance
For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine
Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player
(fervently) Yes, by God
Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank
It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God
So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden
But what of Lord Wessex
For one kiss,  would defy a thousand Wessexes
The boat scrapes on the jetty of the  ' house

Fireworks explode in the evening sky over Greenwich, a royal palace, crowded now with noble guests
The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about, chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while creates a vortex around her as she passes through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the best chair

Are you going to do it like that
And before the humbled actor can reply continues
( ) And but one word with one of us
Couple it with something, make it a word and a blow
But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, ready to fight
and the '  have arrived to avenge ' honour with swords, clubs, and a bucket (containing pig swill)
Where is that thieving hack who can't keep his pen in his own ink pot

What is this rabble

He swings at , a '  swings at , cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ' and the ' , using their much rehearsed skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using everything short of unbuttoned rapiers

What--
literary feud
Quite normal
Then he is smashed over the head
He falls off the stage taking  with him
Under the stage is a space (known as Hell) and  shoves  into this space

He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, with  , dressed as "," fighting with the best of them
There is a stack of cushions, stored for the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, and others grab cushions to use as shields
Soon cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying feathers
The trap door in the stage opens, ' head pops up
She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and half knocks her wig off
In danger of having her cover blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just nicely for Will to plummet down it

You were cast ashore in a far country
They embrace and kiss
In a moment they are in a world of their own

By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan
He hears only that Juliet is dead
And thus he goes to the Apothecary
That's me
And buys a deadly poison

He drinks the poison
He dies by her side
And then she wakes and sees him dead

(') There's a new scene He turns the pages and shows her
Will you read it for me
(he knows it) "Wilt thou be gone
It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale
" (reading) "It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale
Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops must be gone and live, or stay and die
" The words of the scene become ' and ', their way of saying the farewells they cannot utter
"Yon light is not daylight,  know it, It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer
" But the scene is continuing with  dressed as "
" Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc

But after a few moments it is definitely lovemaking
Their clothes start coming away, their words interrupted by kisses
"
thou need'st not to be gone
" " have more care to stay than will to go
Come death, and welcome
Juliet wills it so
How is't my soul
Let's talk
It is not day
" By now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away and  passionately embraces her nakedness
And into this heaving composition comes a little white mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in the planking behind ' head

He is muttering
He is glancing at a sheet of paper
He is rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary, for which he has a special voice
"Such mortal drugs  have but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them
" Then him
Then me
"Put this in any liquid thing you will And

The fight goes fast and furious around the stage, until  thrusts accurately at ' chest
