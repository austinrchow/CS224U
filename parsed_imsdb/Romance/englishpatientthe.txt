seen from the air
An ocean of dunes  for mile after mile
The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black
An old  is flying over the Sahara
Its shadow swims over the contours of sand
woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track
Szerelem, szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one
the aeroplane are two figures
One,   , seems to be asleep
Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit , a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet
He is singing, too, but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's plaintive voice
The plane shudders over a ridge
Beneath it , camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks and armored vehicles
An , , focuses his field glasses
The glasses pick out the  on the plane
They are English
An -  swivels furiously
Shocking bursts of
Explosions rock the plane, which lurches violently
, slamming her head against the instruments
The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not conscious
The fuel tank above their heads is punctured
It sprays them both, then
, clinging to his dead lover
The are both She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely
He looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries them slowly to earth
Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his face, his lover

1942
Behind them the wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it glints in the sun, is retrieved
Another man comes across   -  and takes it over to the Pilot
The Pilot is charred
His helmet has melted into his head
He's oblivious to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him
He twists frantically to find her
Two men pick him up and carry him across to a litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets
3
The Pilot is being carried across the desert
mask covers his face
His view of the world is through the slats of reed
He glimpses camels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him
4
The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack and begin to chew it
Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the Pilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth
He stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth
Mouth to mouth

The   , of tiny chimes
music of glass
It floats in darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire
The image develops to reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang , on different lengths of string and wire
He could be an angel
The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot
He's still in the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets
The stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the support of the two crutches
He puts some liquid in the Pilot's tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll
Then he slowly sets about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's flesh
The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck, hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl he'd made with his feet
This mixture he uses to anoint the burned skin
Next he finds green-black  - ground Peacock Bone - and on to the Pilot's rib cage
All the while he us humming and chanting
The bottles continue to jingle

1945
The sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church bells, as      - Red Cross vehicles and some supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road
The war in Italy is largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and supply lines slowly following

Hana pays special care to the  lying in the stretcher alongside her
This is the  - now known as
web of scars covers the Patient's face and body
They have the quality of a livid tattoo, magenta and green-black
The hair has largely gone and the effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes liquid
It's a warrior's face
But he has no physical strength
He coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road

pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck containing Hana and the Patient
The horn blows and Hana looks out to see it contains her best friend,
sit up front, one driving, both grinning
Jan signals for Hana's attention
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me
'm not sewing anything else
(mischievously) You don't have any money, do you
Just in case there's silk
No
Hana,  know you do
Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some
The two hands - hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side by side
They laugh at the effort
Jan's   catches the sun and glints
'm not sewing anything else for you
(getting the money) love you
The Jeep accelerates away
Hana sighs to the patient
Suddenly   shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a
The jeep is  into the air
The convoy halts and there's chaos as soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles
Hana runs the other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by a soldier

One of them, a , wears a turban
The motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy

The other two bodies are covered with blankets
There's blood everywhere

He stiffens as he registers metal
With a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface
Something Suddenly,     walks across his vision as , walking carelessly up the road
It's so surreal that neither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting
Hey
Hey
Stop
Hey
Don't move
Stand
Hana stops
Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps
(as he approaches) Good, that's good, just stay still for me and then we're going to be fine
He arrives at Hana
Then grabs her
He'd like to slap her face
What are you doing
What the bloody hell do you think you're doing
By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet
Jan's lies in the mud
Hardy bends down and collects the mangled bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands

The  is threading through   , passing the souvenirs of war
An overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children, dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road
From the end of one of the buildings are hanging    , strung upside down with crude placards denouncing, in Italian, their collaboration with the Nazis

Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the Patient swaying alongside her
She puts out her hand to steady him

The trucks are silhouetted in a line
Hana helps lift the Patient's stretcher onto the ground
She bends to him
Do you need something
The Patient nods
Hana gets up to prepare   from a small kit
Mary arrives
Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief for Jan's death
Are you okay
Oh God, Hana, you were like sisters
(sighs angrily) We keep moving him - in and out of the truck
Why
He's dying
What's the point
Well, we can't hardly leave him
Do you mean leave him
We can't
Hana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher
She draws herself up against the night
On the hill above, she can see the outline of    in the moonlight
She's crying, her face a frozen mask
must be a curse
Anybody who loves me, anybody who gets close to me - or  must be cursed
Which is it
The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand

Hana is investigating the

What sanctuary it seems to offer
15*
Hana explores via a gaping hole in a  where the walls have collapsed from shelling
The garden intrudes, ivy curls around the shelves
Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a  tiled up on one side
Hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which covers it
Everywhere there are signs of a brief German occupation

She comes across a small , with the remains of murals and an altar pressed into service by the Germans as a table
Hana finds an old bed, and a mattress

Hana comes out, passes a
She hears a rustling on the gravel and turns to see   ambling towards the trough
On cue there's
, splashing water everywhere
The Tortoise, clearly arriving for this, enjoys a welcome shower
Hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into the water
Looks around her, and makes a decision
17
The Convoy is in the final stages of loading up
Oliver passes the vehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is carrying some sacks of rice
The war's over - you told me yourself
How can it be desertion
It's not over everywhere
didn't mean literally
When he dies 'll catch up
Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions, then lays another blanket over the Patient
It's not safe here
The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what
It's madness
can't allow it
You're not, this is natural - it's shock
For all of us
Hana - need morphine

And a pistol
(clutching at straws) And what if he really is a spy
(impatiently) He can't even move
If anything happened to you 'd never forgive myself
Hana nods
tiny smile
Oliver shrugs helplessly
We're heading for Leghorn
Livorno the Italians call it
We'll expect you

are helping Mary and Hana carry the Patient into the monastery
Hana indicates the stairs
Up there
They struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly avoids falling into the void in the stairs
The cot almost tips up, at which the Patient  , his voice cracked and rasping, but still clearly aristocratic
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills
Am  that Prince
Hana laughs
Because you're leaning
No, you're just on an angle
You're too heavy
Mary laughs
They reach the landing
Hana kicks open the door to the In here

Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away the drapes, sending up a cloud of dust
They lower the Patient onto the bed
She turns to the
Thank you
She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room, its faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos
Hana smiles, opens a shutter to let a fierce envelope of light into the room
Good
She goes to Mary and hugs her

The Patient turns his head to her
He's grinning
He puts up a thumb

1938
where we find the singer - , a weather-beaten man who is working on the guts of an His face is blackened with oil
second European, , stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the camshaft
Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for Almasy to inspect
Behind them is an  - some camels foraging in the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the : guides and servants to the Almasy/Madox Expedition
It's 1938 and the whole continent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other, pursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities
', the team's Italian , drives towards the plane in one of the expedition's adapted
He gets out carrying a large earthenware
He looks very pleased with himself as he shows the jar to Almasy and then passes it to Madox
' Thirsty
(sniffing inside) What's this
' Don't drink it
He reaches for the jug, then pours out a little sludge - it's a brackish and stinks
Madox makes a face
' can't guarantee the vintage, my friends
just dug it out of the hill
Madox and Almasy have seen many such jugs
Excellent
That's terrific, 'Ag
(to Almasy, of a tool) Toss that up, would you
' (mischievously) There are some others
21
'Agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading Madox and Almasy
The other members of the team are already there - , a German and ,  from Cairo
(to Almasy, astonished) My God, look at this
They bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken, piled on top of each other
Bermann approaches them, carrying his tripod
Incredible, Hmm
Quite incredible
' 've never seen anything like it
There would have been enough water here to serve an army
(gloomily) Which means we're in the wrong place
Almasy speaks with a slight but unmistakable European accent
' Why
Would you stockpile water near to an Oasis
There can't be a natural spring within fifty miles of here
Or they didn't know of one
So, it may not be Zerzura, still incredible
' (nodding, delighted) pottery hill
wild goose chase
(firmly) No
Almasy gives him a look
But Madox will have none of it
No
Now we look in the other places
We're eliminating
The unmistakable buzz of   distracts them
Good, and here comes reinforcements
21a*
and a smart new aeroplane, a , makes a smooth landing on the flat desert
The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals
Almasy is not with them
He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic
young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane
They are
And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane- crash at the beginning of the film
Madox makes all the introductions
Hands are shaken, hellos all round, as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear
Geoffrey removes his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, produces a bottle of  and sets off the cork with a flourish
hereby Christen us the International Sand Club
22
The party is in the shade of the tents
Almasy joins the group
Madox nods over to the Clifton plane
Marvelous plane
Did you look
(beaming at Almasy) Isn't it
Wedding present from Katharine's parents
'm calling it Rupert Bear
Hello
Geoffrey Clifton
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap
Almasy smiles and walks on towards the others
' Mrs
Clifton - Count Almasy
(smiling, offering her hand) Geoffrey gave me your monograph when was reading up on the desert
Very impressive
(stiff) Thank you
wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives
thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it
Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car
(joining them and joining in) broken car
Still a car
(hands them champagne) Not much use, though
Love
Romantic love, platonic love, filial love -
Quite different things, surely
(hugging Katharine) Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love
Excessive love of one's wife
(a dry smile) There you have me
23
'
The morning floods into the room
The Patient lies, lost in the desert
Then a sudden   disturbs him
24
,
Hana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the damaged stairs, and with others, she is improvising new steps
The heavy volumes are perfect for treading on
25
Hana comes in, gathers up another armful of books and carries them out to continue her stair repairs
26*
'
Hana enters
What was all the banging
Were you fighting rats or the entire German army
was repairing the stairs
found a library and the books were very useful
Hana shrugs
She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping up the pillows
He's short of breath
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me
think they're all in Italian, but 'll look, yes
What about your own book
(reluctant) My book
The Herodotus
Yes, we can read him
Hana picks up the book and hands it to him
Then she starts rummaging in her pockets
Oh - 've found plums
We have plums in the orchard
We have an orchard
She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth
Thank you
His mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping from the mouth
Hana mops it up
The plumness of this plum
noise,  sound, disturbs them
What's that
27	/
Hana comes through the Cloisters into the garden as the gurgling increases
She's in time to catch the  arriving once again in the   just as it starts to gush with water
She shouts up to The Patient's open window
Water
(bends to the Tortois) You hear it, too, don't you
28
'
Close on the
The Patient opens its cover, held together by leather ties
Loose , , - are all collected between the pages
He claws at some water-colors which appear to be based on   - figures, dark-skinned warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like those of Matisse
Some appear to be swimming, another is diving
Then the Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel  to the floor with a crack
29
, disturbing the evening meal
Almasy and others go outside
Silhouetted on a ridge, a group of men sit astride camels
One of them holds his rifle aloft, clearly pointing towards the sky - means friend
Fouad peers at the horizon
European,  think, with guides
(can only see shapes) How do you know
(frowns) Yes, and  think  know who this is
30
as the first Arab dismounts, the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse
Almasy speaks in Arabic, exchanging the ritual greetings
, -, sole European in this expedition, has finally persuaded his camel to sit, and dismounts irritably, slapping the animal in disgust
- Ugly brute
Shits and roars and complains all day
(bypassing Almasy and approaching Madox) Of course, you have your aeroplane
Two now
Do you still call yourselves explorers
assume not
(stiffly) Fenelon-Barnes
Yes,  think a sailor can call himself an explorer, can't he
Or should Columbus have swum to America
31
The arrivals come inside
Madox handles the introductions
think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England
Apprentices
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes
- (to Katharine) know your mother, of course
Hello
- 'm also searching for the lost Oasis, but by more authentic means
(of Almasy) Anyway, my friend here has a new theory - that Zerzura doesn't exist
So we may all be chasing windmills
Have some food
- Well, it's certainly not between here and Dakhla
Nine days of nothing but sand and sandstorms
An egg
found an ostrich egg and some fossils
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms
What kind of fossils
- 'll invite you to my paper at the Royal Geographical Society
Are you still a member
He takes a long drink from a bowl of frothing camel milk
think you know  am
- (ignoring Almasy) Quite impossible, Madox
You must know that
If you attempt to cross the Sand Sea due east of Kufra by car you'll leave your bones in the sand for me to collect
(leaving the tent) If you come across my bones -  hope you'll do me the honor of leaving them in peace
(to Katharine) Excuse me
- You have my word as a gentleman
(watching him leave) 've discovered a unique type of sand-dune
've applied to the King for permission to call it The Fenelon-Barnes Formation
32
, supper over, the company is entertaining itself
Almasy, standing outside his tent, watches the merriment from a distance
'Ag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of  Puccini's Lucevan Le Stelle
He sits down to much applause from the others and on the sand
It comes to rest pointing at Clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into Yes
We Have No Bananas with great gusto
His version involves during each line of the chorus - prompted by Oui
or Ja
or Si
from the others
Song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle and it arrives equidistant between Fenelon-Barnes and Katharine - until with a little  from the husband it settles on his wife
Katharine gets up, awkward
can't sing
(the audience groans) but  can tell a story
(to Almasy, who has arrived) might need a prompt
Do you have your Herodotus
've noticed you carry it
'm sorry - what have you noticed
Your book
Your Herodotus
Almasy looks uncomfortable
(reacting quickly) It doesn't matter
Really
think  can muddle through
Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges
King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife - (Geoffrey whistles proudly) One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior - (quietly prompting her) Daskylus
(smiles) Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him  don't think you believe me when  tell you how beautiful my wife is
And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women
Do you all know this story
The men all encourage her to continue her story
33*
'
- and Hana's voice    as she reads to the Patient who listens, eyes closed, still in the desert
(reading from the Herodotus) will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules
She stumbles over the word
Candaules (not neurotic) Candaules
you're laughing at me
'm not laughing at you
Go on, please
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
34*
(her story continuing) And that evening, it's exactly as the King had told him, she goes to the chair and removes her clothes, one by one, until she stand naked in full view of Gyges
And indeed she was more lovely than he could have imagined
Almasy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky
Katharine turns to looks at him
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows
And though she said nothing, she shuddered
The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him
And hearing his story, she said this - Off with his head
#
death for gazing on that which you should not, or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his place
Clifton makes a face of outrage
For Katherine the story has collapsed
She wants it to be finished
So Gyges killed the King and married the Queen and became ruler of Lydia for twenty eight years
The End
(an uncomfortable moment) Do  spin the bottle
Almasy shrinks away from the fire, disappears into black
(to Clifton) And let that be a lesson to you
35
'
Hana looks up from the Herodotus, sees the Patient's eyes closed
Gently touches his face and whispers
Are you asleep
(lying) Yes
Dropping off
And Hana closes the book, gets up, and blows out the lamp
36
-
and then   flickers on as Almasy enters Fenelon- Barnes' tent
He pulls apart his luggage, quickly and methodically
He finds what he is looking for inside a trunk: ; a collection of stone leaves, wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin
Then he's distracted by a noise from Fenelon-Barnes' bed
Almasy stiffens, turns to investigate
There's   in the cot
dog
Almasy eases back the blanket to reveal a  , no more than fourteen, bound hand and foot
He holds the torch to her face
37
The next morning
Almasy and Madox prepare to take off
As they talk Clifton's Rupert Bear taxis past them, a wave from Clifton and Katharine
Madox is very disturbed by what Almasy is telling him
What did you think you were doing in his tent
Looking for the fossils
Why should we wait until we're in London
This girl was probably twelve years old
(getting into the plane) You shouldn't go into another man's tent
It's inexcusable
Her hands and feet were tied
What did you do
looked at them
They're shrubs, small trees
Exquisite
And fossilized, rock hard
He walks away to the nose of the plane
was talking about the girl
Cut the ropes
left a note, on his blanket
(gleefully) At the next Geographical Society shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot
The Girl wouldn't leave, of course
Her father had sold her for a camel
He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up
38
Both planes are scouting the Gilf Kebir region
Geoffrey flies up alongside Madox and wiggles his wings
Madox waves
They're flying over a distinctive group of  , Crater- shaped hills
The broken towers of the Gilf Kebir
Almasy is distracted by them
He turns to Madox and points down, indicating they should explore them
Madox gestures to the Cliftons to  the Massifs from Geoffrey
39*
'
Hana gives the Patient his injection, now she begins to change the sheet
The light streams in from the open window
She looks up at the green hills rolling away from the Monastery, the village in the distance
should try and move your bed
want you to be able to see the view
It's good, it's a view from a monastery
can already see
(bending down to his level) How
How can you see anything
Not the window -  can't bear the light anyway - no,  can see all the way to the desert
've found the lost fossils
'm turning you
An awkward moment as she rolls him on to his back
He grunts with the pain
She washes him very tenderly
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds
As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room
can smell it
The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth
can taste it
'm chewing the mint
Is there sand in my eyes
Are you cleaning sand from my ears
No sand
That's your drugs speaking
can see my wife in that view
Are you remembering more
Could  have a cigarette
Are you crazy
Why are you so determined to keep me alive
Because 'm a nurse

The  heads towards the trough, to the gurgling accompaniment
It reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis shoes, a frock
It clambers over as the water begins to belch out
Hana, naked, kneeling in the trough, receives the shower with a great of shivering joy
41*
It's dark, but something is going on here
Hana is caught by the stray shafts of moonlight
She is  something on the flagstones
Her skirt is bunched up around her thighs
She throws something in the air
It's a , used to tap into the maple tree for syrup
It lands with a crack
Suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a skip, a jump
Then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then back again, in this blindman's version of

Hana walks through a long carriage
She could be ten years younger than the Hana at the Monastery
And easy
She stops at the bunk of
Hana bends to the boy
He's had shrapnel in his legs and cheek
She speaks softly to him
How are you
Okay
Your leg will be fine
lot of shrapnel came out -  saved you the pieces
You're the prettiest girl  ever saw
(she hears this every day) don't think so
Would you kiss me
No, 'll get you some tea
Wait till you're in Naples
You'll find a girl there
(innocent) Just kiss me
It would mean such a lot to me
(tender, believing him) Would it
She kisses him, very softly, on the lips
Thank you
He closes his eyes
Is almost instantly asleep
Hana smiles, continues along the compartment
#1 Nurse -  can't sleep
#2 Nurse
Would you kiss me
#3 You're so pretty
#4 Hinky-dinky parlez-vous
(good-naturedly waving away their joke) Very funny
Go to sleep
She gets into a corridor
Mary is coming the other way
She carries a blood-soaked bundle
Hana questions her appalled expression
Don't ask
43
The train is arriving
Hana hangs out of a window, scouring the crowds to find her sweetheart,  McGANN, a young Canadian Captain, who seeing her runs up to her window
Where are we going
don't want to be kissing in a crowd
have six hours
She jumps out of the moving door and into his arms
(laughing at her ferocity) Whoa - give me a chance
Sorry
took a Benzedrine
The Station is full of desperate people trying to make do
the couple hurry through, oblivious to anyone except each other
've got a surprise
boat
We can go to Capri
It's got a cabin, it's private
'd like to spend a night with you in a bed
We can do that when we're very very old

Hana lies alone in her bed covered by a curtain
There's a sharp She's very frightened
She has her pistol under her pillow and pulls it out, listens, holding her breath
Another
She listens
45
'
Hana has been reviving a vegetable patch
She comes to garden are feasting
She's furious, shouts, runs at them
Nature, wildness, insisting on invading her peace
46*
Hana appears from the Cemetery, dragging
It's bigger than she is, and she drags it, as if approaching Calvary He's approaching fifty, grizzled and attractive, and could be Italian
His hands are bandaged
Hana aims the cross at the soil, but is not quite bit or strong enough
The man, , chooses this moment to introduce himself
He drops the bicycle on the ground with a clatter
(very cheerful) Buon' Giorno
Hana turns, startled and suspicious
Are you Hana
What do you want
met your friend Mary
She said should stop and see if you were okay
Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal
Cabot, north of Laurier
Bonjour
(unraveling this information) Bonjour
He goes to her and - putting a bandaged hand behind her ear - He beams, as does Hana
'd like to take credit, but it's from Mary
My name's David Caravaggio, but nobody ever called me David
Caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on
During this he attempts the same thing with his other hand to Hana's other ear
Cursing, he gets on his knees and starts to scoop it up, preserving it
47*
Hana has taken his eggs and put them into a bowl
She beats them with a knife picking out the bits of shell
Caravaggio watches, takes in how little food there is otherwise
The table seems useful more as a sewing area than for cooking - it's     being sewn into drapes
On a tray on the table are     from the Patient's room
As Hana turns to the stove, he's moved and covered them with his bandaged hands, a second later and he's juggled them into his pockets with the slightest clink
Hana looks at him
He shrugs, nods at the eggs
They're fresh
haven't eaten an egg in
have you noticed there are chickens
You get chickens in Italy but no eggs
In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens
Who separates them
You were in Africa
Yeah, for a while
So was my Patient
'd like to stay
That's the long and short of it
mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah
have to do some work here - speak the language
There are Partisans to be - (trying to paraphrase) #
relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug
was a thief, so they think 'd be good at that
So you can shoot a pistol
(showing his hands) No
If you said yes  would have had a reason
You should let me redress those bandages
Before you go
'm okay
Look, it's a big house
We needn't disturb each other
can shoot a pistol
'll sleep in the stables don't care where  sleep
don't sleep
Because we're fine here
don't know what Mary told you about me, but don't need company,  don't need to be looked at
Fine
'm not looking
48
'
Hana carries in a tray
There's  on the plate
There's a man downstairs
He brought us eggs
(shows him the omelette) He might stay
Why
Can he lay eggs
He's Canadian
(brittle) Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place
What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you
He needn't disturb you
Me
He can't
'm already disturbed
He won't disturb us then
think he's after morphine
(she's cut the omelette into tiny pieces) There's a war
Where you come from becomes important
And besides - we're vulnerable here
keep hearing noises in the night
Voices
The Patient says nothing
She puts a spoonful of the omelette into his mouth
He grunts

in full sway, a locals-only affair, blazing with noise and bustle and barter
Emerging from a thicket of women and begging children,   carries her purchase of an exotic-looking From nowhere she is joined by Almasy
How much did you pay
(delighted) Hello
Good morning
They don't see foreign women in this market
How much did you pay
Seven pounds, eight,  suppose
Why
Which stall
Excuse me
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back
(bristling) don't want to go back
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs
Clifton
don't care to bargain
That insults them
(turning to face him) don't believe that
think you are insulted by me, somehow
You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market
(of the carpet) should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this
apologize if  appear abrupt
am rusty at social graces
(tart) How do you find Cairo
Did you visit the Pyramids
Excuse me
He stands as she continues, pushing past him, shrugging off the children, boiling

The Exploration Team are drinking at a table
They are not entirely off-duty - Almasy and Madox as ever ponder the maps
Geoffrey Clifton appears, arms waving
Gentlemen, good evening
He sits down
Madox hails the waiter
' How is your charming wife
Uh, marvelous
She's in love with the hotel plumbing
She's either in the swimming pool - she swims for hours, she's a fish, quite incredible - or she's in the bath
Actually, she's just outside
(responding to their bewildered expressions) Chaps Only in the Long Bar
(standing, embarrassed) Of course
Well, we should all go out onto the terrace
Oh no, really
She has her book
won't hear of it
None of us will
52
'
Katharine appears with Geoffrey to join the arriving Explorers
She looks exquisite in her evening clothes
Madox brings her to her seat
There is dancing inside, and couples walk to and from their tables
Katharine manages to produce a dazzling smile which includes everyone except Almasy
Mrs
Clifton, you'll have to forgive us
We're not accustomed to the company of women
Not at all
was thoroughly enjoying by book
(indicating they should all sit and then nodding at Almasy before greeting the others) Please
Signor 'Agostino, Herr Bermann
The team is in mourning, darling
Oh really
'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition
How awful
What will you do
more modest expedition, or even wait a year
Remind our families we still exist
(astonished) Good heavens, are you married, Madox
Very much so
We are all, save my friend here
He nods at Almasy
Clifton appears tremendously relieved
feel much better, don't you darling
We were feeling rather self-conscious
Let's toast, then
To absent wives
' (toasting Katharine) And present ones
(toasting Almasy) And future ones
53

dance finishes
Almasy takes over from 'Agostino to partner Katharine
They dance beautifully
The others remain on the terrace in deep conversation
Why did you follow me yesterday
Excuse me
After the market, you followed me to the hotel
was concerned
As  said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, felt obliged to
You felt obliged to
As the wife of one of our party
(sardonic) So why follow me
Escort me, by all means
Following me is predatory, isn't it
The dance finishes
They walk back to their table, where Almasy leads Katharine back to her seat next to Clifton
was just saying, 'm going to cable Downing Street, see if  can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the 's wife are best - (interrupting) Darling, for goodness' sake
Well, she is

Hana, having already replaced the bedlinen, is standing on a stepladder trying to hang home-made drapes around the bed as Caravaggio knocks tentatively, then comes in
Hello
Finally
So you're our Canadian pickpocket
He goes to help Hana, they work as he talks
Thief,  think, is more accurate
understand you were in Africa
Whereabouts
Oh, all over
All over
kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed
(to Hana) Are you leaving us
Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds
Then 'm definitely going
And she exits
The men consider her
Does she have war wounds
55*
'
As Hana walks up her stairs she finds herself overhearing their conversation as it threads up through the hole in the ceiling
She strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for a sheet
think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her
Are you planning to be the exception
Me
You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy
(a pause) So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name
And you've forgotten yours
told her you would never invent such a preposterous name
told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name

Hana walks up to the Patient's cabin
He is propped up with a view of the sea, which is interrupted by the pacing Officer
Hana has a blanket and a chart for the Patient's bed
She busies herself
Do you remember where you were born
Am  being interrogated
You should be trying to trick me
Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur
Or Buckingham Palace
About Marmite -  was addicted
Or make me speak German, which  can, by the way
Why
Are you German
No
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything
You tell me
remember a lot of things
remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France
This was your garden
Or my wife's
Then you were married
think so
Although  believe that to be true of a number of Germans
Might  have a glass of water
Hana pours him a glass of water
He notices her
Thank you
(he sips) Look - my lungs are useless - (makes a small gap with his fingers) 've got this much lung
the rest of my organs are packing up - what could it possibly matter if were Tutankhamun
'm a bit of toast, my friend - butter me and slip a poached egg on top
Hana leaves, smiling at the Patient's irascibility, sharing this with the Officer, who frowns
The interview continues
57
Hana walks between the cabins
steps out of the shade
He is drawn, older than last seen
My leave is canceled
can't meet you later
Hana frowns, helpless
As if to emphasize this, a Staff Nurse comes by, carrying a bowl and a withering look
58*
Hana enters, approaches the Patient
She's circumspect
Excuse me - Yes
Can  ask - my friend, can he come in
Just for a few minutes
Your friend
He's going back to the front this evening
can't see him otherwise
Just go off
'll be quite all right
No,  can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed
This is as private as we'll get
Well then - yes
Of course
Thank you
Thank you
She hurries out, returns with Stuart
They stand awkwardly
This is Captain McGann
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries - Thanks
'm going to sing
If  sing  shan't hear anything
And with that he bursts into a raucous, coughing version of Yes
We Have No Bananas
He changes language each verse
The couple stand, formal, then edge round to the back of the bed

He collects some packages from the , including a dead , and then exchanges a few words with the driver
Hana, who's watching all of this from her garden, sees that the driver is a
The woman's name is , and Caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye to her
Caravaggio approaches the Vegetable Garden as Hana comes to greet him
He throws her the rabbit, and hurries up the stairs without pausing, clutching the other boxes
Supper
Hana calls after him
Where've you been
(not stopping) Rabbit hunting
Hana looks at the rabbit
She's angry
Caravaggio hasn't been around for a week

Hana heads up for the kitchen, then stops as there's a faint  from upstairs

Hana, the rabbit still in her hands, comes along the corridor to find Caravaggio  on the floor, retching
The discarded  lies beside him, the new package of   ripped open
He looks up at Hanna, glazed

could get you off that
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life
She bends, starts clearing up, putting the morphine phials back into the box
It's a week
We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or - (of the drugs) You should be happy
What were you going to do for him when it ran out
He pulls out more phials from his jacket
What do you do
What are you doing here
Some gave me a dress

What 'm learning
You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground
Everywhere  go, we're in the right

Hana comes in, carrying a batch of the new morphine
She's wearing a different
It's not new, and it's faded, but the change of color is startling
Something smells so rich
My stomach is heaving - He came back, he says he caught a rabbit
'm cooking it
That's a different dress
He keeps asking me questions about you
Do you know him
Do you recognize him
Do  recognize him
recognize what he is

He's Canadian
He can read Italian
He can catch rabbits

Almasy squats with an   outside his rudimentary house, while he draws on the sand, talking in some arcane dialect, scratching out a possible location for the lost oasis
The man stops speaking and scours the sky a beat or two before we or Almasy hear the faint noise of a
It's Clifton's Steerman, Rupert Bear, coming in to land
Almasy doesn't look up
The Arab continues to talk
The newly-arrived Katharine has scrambled up the hill to speak to Almasy
(diffident) Hello
Not to interrupt but we're celebrating
She makes to leave but Almasy puts up a hand to keep Katharine there, but quiet
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich
(to the Arab in ) 'm telling her your map is poetry
The Arab shrugs
What do you mean, poetry
mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear
Sounds perfectly clear
Where does the Ostrich come in
The Ostrich is a detour
poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method
Nothing to do with Zerzura
To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move
The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run
At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards
When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer
(to the guide) Haunting the ostrich
The Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe
Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family, not just the meat, but by selling the feathers, beak, the skin, a year from this one animal
So, each day the man gets closer
And the ostrich is not sure - has something changed
- now the standing man is only a few yards from where it feeds
And then one day, the man is in the wadi, in the water
And the Ostrich comes, as always, dips into the water and the man   - and captures it
He shrugs
The Arab has more to say
Almasy doesn't respond, quieting him with a dismissive gesture
What is he saying
(Almasy, awkward, shakes his head) Come on, what did he say
He said - be careful
Be careful
You mean you - or me
Who
(to the Arab) Her or me
The Arab speaks again
Almasy speaks without looking at her
The one who appears not to be moving
64*
Katharine comes in
Then, a beat, and Almasy
Clifton is holding up the champagne
Gentlemen, to Zerzura
Zerzura
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund-raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels
They toast the Cliftons
To arm-twisting
(to Almasy) Did Katharine say
- Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army
Darling, Peter says  could stay
(checking with Almasy) Why not
What kind of photographs
Portraits
The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing
(to Clifton) Why do you think
About my staying
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then suppose -  shall, of course, be bereft
(playfully poking his ribs) Oh
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life
shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and -  want to say Harems - am  in the right country for Harems
65*
As Clifton prepares to leave in the Steerman, Almasy approaches
Safe journey
You too
Good luck
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her
Appropriate
think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough,  wonder if it's not too much for her
Are you mad
Katharine loves it here
She told me yesterday
All the same, , were  you  would be concerned - 've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife
think 'd know what is and what isn't too much for her
think she's know herself
Very well
(laughing it off) Why are you people so threatened by a woman
He settles into the controls
Almasy watches the plane taxi away
Doesn't move at all

It's contents have been unloaded, and a rope ladder is being inserted under the tires
The entire company huff and puff and argue about the best means of extricating the vehicle

- Almasy drives the second car, accompanied by Katharine and Al Auf
Katharine breaks the long silence
've been thinking about - how does somebody like you decide to come to the desert
What is it
You're doing whatever you're doing - in your castle, or wherever it is you live, and one day, you say,  have to go to the desert - or what
Almasy doesn't answer
Katharine, who has looked at him for an answer, looks away
There's another long silence
once traveled with a terrific guide, who was taking me to Faya
He didn't speak for nine hours
At the end of it he pointed at the horizon and said - Faya
That was a good day
Point made, they lapse again into silence
Katharine boils
Actually, you sing
Pardon
You sing
All the time
do not
Ask Al Auf
Almasy asks Al Auf in Arabic
He laughs, nods
(sings wickedly) 'll be down to get you in the taxi, honey, you'd better be ready about half-past eight
Al Auf nods and grins furiously, joins in, impersonating Almasy
Almasy grunts in irritation
68*
The group is investigating a cleft in the rocky massif
They climb slowly
Below them,
The group winds around the rock
Almasy turns to offer a hand to Katharine behind him, pulling her up to the next rock slab
She smiles at him
He smiles back curtly, continues
The group stops at a level plateau
The Arabs stand apart and Al Auf leads the incantations
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
The westerners wait respectfully
As the sun sets in glory, Almasy looks over at the range of rocks
One particular range seems to look exactly like  '
He squints at the rock
Almasy discreetly pulls out his

Almasy clambers up the rocks, coming through a narrow crevice to find He scrambles up this path, reaching up, only to notice that his hand almost perfectly covers    on the rock, and as he digests this he realizes he has climbed past what is He disappears inside

Almasy treads cautiously along the narrow winding passage
He comes to an open cavern and takes his flashlight up to a wall

Cattle
Fish
Men with bows and arrows
Almasy is astonished by what he sees

The others watch as a flashlight bobs and jerks among the rocks as Almasy comes scrambling down, transformed into an excited teenager
Madox
Madox
He slithers in a heap in front of the astonished expedition party
Doesn't care

Almasy has led the whole party into the heart of the cave
Now Madox comes alongside him at the wall, his flashlight joining Almasy's and increasing the visibility of the paintings
dark-skinned figure, apparently in the process of  into water, comes clearly into view
Then others supine, arms outstretched
(with audible excitement) My God, they're swimming
The others crowd round 73*
hive of activity
The team has set up  to catalogue the finds as the Bedouin come out with baskets of detritus, which they empty onto a growing heap as the Cave is cleared out
Entering the cave, Almasy passes with camera equipment, just as 'Ag emerges carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved
'Ag gestures to Almasy with his customary enthusiasm, holding up the body of the fox
' Have you seen this
Astonishing
Perfectly preserved
74
Inside, Bermann is setting up , running wires from a car
Kamal is helping him
And as Almasy arrives he catches a tiny moment of tenderness between them
Bermann, seeing him, quickly disengages and busies himself with the lights
At another wall, Katharine is catching

The  are heading back to Basecamp
They bounce over the sand

'
Bermann is driving the lead  along some
Almasy beside him
Bermann is peeling  , a segment of which he holds out of the window
Kamal, riding shotgun, leans down and collects it, his head dipping in to grin at Bermann
Bermann looks uneasily as Almasy
He wants to tell him of his passion, of his absolute love for Kamal, but he daren't
love the desert, you see
That's my, that's my -  can't think of the word
(Almasy nods) How do you explain
To someone who's never been here
Feelings which seem quite normal
(compassionate) don't know, my friend
don't know
Bermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches the slim brown hand collect it 'Ag - following, Fouad beside him - brakes sharply, but can't stop his own car from being caught in the avalanche of sand, and '      , the radiator exploding
Only Madox, Katharine beside him, and a little way behind, manages to stay clear of the trouble
He jumps out of the vehicle and slides down the dune to find pandemonium as the passengers stumble out of the cars, sand flying, smoke pouring from the upright vehicle, the wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the air, a puddle of oil spreading ominously
77*
and the group have cleaned up as best as possible
'Ag, Bermann, and Fouad are a little worse for wear
Fouad's arm is in a sling, and 'Ag is sporting a bloody head-bandage
Bermann has broken a finger and is being attended to by Madox
The luggage, water and petrol have been stacked up and the men are loading up the remaining car
Almasy is working at the crumpled end of the vehicle
He's having no success
78*
Almasy, Kamal and two of the other young Bedouin stand around the mess of the two broken vehicles
The    is loaded with men and provisions
Katharine sits inside, next to Madox, Almasy comes over to her window, to speak past her to Madox
'll be back as quick as  can
Thirty-six hours at the outside
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill
And a better jack
We planned badly
(nods at Almasy, then shouts over to the wrecked vehicles) Bermann
This is Bermann's cue to take leave of Kamal who is staying behind
Kamal makes a little bow
May God make safety your companion
Bermann nods and hurries away, squeezing into the car which jolts off, bouncing over the track
,  , '
shall stay behind, of course Certainly not
insist
There clearly isn't room for us all, 'm the least able to dig, and 'm not one of the walking wounded
Those are facts
Besides, if  remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us
It's hard to argue with this logic
Almasy shrugs
-    makes a more effective departure
And Almasy and Katharine are left alone
as if realizing this for the first time
Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent Katharine goes to join them
There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles of undulating dunes
79
Almasy sits alone, writing into  , a map folded in front of him, from which he makes notes
Katherine comes across with a clutch of her  from the Cave wall
Hands them to him
They're beautiful
What's this
thought you might paste them into your book
We took several photographs, there's no need
'd like you to have them
(handing them back) There's really no need
This is just a scrapbook
should feel obliged
Thank you
(exasperated) And that would be unconscionable, suppose, to feel any obligation
Yes
Of course it would
She's already turning, walking as far from him as the cramped shelter permits
He continues with his maps
80
Katharine sits alone on top of the Dune, smoking, surveying the landscape
Below her the makeshift camp - a fresh wind flicking at the tarpaulin,     ' Almasy emerges from the tent and, locating Katharine, heads towards her
You should come into the shelter
'm quite all right, thank you
Look over there
Katharine turns, scans the horizon
What am  looking at
See what's happening to them - the stars
They're so untidy
'm just trying to rearrange them
In an hour there will be no stars
The air is filling with sand
He offers a hand
little reluctantly she takes it
81
The team hurries around the improvised tent, weighing it down with packing cases, gasoline drums, water cans, bringing anything loose or light inside the tarpaulin
is whipping up, the air busy with sand
Almasy pushes everyone under cover
82
Kamal and Almasy try to secure one vulnerable area, but suddenly there are leaks everywhere and the sand swarms inside
It's noisy, too, and Almasy has to shout to make himself understood, indicating to the Bedouin to grab water and blankets and food, all the valuables, and get out
He himself finds blankets and water and shouts at Katharine to do the same
One side of the canvas suddenly apart like paper
Chaos as figures struggle in ever-worsening conditions, sand blizzarding the air
83
, stranding the figures, their heads wrapped in blankets, flashlights useless
They seek safety in two groups, the tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car, Katharine and Almasy to the upright one
84
Inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, Katharine and Almasy sit without speaking
Dawn is trying to break through
He pours a little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses and mouths
She takes her silk scarf and first dries her eyes with it, then dries his
This is not very good, is it
No
Shall we be all right
Yes
Absolutely
Yes is a comfort
Absolutely is not
85
The sand is piling up against the two cars, the tent is swept from its moorings, the water cans are hurled up too, and then plunge ominously into sand drifts as if going under an ocean
(/) let me tell you about winds
There is a whirlwind in Southern Morocco, the Aajej, against which the fellahin defend themselves with knives
The Ghibli from Tunis rolls and rolls and produces a rather strange nervous condition
And we hear Katharine's laugh
86
Almasy sits alongside Katharine, whose head is against his shoulder
He continues his story of winds
#
Which Mariners called the sea of darkness
Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood
Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake
Fiction
We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood
Go on
More
All true
Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised
87*
The sand has almost   the car on the exposed side, covering the windshield like snow, and encroaching onto the door of the protected flank
88*
Almasy is woken by sound of
He jerks up, waking Katharine in the process, and heaves against the door
He can't open it, and has to lean his feet against the passenger door, lying across Katharine, kicking it open
89*
By the time Almasy emerges from the car, the sand pouring into the cabin, '
Almasy waves, shouts, and then runs back into the car, finds his flare-gun, and high into the sky
Katharine is with him now, and they watch, helplessly, as the car bounces away from them, Madox a man on a mission
Katharine panics,
She speaks quietly, shocked
Our tracks, where are they
Almasy is preoccupied
He's gone back to their vehicle and returns with a shovel,
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around
(realizing what he's doing) Oh my God, the others
She kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand containing the three Bedouin
(during this) Could  ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book
should like to have them
should be honored
Of course
Is it, am  a terrible coward to ask how much water we have
(shoveling hard) Water
Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk
Not at all cowardly, extremely practical
(anxious at not uncovering the boys, egging himself on) Come on, come on
(then back to Katharine) There's also a plant - 've never seen it but 'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid
Find that plant
Cut out its heart
They hear , scrabbling, faint thumps
Almasy scrapes at the sand and they find the glass of the car
The angle of the cab, tilted up to the sky, has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open
Their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating
Almasy pulls the door and it cranks open

Katharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the Herodotus
It's full of ' , ,
She deciphers a page of his words and drawings
It's almost exclusively about her, the lines studded with

She reads, astonished, then looks at him as he and two of the three Bedouin circle the area of the cars in ever-widening circles, like water-diviners, like Kip searches for mines
Kamal is slumped against the front of the car
He's sick
Almasy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to shovel into the sand
He pulls out
Turns to Katharine and holds it triumphantly in the air

There's a small, weak fire
The group crouch around it
The boys talk noisily to Almasy
Kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering
Almasy gives him water, speaks to Katherine
Kamal is passing blood
He must have had some internal damage in the crash
He needs medicine
think we must risk the other flare
He gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge
This time the effect is dramatic with
Katharine comes up beside him
They wait, hope fading with the flare
(blank) Geoffrey's not in Cairo
(Almasy looks at her) He's not actually a buffoon
And the plane wasn't a wedding present
It belongs to the British Government
They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa
So  think he's in Ethiopia
In case you were counting on his sudden appearance
And the marriage - is that a fiction
There's a beat
Katharine has a hundred answers
No, the marriage isn't a fiction
The light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark
Suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, fireworks into the sky
Thank God
Oh, thank God
There's excited shouting from the two fit boys
They leap up and run towards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not come from Madox, but from an approaching
Almasy shouts to the boys for some identification
Do they know them
(squinting at the horizon) No, but  think  do
The Caravan slowly comes into focus

Katharine touches Almasy's arm - an almost imperceptible gesture
Am
in your book
think  must be
Almasy turns to her
He runs the blade of his arm across her neck - the sweat leaving a clear stripe
Fenelon-Barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses Almasy
- recollect your saying to ignore your bones but  assume you have no objection to my rescuing your companion
(to Katharine) Good evening, Mrs
Clifton
(accepting his handshake) Hello
- 'd like to introduce you to my camel - the most notable beast on earth
(to Almasy) understand you found some remarkable caves
goatskin bag of water is offered to Katharine
She drinks and hands it to Almasy
- Paintings of swimmers
Remarkable

Almasy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges from the cab, and pulls Katharine's belongings from the trunk, then holds open the door for her
As she walks towards the hotel, he hands her bag to a porter
Katharine is stung
Will you not come in
No
Will you please come in
(a beat) Mrs
Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted
Don't
believe you still have my book
Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then disappears

Almasy lying on a camp bed, face down
The walls are covered with maps, enlargements of photographs
fan whirs over his kit which is spread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor
An ineffably male room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing the gloom
Almasy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked off below his jutting feet
There's   at the door
Almasy sleeps
Another
third
He's roused from the dead
Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the knocking continues
It's Katharine
She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress
She walks past him into the room
He closes the door
She turns
He  before her, head at her thighs
She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go to his head
You still have sand in your hair
She starts to  on his head and shoulders, violently
He pulls back, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face
She kneels and covers his face with kisses
He pulls blindly at her dress and it across her breasts

Almasy is in the bath
Katharine, wearing his dressing gown, pours in a jug of steaming water
Almasy leans over the rim of the bath
He's sewing, carefully repairing the torn dress
'm impressed you can sew
Good
You sew very badly
You don't sew at all
woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it
Close your eyes
(laughs) That makes it harder still
She pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his head, then begins to shampoo his hair
Almasy is in heaven
The biggest smile we have seen from him
She continues to massage his scalp
When were you most happy
Now
When were you least happy
(a beat) Now
Okay
And what do you love
Say everything
What do  love
love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs
The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths
She rinses his scalp, then slips off the robe and    , covering his neck and shoulders in kisses
What else
Marmite - addicted
Baths - not with other people
Islands
Your handwriting
could go on all day
(a beat) My husband
Almasy nods
What do you hate most
lie
What do you hate most
Ownership
Being owned
When you leave, you should forget me
She freezes, pulls herself away, out of the bath, looks at him, then across the face
She picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it, and walks, dripping, out of the room

To the Patient it's as if Katharine is walking out of his wall
He sighs with pain, then looks away to where Hana has fallen asleep on the bed, almost on top of him
He touches her
He speaks as if each word burns him
Could  ask you to move
'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets,  can't really bear the sheets moving over me
Sorry
(mortified, moving quickly) Yes, of course, 'm so sorry
Stupid of me
Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him
'm so sorry

Hana comes to the table, carrying a jug of water and a bowl
She's still sad
She unbuttons her dress, pulling it off her shoulder, begins to pour the water to cool herself against the night's pressing heat

Hana walks through the main
It's packed with the ruined bodies of the injured, swaddled in bloody bandages
Hana stops at a couple of beds, shares a word or two with the patients
She stops at another bed, leans over its occupant
His bandaged face is bloated and yellow
He's not breathing
She bends over him, his open eyes fixed in a glassy stare
No pulse
She snaps the triangular cardboard from his bed to indicate '
Then tenderly closes his eyes
,
Can't wait to have me dead
You bitch
He slaps her hand away
Slaps at the tubes going into his arm
Hana is absolutely shocked
But just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi- consciousness
Shaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes it again
He is in terrible pain
His face creased with anger
Now his hand is clutching at hers
She tries to soothe him
Try t be calm
Ssssshhh
Come on
Be calm now
Ssshhhh
Be peaceful
It's okay
It's okay
Now he has gone

The Soldier can just see them
He's going to die any minute
(whispering to Oliver) Is there anybody here from Picton
Picton
don't know
'd like to see somebody from home before  go
Hana can only really hear Oliver's end of this conversation, but the mention of Canada chills her, and she knows, now, not later, that Stuart is dead
(to Oliver) Why Picton
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier
The boy nods
(innocent) Where's your Stuart from
Somewhere near there, isn't it
(to Oliver) As him what company he's with
Oliver leans over, then turns to Hana
Third Canadian Fusiliers
Does he know a Captain McGann
The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver
He bought it
Yesterday
Shot to bits
The shells are getting closer
What did he say
(can't look at her) Doesn't know him
, Everybody is on the floor, struggling to get on a helmet
Hana lies down, the blood still leaving her, her helmet on
Oliver is next to her in the mud
Her heart is breaking
He's gone, hasn't he
No
He's - no
Oh God
Oh God
The shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief, but each explosion illuminates it for a moment

Caravaggio comes into the kitchen
Hana is slumped at the table, her back naked
The jug of water in front of her
She's sobbing, her shoulders heaving
Caravaggio approaches tentatively
Hana

Are you alright
(without raising her head) Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me
(soothing) 'll have some of your water
It's hot
She reaches for her blouse, wraps it around herself
Her face is read with weeping
(gently) You have to protect yourself from sadness
This is the thing 've learned
(drinking the water) You're in love with him, aren't you
Your patient
Do you think he's a saint or something
Because of the way he looks
don't think he is
'm not in love with him
'm in love with ghosts
And so is he
He's in love with ghosts
Who are his ghosts
Ask him
(he holds up his hands) What if  told you he did this to me
(stung) What
How could he have
When
'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know
It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk

Officers and Civilians walk the parameter
One of these, arriving, is Almasy

Katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with Christmas cake on it

No

Right

It's Christmas and it's all -  don't know - if you asked me 'd go home tomorrow
If you wanted
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war

It's mine now
heard your breathing and thought it might be rain

It's a folk song
Arabic
No, no, it's Hungarian
My daijka sang it to me

What's it about
(as if interpreting) It's a long song - Szerelem means love
and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool
For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what
And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave

You bastard,  was believing you

Sorry, is it all right 'm seeing this
Kip shrugs
My hair was long
At some point

You know - if you were ever around - we get water from the pump at noon
He continues to wash

Madox and Almasy are camped in one corner of  , hunched over their maps and papers and journals and clashing furiously over the site of the next part of the expedition
(pushing away his charts) And 'm telling you there's nothing there to explore
No, because you can't see from the air
If you could explore from the air life would be very simple
(he yanks up a map) Look
What is that
Is that a wadi
That whole spur is a real possibility
Which we've overflown twice
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy
(stabbing another location) And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura
Other readers look over at this unseemly skirmish
So - on Thursday you don't trust Bell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell couldn't draw a map, but on Friday he's suddenly infallible
Almasy is surprised by Madox' anger
And where are the Expedition Maps
In my room
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government
They're confidential
They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of
What's the matter with you
Don't be so bloody naive
You know there's a war breaking out
(he tosses a slip of paper onto the map, recites its message) This arrived this morning
By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939
129
Almasy and Madox walk down this busy and rather narrow street without pavements
Both of them somber
Why do they care about our maps
What do we find in the desert
Arrow heads, spears
In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa
(contemptuous) Own the desert
Almasy hesitates at a junction, clearly about to take leave of Madox
That place at the base of a woman's throat
You know - the hollow - here - does that have an official name
Madox looks at him
For God's sake, man - pull yourself together
130
-
The -  is just beginning its evening programme
and we date the event to April 1939
Stories of imminent war jostle with images of Merrie England
Village greens, sporting victories, Cruft's Dog Show
Alone among the necking couples - mostly soldiers with their Egyptian girlfriends - in an otherwise empty block, is Katharine
She's waiting for Almasy
comes over to Katharine's row and settles a couple of seats away from her
Beggin your pardon, miss, but have you got a lighter
Katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen
An item about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and
The stars do their stuff
The soldier moves a seat nearer
(leering) love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she
Fuck off
What
You heard me
The Soldier slinks off, muttering
Katharine is wretched
She sits head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about duplicity, sordid assignations
Almasy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily large across the screen
Sorry
They watch the screen
Katharine is weeping
Almasy doesn't understand
He puts his arm around her
can't do this,  can't do this any more
131*
man walks round with    - announcing that the Park is closing
He turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages
Almasy and Katharine sit stiffly on a bench
They don't speak
Almasy puts his hands to his head, he rubs his shoulders
The lights are gradually being extinguished around them
Finally, Katharine gets up
'd better get back
(she keeps him away with a hand) Say goodbye here
'm not agreeing
Don't think 'm agreeing, because 'm not
They stand, awkward
Katharine rehearses her position
The bell clangs
just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him
Don't go over it again, please
He takes her hands, lays his cheeks into them, then releases them, gets up, walks away
She walks towards the gate
He calls after her
Katharine - He walks towards her, his smile awful
just wanted you to know
'm not missing you yet
She nods, can't find this funny
You will
You will
Then she turns sharply from him and catches her head against the gatepost, staggers at the shock of it, then hurries away

Hana sits with the English Patient - the room shuttered against the morning light
His breathing is noticeably worsening, a shudder of a breath, the shallow rise and fall of his chest perceptible
Hana frets, touches his wrist, feeling for the pulse
'm still here
You'd better be
Don't depend on it
Will you
That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right
She squeezes his hand, suddenly overwhelmed
(brightly) 've been talking to Caravaggio - my research assistant - there's meant to be a ghost in the Cloisters
can join him
There's some kind of noise from the garden
Muffled shouts
It's the boy
Hana goes to the window, opens the shutters
The day pours in
132A*
Hana sees Kip - barely visible - standing at the far perimeter of the garden in the olive groves,     , run from his foot in all directions as if he'd trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb
133
Hana appears at the edge of the Olive groves and hurries towards Kip, who hasn't moved
He shouts warning her
Go to the left
Keep to the left
There are mines and trip wires everywhere
Hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long grass
He shouts, doesn't want her close
Get Hardy
He's on the other side of town
In the hills
Get him to hurry
She keeps coming, can see that he needs her
It's okay - 'll help
Please
The mines, the wires, there's a trick
Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them
What do  do
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away,  think at least to give me a chance
have to work out which one to cut before  fall over
So  follow the wires
You get Hardy
follow the wires
She kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web
Don't touch them
She follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back to Kip's foot
Then she finds another one leading off to a second mine some thirty metres away
Why would anyone do this
've done this
've had to do this
Then Hana's suddenly tense
Give me a second
She turns and tiptoes     , straight to what had seized her attention
Kip is appalled
What are you doing
Hana
Heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, -
Hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal
She turns, holding the protesting animal in triumph
She has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise
She goes sideways to the safe zone - setting down the animal
Then she's back with Kip
He's seething
She is strangely elated
What is this business with you and explosives
Do you think you're immune
promise you that was the right thing to do
He's my good luck
(she gets the pliers from his belt, and hands them to him) Now cut
This one
(she indicates the wire) hope we don't die
Okay
Get away from here
Quick
'm not scared
So many people have died around me
But  would be a shame for us
(shrugs) don't feel like being shy
You must get away
Before  cut
'm not cutting if you're here
He's struggling
He's going to topple over if he cuts
Actually, you can't cut, can you
You'll fall over
Give me the pliers
No
But he hands them over
Kiss me
Before  cut
Just in case
Don't talk
Check again
Lie flat and then cut
Hana checks, lies down
He bends as close to the ground as he dares ,
134
'
The Patient lies in bed
He's agitated by the silence '
He tries to shout, a croak which quickly reduces him to coughing and breathlessness
Hana
Hana
Kip
Hana
He tries to move
He can't
He's frantic
, as someone hurtles up the stairs
It's Hana
She's ashamed to have forgotten him
She rushes to him
'm sorry
forgot you'd be worrying
We're all safe
It was a mine, but not the mine
Nobody's hurt
'm sorry
She calms him
He's exhausted
His eyes shine
135
Hana clings onto Kip as the   hares along the circling road
She has her arms around his waist
His head turns to her for a second and she smiles
136
Kip and Hana have been detained at a
Kip is being questioned at a sentry post, his papers over-thoroughly inspected and accompanied by several meaningful glances at Hana, who waits, standing by the motorcycle
One of the  saunters over and returns her papers
And you're definitely traveling with him of your own free will
Yes
(clearly disapproving) Just wanting to be sure
And he's taking you to church
(deadpan) Yes
We're going to a funeral
cow has died
And in his religion they're sacred
The Soldier isn't sure what to make of this
He signals to his companion who returns Kip's papers
Kip walks back to the motorcycles
He says nothing
He kicks the starter
Hana gets on, slides her arms lovingly around him

The bike, headlights on, crosses a bridge
Kip has strapped on his crimson emergency light as they sail along the winding crest of mountain ridge that is a spine down Italy

Kip steers the motorbike into the deserted
They dismount and Kip starts to unbuckle his bulging satchel and unload the panniers
Hana still doesn't know what's in store and looks questioningly at Kip as he walks up to the door of the

They enter the Church
It's in almost total darkness It's magnificent
Kip holds the flare, crimson on one arm, green pouring up from the other
Hana walks behind him, still perplexed
There is ,        , Kip has appeared through    high in the church, literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are momentarily visible
He flings a rope over the rafters
Now Kip circles Hana with the rope,    across her waist and shoulder
He lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before disappearing
Hana stands holding the flare
She can't see Kip, can only hear him scrambling

He runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters
He collects the other end of the rope which is attached to Hana
Holding onto it, he just

Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through space, coming to rest about three feet from the  , painted by Piero Della Francesca
Hana's flare makes a halo around her head
Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and causes Hana to  to the right
She lets out a giddy laugh, exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant - faces, bodies, angels
Kip guides the rope as if they were making love, which in a way they are
Hana arrives, hovering, in front of She's overwhelmed
She reaches out to touch the giant neck of the sad Queen
Kip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope
Hana's face is full of tears
He smiles, holds her

Caravaggio is with the Patient
He sits in the window
Fiddles with the bandages of his hands
There was a general who wore a patch over a perfectly good eye
The men fought harder for him
Sometimes think  could get up and dance
What's under your bandages
Caravaggio goes to him, holding out his hands, the bandage ends trailing
Hold the ends
The Patient holds them
Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages unraveling and unraveling

1942
Caravaggio, thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit, walks through the mangled corridors of British
Smoke is rising from buildings, the ominous scream of Stuka dive-bombers in the distance as the harbor is pounded, the steady thud of explosions is a place in the throws of dismantling itself
are visiting braziers manned by   who stoke the fires as boxes of papers are fed into them
hover in the air
142*
Caravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks
From one of them, a young woman, , kisses him, frowning at the chaos and the shelling
He's waiting for you
Some doors are open, revealing men and women in uniform urgently Caravaggio knocks at an office whose door is ajar and where the incumbent, -, is stripping the room of his personal possessions-  photographs, stone branches, a cricket bat
142a*
-
Caravaggio enters
- (barely looking up) What a bloody flap, eh
heard from Alexandria this morning - apparently no-one there is accepting British pounds
And if you pick up a telephone everybody's practicing their German
(holds up some gramophone records) What do you do - do you take these things
(then, awkward) Look, Moose, we need you to stay in Tobruk
bit of a short straw but the thinking is we'll be back -  mean, we will be back - but
and in the interim we need eyes and ears on the ground
lands nearby
The building shudders and plaster dust drops from the ceiling
Almost oblivious, the two men head out of the office
Fenelon-Barnes lugs the  last glimpsed in his tent by Almasy, until Caravaggio takes over
143*
Fenelon-Barnes and Caravaggio make their way down the stairs and to the entrance
We have 30, 000 troops in Tobruk
What are they going to be doing
- (continuing to pack) Giving Rommel a bloody nose
That's my suggestion
But did you hear the  last nigh
Tobruk is of no strategic importance - makes you wonder
is at the bottom of the stairs
She falls into step
- Jerry's got our maps you know
Swines
Before the war we helped them run about the desert making maps - and now they get spies into Cairo using our maps, they'll get Rommel into Cairo using our maps
The whole of the desert like a bus route and we gave it to them
Any foreigner who turned up - welcome to the Royal Geographic, take our maps
Madox went mad, you know - you knew Peter Madox
- after he found out he'd been betrayed by his friend
Absolutely destroyed the poor sod
Shot himself in a church in Dorset
Caravaggio opens the door, Fenelon-Barnes goes through
144*
The Fenelon-Barnes trunk is taken from Caravaggio and joins the pile of luggage and artifacts, which wait to be shipped out
- 'd like to get that bastard Almasy - settle the score, eh
That's my fantasy - said he, clearing out
Must have been a spy all along

She touches a couple of people in the line
They're horrified
Soldiers pull them away
Caravaggio doesn't look, stares straight ahead
An officer watches him , bolts for cover, vaulting the rubble which blocks one corner of the square
The  throws itself to the ground until the square has only standing soldiers and a running man

Shots pursue Caravaggio as he disappears behind the rubble, then bobs up again as he darts inside a blasted building
He clambers up some ruined stairs, heaves over the wall

Soldiers appear along the top of the building, shouting, rifles ready

Caravaggio is slumped at a table, There's   at another table in the corner of the room attended by a  with   working next to him
The room has stone walls which appear damp, and no windows
stand guard at the door
It's a horrible room
Caravaggio is trying to sleep, he's unshaven, and pasty-looking
His interrogator, Muller, seems incredibly tired and aggravated
He's on the phone
(in German) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
He slams down the phone and comes back to the table
David Caravaggio
No
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937
(barely with humor) keep explaining
You've got the wrong man
My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini
Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters,  think that is confusing you
Muller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file
Pulls out some photographs, starts spreading them out
Is this you
don't know
It is you
This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41
And so was this - August 41
And this -February 42
It's impossible
was buying or selling something
've been to Cairo many times
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies
Code-name Moose
rings again, is answered
The Clerk calls to Muller who gets up, irritably
Caravaggio addresses the room
Could  have a doctor
am passing blood
must be bleeding internally
(to the clerk) Can you get a doctor
Look - (he spits onto the table, there's blood in his mouth) 'm leaking blood
(he indicates a Guard) He kicks me
He kicks me all the time
Nobody responds
Muller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch, negotiating time
The call finishes
(in German) He's asking for a doctor
(to Caravaggio) You want a doctor
Yes, 've been asking for weeks, a month,  don't know, also my leg was - We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse
nurse
Well, sure, a nurse is great
nurse
Great
Muller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up
Just then the telephone rings again
He hesitates
(in German) Leave it and get the nurse
The Clerk exits
The phone rings
The Stenographer is plagued by flies
Suddenly he slaps at one
(snapping) Why is there so much nose
can't hear myself think
(turns to Caravaggio) Look - give me something
So we can all get out of this room
name

(wiping his face) It's too hot
slept with the girl
've got a wife in Tripoli
girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble
The  comes in
She is Arab and her head is covered
'll tell you what 'm going to do
This is your nurse, by the way
She's Moslem, so she'll understand all of this
What's the punishment for adultery
Let's leave it at that
You're married and you were fucking another woman, so that's - is it the hands that are cut off
Or is that for stealing
Does anyone know
There's silence
Muller turns to Caravaggio
Well, you must know
You were brought up Libya, yes
Don't cut me
Or was it Toronto
(ashen) Don't cut me
Come on
Now the phone starts again
The  picks it up, there's a terse exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to interrupt Muller
Ten fingers
How about this
You give me a name for every finger - doesn't matter who
get something, you keep something
'm trying to be reasonable
Fenelon-Barnes, we could call that two names
(pauses, suddenly puzzled) Are thumbs fingers
(in  to the others) Is a thumb a finger
No response
Muller opens his palms to Caravaggio
get no help from these people
(in German) The telephone - Muller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down
an is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack- clack of the
At that moment, Muller suddenly becomes aware of what is happening
He turns on the Stenographer
(in German) What are you doing
(awkward, in German) That Geneva Convention
'm - Muller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor
You can't do that
Hey - come on
Muller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and produced  -
He hands it to the nurse, makes a line across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio
The nurse is extremely reluctant
Muller claps his hands, pushes her towards Caravaggio
Go
Hey
Go
Caravaggio is in terror
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus Christ
The guards come away from the door and press down on Caravaggio's shoulders to prevent him from moving
The nurse, grim-faced, approaches, kneels at the table
(as she prepares to cut) Listen, 'll give you a name
What name did you say
knew them
promise
Please - please
And then he    and jerks up, carrying the guards and the table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off balance
He falls to the floor,   , blood everywhere, the table on top of him
The   is continuing outside, the , the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform
Cut the other thumb
He stabs at his own right thumb
This one
Come on
The nurse, horrified, shakes her head
Muller snatches the razor from her and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio
One Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in half-nelson, others holding his legs, while Muller approaches
Caravaggio can't move
He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles him
His eyes are streaming with tears
Now Muller is at his other hand, and the  of pain again lifts Caravaggio to his feet,       , his mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of the table  their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his knees like a gored bull and
148
, and Caravaggio comes round
His eyes open and then his face spasms with pain
He looks down at his ruined hands, then realizes he's alone on the floor of the room, the papers still scattered, the table on its side
He gets up and staggers out of the open door and up the stairs
149*
The corridor is deserted, but the body of a   sprawls on the stairs leading up to daylight
Outside Caravaggio can hear fighting
150*
Caravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building
Grey and yellow gusts of smoke and the rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire accompany him, and there's the sound of vehicles screeching and people shouting nearby, but no visual clues as to what's happening
' , 151*
'
Caravaggio stands in front of the bed, holding up his   to the Patient, like a man surrendering - two flaps like gills where his thumbs were
The Patient reaches out to take his hands and gently lowers them
Caravaggio finds his bandages, start to wrap them back round his fists
The man who took my thumbs,  found him eventually - he's dead
The man who took my photograph,  found him too - that took me a year
He's dead
Another man took that man across the desert to Cairo
Now  intend to find him
The     approaching the Monastery, its growl
Caravaggio goes to the window and watches as Kip and Hana arrive

Last seen at the Troops Christmas party, the   has been transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band
The Almasy/Madox team is assembled for
They are waiting for Almasy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty
He is very late
And then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing
He practically dances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position opposite Katharine
He bows to Lady Hampton
believe 'm rather late
(ignoring the drama of this entrance) Good, we're all here
toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface
The International Sand Club
(raising his glass) Misfits, buggers, fascists, and paedophiles
God bless us every one
The others drink, trying to ignore his mood
Oops
Mustn't say International
Dirty word
Filthy word
His Majesty
Die Fuhrer
Il Duce
Sorry, what's your point
(ignoring the remark) And the people here don't want us
Are you kidding
The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials
(to an embarrassed Fouad) - isn't that right
Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood
(to his host, Sir Hampton) Isn't that right
Ronnie Hampton shrugs
They're all very uncomfortable
Almasy glares at Clifton
What's my point
(standing up) Oh
've invented a new dance - the Bosphorus Hug
Anybody up to it
Madox
'Ag
Come on 'Aggers
' Let's eat first
Sit down
The Band is now playing Manhattan - Almasy, without missing a beat, begins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he knows
He lurches around
Katharine can't look at him
We'll bathe at Brighton, the fish we'll frighten when we're in
your bathing suit so thin will make the shellfish grin, fin to fin
--  Those were the words - actually - before they were cleaned up
Could be a song for you, Mrs
Clifton - (a perfect English accent) #
Madox gets up and pulls Almasy into his chair, taking charge
Look, either shut up, or go home
(darkly) Absolutely right, shut up
Lashings of apologies all round
153*
'
Later, now
We see Katharine dancing with Rupert Douglas, enjoying herself
Bermann is there and even Madox jogging and grinning foolishly
Clifton looks at Katharine who, as the dance ends, excuses herself to go to the cloakroom
Almasy hovers in the shadows, unseen
154*
'
Katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is suddenly confronted by Almasy, tortured and out of control
Why did you hold his collar
What
(mimicking her inflection) What
What
That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for
Would you let me pass
Is he next
Do you drag him into your little room
Where is it
Is this it
Don't do this
've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there
How can you ever smile
As if your life hadn't capsized
You know why
He tries to hold her
She resists Dance with me
No
Dance with me
want to touch you
want the things which are mine
Which belong to me
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything
Is that what you think
Some women, flushed with dancing, turn the corner on the way to the Ladies Room
They collect Katharine in their train and leave Almasy to fall back into the shadows

Hana sits with the Patient
His eyes are full of tears
He opens them, sees her, watching over him
He's embarrassed
Why don't you go
(wiping his eyes) You should sleep
Would you like me to
He nods
She gets up, touches his hand, then leaves
156*
,
Hana leaves the room, then turns and sees    on the floor, it's made from a   and oil
She bends to it curiously, then sees a second lamp half-way down the stairs, then a third further down
She smiles in the light, then follows the trail
157
In the Cloisters      , like tiny cat's eyes
As they reach the hopscotch chalk marks, they outline the squares
Hana  and then follows the light, disappearing round a corner
158
Hana comes through into the stables
The lamps lead her, then they stop
She peers into the shadows
(/) Hana
She turns to the voice
He steps out of the darkness
(happy ) Kip
And he goes to her
159
Hardy knocks cautiously on the door of the stables
Eventually Hana opens the door
was looking for the Lieutenant Singh
He's sleeping
Only we have to go to work
'll tell him
What is it
Is it a mine
bomb
At the Viaduct
She closes the door, then reappears
Does he have to go
Pardon me
What if you couldn't find him
(Hardy's bewildered) Sergeant, not today, please
Not this morning
Kip comes to the door, winding his turban
What's happening
Am  needed
'm afraid so, sir
Kip hurries to his tent
Hana follows him
Don't go
'm frightened
can love a coward,  can't love another dead man
This is what  do
do this every day
And he's ready, Hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles
He gets on his, and they're away, Hana hardly able to look
160
Hardy supervises
The bombs huge - 2, 000 lbs, and protrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk into a pool of sludge at the base of the viaduct
Kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud, grunting in disgust
Warily, he touches his huge opponent, feeling the condition of the case
He wipes the metal
Reveals a serial number, calls it out to Hardy, who's perched on the bank
Serial number - -1P2600
He's hypnotized by the number: -1P: a bomb with his name on it
161
Hana cycles along on Caravaggio's bicycle
comes roaring up behind her, then a second and a third, loaded up with people, citizens and soldiers, and children, waving flags and gesticulating
She lets the metal circus go by
162
Back in the shaft, Kip works away, his fingers shaking with the cold from the oxygen he's using to freeze the fuse
Suddenly there's a The ground is , and the bomb slips horribly
Kip    helplessly as if trying to stop a man from falling, instead it falls on him pushing him into the sludge
Hardy
Hardy
What's happening
163
The  are rumbling towards the Viaduct
start sounding
, below, bellows at his men above for explanation
Corporal
Dade
Tanks, sir
Don't know what it's about
God only knows
(incredulous) What is this - a bloody carnival
Stop them
Three Sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming procession
They wave their orange flags, the tanks wave back wit their flags - Stars and Stripes, Union Jacks
Now  are ringing out
In the shaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from under the bomb, the oxygen spurting everywhere, all over his clothes, hissing on the surface of the water
Hardy bends into the shaft, heedless of his own safety
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last
Go away
Yessir
This is making me incredibly angry
He rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips them through the tiny gap
His hand touches the casing and the freeze his hand
He jerks back,    into the sludge, cursing
Now he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to find the pliers
Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help
The seconds run out as Kip grovels in the mud
Totally submerged, he suddenly comes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and cuts
There's a snip
Then nothing
Then Kip laughs at Hardy
Kiss me
Hardy is already at the winch, hauling it up
Kip can hardly clip on the halter - his hands numb and burned
As the pulley jerks he just clings on, rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out of a bog
The other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site
Great elation on their faces
Get a blanket
(not getting attention) Dade
Get the Lieutenant a blanket
It's over, Sarge
It's over
Jerry's surrendered
(to Kip) Sir, congratulations
Kip shakes his hand
Kip shakes Hardy's hand
Congratulations
And now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the are there and the victory  celebrations begin
Kip's blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around his shoulders

She shouts with relief from the top of the bridge

The gramophone plays Frank Sinatra
Kip sits in the window, the shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the music, sucking out of his condensed milk
Elsewhere there is an open bottle of cognac, some wine
The Patient has a beaker of wine
Caravaggio is dancing with Hana
Kip - come and dance with me (a sly wobble of the head) Yes
Later
Caravaggio swirls past the Patient - nodding at the cognac
Have a drink
've had a drink
Fatal
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know - Very true

tiny  where the Sappers and the Villagers are having their own, more raucous, Victory Feste
There are accordions, there's dancing, and there's , stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: inside a heart, clambering up the He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the he has in his mouth
, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant
He's drunk and slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with a great splash, to much hilarity
166
'
Hana and Caravaggio are still dancing
The music has stopped
Caravaggio changes the record
Hana goes to Kip for a second, beaming, before Caravaggio has snatched her away again
The Patient taps along to the music
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug
Never heard of it
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club
(cryptic) What
You and Madox
Or you and Katharine Clifton
(a small laugh) What
There's a muddled thud in the distance, Kip's ears prick up
He glances for an instant out of the window
(anxious, of the noise) What was that
She is spinning with Caravaggio
When she comes round again, Kip has gone

1945
Kip's motorbike skids into the tiny
Dade and  are presiding as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck
The shattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give some clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm
, young and quite striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the doors of the ambulance
salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know what happened
Booby trap
They was running up the Union Jack, sir, up off that statue - It just went off
Should have been me
It was my idea but Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir, him and Blackler
Kip goes to the ambulance
Spalding tries to stop him
Sir - you don't want to look
Kip steps into the back of the ambulance, bends over both bodies, does look, then comes out, past the weeping girl
Who's that girl
His fiancee, sir
(astonished) Hardy's
Kept it a bit dark
168
Kip has pulled out all of Hardy's gear
Now he starts on the tent
Hana comes out into the step
Kip turns, his eyes brimming, sees her, sighs, then turns back and kicks at the pegs, collapsing the tent
Now he's trying to fold a shirt
Hana takes it from him
She folds it
Then together they start to fold the tent, Kip orchestrating, not wanting to talk
Finally, Kip looks at Hana, stiff with emotion
was thinking yesterday - yesterday
- the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England
couldn't even say what that was
We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some - (incredulous) he was engaged to a girl in the village
- mean - (looks at Hana) and us - he never once
He didn't ask me if  could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - don't even know what 'm talking about
You loved him

Caravaggio, reading Dante aloud in Italian, smoking, walks over to the window, looks out

Hana is approaching Kip's tent, carrying a light
She ducks inside the tent and the light disappears

'
Caravaggio turns back into the room, towards the Patient, still reading
170
'
Hana lies over Kip, unraveling his turban, slowly, sensual
If one night  didn't come to the tent, what would you do
try not to expect you
But if it got late and  hadn't shown up
Then 'd think there must be a reason
You wouldn't come to find me
(Kip shrugs) That makes me never want to come here
But she continues unraveling the turban
Then  tell myself he spends all day searching, in the night he wants to be found

1939
The Expedition Team is packing up the Basecamp
Madox and Almasy are loading things into the plane
,   and others work at the cars
Had a letter from my wife
The wisteria is still out, which 'm looking forward to
She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever
Wrong coast should have thought, still
Right
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow
'm going to do what can, but
And 'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini
So now you can say  told you so
told you so
We didn't care about countries
Did we
Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans
None of that mattered, did it
It was something finer than that
Yes
It was
Thanks for the compass
'll look after it for you
(shrugging this off) When's Clifton picking you up
Tomorrow afternoon
Don't worry
'll be ready
'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis
So if you need it
hard to know how long one's talking about
We might all be back in a month or two
Madox kneels and takes    , puts it into his pocket
He throws his haversack into the plane then turns
Almasy puts out a hand
This is a moment of great emotional weight for them both, conducted as if nothing were happening
have to teach myself not to read too much into everything
Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all
Goodbye, my friend
They shake hands
May God make safety your companion
(a tradition) There is no God
(smiles) But  hope someone looks after you
Madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his throat
In case you're still wondering - this is called the supasternal notch
Almasy nods, goes to the propeller
Come and visit us in Dorset
When all this nonsense is over
(then shrugs) You'll never come to Dorset
The plane roars into life
Almasy watches it taxi away - then heads back to continue with his packing up
172*
'
The Patient's stertorous breathing, each intake accompanied by a small noise, a note, suddenly stops
Then steadies again
He appears to be alone
173
Kip is in the tent, looking out of the flap, waiting for Hana
174*
Kip walks in looking for Hana
174a*
'
Kip enters, sees Hana is not with the Patient, hears his uneven breathing, then goes out
From the shadows of the room, shifts position
He's slumped on the floor, staring at the man prone in the bed
174b*
'
Into her bedroom, Kip can't find her there either
He turns to go, walking down the wooden stairs, until her voice stops him in his tracks
She's in the shadows of the eaves
Sometimes  need you to find me

'
The Patient's eyes open to see Caravaggio at the morphine
Hana tells me you're leaving
(preparing the injection) There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know 'm allergic to courtrooms
We shall miss you
He delivers the injection
The Patient sighs
Caravaggio takes off his jacket
pistol is stuck in his waistband
The Patient sees it
So,  come across the Hospital Convoy (holds up the syringe) was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat - (he administers his own injection, using his teeth grip the sleeve) how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - (picks it up) #
full of letters and cuttings, and then knew it must be you
Me
'd seen you writing in that book
At the Embassy in Cairo, when had thumbs and you had a face
And a name
see
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters
He took some pretty good photographs - saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression
And you thought you'd come and settle the score
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing
had to get back to the desert
made a promise
The rest meant nothing to me
What did you say
The rest meant nothing to me
There was a result to what you did
It wasn't just another expedition
(holds up hands) It did this
If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died
Thousands of people did die, just different people
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them
(a bitter laugh) Is that what you thought
That betrayed the British
The British betrayed me
The British betrayed me

Almasy sits on a ridge transferring map of information from his Herodotus onto a sheet of paper
He looks up at the sound of Clifton's approaching Steerman
He folds up the map and sticks it inside one of Clifton's   and lodges it between the rocks
176a*
Clifton is flying the  up to Gilf Kebir
From the air it's possible to make out Almasy scrambling down from the ridge towards where the stones indicate a landing area, carrying the last of the materials from the Cave of Swimmers
Almasy waves in recognition and welcome
177
Almasy watches as the plane drops towards him, shielding his eyes against the sun
the plane bounces along the runway, not quite landing
Almasy continues packing the equipment
Almasy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly He's completely vulnerable, nowhere to run
He dives at the ground , the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the prostrate Almasy
He gets to his feet and starts to run towards the wreckage
blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire
Almasy pulls away the debris to find   - ,  ,
He tries to move him, and in the process reveals, to his horror, ,   ,
He's frantic
Katharine
Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here
(eyes rolling, an incredible weariness) can't move
can't get out
Almasy starts to pull at the wreck around her
- Why did he bring you
surprise, he said
Almasy inspects Clifton, tries to find a pulse
The smoke circles around them
Katharine looks at her husband
Poor Geoffrey
He knew
He must have known all the time
He was shouting -  love you, Katharine, love you so much
Is he badly hurt
His neck is odd
Almasy puts his arm around Katharine to try and pull her clear
She can't stand the pain
Please don't move me
It hurts too much
We've got to get you out of here
It hurts too much
(can't bear to hurt her) know, darling, 'm sorry
The smoke thickens
He pulls - hard - the pain from which causes Katharine to gasp, then pass out
They slip haphazardly to the ground, cushioned a little by the sand
He lifts her gently into his arms and carries her from the danger of the place, then turns and runs back
Almasy dashes into the fire, disappearing into the smoke before emerging with Clifton over his shoulder, fireman's-lift style
178
He has          and emerges from the near the familiar cleft in the rock, struggling with the exertion of the climb as they approach the Cave of Swimmers
He has a large water bottle slung around his neck and a haversack, and is loaded like a pack horse
Katharine opens her eyes
(whispering) Why did you hate me
What
Don't you know you drove everybody mad
Don't talk
(gasping) You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk
They stagger on
He suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck
It's saffron, leaking from a silver  which hangs from a black ribbon
(overwhelmed) You're wearing the thimble
Of course
You idiot
always wear it
've always worn it
've always loved you
Almasy  as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with the pain of it
They approach the Cave
179*
Almasy comes through in shadows, carrying Katharine, blocking out the light that pours into the entrance of the cave
Once inside, he sets her down incredibly gently, makes a bed of blankets and the parachute
He turns on his flashlight
It's so cold
know
'm sorry
'll make a fire
'll be back
(panicking suddenly) Don't leave me
'm just going to find things for the fire
179a*
Almasy returns with the stocks of   the Expedition had cached
As he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting across the walls
Shall we be all right
Yes
Absolutely
(with a laugh) Oh dear
(as he works) Listen to me, Katharine
You've broken your ankle and 'm going to have to try and bind it
think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe
'm going to have to walk to El Taj
Given all the traffic in the desert these days should bump into one army or another before  reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel
And then 'll be back and we'll be fine, and 'll never leave you
The fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her
Do you promise
wouldn't want to die here
wouldn't want to die in the desert
've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns
Very English
And  know exactly where want to be buried
In our garden
Where grew up
With a view of the sea
So promise me you'll come back for you
promise 'll come back
promise 'll never leave you
And there's plenty of water and food
You can have a party
He kisses her tenderly
Pulls out his  and lays it beside her
Then he puts down the
And a good read
(of the flashlight battery) Don't waste it
Thank you
(clouds over) Will you bury Geoffrey
know he's dead
'm sorry, Katharine
know
Every night  cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again
He's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife
As he starts to bind her wrist he gets her to talk, trying to distract her from the pain
Tell me about your garden
(tries to focus) Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France
The Devil's Chimney it was called - (he pulls tight on the binding) The Devil's Chimney,  don't know why
(he kisses her) Darling
My darling
180
He's dug a narrow trench, and now he goes to the body
Clifton's face is oil stained, bloody
Almasy takes his handkerchief and, pouring his precious water into it,  ' ' (/) Seventy miles, north - north west
had Madox's compass
man can walk in the desert as fast as a camel
That's about two and a half miles an hour

He slides and collapses as he misjudges a dune, gets up, stumbles on
(/) stopped at noon and at twilight
Three days there,  told her, then three hours back by jeep
Don't go anywhere
'll be back
182
He trudges on, his eyes opening and closing
He's singing to keep awake
Darktown Strutter's Ball
- 'll be down to get you in the taxi, honey
He does a little shuffle
Looks behind at the crazy trail of his footprints
182a*
vast flat expanse of dried salt lake
remorseless horizon
Almasy walks, checking the compass, squinting at the sun
then he sees a cloud of dust traveling across the horizon
It comes closer moving at great speed, reveals itself

Almasy lowers himself by an old rope down into a gully
He approaches a pile of stones and removes them to reveal a brackish pool of filthy water
He drinks, pouring water over his head, grimacing at the taste, but parched too

Almasy gets his first sight of the fortress town of   and sinks to his knees, in relief and exhaustion
Then he gets up and trudges towards the town
with a rifle in his hands appears
184a*
The Corporal brings Almasy into a square
young  appears from the shadows of his office
His  is parked in the shade
Good morning
Could  trouble you for some water
(registering the accented English) Yes, of course
(the Corporal has a water bottle, hands it to Almasy) So, golly, where have you come from
(gulping the water) desperately need a jeep
There's been an accident
see
(brain racing) No, 'm not thinking clearly -  need a doctor too, to come with me, can take this vehicle
'll pay, of course - and some morphine and
(calculating) Seventy miles -  can be back here by dusk
Do you have your papers, sir
What
If  could just see some identification
Am  not talking sense
-  forgive me, 'm, 've been walking, 've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers
am a member of the Royal Geographical Society
Right
And what's your name, sir
Count Laszlo de Almasy
The Officer is writing this down
glance at his Corporal
Almasy - would you mind just spelling that for me
What nationality would that be
Look, listen to me
woman is dying - my wife
- is dying seventy miles from here
have been walking for three days
don't want to spell my name, want you to give me this jeep
(writing) understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while  radio back to  - (snapping) No
Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep
Almasy sets on the Officer, hauling him by the lapels, but them immediately loses his balance
As he stumbles up he gets the stock of the Corporal's  across his head,
185*
Almasy, head pounding, is in the back of the jeep, chained to the tailgate
He's desperate
The Corporal is driving
(shouting hoarse) Hey
Hey
Stop this jeep
Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while 'm - Hey
Shut-up
Please -  beg you,  beg you,  beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake
Just stop, please, and listen to me
My wife is dying
Listen, Fritz, if  have to listen to another word from you 'll give you a fucking good hiding
Fritz
What are you talking about
Who's Fritz
That's your name innit
Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck
What's that supposed to be then, Irish
Almasy, berserk, starts to yank at his chains, screaming
Let me out, let me out, let me out - Katharine
Katharine
186
Katharine has been writing in the Herodotus
The torchlight
She shakes the torch
It  again
Then goes out
Absolute The sound of her trembling breath
187*
scuttles through the desert
187a*
Almasy is  to the metal grille of the goods compartment
He's lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell - some Arabs, some Italians
pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor, leaving behind    who sits on a packing case, with a rifle across his lap, reading a Penguin edition of Gulliver's Travels
Almasy is in complete despair to be on the train
He tries to move, but he's locked tight to the grille
He rattles the cuffs against the metal
Excuse me
(the Soldier looks up) also need to use the lavatory
You'll have to wait
(calls up the corridor) Sarge
Jerry wants to use the lav - says it's urgent
Where are we going, please
To the coast
Benghazi
Soon be there
Get a boat home
You'll be all right
'
The  returns
What's up
Cramps
It's urgent
Go on then - you take him
188
The Soldier pushes Almasy along the corridor
They arrive outside the lavatory
The Soldier is distracted for a split second
Enough for Almasy to   savagely in the stomach, winding him, then he in the head
He wraps his cuffs around the Soldier's neck and - yanking them together and twisting - produces a tiny, efficient and sickening snap
He finds the  to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and drags him into the empty lavatory
189
Almasy arrives at the rear of the train, passes the Kitchen carriage, where Arabs sweat over the boiler
He pulls open the back door only to surprise a , who's lolling casually, enjoying the sunset
Almasy with his stole rifle
He clambers over the guard rail and leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert sunset
190
Almasy, silhouetted against the evening sky, walks back down the track, from the dying Katharine Clifton, no way now of saving her
He is a tiny speck in the vast desert
His heart broken
He sinks to his knees in despair
191*
'
The Patient is exhausted
He has said aloud what has tortured him
His failure to save Katharine
He looks at Caravaggio
So yes
She died because of me
Because  loved her
Because had the wrong name
192
Kip is working at a '  in the Stables
He is heating pieces of metal
He has arranged his material on a bench - a bayonet, a rifle, a piece of bomb casting
Hana enters, goes up, hugs him from behind
What are you up to
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember
That was made out of the metal of ordinary things
want to make an ordinary thing out of guns
His bayonet is thrust into the forge
It's red hot
When  went to England  was amazed at what went on, the waste - 'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what  saw thrown away
should go to the house, get breakfast
The lamp was burning all night in his room
Caravaggio was there with him
She goes to kiss him
He is over the fire and protests
This is hot
(teasing him) Nya-nya-nya
193*
'
Caravagio is injecting the Patient with morphine
And did you never see Katharine
You never got back to the Cave
Yes,  got back there finally to keep my promise
To come back for her
And then of course  couldn't couldn't even do that properly
194
Kip hammers the metal into its new shape
He stops, distracted by something he's listening to on his crystal set
It's new he seems not to fully understand, about a bomb dropping on Japan Suddenly Kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing column of steam
195*
'
Caravaggio sits by the Patient
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it
Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog
thought  would kill you
You killed my friends, you ruined my hands
But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel
You can't kill me
died years ago
No, now  can't kill you
Kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the Patient and Caravaggio is taken by surprise
Kip - what are -
Stay out of this
Kip
looked up to you, Uncle
My brother always said  was a fool
Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them
What are you talking about
What have  been doing all this time
Do you know how many mines 've seen
- more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky
And now this
He approaches the bed
Caravaggio tries to intervene
Kip, listen - Kip sings the rifle at him,   to the floor
said keep out of this
He pulls of his earphones and rams them around the Patient's head, dropping the set onto the bed
The Patient listens, coughing
Can you hear
Can you hear what they're celebrating
listened to you, Uncle
Sitting at your feet - always sitting at somebody's feet - trying to learn
The right way to hold a teacup, otherwise you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie - as if everything can be explained in terms of a cricket bat and an accent
Kip - Kip
- it's not even my name because you can't say it
Kirpal Singh Bhuller is my name
Hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees
Well, then ask him his name
(getting in between Kip and the Patient) What's happened
Kip
What's happening
Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody
They're excited
They're happy about destroying a whole city
Would they do that to a White Man's City
Never
(pulling off the earphones) Go on, do it
don't need to hear any more
Kip, listen, he lost everything because he wasn't English - Jesus
- shoot me, 'm more English than he is
Kip levels the gun at the Patient
Then breaks it open, throws it down on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay
Hiroshima
and from different voices - It was beautiful
just beautiful
Bang
the biggest bang you ever saw
196
'
Hana approaches
Kip is inside the tent, the flap zipped
She sees his shadow move, then freeze as she calls his name
It's like a confessional
The flap between them, the man in shadows, Hana crouched, forlorn
Kip
Kip
It's me
(no response) Why
It's another bomb
However big, what's the difference
There've been so many bombs
What about Coventry
What about Dresden
Where were those cities
(no response) don't understand
Let me come in
The shadow doesn't move
Hana is at a loss
197
'
The Patient becomes aware of something in the room, opens his eyes, squints into the darkness and sees   hovering against the wall
He's in the Cave, he thinks, he's seeing the painted figures moving, he's seeing the Swimmer
- bare chested, no turban, hair loose - stands in the shadows at the foot of the Patient's bed
198
'
Kip comes into the room
Hana sits in the corner
She is nervous of him, his look, his intensity
Will you come with me
Of course
When
mean home
India
Kip
- (interrupting this) know - here  am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman
Is that what you think
Is that what you think  think
It's what 've learned
'm thinking about your heart, not your skin
And how to reach it
And that  don't think  can
bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb thought would ruin us
She stands, goes to him
've clung to you
've clung to you
Kip
Life  a raft
(clinging to her) Then come with me
199
Next morning and Kip has attached what he was making in the forge - - to the pump
Now he works it, producing a steady stream of water
His motorbike is against the wall
He goes to it
Caravaggio is watching
He hugs Kip, wrapping his arms around the boy like a bear

You feel she might jump on the seat behind him
But she doesn't

'll always go back to that church
So one day we'll meet

Hana comes in carrying  and sets them down on the table next to a clutch of
She picks up the hypodermic to prepare his injection

The chill of the cave has preserved her
She could be asleep
She clutches the Herodotus

He's terribly cold, exhausted
He slips underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes
'm so tired

She shivers

He gets up into the , tentatively finds his balance, then starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence - along the long thin line of stone
The children watch intently
He turns and bows
(/) bodies we have entered and swum up like rivers, fears we have hidden in like this wretched cave

Hana walks across the cloisters, passing the chalked hopscotch squares, leaving it all behind
Then she stops, bends, retrieves   , keeps going

'
across her brow,  on her eyelids,  on her lips
He presses his cheek to hers, smoothes her hair
(/) want all this marked on my body
We are the real countries, not the boundaries drawn on maps with the names of powerful men

Hana comes out to the truck, carrying her small bundle
Caravaggio effects some introduction, beginning with the woman driver, Gioia
She and Caravaggio smile like lovers
Hana - this is Gioia
Gioia smiles, shakes her hand
Then Hana meets the others - Gioia's brother and wife, their children
She smiles at them
Buon' giorno
She can take you as far as Florence
can get in the back
And she clambers up, sits down between the children
They exchange some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away
Hana takes one final look at the Monastery as it disappears around the bend and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck

Almasy comes out of the cave, carrying the bundle of Katharine in his arms, wrapped in the silks of her parachute
(/) know you will come and carry me out into the palace of winds, the rumors of water
That's all 've wanted - to walk in such a place with you, with friends, on earth without maps

growls and complains into the air

:
Almasy obliterated by goggles and helmet
Katharine behind him, slumped forwards as if sleeping
Almasy banks across the plateau of the Gilf Kebir and glances down
In a ravine is a sudden
He is mesmerized
And then it's gone and he passes into the earth without maps - the desert - as it stretches out for mile after mile
(/) The lamp's gone out and 'm writing in the darkness
Almasy, the English Patient, begins to sing - Szerelem, Szerelem - until that also fades and is replaced by the woman's tender lament heard at the beginning of the film, singing for all that has been lost
The sound of gun fire
