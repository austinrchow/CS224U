- 2 It's a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon
Celeste and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to "Love Rhino," the song heard under the montage
Jesse drives while Celeste is on her Blackberry
Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a hooded sweatshirt
Celeste is wearing all black workout gear
She is always wearing all black
'm a Love Rhino
Don't worry `bout me, 've Dont' worry `bout me, 've got a enough love for got enough love, for the two the
(her Blackberry rings) us
Oh please
oh shit,  gotta take this
Turn it down
(') () 'm a Love
Jess, turn it down, seriously
She playfully slaps him
He turns it down
little
(') () Hello
Hi
With Jesse, running errands
(to Jesse) Turn it down
More
(back to the phone) Yeah, can do it now
No, it'll be fast, right
(To Jesse) Hey,  have to give a quick sound bite for the New York Times, so no noise please
For a second
Maybe
may have an important call coming in too, so
They both know he has no important call coming in
(on the phone) Okay
Ready
This year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort
Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of them
(') () Jess, just go around him
(To the phone) Sorry
() 3
(') () Consumers will be less likely to go out for entertainment
While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored
He starts looking through the middle console
He finds something melted tube of Chapstick
Ew
Ooh, a cigarette
Jesse lights the cigarette, takes a drag
Celeste looks at Jesse and signals to him, "Can  have a drag
" (') () Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual wear and cookbooks will see a huge spike in the market
He hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the window
What the shit
(she whispers to Jesse) Shhh
Phone call
(back to her call) That's enough of a blurb, right
Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror
He then looks at his teeth
Does this tooth look dark
Celeste just glares at him
Okay
Call me back if they need more
Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror
Like a little darker than the rest
Celeste waves her hand to quiet Jesse
Okay, thanks bye
(to Jesse) Can't you just sit still for two minutes
And we talked about this, no more smoking
wasn't smoking,  just found it
4
Come on
They drive by "Urban Light," Chris Burden's installation at the entrance of
They are rows of restored street lamps
Celeste sneers
(') () Really
Street lamps
No
Not doin' it
That is not art
think it's beautiful
beat passes
Then, Jesse pulls over
What are you doing
Why are you stopping
Well, your appointment is not until noon and this is that place with the deadstock vintage Italian fabric
thought it would be good for the guest room windows
Celeste is truly touched by the gesture
Oh wow
you are so thoughtful
Jesse smiles, proud of himself
(') () Thanks, Jess
She gives him a kiss on the cheek
Jesse's phone rings, he answers
Whassup, muthafucka
Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at fabric
: 3
-10   3 Celeste is getting back in the car with some fabric swatches
5
Jess, that place is insane
They have tassels that were manufactured for Mussolini's mistress
(covering the phone) Sorry, 'm on the phone
It's important
Okay then
Celeste sits quietly while Jesse is on his call
Really
just
don't know what to say
Thank you so much for calling me
Celeste throws her hands up in silent celebration
(whispers) Did you get the job
Jesse signals with his finger, "one minute
" Well, sometimes things are just meant to work out
Celeste looks at him with anticipation
(') () Okay, great
Great
Talk soon
Bye
Was that the job
Did you get the book job
No, but Celeste
He looks at her and grabs her hand, with tears in his eyes
(') () a swell came in last night
Out of the Northeast
It's overhead and it's glassy
What the fuck are you talking about
6
Malibu
The waves are peeling out there
Is this about surfing
You're talking about going surfing
Unbelievable
No, this is best part
Skillz got a hi-def digital camera and he's gonna film me
Oh, god
And we're gonna upload it on You Tube
'm not
What
Is that not awesome
No, yeah,  just thought it was about the Slate job you interviewed for
Oh yeah
No
They haven't called yet
But if they don't think 'm the right artist to illustrate the book, then it's not the right job for me
You know what  mean
absolutely do, yes
You are a wonderful artist
But at some point, you will show the world that one day
right
Hey, can  drop you at home now
Because  just missed a wave
Well
Wait
just missed another one
7
Yeah
Take me home, it's fine
: 4
-30   4 Jesse is dropping Celeste at home
Be back by six so you can shower
Why shower
Dinner with Beth and Tucker
Right, right
Have fun shredding your glassy peel
Aw, so wrong
Love you
Love you too
He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature " and " hand sign
She flashes it back
He zooms off
5
'- 5 Celeste and Jesse are on double date with , 30, petite, and full of energy and , 31, preppy in an indy way
These are their best friends from college
They're engaged
Did you end up going to see that band at Spaceland last week
Oh, The Injured Saint
Yeah, dude
They are real
You know what
They should be your wedding band
() 8
() They're loud but they're affordable
They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers
Now, they're amazing
You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding
Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available
The horn section is tight
It's already done
We got the best swing band in New England
Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod
told you, 'm not doing it
Swing is so late 90's, honey
Beth leans over a gives him a deep kiss
She knows how to work him
love you
We'll talk about this later
Celeste looks over the menu
Celeste and Jesse's next interaction is said with heavy, really bad German accents, which is hilarious--only to them
So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet zalad and zeh bolognese, riiiiiiight
Yawh
But  em murdering zeh creme brulee alooooone
No sharrrrring

Ve know zeh end of zat story
Yawh we doooooo
Yawh
9
Celeste and Jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a little too long
Then, there is a deafening lull in the conversation
Beth is buttering a piece of bread
She loudly drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her hands
can't do this
just can't
Celeste is genuinely concerned about her friend
Are you okay
Oh no
It's just not right
can't hold my tongue
We can't do this anymore
Honey, weddings are stressful, know all about it
But you guys we'll be fine
are fine
What the fuck are doing
Jesse and Celeste look at Beth in amazement
What do you mean
Yeah, what do you mean
What do  mean
You guys are not together anymore
This is not normal
You've been separated for and you hang out every day like nothing's wrong
It's fucking weird
Beth
No, Tucker, you think it's weird too
Speak up for yourself
It's weird
Let's not play charades anymore
10
No charades
We are separated and we're friends
You guys should be happy, all we did was fight before
Yeah, you guys should be thrilled about this
You'll never have to pick sides
Yeah, everyone's cool
Everyone is not cool
This is not cool
It's just not working for me, 'm sorry
Beth gets up and walks out
Celeste and Jesse sit there and stare at Tucker in silence
Bett iz zo angry
Yah, she iz uber angry
Yahhh
Yeah, you guys are weird
can't do this
It's fucked up
Tucker gets up and leaves
Jesse and Celeste watch him leave and sip their wine quietly
6
-- 6 Celeste drives and Jesse is in the passenger seat
He has a tube of Vaseline Lip Therapy
He is stroking it rapidly as if it were a penis
This is not the first time
, look
uhhhh
Celeste looks at him
She joins in
She reaches over and pushes in on the tube
Vaseline comes out of the top
This looks a lot like a penis ejaculating
Ahhhhh
Oh god
They both erupt in laughter
Even though this is the thousandth time they've done this stupid joke, it will always be funny
To them
11
(') () Beth and Tucker are crazy
Crazy
It's not weird that we hang out
Do you think it's weird we hang out
No, of course not
You're my best friend
Yeah you too
mean, we can't not hang out
The last time we didn't talk for longer than a week was in 10th grade when you went to Space Camp Canada
Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture
mean, the anti-gravity training was insane but  missed you
: 7
' - 10   7 Celeste and Jesse stand in the driveway of Celeste's house
There is a bit of a linger
Well, 'm exhausted
Me too
Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads towards the side gate with his key
It is now obvious that he is living in her guest house
Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight, how's the heat in there
Oh, it's fine
'm fine
He keeps walking
He turns again to Celeste
12
(') () Sorry 'm still living here
Times are tough and money's tight so you know
Jesse, please, you can stay here as long as you like
It's your studio
It's actually really nice to have you here
For me too
Oh, don't forget, the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning
So make sure your thingys, your sculptures, whatever
are out of the way
Got it
Night
Night
Love you
Love you too
8
' - 8 Celeste's morning symphony is under way
She sits in front of a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4 neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television tuned to
She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads the paper, watches , and surfs the internet
She is clearly a culture vulture
Jesse walks by outside his studio and does the " and " sign to Celeste
She does it back instinctively
Is it weird that we hang out so much
She shakes it off and titters
She's being ridiculous; it's fine
9
-  9 Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably
Again, in all black
She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty pre-work crowd
People are in some semblance of a line, waiting to order
13
Celeste spots a man in a business suit, taking advantage of the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of the line
He orders
Large coffee, please
Excuse me, sir
The business man pretends to not hear her
(') () Sir
You
She taps him on the arm
He turns around
(') () You do realize that you just cut in front of a lot of people
Oh
Sorry,  didn't know
Did you not
'm in a rush
So you did know
And everyone's in a rush, so
Other people in line are now paying attention
Celeste wants to let it go, but she can't
Well, she was looking at the pastries,  didn't think she was ready to order
Well, it's not just her
It's everyone behind her too
So, if you want to ask all these people if it's okay to cut in front of them because you are late, be my guest
Just don't assume that your time is more important than everyone else's
The business man gets his coffee
14
Have a nice day
(sotto) Prick
10
- 10 Pop Form Headquarters looks like the future
No walls, just large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other
Celeste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live satellite interview for
American culture is dying
We have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks and recycled movie franchises like Transformers
The more we consume crap, the more we want crap
: 11
11 Rachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio
Sounds utterly hopeless
Is there an upshot
think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity
People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs-- they will crave mental, spiritual and physical nourishment
It's back to basics
Wow, a lot to chew on
Well, thanks for being with us today
You're great, come back any time
For more on this gloomy but interesting subject, look out for trend forecaster, Celeste Martin's new book "Shitegeist," on bookshelves Monday
15
Thanks so much, Rachel
12
' - 12 , 40, Celeste's partner, gay but very straight, sharply dressed and bespectacled, sits at his desk
Celeste enters
So  had dinner with the drama club last night
Who's that
Tucker and Beth
They're such dicks
They left in protest because they think Jesse and  are being "unhealthy
" So judgy, right
We're fine
You're only done when you're done
Spare me the spiritual platitudes, Scotty
If we were gay,(she motions to Scott) no one would even question us being friends
You and Jesse are clearly not ready to let each other go
And there's nothing wrong with that
Yeah there's nothing wrong with that
mean, what do you think
Well, to be honest
Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts
Wait, we're signing Riley Banks
When were you going to tell me just trashed her on Rachel Maddow
Great
16
Yeah, that's why  wanted you to come in
It's a huge account
Scott, you and  built this company so we wouldn't have to take an account like Riley Banks
Well, you and  may not have a company if we don't take Riley Banks
Recession, remember
She's like a
soul-less hologram
She is releasing a new album
She wants us to do the branding and merchandising
We need to take this account
Ok
Fine
'm gonna go eat lunch
Celeste starts to heads out
If you are looking for my opinion, do think you should start dating
don't do dating
The right guy will show up
And 'm still on track for my 25 year plan
No one has a 25 year plan
Except for my mortgage company
First child at 33
Second at 35
Which means  will only be 56 at my eldest's college graduation
The bad news is that  may not be at my 4th grandchild's high school graduation
But that's okay, guess
'm fascinated with the mentally ill
17
've got time
'm not worried
Well, do me a favor and get your fuck on before you meet the next guy
Celeste looks at Scott in shock
What are you doing
Sorry,  was trying to be your saucy gay friend
It didn't feel good
Yeah don't
13
- 13 Jesse and , 32, another man-boy, in hip-hop gear, wait in a very, very long line of very, very hip people at 's trendiest new yogurt place
The economic climate is real bad, man
And  think my business is taking the hardest hit of all
It's brutal
And no one's talking about it
You sell pot
Not for long, dude
Have you been to those weed pharmacies
They're killing me
gotta branch out
Maybe start working in methamphetamines
Or maybe teach pre-school
always wanted to do that
love kids
Skillz is distracted by something
(') () Sorry,  know this is serious talky time but would you look at the fucking seat on that girl
18
We see a girl's apple bottom butt stuffed into blue jeans
(') () is a party
Jesse does not laugh
He looks like he is in pain
don't think it's over
What
Her butt
No, it will never be over
It goes on forever
It's like space
So great
No, Celeste and
think she's just confused and overwhelmed right now about everything
But she'll come around
She always does
Uh oh
It's been a while now think it's over, bro
It may be time to accept that and move on
Call that dime Veronica
Jesse looks uncomfortable
That was a one time thing, a couple months after Celeste and  broke up
Celeste does not know about that
And we will keep it that way
Didn't know that was a hit and run
Sounded like you liked her
Well, she's not Celeste
It's always been Celeste
'm not ready to give up
Okay, but remember, you can't re- heat a souffle
Huh
19
Also, there's Bettys everywhere
It's
Maybe it's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool
Make her sweat a little bit
It definitely wouldn't hurt to
go out with somebody
They reach the front of the line
Do you know what you want
Yeah,  want to not be a quitter don't want to start all over again
want everything that  believed to have been true to be true also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles
Please
(to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go out on a date with my friend here
Um, wait, where's your wife
You guys are here like everyday together
Well
we're separated
Oh
Cool
mean, bummer
But okay
'll go
14
-  14 Celeste and Beth wander amidst the modern art
They stop to take in a Cindy Sherman photo
It's so
grotesque
But kind of beautiful
In a grotesque way
20
Ugh, let's keep moving
Too many feelings
Celeste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien Hirst collage
(') () need to say this and then 'll never bring it up again
'm sorry wigged on you guys the other night but  don't know what you're doing
think it's stupid that you're not together
You are best friends and that's the hard part
Nothing else matters
Celeste and Beth stand in silence
Then: Beth, the reality is  love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account
Or dress shoes
The father of my children will have a car
But
Jesse will always be my best friend
Okay fine
've said my peace
It's your life
But  definitely don't think he should be living in your guest house
think you're kind of breaking his heart
Slowly
Jesse is fine
Can  show you something
Sure
Beth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner
With no art
Okay
Look
She points to her neck
What am  looking at
21
It's a hair
On my
Ewww
Will you get that thing lasered off, please
What the fuck
can't because it will pop up somewhere else where  can't keep my eye on it
Are you serious
That's the craziest thing 've ever heard
It's not a turnip
Trust me,  know my body
It's a cruel land mine
Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake
should, at least before my wedding, right
What is wrong with you
Celeste grabs the hair and pulls it out
(in pain)
security guard heads for them
Sorry sir, my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art
That was fucking rude
Had to be done
22
15
' -  15 The studio is beautifully, magically chaotic
There are large canvasses everywhere, paint rags, spray cans, common household items turned into sculptures (buttons, clothespin, hangers) and mobiles
Celeste walks in
Jesse is on a mattress on the floor, he's clearly been sitting there for a while
He is fist-deep in a huge bag of Cheetos and he's watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo
He is watching a short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold medalist in weight lifting
Hey
you're not working
Are you watching the Olympics
Again
And crying
Again
Jesse blows his nose
Yeah
God, you really love that, don't you
Matthias' wife died in a car accident last year
Well, three years ago now but
And he dedicated his gold medal to her
The human spirit is
unbreakable
Jesse is choked up, can barely speak
Uh huh
Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Form website
Huh
Oh yeah, 'm almost done
'm working on it
think you'll really like it
'll like it more when  have it because  needed it yesterday, so
23
Jesse turns off the television, takes a deep breath, wipes his eyes and recovers
Celeste, can you sit down for a minute
have something really important to tell you
Oh
Okay
Does it have something to do with the work you owe me
Celeste sits
Jesse sits next to her
Again, he has tears in his eyes
don't know how to tell you this but
have a date tonight
'm gonna start dating
People
date
Really
That is so great
It is
You don't
Yeah
Don't cry
Good for you, Jess
That doesn't bother you
Wow, okay
Well, it's actually the Yogurt Girl
From Yoga Yurt
Really
Yogurt Girl, huh
She's cute
But so young, right
Super young
Her body is all-time
Okay, no need for that
But this is good
You gotta crawl before you walk
mean she's definitely not gonna be wifey number two, right
Ha
Well, it's just a date
She hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way
24
Big move
'm proud of you
Jesse looks confused and slightly hurt
Thanks
Can  get up now
Huh
Yeah, sure
Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair
(') () Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it and from the get go, she was way into
what are you looking at
No, nothing
Are you gonna wear your hair like that
What
Oh
don't know, is it weird
Not weird, just different from how it looks best
She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he continues
Anyway, this is what we're doing right
We're getting divorced and we're friends and we're also dating people
That's what we're doing
She is satisfied with her work
She steps back
There
Better
You'll be great
You don't even need to be great
Just be you
Take her somewhere nice
Okay mom
Call me after
25
16
' - 16 Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl
It's clear he's hasn't been doing a lot of talking
So  was in school but then dropped out because  really wanted to work in fashion but it's really hard to find a paid internship
So went back to school and now work at Yoga Yurt part time but 'm really looking to make money doing something  love
But 'm sure the universe is looking out for me and when the time is right, the right thing will come along, you know
: 17
' -  17 Celeste is in bed on the computer
She hears noise from the outside
She listens more intently and hears Jesse
and a woman, giggling and talking loudly
Then, the studio door shuts
Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over
He wouldn't do that
Would he
18
' -   18 Again, with the morning symphony
Celeste drinks coffee, eats breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines
This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks' new album
It's exactly what she thought it would be
Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless
She nods her head, "yeah,  get it
" She turns it off
Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there
Finally, a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position
He is alone
Phew
19
' -   19 Celeste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for books
Where is it
They told me it would be in new releases
26
Celeste searches frantically for her book
She peeks around a corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading "More New Releases
" Three copies of her book, "Shitegeist" appear in the very bottom row, barely visible
She is disappointed
(') () That's what  call placement
She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the front of the store
Well you probably shouldn't steal it
Even if it is yours
Celeste marches to the Oprah's Book Club table and swiftly replaces the center display book with her own
There
But you don't have the "" on your cover, you can't do that
Yes  can
Jesse and Tucker arrive and see the book
There you guys are
you're on Oprah's Book List
That's so great
Something catches Celeste's eye
Some people are browsing my book
Guys, come with me to eavesdrop
Celeste, Tucker and Beth head off
Then: (
) Jesse
Jesse turns to see , 26, stunning and European
Veronica
Yeah, hey
How are you
27
Good, good
You look great
Thanks, you too
How's your clothes pin collage going
Slowly, but it's going
Well, don't give up
Your work is really unique
And beautiful hope that doesn't sound
No, that's means a lot, thank you
They looks at each other for a beat
(') () had so much fun
that night
'm so sorry  didn't call you
My life is just
had a lot of fun too
There is silence, as Beth, Celeste and Tucker arrive and stare at her
Who is this creature
Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth and Tucker and Celeste
Veronica notices Celeste's name on the book
Oh, this is your book
read an excerpt online, it's really compelling
Wow, thank you
That is so nice
Well, nice to see you
Oh you too
Take care
She turns and leaves
28
What is that
That was uh
Veronica
Story
No story
Just this girl  met a while ago
Huh
She's pretty
Celeste changes focus again and turns to a Border's employee to loudly and unconvincingly act out "Interested Reader" for other shoppers to hear
(') () "" He looks at her like she's crazy and keeps walking
And so do her friends
20
- 20 Jesse and Skillz are exiting a Bizmarkie concert, surrounded by older hip-hop fans and young hipsters who weren't alive when the Biz dropped his first album
They are trashed
Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what neeeeeed
And you say he's just a friend, and you say he's just a friend
Oh baby youuuuu
Oh baby youuuuu
Jesse's iPhone rings
very flirty picture of Celeste comes up
No, no, no
Ignore for sure
29
Uh,  just need to
(picks up) Hey
(whispering) Nooooo
(talking to Celeste) Uh huh
Okay
Okay
No, 'm not busy
(hangs up) Uh, 'm gonna go home
Come on, after the show it's the after party
There's an Ikea dresser that she needs me to "build
" Skillz takes this in
He is impressed
Huh
Really, cowboy
Are you guys
told you pal,  know what 'm know 'm doing
She just needed time
21
' - 21 Celeste is in a corner with a glass of wine and a  bag of nuts and bolts
She had a fight with a dresser and the dresser won
Jesse uses his key and enters
'm in here
Fuck Sweden
Oh baby youuuuu
It was definitely easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge,  think
Well, how hard can it be
It's a dresser, right
: 30
22
' - 30   22 Jesse is drunker than before and sitting where Celeste was earlier
Crying, frustrated
He's covered in sawdust and nuts and bolts
Fuck me
Do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable, just to fuck with you
Thank you
Wait
got it
: 23
' - 30    23 We see Jesse and Celeste admire their "dresser" as they drink wine
Perfect
Fucking lay-up
We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling that should have been the dresser
They both slide to the floor in satisfaction
They look at their "artwork
" They laugh; they are pretty drunk
Ruscha meets Basquiat
meets Serra meets Corky from "Life Goes On
" Yeah
He's a vegan, you know
Cherish
That is so cute
They share a laugh
31
You're cute
Celeste looks at him
She kisses him
He kisses back
It gets hotter
They fall back
: 24
'  -    24 Celeste and Jesse are in bed
Celeste is asleep
Jesse wakes up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face
This wakes her up
She is hungover and confused
Hey
What are you doing
love you
Celeste does not respond
She pops up out of bed
Okay
We should talk about this
Yeah
Whoa, we were drunk
What a bad idea
'm sorry
Don't be sorry
It was nice
And love you
Oh Jess,  don't
come on, we were drunk, and the dresser and thought
you're dating other people
Only to
god, 'm so stupid
He realizes how pathetic it sounds
Oh no,  thought
You thought what
32
Well, clearly  wasn't thinking
Or wouldn't have let it happen
Come on Jess, we're not getting back together, you didn't think
Celeste realizes he did think
Jesse is crushed
He gets up and leaves
He turns
You know, there's a guy that you can call, from Ikea, that will build you're dresser
You should call him
Hell, he'll probably fuck you too
'm a fucking idiot
Jess
No,  didn't
Jess
Celeste collapses back in the bed

- 25 bunch of Los Angeles hipsters file out of a yoga class
Everyone is sweaty and a little out of it
Celeste heads out as she towels off
She heads towards the shoe cubby holes
Hello
What
said hello
Oh
Hi
Celeste keeps walking briskly
, 35, short but handsome, tries to keep up with her
(a little too loud) How was your practice
My practice
It was
wait, what
it was fine
(who is this guy
) 33
see you in class a lot
You have a great warrior two
Are you single
Celeste puts on her shoes
Are you really doing this right now
You're really doing this right now
Paul realizes that his game is wack
Oh well
Yeah,  can't believe it either don't do this, it's just happening, can't stop
it
what do you do
Just gonna jump right in there
Wow, Captain Conversation
Paul
Here's my card
You bring cards to yoga
Look, you're really pretty
'm not good at this
Help
He smiles nervously
(she looks at the card
) financial analyst
Cool
Not really
It's not cool
Did you ever tell me what you did for a living
No, no  didn't
There is a pause in conversation
Celeste continues to put her shoes on
Well, will you
'd love to know
34
'm a trend forecaster
forecast trends
Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career
Trend forecaster
Really
Huh
They have reached the parking lot
Celeste turns to him with purpose
You traded in your Porsche for an Audi because the economy is tanking and you're afraid you'll lose your job soon
You bought a Samsung cell phone because you think it makes you seem more "business-oriented," unlike the iPhone which is for teenage girls
You go to yoga because you went to a sub Ivy League college, spent the last ten years working long weeks and drinking all weekend and you feel like it's time to do something "spiritual
" Nice to meet you, (looks at the card) Paul
Celeste walks away
Paul remains where he is, flummoxed

' - 26 Celeste enters through her side gate
She has some Chinese takeout in her hand
She heads for the studio
She sees that Jesse is not there
Neither is any of his shit
It's completely empty and sterile now
He's gone
27
-   27 Celeste is about to go on the road for work
She is on the phone
No, just make sure the San Fran focus group has a little more diversity than last time
It was like a rave
Without drugs
Okay
She hangs up and pauses
Then dials again
35
(') () Hey, Jess, it's me
'm getting on a plane but 'd really like to talk to you
don't know what happened last night
Hope you're okay
Call me

She asks questions, they share laughs, she engages with them
She is good at this
She excuses herself to make a phone call

She dials Jesse
It rings

He presses "Ignore

We reveal that it is: Veronica
'm glad you called
Jesse smiles big

- 31 Hey
It's me
Again

Anyway, call me
Okay
Bye
She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself: (') () love you
'm so sorry

She chuckles

Stupid

(on the phone) Hey
You're back want to talk to you
33
' - 33 Celeste is in her home office, working on the Riley account
Yeah,  want to talk to you too
Where have you been
It's been like two weeks
So much to lay down
like, did you know that pay- per-view porn is available in Cantonese
34
- - 34 Really
Like subtitles or dubbed
Wait, actually, 'm really close to your house right now
Can  come by for a minute
It's
important
: 35
' - 35 Celeste puts away groceries
Okay
have to tell you something
Me too
Wait, you first
Are you gay
No, not gay
He takes a really deep breath
37
(') () Um, you're not gonna believe this but
(playfully) Oh no, did you go on another date
'm having a baby
don't understand
'm having a baby
Celeste is still busy, putting away groceries
She is half- listening
What do you mean
am having a baby
Celeste opens the pantry and puts away cereal
With another person
Yes
With another person
Celeste takes out cold cuts from the bag and opens the fridge
Um
What
Sorry, 'm confused
Wait, what
What the fuck
With whom
With Veronica
Veronica
What's a Veronica
You actually met her
That day at the book store
38
Huh
But that's not even physically possible, that was two weeks ago
Well, the truth is,  slept with Veronica three months ago
It was just a one night thing
But she's pregnant
Celeste rearranges the fruit bowl
Whoa
Okay
Shit
Didn't know about that
But that's not important right now
This is not good
Alright
Okay
You and  are gonna deal with this
We will, we'll just have to
What do you need me to do
No, you don't have to do anything
But you don't even know this person, right
Yeah  know her
mean, 'm getting to know her
And  really want to make it work with her
Make it work
You slept with her once
What are you talking about
've actually been seeing her, well, a lot, recently
And  think really like her
So what you're saying is you got a girl pregnant and now you think you like her because she's pregnant
Or
'm really confused
The universe is fucking weird, Celeste
slept with her months ago and never called her after
() 39
() But we started hanging recently and she told me she was pregnant with my child
know it's crazy, but it just feels
right
It was like this really weird retroactive gift
don't know
Can you excuse me for a second
Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom
She gently shuts the door
She looks around, not knowing what to do with herself
She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint
She silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight
She collapses on the wall
She is in silent turmoil
Is this really happening
: 36
'  -    36 Jesse is sitting, waiting
He checks his cell phone
He hears the toilet flush
moment goes by
Celeste re-enters, having pulled it together
But her face is still wet with tears
Sorry about that
had something in my eye
Right
Look,  know this is so sudden
And so weird
've been holding on to us, this idea of us, for so long
And  know you've wanted me to let go
So 'm sorry
You were right, we're friends
We will always be friends
And  need that now
Of course
Thank you
Love you
Jesse gives Celeste a big, long hug
(') () Wait, you had something to tell me too
Sorry

Celeste takes a beat
It was nothing
She forces a smile

' - 37 Celeste is on the computer
She drinks coffee
Scott peeks in
Hello
Hey
Celeste lets out a guffaw
What are you doing
'm just following Diddy Twitty
don't
know what that means
It's Sean Comb's Twitter page
There's also a singing competition on television
It's called American Idol
Keep up
Okay saucy
You don't have to be so saucy
Well, just part of our job, so
ready for breaking news
Jesse is having a baby with some girl
Crazy
Whoa
Wow
Did you even know he was seeing someone
It's this girl he slept with once a couple of months ago
() 41
() And now he's "making it work" with her
Plane crash
don't know what to say
am so sorry, Celeste
No need, Scott, 'm totally fine
Are you
Look,  wasn't going to have his baby
So, good for him
Well, it's great that you're so resolved about this but it's also okay for you to have feelings
It's very sudden
Celeste pauses to consider this
Right
Well, let me see
mmmm, nope, 'm fine
promise
Not in love with him anymore
It kind of makes it easier
Scott is not convinced
Celeste is still distracted by the computer
(') () Oh my god, Diddy's snowboarding for the first time in Mammoth
Amazing
actually have a date tonight
Um
that's great
Who's the guy
The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes last quarter
He's been asking me out forever
Not the one, but it'll be nice to be admired
agree, go be admired
Who knows, you may actually even simulate human emotion
42

' -  38 Celeste, in workout clothes, is cleaning up her house maniacally
She is walking past her office
The Ikea robot she built with Jesse catches her attention for a moment
She keeps walking

' - 39 Celeste and , 38, handsome and clean cut, are sitting at dinner
They have just ordered
Thank you
She hands the menu back to the waiter
(') () My foot actually pronates
And my band is strained when  run, which really hurts
So Dr
Ozar recommended a foot specialist who made these customized orthotics for me and it's amazing how much better feel
Well, actually
Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the bar, by himself, watching tv
She is not prepared for this
My ex is here
Oh god, oh no, we just made eye contact
Maybe he didn't see me
Wait, he did
He's coming over
Oh god, this is so awkward
(to Max) You should probably leave
Wait, what
don't think
really
Yeah, just go
Jesse is at the table
(') () Too late
Here he is, heyyyy
just wanted to say hi
'm Jesse
43
Oh, this is Matt
Max
Mack
Max
Nice to meet you, Max
We're just here
Just eating
It's a date

Who are you here with
Oh, just here alone

Epic
So psyched  tivo'ed it
Nice to meet you, man
Good to see you,
You too

He's cool
44
Uh huh
Celeste immediately scarfs down her salad which has just arrived
She's quiet
How was that
Are you okay
'm fine
Celeste stares at Jesse at the bar
(') () He always loved the meatballs here
What
Nothing
Do you like bread
Bread
Um, yeah,  like bread
Cool, cool
Silence, once again

' - 40 Celeste and Max wait for their cars at the valet stand
Max's car arrives
He pays the valet
This was great
'm free next Wednesday
Sushi
Um,  don't think we should
Oh, because of mercury poisoning think that's a myth
go to this acupuncturist that
45
No,  think you may need some time
To get over, you know, your divorce
It took me a long time to start dating after mine
Thank you for your concern but 'm just fine
guess you're just not a match for me
Well, have a good night
Good luck
Max gets in his car and is gone
Celeste stands there, confused and alone
She shakes him off
(sotto) Whatever
41
41 Celeste is running
hard
It is a cacophony of street sounds around her: traffic, honking, speeding, Celeste listens to the Dirty Projectors "Stillness is the Move" on her iPod and joyfully runs across the street
42
-  -    42 Celeste arrives to meet Beth
She is in full marathon gear
She waves at Beth and enters, panting
Hi honey
Hi, wow, you are really out of breath
Did you fucking run here
From West Hollywood
Yeah  ran
Just started
It's really fun
You're soaking wet
Isn't that like 12 miles
13
5 actually
was just clearing my head, you know, keeping the endorphins up
46
Celeste pants like she's about to collapse
She doubles over with her hands on her knees
She's in pain
Do you
want to sit down
Oh, okay
Wow, is this it
It's so nice
Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate
saleswoman approaches
'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a- kind piece that was handwoven by a tribe of Afghani women
So if you could maybe just sit over there
The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable looking chair
Right
Sorry
Totally
Wow, you are a sweat tsunami
You should get it
It's really pretty
Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire body in sunblock and sweat
They look at the wreckage
Uh boy
Don't worry
know people who can get that out
Easily
Okay
guess 'm getting it
43
- - 43 The saleswoman is ringing Beth up for the couch
It is basically ruined
The Riley account is a handful
've been sooooo swamped
47
It's great you're staying busy
(about the couch) If it doesn't come out,  can have it reupholstered
Thanks
How's dating
Sorry, can  get your card
Here you go
Great
Dating's really great
Have you talked to Jesse
No, but  actually ran into him last night
think he's getting a little fat
think he's been looking pretty fit lately
(to the saleswoman) Can get a rush delivery on that
So you've seen Jesse
Yeah,  have
Huh
Have you hung out with
Veronica
Yeah
Yes

Silence
48
So, my first available delivery is Monday afternoon
Does that work for you
Yeah, that's fine
If you can you just call my cell
She's dumb, right
Huh
Oh no, not dumb
Simple
Simple means dumb
No, actually, simple in a really elegant way
Elegant
The saleswoman senses awkwardness
Okay, so you're all set then
Elegant
Thanks a lot
(to Celeste) They head for the exit
(') () thought you would be happy for him
am,  just didn't realize that Monica was "elegant
" Veronica
And you know what
You would probably really like her
Beth studies Celeste for a moment
49
(') () You're not having regrets about Jesse
Not one
Please let me drive you home
'm afraid you'll drown
Sure
have a date tonight so should probably shower before then
Beth looks at a sopping Celeste
Yes
Shower
Who's the date
Rupert Bates
Rupert Bates
The Gap model
Oh my god, he's so hot but he's like 15
22
Skillz set me up
He's about to be a huge star
He's filming "20,000
" It's the prequel to "10,000
" Fuck,   that movie
loved that movie too
It really spoke to me
44
-  44 , 22, very handsome, British, wearing a leather jacket, sporting tousled actor hair is playing a hideously earnest original song on the guitar
He sings with passion
He looks up at Celeste and winks
: Celeste,on the couch, looking slightly mortified
She smiles tepidly at him
50
Rupert finishes the song, closes his eyes and hangs his head
beat of silence
Celeste musters up a short and slow round of applause
That was so
good
wrote that for my mum
Lucky lady
So how do you know Skillz
He provides me with the happy smoky green treats
(sotto) Ew
Celeste cringes
What a dork
Rupert slides next to Celeste and is all of a sudden right in her face
He touches her hair
He kisses her, deeply
He pulls away and takes her in
Hello, Special One
Oh
hi
Oh god
(whispers) Oh no, no, no  gotta go

Celeste walks down the hall quickly to the bathroom

46 Celeste enters a stall
Then, she hears two girls enter the bathroom
, 19 and , 22, are chatting and primping
Celeste goes quiet and listens
Ugh
My hair is so dry
It looks like straw
Savannah quickly pops a pill
Then offers one to Riley
Here
Do you want an Adderall
51
No, that shit makes me feel like a robot
Speaking of robot, who the hell designed this place
It's like Spock and his eyebrows are about to walk around the corner
Celeste takes this opportunity to flush and come out of the stall
Hi Riley, 'm Celeste, 'm a partner at Pop Form
Hey
Wow, you're pretty
Riley looks closer at her skin and picks at it
(') () Why am  breaking out
Too much sugar
Coffee
Alcohol
Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime
Um
it's actually regimen
Sorry
Regime is a system of government
It's a "skin regimen
" Riley and Savannah glare at Celeste
Thanks, Scrabble
Nice to meet you
They leave
Charming

He looks to Celeste who is not paying attention
She is busy learning that she was right and Riley was wrong
Celeste looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley
Riley catches her and looks away uncomfortably

Do you wanna
Right
Yes
Sorry
So we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork

You know him

He has Indy rocker hair and a Los Feliz beard
He's hip and smart in an effortless way
Celeste is feeling him
They drink wine and laugh
So you pissed in your pants

Three of them soaking in my own pee
But finally got the shot of Ahmadinejad
He hands her a photograph

That was really, really nice
Um, yeah
So, what are you doing for the rest of your life
Making out with you
They start to kiss again

Nick is masturbating
Can he really be masturbating

Eyes closed

Riley Banks is a new client which is huge
Things are going really well

Great
Long silence
(') () Listen,  know this has all been pretty weird
It's only weird if you think it's weird
Celeste,  never wanted to hurt you
Thank you
You didn't
Glad we cleared that up
Look,  actually wanted to see you because
apparently there's some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and Veronica's actually not a citizen so
What
Where's she from
Uh, Belgium
(sotto) Huh
Belgium
Elegant
What
Nothing
Point is, we need to
get married
'm sorry

Well, Jesse, 've been busy with work
Because some people work for a living
So  haven't really been focused on what  can do to help you get on with your new life
59
'm sorry
know
What makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad
You don't even know how to read the electric bill
How are you going to support yourself
Have you even thought this through
guess 'll have to figure it out
Veronica is really supportive of my work
Really
Really Jesse
paid the rent for ten years
If that's not supportive,  don't know what is
That's true
And thank you
There is a long pause
We never even talked about kids

It stares back
She hates it
She kicks it
That hurt
She violently, with all her might, rips its head off
That felt good
She picks it up and starts to thrash the robot torso all over the room as, slowly, pieces of wood flail in every direction
She's angry and out of control
She stops to catch her breath and sees what she has just done
She falls to the ground in tears

Yoga

Uh huh
What are you

only go to yoga to meet girls
Speaking of, what's the deal with you and me
Is this happening
Or
64
My husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman who's carrying his child
That's the deal with you and me
'm sorry, that sounds tough
He's having a baby with a girl he barely knows
He's so lost
He's just going about it all
wrong
And you're right
Now what
What do you mean
Well do you want to be right or do you want to be happy
Listen, Yoga,  don't  to be right,   right
People will let you down
've accepted that fact, but unfortunately, most of the time, knowing that does keep you from being happy
But at least it's real

She quickly tosses it aside
Then she comes across one of Jesse's old notebooks
She flips through it
She reads a couple of sweet passages about her, it makes her smile
She grabs the phone
Hey, it's Celeste
You know, still have a bunch of your stuff in the office
You should probably grab it at some point
Okay
She hangs up
She makes a decision
She grabs a box and starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to Jesse
60
' - - 60 Celeste carries a box of Jesse's stuff to his front door
She doesn't knock
She leaves the box by the door
But she decides to keep the one journal with the sweet passages for herself; she deserves it and he'll never know
She starts to walk away when she notices, it's trash day
: 61
'  - 61 Jesse drives and Veronica is in the passenger seat
They are quiet and content
They look at each other and smile
After a : You're going to be a really good dad
What
Why did you say that
Veronica studies Jesse's face
don't know,  just know it
No one's ever said that to me
: 66
62
' -   62 Three trash cans-green, brown, and blue-are lined up in the driveway
huge box is protruding from the blue can
Celeste considers
So much to be learned from the trash
She slowly walks over
She peeks in at the box; it has a big picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it
Crushing
At least they recycle
63
'  -   63 Veronica looks out the window
This is
so weird but  just realized
what's your middle name
don't even know it
They laugh a little
It's um
Godelieve
Goldleaf
No, Goldelieve
It means loved by the Gods
It's Dutch
Sweet
Mine's Mordechai
What does it mean
Means 'm really Jewish
Veronica giggles
They're getting to know each other
It's awkward
but sweet
: 64
' -   64 Celeste is still digging in the trash
She looks further down
67
Guitar Hero
That's quite an extravagant purchase for a freelance writer and his "elegant" Belgian bride
All of a sudden, her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and plunks to the bottom
(') () Shit
Shit shit shit
She drops Jesse's journal to the concrete and crawls into the trash can, still reaching for the bottom, not quite getting there
The trash can falls over with her in it
Just then, Jesse's car pulls up and headlights shine on Celeste half-way in the trash can
She fumbles and then: (') () Ow
Shit
piece of glass from the can has sliced her face
She immediately wiggles out of the trash can, stands it back up again
She looks for a place to run
It's too late
She picks up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but Jesse and Veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car
Jesse approaches a crouching Celeste
Celeste
Celeste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong
She is also holding Jesse's journal close to her chest
Hey
What
are you doing
just
She looks around to make an excuse
(') () Um
came over to drop off some of your stuff
But why were you in the trash can
lost something
68
In the trash can
My bracelet
It was a whole thing
It's over now
Jesse and Veronica just stare at Celeste for a long beat
You've met Veronica, right
Yes
Hi
Wow, you're so pregnant, right

Oh
Thanks
(beat) Are you bleeding
What
Oh (she touches her cheek), yeah,  guess  am

Are you sure
'm so sorry about this
No, 'm sorry
So sorry
Well, 'm late for things
Have a good afternight
You sure you don't want to come in for a drink
Nooooo, no
That's very nice but no
Great to see you guys
Okay
She starts to walk away with the journal
Is that mine
69
Waht
Oh, yeah, that's weird don't know how

She laughs nervously and hands him his journal
Celeste walks to her car

Celeste writes " went through Jesse's trash last night
Oh no
" Beth writes back, "'m coming to your office right now
" (
) Hey
Celeste
It's Paul
The cereal killer
There's this yoga retreat in Tulum that  just got an e-mail about

Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich, recounting the waking nightmare of last night
The cut on her face is neatly bandaged
You told her you liked her sweater
What are you, twelve
It was a disaster
But you should have seen the sweater
So great
Beth, am  losing my mind
Maybe
No
Please no more trash- diving
Let's focus on you now

She takes a deep breath
So where do you live
We reveal that she is lying next to Paul, they are both about to get thai massages
Uh,  live in Westwood
In a condo
Cool
You are gonna love this place
You've never felt so relaxed in your life
Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses
They all exchange quiet hellos and head nods
Cherry and Lucky get to work
Lucky takes Celeste's leg and pushes it all the way over her head, not the most comfortable position
Ahhhhh
(responding to the stretch) Wow, this is a unique place to take a date
Yeah,  take all my dates here
feel special
You are
They all are
Celeste giggles
Paul takes a deep exhale as Cherry rams her elbow into his shoulderblade
71
(') () So how is being right about everything going for you
Not
that well
've been on a real winning streak, so  thought 'd call you
You know what
'm happy you did
At that moment,
Lucky has Celeste in a bear hug and it looks like she may have broken her back
don't know what your definition of relaxing is but
Just wait
Trust me, you need this right now
68
- 68 Celeste and Paul exit
He has a huge smile on his face
She looks like she's in pain
Why would you take me to a place where Asian people beat you up
That was absolute torture
But how do you feel
Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels
feel great, actually
So shut up then
Where are we going now
Don't try to control me
You need to let go
In yoga, we call it vairyaga
He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot

Teddy Pendegrass' "Love " is playing and people are dancing, actually dancing
No one is there to be seen, there is no pretention
This place is
really cool
You sound surprised
am, Westwood condo
'll get us beers
Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment
She is happy to be out
She takes her hair down, puts her hands through it, trying to look a little better
(') () Hey
Paul is on the dance floor, with two beers
Celeste meets him, takes her beer, and downs a third of it
Celeste looks up and Paul has started to dance
He looks at Celeste with jocular seduction
He's actually not a bad dancer
Maybe he's good
Okay, no, he's great
Paul pulls Celeste in and they dance together
She's sort of embarrassed but she's having fun
Paul pulls away in a little spin and goes into a James Brown splits move
Ohh
Celeste is into it now
She dances around him, other people watch them
Paul pulls Celeste in close
Celeste kisses Paul quickly, to his surprise
What was that for
Vairyaga, bro, let go
Not everything has to have a reason

Way to go, Becky
Jesse is look at his iPhone
He is looking at "Veronica and Jesse Baby Registry" What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn

Jesse takes this in
Tucker changes the subject
How's Veronica
She's so sweet

But are you into it
Yeah,  really like her
She seems great
For someone that  don't really know that's having my baby

He's not that good
Committed though
Jesse and Tucker continue to talk

And a butt
What
Really

You can't be serious
(points to the logo) There's the penis
And there's the penis going into the butt

Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste
Scott puts a  into the  player
reel of news clips comes on
teenagers were hoping to get a little bit of the teen star's fashion magic but instead, they have been suprised by what they saw
There's homosexual butt sex in the logo
Does Riley think we're that stupid
will never support gay marriage
80
Neither Riley nor a representative from Pop Form-the marketing company responsible-could be reached for comment
Scott turns it off
Celeste, what did you do
How could be so careless
Celeste picks up the magnified logo again
Oh
Oh my God
Oh wow,  totally see it now

Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably
It's the funniest thing she's ever seen

Celeste
Wait, let me say something don't know what happened last night

But  need to say this
For the record,  fucked up

And  know this may sound crazy but 'd be remiss if didn't

With you
With us
If there's a chance still
'd like to know

You're a fucking coward
'm just trying to do the right thing with Veronica

Well, you never changed for me
Jesse pauses
To be honest, you didn't really let me
83
Wow
All  did was wait for you to grow up
rooted for you, fucking paid for everything,  did everything for you
Yeah, and  was never your equal
And you know what
think you preferred it that way
Right
Well,  know my success was never easy for you
And how do you define success, Celeste
Because you don't look very successful right now
And you are
Pretending to be a father
Pretending to be an adult
What do you want
just want you to admit that you're wrong
Wrong
Wrong about what
What did you want me to do
Wait for you to meet someone first
Is that how you saw it happening
Celeste doesn't respond
(') () didn't expect to meet someone so fast, but  did
And  think we have a chance to be happy together
don't want to blow that
You know what, Jesse
You definitely will blow it

Busiest travel day of the year
So thanks for that, Mrs

Wedding guests look uncomfortable
(') () But the truth is,  would go anywhere for Beth
She's my best friend
And 'm so happy for her
Senior year of college, we had a tradition
Every Sunday, come rain or shine, Beth and Tucker would meet me and Jesse at the Bishop with a 12-pack of Miller High Life, the champagne of beers, and we would meet to talk about what was important in the world, you know, Heidegger's influence on hip-hop
Or the feminist duality on "Melrose Place
" Life's big questions
Beth and Tucker were just friends then but there was always something there
Just an ease they had with each other
Jesse and  spent years trying to get them together, unsuccessfully

For five long years
Tucker flinches

And that was beautiful Beth
And none of us could be happier about it; they were perfect
At last
Love wins

It's not
Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd
Veronica is next to him

Jesse and  are getting a divorce
So that's

Celeste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught
What are you doing
What
Nothing
We're just
He looks at Celeste for cover
She is giddy, wasted and happy to explain
Oh, Jesse and  do this thing where we find the littlest thing that resembles a penis and we just, you know
96
Celeste and Jesse demonstrate for Veronica
Celeste looks up and realizes how dumb this must seem
don't get it
Celeste and Jesse stop
It's stupid
Veronica is looking at Celete's food
Oh, the foods out
(to Celeste) See you on the dance floor
Watch out for Tucker though
They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling
She bites into the carrot
94
- 94 We see a raucous wedding dance floor
Everyone's dancing: Beth, Tucker, their families, their friends, Jesse, Veronica, Scott, etc
They are doing wedding dances
Celeste sits at her table, watching with a smile
It is bittersweet for her
She drinks a martini
Alone
95
' - 95 Celeste and Paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine
(keeping score on a notepad) So, that's 38 points plus 50 bonus points for using all my tiles so
Wait, wait, wait
think  may have to challenge
Zooecia
That's not a word, that's my hoochie cousin's name
Are you challenging or not
Yes,  definitely am
97
Well,  will tell you that Zooecia is a sac secreted by a compound organism but here you go
(he hands her the Scrabble dictionary) Look for yourself
Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently accepts defeat
(') () Ha ha
go again
've never lost a game of Scrabble in my life
Well, nothing lasts forever
96
'  -  96 Celeste and Paul are making out on the couch
'm so sorry  beat you in Scrabble
No you're not
You're right, 'm not
The making out gets a little hotter
Celeste is aggressive
Will you get a condom
Uh
don't think we should
No, you're using a condom
No,  don't think we should sleep together
Celeste pulls away from him
What
98
just
don't know
Are you not into it
No, no believe me, 'm into it
Then, what's the deal
really like you
Right, 'm confused
why not sleep with me then
Because  think  might really like you
Oh
(further realizing) Oh
Okay
Well,  like you too
Celeste looks distant
97
- 97 Celeste is at a loud, trendy club
She sits next to Riley
They have to shout to be heard
, , ' Celeste looks around at lots of men, grinding each other with whistles in their mouth and drinks in their hands
, 99
Celeste just looks at her like, "Oh you poor, sheltered Disney princess
Are you serious
" '
' Still nothing from Riley
,
Riley looks around and takes it in
Aha, right
Celeste looks out amongst the crowd
Just then, two beefy, waxed, tanned, well-groomed gay men walk up to Celeste
Excuse me, can you please tell your friend Riley that we worship her
#2 , she's so pretty
Sure
Celeste notices that they are both wearing the Riley Banks t- shirts, made for pre-teens, with the cock-in-the-butt mistake in the logo
She points at it
(') () Wait, are you aware that the logo is
#2 dick in a butt
Yeahhh
It's amazing
All of our friends are rocking it
It's like the gay Izod
The gay man points to a group of his friends on the dance floor,  wearing Riley Banks gear, some of them have even made their own t-shirts with the cock in the butt logo magnified
100
Wow, so, what, you just buy the biggest size they make
How dare you, 'm a size 10 in tween
have a slight frame
They walk away, offended
Celeste turns to Riley
She is being adored by gay men
Celeste has a big idea
98
- 98 Celeste is hiking alone on the phone, energized
Tweens don't want her anymore
But the gays do
Ten percent of Americans are gay, Scott
You're gay, start thinking gay
Gay Izod
She could be Lady Gaga by the end of the year
Huge market
Wow, you might have just turned the cock in the butt around
We  make the cock in the butt work for us
The cock in the butt will be huge
Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear her dirty mouth and glare at her
She waves at them self- consciously
' " ": A98   , ,       A98 - , , 101

99
- 99 Celeste is shopping for a dresser
She is talking to a salesperson
So, it comes with directions and it's actually really easy to assemble
Look, you do not know me
do not want to assemble
Trust me, you do not want me to assemble
Bad things happen
Could  just take the floor model
'll hook you up
Lemme go ask my manager
Thanks, dude
Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart filled with baby stuff
She approaches her
(') () Veronica
Hey, Celeste
Of course, yeah, hi
What are you doing
Oh, 'm getting a dresser
You
Oh, you know getting

Very
And so helpful right now
Of course
(laughs nervously) Well, looks like you're really organized
Organized, terrified
You'll do great
Thanks
hope so
They share an awkward moment
(') () Listen,  never got a chance to just tell you 'm so sorry about all this
Trust me,  didn't expect
No, don't
Really
There's nothing to apologize for
'm the one who's sorry

Celeste laughs
Look,  don't blame you
For anything
This has all been so weird
Everything happened really fast
Yeah, it did
But everything will work out
know it
Jesse's book is coming out
He's so talented
103
beat
Yeah, he is
An awkward silence
(') () Well, good luck
Nice to see you
You too
They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite directions but bump right into each other
Oh sorry
Oh, it's okay
Bye again
100
--    100 Celeste and Paul are in a private karaoke room
Paul is belting his heart out, singing Boyz  Men, "On Bended Knee
" Celeste is loving it
She has her own mike and pipes in once in a while with a harmony
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be
oh God give me a reason, 'm down on bended knee
ooohohhh ooooh Ooohh ohhh
Til you come back to me
'm down on bended knee hee hee hee
They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast with beers
(') () think we're really good
No, we  really good
104
Celeste punches in the numbers for the next song
It's "Islands in the Stream," made popular by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton
Aw shit
Get ready
You're first
Baby when  met you, there was peace on earth,  set out get you with a fine tooth comb
was soft inside
Soft inside
What the fuck
Shhh come on
Focus
You do something to me, that can't explain, hold me closer, and feel no pain
Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
Celeste and Paul sing in harmony
Honest love, we feel, needs Honest love, we feel, needs conversation
And we ride it conversation
And we ride it it together, uh huh

Celeste slowly drops her mike
Paul is still singing
(quietly)  can't
What
Come on, we're so good together
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
Get in there
This is my favorite part
No

Paul slowly drops his mike
105
What do you mean
just

Are you serious
Oh no
Why
He sits down on the couch
The music is still playing in the background
think  need to be alone
'm not ready
'm having fun and  feel like 'm beginning to like you and just don't think 'm ready for that
What
Really
Celeste doesn't say anything
(') () Wow, you're breaking my heart
'm so sorry
You are so
great
But 'm getting divorced
Celeste,  know

Yeah
Yeah, okay

Live by will, not by force
What
You're only ready when you're ready, you know
Don't force it
It's just some yoga shit
Thanks
106
But  do like you

And when you are ready, if you're ready, call me
101
, ,  &    - 101 Celeste and Jesse sit across from each other with their respective lawyers
They are both dressed very well
The atmosphere is formal, tense
There is not a lot of talking but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point pens
' , male, 40, speaks: ' Sign here
And here
And here
Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles uncomfortably
'  (') () And here
Here
Yup
Aaaaaand here
Here
Couple more
Here
Celeste is still signing
She looks at Jesse again, who is straightening his tie
like that tie
Oh, thank you
' One more here
Is it made out of organic mung beans
Jesse nods and chuckles
No,  actually found it digging through your trash
Ohhh,  see
All right
They've broken the tension
But it's still silent
Then Jesse chortles
It sounds like a baby pig
It makes Celeste laugh
107
Now, both Celeste and Jesse are silently cracking up, doubled over as their lawyers sit there, watching them, perplexed
102
, ,  &    - 102 Celeste and Jesse walk out of the building
So
we're divorced
They high five
What are you supposed to do when you get divorced
We did it
You wanna walk for a couple minutes
Sure
: 103
-  103 Celeste and Jesse are now approaching the front of "Urban Light," the installation from the beginning of the movie
The street lamps are now illuminated
She takes a seat on a step
Jesse sits next to her
She refers to the lamps: These are beautiful
thought you hated them
Yeah, well, 've never seen them at night
Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in
He looks pretty sad
(') () What's up with you
know we just got divorced but no one died, right
108
'm just feeling like maybe you were right
am a fuck up don't know what 'm doing
My girlfriend left
There is a long pause
What
Veronica
Left where
Left me
She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and couldn't
don't know why but just
couldn't
She wants to go back to Brussels
Another monumental pause
Jesse's eyes start tearing up
(') () Okay, you can say it now
You were right,  blew it
Just say it
Hey
don't do that
Do what
You are not a loser
You never were
You took a chance
admire that and  believe in you
You do
do
And  want to thank you
For what
For never being the person  wanted you to be
Oh, you're welcome
Go get her
109
But  don't know if everything is gonna be all right
Well, who does
Do you love her
Jesse looks at Celeste
do
Then it's worth fighting for
Okay
Okay
Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes
God,  finally understand why you fucking cry all the time
Shit is emotional
They share a laugh
Then, they sit in silence for a beat
(') () You deserve to be happy
And  wish that for you, always
Me too
So
guess we were right
Huh
Celeste makes the " and " hand gesture from the high school photo in the opening montage
Jesse makes it back
They smile
(') () love you
He kisses her on the lips
For the last time
And then, he's gone
love you too
110
Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky
104
' -   104 Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth
Hey
So, you're probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now
But if that doesn't work out for you
think  may be ready
To beat you in Scrabble
105
-    105 Celeste runs in to pay for gas
She is on her Blackberry
106
106 Celeste stands in line with some gum and water
young man blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water
Old Celeste returns for a moment
Excuse me, sir
The young man turns around
Celeste realizes she's no longer this person
She restrains herself
(') () Nothing
Celeste takes in how she has changed
She smiles a little
The young man turns back to her
Hey, 'm sorry for cutting
My dog's in the car and he's really thirsty
So, thanks
No problem
She smiles again
The world feels bigger now
