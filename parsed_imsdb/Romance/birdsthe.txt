- waiting at street corner for light to change
- at the end of line of pedestrians
He is looking up at the sky
- as she follows his gaze upward
- with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling
- as the light changes and people begin to cross
In the crowd walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling gulls in the sky overhead
The  : - in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop
She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, exquisitely dressed, though hatless
She walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, a mischievous grin on her face
She continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters
- Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back toward the street and skywards
The proprietor, a
MacGRUDER, comes toward her
Hello, Mrs
MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls
Hello, Miss Daniels
What do you suppose it is
Mrs
MacGruder takes a look out at the sky
puppy is , o
s
(shaking her head) There must be a storm at sea
That can drive them inland, you know
They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now
The  of the dog  into the clamor of innumerable birds, , ,  as Melanie and Mrs
MacGruder go to the counter at the far end
There is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure
The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages
As they walk: was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels
(apologetically) You see, he hasn't arrived yet
You said three o'clock
know
Oh,  know
(she is more distressed now) 've been calling all morning
Oh, you have no idea
Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are
We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he
Certainly not
Oh, no
Certainly not
This will be a full grown myna bird
Full grown
And he'll talk
Well, yes, he'll talk
Well, no, no
You'll have to teach him to talk
Yes
Yes
(pause) Oh my,  suppose  should call them again
They said three o'clock
(pause) Maybe it's the traffic
'll call
Would you mind waiting
(judiciously) think maybe you'd better deliver him
Let me give you my address
(she begins taking off her gloves) (producing pencil and pad) Oh
Oh, well, all right
As Melanie starts writing: 'm sure they're on the way, though
Could  just call
(with a resigned sigh) Well, all right, but
She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight
Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter
She taps her teeth with the pencil
(
) Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's
(pause; accusingly) It's past three, you know
(pause) Well, how long do you think
All right, would you check it please
Yes, 'll wait
Melanie sighs
Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil
There is no menace in the birds surrounding her
They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages
Off screen, the puppy begins again as the front door opens
Melanie looks up
- as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department
He is a handsome man, about twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt hat
- seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches
She pokes the pencil through the mesh
The birds are startled into scarlet flight
- as they pass each other in the aisle
He gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile
But as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner
- looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again
wonder if you could help me
What
(deliberately, and with a touch of hauteur) said  wonder if you could help me
- a trifle annoyed by his manner at first
She is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl
But then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her
(solicitously) Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir
- (deadpan) Lovebirds
Lovebirds, sir
Yes
understand there are different varieties, it that true
Well
yes, sir, there are
These are for my sister
her birthday you see
As she'll be eleven and
well, frankly,  wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative
understand completely, sir
As the same time,  wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either
(leading him around shop) No, of course not
Do you have a pair that are just friendly
think so, sir
(she looks around) Now then, let me see
(at the finches) Aren't these lovebirds
No, sir, those are
redbirds
The sign says strawberry finches
(airily) Yes, we call them that too
(she moves away) Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds
(and stops before a cage of canaries) Those are canaries, Miss
(pause) Doesn't this make you feel awful
(baffled) Doesn't what make me
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know
suppose not
Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages
Oh, certainly
It's to protect the species
imagine that's very important
Especially during the moulting season
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time
Are they moulting now
Some of them are
How can you tell
Well
they get a sort of hangdog expression
-    - '
The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression
Yes,  see
(pause) About those lovebirds, Miss
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead
We have some very nice canaries this week
All right
(he smiles) She smiles back
(he waits) All right, may  see one, please
- as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries out of the cage
She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter where she expects Mrs
MacGruder to reappear momentarily, and then takes a deep breath
She opens the door to the canary cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it
(feebly) Here, birdie
Here, birdie, birdie
One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and into the room
Melanie leaps back, startled
Oh
Ohhhhh
- as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and Mitch in pursuit
Mrs
MacGruder appears at the counter, finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all day
What is it
Oh
Oh my, one of the birds is loose
She joins in the chase around the room
The bird flutters up to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches them suspiciously
Shhh
Shhhh
He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand
Quickly, he covers the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it
- the canary in his hand
There we are
Oh, good
Oh, wonderful
- as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage
He opens the door
(putting the canary in) Back into your gilded cage, Melanie Daniels
- startled
What did you say
- (savoring this) was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels
But how
how do you know my name
(secretly) little birdie told me
(he smiles politely) Good day, Miss Daniels
(he bows to Mrs
MacGruder) Madam
(he starts out) Hey, wait a minute
She goes after him
Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her bafflement immensely
Melanie studies him
Then: don't know you
Ahhh, but  know you
How
We met in court
We never met in court or anyplace else
That's true
'll rephrase it
saw you in court
When
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window
didn't break that window
No, but your little prank did
The judge should have put you behind bars
What are you
policeman
simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and 'm not too keen on practical jokers
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical
Ahhh, but  really do want those birds
You knew  didn't work here
You deliberately
Right
recognized you when  came in
thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag
What do you think of that, Miss Daniels
think you're a louse
am
(he tips his hat) Good day
(to Mrs
MacGruder) Madam
(and he goes down the steps) And 'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds
(breezily, as he goes out) 'll find something else
(he gives a slight bow) See you in court some day
The door closes
The puppy begins
(angrily) That
that
who was that
have no idea
- seething as she stares after him
Suddenly, she gets an idea
- going down the steps and to the front door of the shop
She looks through the glass
-  - '
getting into his car at the curb
- looking after the car at the curb
-      - seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod
She begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns
- as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter
-  -
'
as she comes up to the counter
Have you got a pencil
What
Oh, yes, certainly
As Melanie begins writing: They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon
If you'd care to come back
No, you'd better send him
May  use your phone
(bewildered by everything) Yes, certainly
(she puts phone on counter) (as she dials) Do you have any lovebirds
No, not in the shop
But  can order them for you
How soon
Well
well, how soon would you want them
Immediately
(into phone) Is this the Daily News
Melanie Daniels
Would you get me the city desk, please
might be able to have them by tomorrow morning
Would that be all right
(with an edged anger) That would be just fine
(into phone) Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie want you to do a favor for me
(pause) No, this is a small one
(pause) Pressure you
Why, Charlie darling, would  try to pressure you
Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate
dash one seven six
(pause) Yes, a California plate
(pause) No, 'll stop up there in a little while
Is daddy in his office
(pause) Oh
No, no,  don't want to break in on a meeting
Just tell him 'll see him later
Thank you, Charlie
(she hangs up) -
Now
What time tomorrow morning
: - ' pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down
She glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around to the other side, and opens the door
- in a cage as Melanie reaches for them
- turning from the car and going into the building
She pauses in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons
- running down the list of names slowly
It stops
- her finger beside it
,
3B -    the forefinger extended as she runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then does the same for the next column
- as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, grabbing the knob
She opens the door
- coming through the door and into the lobby
She walks swiftly toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, waiting
Behind her, the inner door is  wildly with answering
Melanie and the man stand waiting for the elevator, silently
Behind her, the
The elevator doors open
The man smiles pleasantly and allows her to enter first
She does so with a small nod
The elevator doors close
-     - The birds are  wildly in their cage
The man and Melanie stand silently side by side
The man's eyes wander down to the bird-cage
Melanie's eyes move toward him
Self- consciously, she stands with the cage of  birds
The man is dead-panned, unsmiling
The elevator stops
The doors begin to open
- stepping out of the elevator as the doors open
The man is right behind her
She begins looking for apartment 3B
The man is walking down the corridor beside her
She stops in front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn the corner in the corridor
Instead, he stops at the apartment just opposite
He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key
He looks at Melanie
- smiling at him feebly
- The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm of his hand as he searches for his key
Impatiently, Melanie watches him
Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse
- ' reaching into the purse for a white envelope
- written there in Melanie's handwriting:
- as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly goes down the hallway, intent on retreat
' Miss
She stops, distressed
- the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other end, near the elevator
Is that for Mitch Brenner
(curtly) Yes
He's not home
That's all right
She presses button for the elevator
He won't be back until Monday mean, if those birds are for him
Monday
Yes
don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you
(trapped) Well,
The elevator doors open
Well, where did he go
Bodega Bay
He goes up there every weekend
Bodega Bay
Where's that
Up on the coast
About sixty miles north of here
Sixty
(her face falls) Oh
About an hour and a half on the freeway
Or two if you take the coast highway
Oh
'd hold the birds for him, but 'm going away myself
Someone's got to feed them,  suppose
(in utter despair now) Yes
Yes, someone's got to feed them
(apologetically) 'm awfully sorry
He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes inside
The door closes
Melanie is alone in the hallway
- exasperated
She looks at the open elevator
She turns to look at the birds
- in their cage outside the apartment door,
- surrendering with a gesture of resignation
She walks down the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator
The birds are  and  madly
Oh, shut up
And she steps into the elevator
- '   - () on the coast highway
It is a spectacularly beautiful day, with a cloudless blue sky
The montage of  that follow should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the ocean below, and  of Melanie driving with the caged birds on the seat beside her
The last shot should be a of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve
- She turns wheel forcefully
- in the cage as the car rounds the bend
They lean to one side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car rounds the curve
- () Car approaching Bodega Bay seen high up
- at the wheel, she glances out toward the bay
- ahead, through the windshield as the car approaches
- behind the wheel, leaning forward slightly for a look at the town
- through the windshield as Melanie slows her speed
- behind wheel
- on right of the road as Melanie enters the town matching car's cruise past ,  , , - behind wheel
- past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place
-  - () studying the town
The car turns into road by gas station
- through the windshield
The car turns right
There is life in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags
This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is -- is alive with its inhabitants
We see them from Melanie's ( ) - pulling in, in front of the post office
Melanie opens the door and steps out
She is smartly dressed in a traveling suit and sweater
She looks up at the sign, and then walks quickly toward the front door
- enters post office
- behind cage as Melanie approaches it
He is busy filling out a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc
He does not look up as she approaches
- through the bars of the cage
Good morning
- (without looking up) Morning
- wonder if you could help me
Try my best
'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner
Yep
He is still busy with his form, still does not look up
Do you know him
Yep
Where does he live
Right here
Bodega Bay
Yes, but where
Right across the bay there
Where
It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her
Suddenly, he leaves the window
- through the bars, exasperated
-  - as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's vanished
door to the left of the window opens, and the Clerk steps out
He walks a little distance as Melanie watches him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if he'd expected her to be right behind him
He stands stock still, looking at her, saying nothing
She understands then that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither speaking
They go to the front door
He opens it, looks at her, then looks out across the town and the bay
He extends his arm and points
See where 'm pointing
Yes
-   -
- () (
) See them two big trees across there
(
) Yes
(
) And the white house
(
) That's where the Brenners live
- The Brenners
Mr
and Mrs
Brenner
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids
The two kids
Yep
Mitch and the little girl
see
How do  get down there
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left
That'll take you right around the bay to their front door
The front door
(pause) Isn't there a back road  can take
Nope
That's the road
Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door
You see,  wanted to surprise them
Mmmm
didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me
Mmmm
It's a surprise, you see
Mmmmmm
(long pause) 'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it
The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at
If that's what you wanted to do
Where would  get a boat
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant
Ever handled an outboard boat
(looking at him) Of course
(looks back at her) 'you want me to order one for you
(surprised) Thank you
What name
Daniels
Okay
He nods briefly and goes inside
Melanie looks across the bay
-   - '
- () - smiling
She gets a new idea
She reaches into her purse for the envelope
She looks at the envelope, then tears it up and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag
She turns back toward the post office
- as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window
He is still busy, still does not look up
wonder if you could tell me
Yep
The little girl's name
The little Brenner girl
Yes
Alice,  think
(he turns, shouts to someone in rear) Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name
' (shouting) What
(shouting) The little Brenner girl
' (shouting) Lois
(shouting) It's Alice, ain't it
' (shouting) No, it's Lois
(to Melanie) It's Alice
Are you sure
Well,  ain't positive, if that's what you mean
need her exact name, you see
That case,  tell you what you do
You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there
Not the motel, that's the other end of town
This is the hotel
Now you take a right turn there, you got that
Yes
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church
You head for the school
Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box
That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher
You ask her about the little Brenner girl
Thank you
Yep
(pause) Could save yourself a lot of trouble
Her name's Alice for sure
Can  have the boat in about twenty minutes
The Clerk nods
How much for the phone calls
(brushing this aside) It's nothing
- grinning, as she makes for the door and
-
- getting into the car and slamming the door
() - '  turning in school road
- ' passing the school and pulling up outside the teacher's house
- with the name "Hayworth" on it
to reveal: - passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door
The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the front door
There are white curtains in every window of the house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway advises,
Melanie rings the doorbell
- waiting
She  the bell again: ' (shouting) Yes
Who is it
Me
' Who's me
- walking along the porch of the house
The walk in front of the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for flowers
comes round from the back of the house as Melanie reaches the corner
She is a woman of thirty- two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face
Her hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth- stained gloves
But there is something about her, a feeling of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness
Miss Hayworth
Yes
'm Melanie Daniels
'm sorry to bother you, but
- She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and groomed, seems singularly out of place in Bodega Bay
She studies her openly
Yes
- The man at the post office sent me
He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl
Cathy
The one who lives in the white house across the bay
That's the one
Cathy Brenner
(smiling) They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place
(She takes out package of cigarettes, offers one to Melanie) Did you want to see Cathy about something
- taking cigarette, hesitating
Well
not exactly
- studying her, thinking she understands
Are you a friend of Mitch's
No, not really
- There is an awkwardness here
Annie wants to know more
She puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach
've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but couldn't convince myself to stop
This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know
It's a lovely garden
Thank you
It gives me something to do with my spare time
(pause) There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay
(another pause) Did you plan on staying long
No
Just a few hours
You're leaving after you see Cathy
Well
something like that
(pause) 'm sorry
don't mean to sound so mysterious
Actually, it's none of my business
There is a pause
Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it is none of Annie's business
(putting out cigarette) 'd better get on my way
Thank you very much
Not at all
They begin walking toward the car
(still curious) Did you drive up from San Francisco
Yes
It's a nice drive
(pause) Is that where you met Mitch
(hesitating, then) Yes
guess that's where everyone meets him
- as she gets in behind the wheel
Annie's remark is not lost on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her face
Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss Hayworth
- as Annie leans over the seat
Do
(she shakes her head, smiles wistfully) No, 'm an open book, 'm afraid
(pause) Or maybe a closed one
(she smiles again, sees the lovebirds) Pretty
What are they
Lovebirds
Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship with Mitch: Mmm
(pause) Well, good luck, Miss Daniels
Thank you
She nods pleasantly, starts the car, pulls away
- watching the car, a look of sad resignation on her face
- coming out of Brinkmeyer's General Store, carrying a small paper bag, walking toward her car out front
The her as she gets in
She opens her purse and reaches in for the paper bag
- She pulls out a birthday card from the paper bag
- reaching into her purse again for a fountain pen
She unscrews the cap, braces the card on her closed purse
- Happy Birthday, the usual rhyming sentiments
The pen writes: To Cathy - ' crossing the highway down into the parking area behind the Tides, close to the docks
She gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the bird cage in her hand
Melanie approaches a waiting fisherman
She asks for her boat
The fisherman nods
He leads her to the dock and the waiting boat
She gets into the outboard motorboat, the fisherman helping her
He hands down the lovebirds in their cage
- pulling away from the dock, heading across the bay
() - and the wide expanse of the bay, as it heads on a direct course for the house on the other side
() Another spectacular  of the small boat
- coming head-on toward , Melanie at the tiller
She cuts the motor
The motor drifts to a stop
The bay is silent except for the cry of the gulls
-    - '
There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a little closer
As Melanie watches, the front door opens and a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the engine
little girl comes out of the house, goes to the truck, gets in
The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this distance -- and he comes over to the truck
The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust behind it
The farm is still again
Mitch stands looking after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up toward the barn in the distance
watching, biting her lip
- Mitch reaching the barn and entering
Silence
- watching, waiting
- Not a sign of life
- picking up paddle from deck, beginning to paddle in toward dock
- edging in toward the dock
Closer, closer, Melanie puts down the paddle
The boat drifts in
- leaping ashore, tying up the boat, reaching down for the cage
She climbs onto the dock and approaches the until she is in
The   to  in front of her as she walks forward
The barn door closed, still no sign of Mitch
- Coming off the dock and onto the lawn, the  still in front of her
She makes her way carefully across the lawn, glancing toward the barn, carrying the bird cage
- - crossing the lawn, the   in front of her
-  - -  - in front of her: Excitement and anticipation on her face
She wets her lips
The    her as she goes to front door and lets herself in
- as the door opens
Melanie  quickly, and closes the door behind her
She glances around for a moment, getting her bearings
The house is silent
- entering the dining room
Hastily, she puts the cage on the dinning room table, props the card up against it, then glances through the lace curtains on the dinning room window
-   -  - as before
-   -  -
as the front door opens and Melanie her back down front walk
Melanie glances over her shoulder toward the barn
-
Mitch has not emerged
- on Melanie's back toward the end of the dock
Melanie again glances over her shoulder toward the barn
further along the dock toward the barn
Still no Mitch
on her back for a short distance and as Melanie continues to the end of the dock and climbs into the boat
- on her back for a short distance and as Melanie continues to the end of the dock and climbs into the boat
- Melanie as she paddles away from the dock
-  () as she looks toward the house and barn
She starts to duck down
- '
as Mitch  from the barn and goes toward the house
He goes
-  () peering over the stern of the boat
- '
Mitch dashes  of the front door and looks around
- as she watches Mitch
'
as Mitch runs back  the house
-  () peering over stern of the boat
- '
as he  from the front door and raises binoculars
- as he looks towards Melanie's boat through the binoculars
The Bay is reflected in the glass
-  ( ) She is pulling at the cord which starts the motor
She sits down and grabs the tiller
She looks back over her shoulder, as the boat moves away
- He is smiling with amused recognition; he lowers the binoculars and dashes
-  () The     her as she looks toward Mitch
- Mitch is running for his car
The car door
The The car practically leaps out of the driveway
-  - as she watches the car race along the shore
-  - '
Mitch's car racing along the shore
-     -  () She looks off  toward car
- '
Mitch's car racing along the shore road, turns inland at Keesport
-   -  () Melanie looks  , her eyes slowly turn
- '
Mitch's car races past wrecked ferry boat
-   -  () Her head continues to turn
She looks off and sees: -   - '
moves forward slower
Mitch drives onto dock, gets out of the car and stands waiting
-   -  () partially posing for Mitch, her hair blowing in the wind, her head tilted back, a smile on her face
- swooping down from -   -  () as gull strikes the back of her head
She recoils and looks up with shock and pain
- '
The gull soars away from   corner of frame to - reacting to the sudden attack and looking after receding gull
Blood is starting down her temple from her hair
- as the boat comes closer
The boat drifts in toward a second boat tied up at the dock
Mitch crosses the docked boat, leaps into Melanie's boat
- in the boat
That was the damndest thing  ever saw
What made it
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding
- a thin line of blood trickling from the cut on top of her head, down onto her forehead and cheek
She seems dazed
She shakes her head in answer to him, then touches the top of her head, looks at her bloody fingers, and then nods weakly
- concerned
Come on, let's take care of that
- as they climb onto it
fisherman standing by looks at Melanie curiously
What happened, Mitch
(over his shoulder) gull hit her
what
The   them as they walk across the parking area behind the Tides, and to the closest office
Mitch tries the door knob
The door is locked
-         - as he tries door of next office
It, too, is locked
Come on, we'd better go up to the restaurant
They walk quickly up the slope to the Tides, establishing gas station across the road, the collection of stores opposite, the cars pulling in and out
Mitch opens the door for her, and they
- This is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of a local hangout
There are fishermen lounging at the bar, and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines
Two ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are sitting at one of the booths, having coffee
The rear wall of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the bay and the parking area below
television set over the bar is going
The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western movie should be  muted throughout following , who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates his attention between serving his customers and watching the Western
He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie
- Mitch and Melanie coming over to it
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there
(instantly alarmed) What happened
Young woman cut herself
Shall  call the doctor
(accepting the first aid kit) don't think it's that serious
You want to sit up here
Melanie climbs onto the stool
You cut yourself outside, Miss
Stop worrying, Deke
She was in a boat
He is rummaging around in the kit
had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before could bat an eyelash
don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody
(doubtfully) Well, you're the lawyer
(goes to other end of bar) - as he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide
What's that
Just some peroxide
want to clean out the cut
He pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the cut
They are silent for several seconds
Then: So you're a lawyer
That's right
What are you doing in Bodega Bay
Do you practice here
No, San Francisco
What are you
What kind of law
Criminal
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars
Not everyone, Miss Daniels
Only violators and practical jokers
That's right
As he swabs cut
Ouch
'm sorry
(pause) What are you doing up here
Didn't you see the lovebirds
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds
To bring your sister those birds
You said it was her birthday
Besides,  was coming up anyway
What for
To see a friend of mine
(she winces) Will you please be careful
'm sorry
(pause) Who's your friend
Why
(pause, stymied) Yes
(blurting the only name she knows) Annie
Annie Hayworth
Well, well, small world
Annie Hayworth
(realizing this was a mistake) Yes
How do you know Annie
(the lie getting deeper) We
we went to school together
College
Did you
Imagine that
How long will you be staying
Just a few
just a day or two
the weekend
think we'll have to shave the hair
Deke, have you got a razor
(pulling away) Oh, no you don't
It's still bleeding a little
Here, let me put this on
He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says: Bend your head down
This little Band-Aid won't show
He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut
Melanie takes a mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at it
She covers her hair over it as Mitch says: So you came up to see Annie, huh
Yes
don't believe you
(grins) think you came up to see me
Why would  want to see you, of all people
(shrugging) don't know
But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who  was, and where lived and
It was no trouble at all
simply called my father's paper
Besides, was coming up here anyway,  already told you
(grinning) You like me, huh
loathe you
You have no manners
And you're arrogant and conceited and
wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but  tore it up
What did it say
None of your business
(pause) Am  still bleeding
She lowers her head
Can't see a thing
can't say  like your seagulls much, either
come all the way up here to
But you were coming up anyway, remember
was
And all  get for my pains is a
a
a hole in the head
(grinning) Right next to the one you already had
(angrily) Look, Mr
Brenner
(
) Mitch
They turn toward the door
- closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar
She is a woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, cardigan sweater, low heels
There is nothing agrarian-looking about her
She speaks with the quick tempo of the city dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes
(puzzled) thought  saw your car
What are you doing in town
(rising to greet her) had to acknowledge a delivery
(grins) Mother, 'd like you to meet
what
(continuing) Melanie Daniels
Melanie, my mother
- Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure, but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the introduction
How do you do, Miss Daniels
(to Mitch) Acknowledge a what
delivery, Mother
Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco
Lydia thinks she understands
This is one of Mitch's San Francisco chippies
Oh
see
For Cathy
For her birthday
By the way, where is she
Across at Brinkmeyer's
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend
In fact, 've already invited her to dinner tonight
- turning to him in surprise, beginning to shake her head
- After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds
(
) 'm sorry
couldn't possibly
You did say birds
Yes, lovebirds
We couldn't let you
(understanding completely now) Lovebirds,  see
get away without thanking you in some small way
After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend
Yes, but
You are, aren't you
Certainly, but
Then it's settled
What time is dinner, Mother
Seven o'clock, same as usual
'll pick you up, Miss Daniels
Where are you staying
With
with Annie, of course
Of course, how stupid of me
quarter to seven, will that be all right
Annie
Annie may have made other plans
'll have to see
Besides, can find my own way
You're sure now
You won't hire a boat or anything
'm sure
Seven o'clock then
Maybe
- grinning
We'll be waiting
How's your head now
- Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly
(with an overwarm smile) It's nothing, Mrs
Brenner
gull hit me, that's all
Lydia stares at her doubtfully
'  - Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her hands
She rings the doorbell
The    sign is still in the window
The door suddenly opens
(surprised) Oh, hi
(pause) Did you find her all right
- Yes,  did
There is a long awkward pause
Annie smiles expectantly at Melanie
Melanie seems hesitant
was wondering
Yes
That sign
(pause) Do you think  could have the room for a single night
Well, 'd really hope to rent it for
would appreciate it
've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full
(after a pause) Sure
You can have it
(smiles) Where's your bag
In the car
Melanie holds up the paper bag
Annie looks at it and then smiles
It's utilitarian, 'll say that for it
(smiling) just picked up some things for the night at the general store
You see, hadn't planned on spending much time here
Yes,  know
Did something unexpected crop up
There is a moment where both women look at each other
When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she is again telling Annie to mind her own business
Yes
(pause) May  use your phone
'd like to call home
There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's attitude, and then accepts it
She suddenly smiles warmly
Why don't you come in then
was just about to mix a martini
She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both hear a  overhead
They turn to look skyward
- flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky
- (shaking her head) Don't they ever stop migrating
But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously serious expression
-    to the Brenner house
Melanie's car is driving along the shore
Behind her, the sky is stained with sunset
There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the silence
- as it pulls into the Brenner yard
- reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand
She gets out of the car,   her to the house
She climbs the porch steps,  on the door
There is no answer
Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard
In the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from behind the chicken sheds
She raises her arm in greeting
(calling) Hi
- , , in the distance
Mitch and Cathy raise their arms
(excitedly) Hi
(she breaks into a trot toward Melanie) -  as she approaches
She is an eleven-year- old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head
She hesitates for just a moment
Miss Daniels
Yes
And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking her off her feet, hugging her fiercely
They're beautiful
They're just what wanted
Is there a man and a woman
can't tell which is which
Well,  suppose
- (coming up) Hi
Annie had no plans, huh
'm glad you came
Are you hungry
Famished
Dinner's just about ready
(explaining) We were out back looking at the chickens
Something seems to be wrong with them
(going toward house) There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch
'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now
(as they follow into house) don't know what good that'll do
(aside to Melanie) Chickens won't eat
- as they ,   them throughout into dining room where Lydia dials phone, talking to Mitch all along
He sold the feed to me, didn't he
Caviat emptor, Mother
Let the buyer beware
Whose side are you on
'm simply quoting the law
Never mind the law
Cathy, you can start serving the soup
She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone This won't take a minute, Miss Dan
(into phone) Hello, Fred
This is Lydia Brenner
didn't interrupt your dinner, did (pause) Fred, that feed you sold me is no good
(pause) The chicken feed
The three bags brought
- holding the telephone
Well, it's just no good
The chickens won't eat it
(pause) They're always hungry, Fred
opened one of the sacks when  got home, and  poured it out for them, and they wouldn't touch it
Now you know chickens as well as  do, and when they won't eat, there's just something wrong with what they're being fed, that's all
(pause) No, they're not fussy chickens
(pause) Who
What's he got to do with it
(pause) Fred,  don't care how much feed you sold him
My chickens
(pause) He did
Dan Fawcett
(pause) This afternoon
(pause) Well, that only proves what 'm saying
The feed you sold us is
(pause) Oh
Oh,  see
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh- huh
Maybe  ought to go over to see him
You don't think there's something going around, do you
(pause) No, never
(pause) No, Fred, they don't seem sick at all
They just won't eat
(pause) Mmmm
Mmmmm
Well, 'll try to get over to Dan's farm
Maybe he'll
mmmmm
mmmmm
all right, Fred, thanks
(she hangs up, puzzled) - as Lydia comes to the table
Mitch and Melanie are sitting opposite each other in the center chairs
Cathy is serving the last bowl of soup
(as she sits) He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago
His chickens won't eat, either
It's what you said, Mom
Mr
Brinkmeyer's feed is no good
(slowly) No, Cathy
He sold Mr
Fawcett a different brand
(extremely worried) You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch
- her eyes troubled as she picks up her napkin
- The meal is over
The lovebirds in their hanging cage have been covered for the night
In the b
g
Mitch and Lydia are carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen
In the f
g
Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano
Melanie is playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from the ashtray now and again to take a puff
still don't understand how you knew  wanted lovebirds
Your brother told me
(as she goes into kitchen) Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right
No, not exactly
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco
Of course, they're mostly hoods
(from the kitchen) Cathy
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it
(to Melanie) He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice
(coming from kitchen) In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial
Your brother's practice
Mom, please,  know all the democracy jazz
They're still hoods
(to Melanie) He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times
Six times, can you imagine it
(she starts for living room) mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think
(to Mitch as he carries load of dishes out) Why did he shoot her
He was watching a ball game on television
What
His wife changed the channel
He   kitchen
- Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her cigarette
Is smoking fun
Oh,  suppose so
Could  have a puff
don't think your mother would like that
(
) Just a little one
- They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen
Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette
Quickly, Cathy takes a small puff
(delighted) Why, it's just like air, isn't it
(determined) When  grow up, 'm gonna smoke like a chimney
'll be eleven tomorrow, you know
know
Are you coming to my party
don't think so
(seeing the child's face) have to get back to San Francisco
Don't you like us
(touching her hair) Darling, of course  do
Don't you like Bodega Bay
don't know yet
Mitch likes it very much
He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city
He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge
(smiling) guess it does get a little hectic at times
If you do decide to come, don't say told you about it
It's supposed to be a surprise party
Melanie laughs
You see, they've got this whole complicated thing figured out where 'm going over to Michele's for the afternoon, and Michele's mother is going to say she has a headache and would  mind very much if she took me home
Then, when we get back here, all of the kids'll jump out
(pause) Won't you come
Won't you please come
- shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen
don't think so, Cathy
-   - Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch
Yes, very
And certainly pretty
Yes
How long have you known her
told you
We met yesterday
In a bird shop
Yes
She was selling birds
No
only led her into believing believed she was
Mother, it's really very complicated
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
Mother, where did you go to law school
(laughing) Forgive me
suppose 'm just naturally curious about a girl like that
(pause) She's very rich, isn't she
suppose so
Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print
She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch
know, Mother
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she
Yes, Mother
Perhaps 'm old-fashioned
(pause) know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but
well
actually
well, the newspaper said she was naked
know, Mother
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to
Mother
(looking up) Yes
think  can handle Melanie Daniels by myself
Well
(she sighs) So long as you know what you want, Mitch
know exactly what  want, Mother
-    -  - as Mitch and Melanie cross it to her car
wind is blowing off the water, and high fast clouds are scudding across the face of the moon
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you
Oh, yes
Will  be seeing you again
San Francisco's a long way from here
'm in San Francisco five days a week
With a lot of time on my hands
'd like to see you
(he grins) Maybe we could go swimming or something
Mother tells me you like to swim
How does Mother know what  like to do
guess she and  read the same gossip columns
Oh
That
Rome
Mmmm
like to swim
We might get along very
In case you're interested,  was pushed into that fountain
Without any clothes on
With all my clothes on
The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper
Anything they said
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh
'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd
Yes, but
who didn't much care for propriety or convention or
Yes
the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth
Yes, that's the truth
But  was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too
Sure
Do you really know Annie Hayworth
No
(pause) At least,  didn't until  came up here
So you didn't go to school together
No
And you didn't come up here to see her
No
You were lying
Yes,  was lying
Did you really write a letter to me
Or was that a lie, too
wrote the letter
What did it say
It said, "Dear Mr
Brenner,  think you need those lovebirds, after all
They may help your personality
" That's what it said
But you tore it up
Yes
Why
Because it seemed stupid and foolish
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome
told you what happened in Rome
Do you expect me to believe
don't give a damn what you believe
Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door when Mitch catches it in his hands
'd still like to see you
Why
think it could be fun
- pulling the door shut
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer
But it's not good enough now
- It is for me
- But not for me
- What do you want
- (angrily sarcastic) thought you knew
want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked
Good night
- as it pulls away
Mitch yanks his hands back from the door
- as he watches the car leave
- The car turns the bend and disappears
Empty road
Only the long line of telephone poles and wires and
something strange on the wires
His attention caught by the poles and wires
- Hundreds of birds sitting on them
- standing and watching
wind blows off the water
He shivers suddenly, turns up his collar, and heads for the house
'   -
- In an easy chair, reading
She is wearing a robe and smoking, absorbed in her book
She turns when she hears the front Miss Daniels
Is that you
(
) Yes
Annie rises to greet her
As Melanie   : Hi
(seeing her face) Is something wrong
Is that cut beginning to bother you
(touching her head) No, it's not the cut that's bothering me
(concerned) Would you like some brandy
If you have some, 'd
'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels
Do you want a sweater or something
quilt
As Annie gets the brandy: No, thank you
(pause) Won't you call me Melanie
All right
(she smiles) -  sitting, tucking her legs up under her
She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, by the way this entire trip has worked out
Annie brings her the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully
Thank you
(sitting opposite her) It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes
Especially if you're over near the bay
Melanie nods and sips at the brandy
There is a long pause
Well, how'd your evening go
Melanie shrugs
Did you meet Lydia
Melanie nods
Or would you rather  changed the subject
(with a tired smile) think so
(nodding) How do you like our little hamlet
despise it
(laughing) Well,  don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor
Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside
It takes a while to get used to
Where are you from originally, Annie
San Francisco
How'd you happen to come here
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago
There is an awkward pause
Annie shrugs
Look,  see no reason for being coy about this
It was Mitch Brenner
Melanie nods
guess you knew that, anyway
suspected as much
You needn't worry
It's over and done with
long time ago
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me
Isn't there
(she shrugs) Maybe there isn't
Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl
What do you mean
think 'll have some of that, too
(she pours brandy, drinks, sighs) was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know
(she smiles weakly) And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia
When was this
Four years ago
Of course, that was shortly after his father died
Things may be different now
Different
With Lydia
(pause) Did she seem a trifle distant
(smiling) trifle
Then maybe it isn't different at all
You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy
simply couldn't understand it
When  got back to San Francisco spent days trying to figure out just what 'd done to displease her
And what had you done
Nothing
simply existed
So what was the answer
jealous woman, right
clinging possessive mother
(she shakes her head) Wrong
With all due respect to Oedipus,  don't think that was the case at all
Then what was it
Lydia liked me, you see
That was the strange part of it
In fact, now that 'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends
Then why did she object to you
Because she was afraid
Afraid you'd take Mitch
Afraid 'd give Mitch
don't understand
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman
No,  don't think so
She's not afraid of losing her son, you see
She's only afraid of being abandoned
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter
She already has a daughter
What about Mitch
Didn't he have anything to say about this
(apologetically) can understand his position
He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died
He didn't want to risk going through it all over again
see
So it ended
Not immediately, of course
went back to San Francisco, and  still saw Mitch every now and then
but we both knew it was finished
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay
You get straight to the point, don't you
'm sorry
Forgive me
No, that's all right,  don't mind
came up here for two reasons
To begin with,  was bored with my job in San Francisco
was teaching at a private school there
well, you know, you probably went to one yourself
did
Then you know
Little girls in brown beanies
Deadly
Here  have a life
'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and 'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have
' (pause) And 'll give them what  have haven't got very much, but 'll give them every ounce of it
To me, that's very important
It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time
(she sighs) That's the first reason
And the second
(simply) wanted to be near Mitch
(pause) It was over, and  knew it, but wanted to be near him, anyway
(she smiles) You see,  still like him a hell of a lot
That's rare,  think
don't want to lose his friendship
ever
There is a moment of silence
Into the silence, the shrills
Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer it
- at the phone
Hello
Oh, hello
No, no,  wasn't asleep
What is it
(pause) Yes, just a little while ago
Sure, hold on
(she turns to Melanie) It's Mitch
For you
- as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie hesitating
He's waiting
Melanie rises and goes to the phone
The   Annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie talks to Mitch in the background
Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl
(at phone; coolly) Hello
Yes, this is Melanie
Fine, thank you
No, no trouble at all simply followed the road
It's a very bright night
(pause) What
Oh
Well, there's no need to apologize
can understand
(pause; she listens) Well
(she listens again) That's very kind of you
No, 'm not angry
(she listens) couldn't
'm afraid  have to get back to San Francisco
(pause) No,  wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but
(pause) see
(she is warming) see
Well, if you really
(pause) All right
Yes, 'll be there
(pause) Good night, Mitch
She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon
(pause) said  would
'll be going, too, to help out
It should be fun, Melanie
It seems so pointless
(she sighs) think 'll go to sleep
This has been a busy day
(picking up her paper bag) My luggage
She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie
Pretty
Did you get that at Brinkmeyer's
Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm
She is silent for a moment, pensive
Then: Do you think  should go
That's up to you
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it
Never mind Lydia
Do you want to go
(firmly) Yes
Then go
The room is silent
Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles
Thank you, Annie
Suddenly, into the silence, comes a  at the door, startling them both
(rising) Who can that be at this hour
(she walks to door) Who is it
(no answer) Is someone there
Melanie goes to stand beside Annie
Puzzled, Annie unlocks the door, and then opens it
She looks out into the night
There is nothing but the  of the wind
(to the emptiness outside) Is anyone there
(pointing to the ground) Look
- - (sympathetically) Ohhh
Oh, the poor thing
He probably lost his way in the dark
- who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up
And then, slowly: But
it isn't dark, Annie
There's a full moon
- as Annie, stooping, looks up at her
On their puzzlement and consternation: -    The place is decorated with balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn
The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are clustered around a long folding table upon which are sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks
The parents are either helping the children to more or telling them they are having too much
There is a general  of kid's  and Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, are Melanie and Mitch
The   them  the slope and away from the party in background
As they turn the hairpin bend of the slope, and come up toward the , we see the entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background
The   them as they come near to us and, once more, the party is in the background
Mitch and Melanie pass the out to the left
- Melanie and Mitch come  the picture from the right and stand against the sky
Mitch takes a martini shaker from one of his pockets, and two glasses from the other
He hands one of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours
really shouldn't have any more
'm a little tipsy already
'm trying to get you to stay for dinner
We're going to have a lot of roast left over
couldn't possibly
have to get back
(with a shrug) Cheers
Cheers
They drink
What's in this
Nitro-glycerin
Why do you have to rush off
What's so important in San Francisco
Well
have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing
(surprised) You have a job
(sipping at the martini) have several jobs
What do you do
do different things on different days
Like what
(hesitating) On Mondays and Wednesdays,  work for the Travelers' Aid
At the airport
Helping travelers
Yes
She hesitates for a moment, thinking
She has never really considered before what she does with her time, and now that she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and unimportant
And on Tuesdays,  take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley
That's not a job, of course
just take it because
What about Thursdays and Fridays
On Thursdays  have my meeting and lunch
(pause) 'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school
We plan how to raise funds and
things like that
(she shrugs) And Fridays
What do you do then
Nothing
(she smiles) go to bird shops on Fridays
'm glad you do
Do you know what  was doing in that shop
What
have an aunt, you see
Aunt Tessa
She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced
(she does an imitation) She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and 'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her
What'll it say
(facetiously) You'll think me very bold, sir
No, tell me
She leans over and whispers in his ear
They both burst out But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into Melanie's face
- serious, introspective
That's silly, isn't it
Teaching a bird to shock my aunt
That's just silly and childish
(slight pause) Maybe  ought to go join the other children
- as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff
Mitch stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse of character, and then follows her down the dune
The children are all in a circle
Annie is busy changing the blindfold from Michele to Cathy
- The  is now on the lawn   toward dunes
We see Mitch and Melanie descending
They are coming down by way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path
As they reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of the dunes
They are absorbed in each other
The them and   the picture Annie, surrounded by the children
She is in the act of changing the blindfold from Michele to Cathy
She hands Michele her glasses back
During this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is watching Mitch and Melanie
- '
- to her left ( )
At this moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday cake
The candles on it are unlit
Lydia immediately also catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple
During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy off
All right then, here we go
(she spins her) Once
(she spins her again) Twice
(she spins her again) Three
Go get 'em, Cathy
She says all this while still looking toward the couple
She turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on her face
She twists completely around to look at Lydia as though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees
Suddenly we  a little boy's voice crying: (
) Look
Look
Annie swings round and the    her face as she looks up
- '
gull is swooping down
- as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously reaches out in front of her at the air
The gull suddenly swoops at her, hitting her shoulder
She whirls
No touching allowed
She almost falls
- seen from Cathy's position
He flies off, cycles and then returns
- reacting to gull
She turns her head back to Cathy
- reacting to the gull hitting Cathy
They start towards Cathy
- with Cathy and the children around
The    as she ducks with two gulls swooping by
- hurriedly putting the cake onto the table
She rushes round to the front of it
-  - '
Annie rising from the ground
Cathy and the other children are running in the background
- reacting to two more gulls diving
-   - '
diving toward the children
- She starts to run out
- She pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks
- as a gull swoops between them
- coming out of the house with a broom
swooping down at the children's heads
- swinging at gull and missing
- running toward bank
Gull swooping after him
- falling forward against the bank as the gull smashes into him
- running to the injured boy, who is lying against the bank
- , They look up
- against the sky, flying away in formation
- about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no longer there
puzzled look crosses his face
He turns to Melanie
Are you all right
- Yes
(coming over) That's the darnest thing thing 've ever seen in my life
- Are they gone
They're gone, Mother
- as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the cake
There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck very close by without having injured anyone
All that adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go
Well
well, is everyone all right
(with a small boy) think he got a little scratch, Mother
#3 Did you see them
They were hawks
#4 They were bigger than hawks
Children, they were only seagulls
And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before
- as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent meaningful glance
They must have been after the food, Mother
They all turn toward the table
-           , - eyes narrowed
They didn't touch anything
(trying to restore order) Well, they're gone now, so
so let's
(pause) Who was 'it
' You were 'it,' weren't you, Cathy
#2 Can  be 'it,' Miss Hayworth
- as Annie and the children begin the game behind them
You look a little shaken
am
(pause) Mitch, is
Mitch, this isn't usual, is it
The gull yesterday when  was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now
Last night
What do you mean
gull smashed into Annie's front door
(pause) Mitch
what's happening
(concerned) don't know, Melanie
(pause) Look, do you have to go back to Annie's
No,  have my things in the car
(gently) Then stay and have something to eat before you start back
'd feel a lot better
- She nods, and then looks up at the sky
Suddenly she shudders
- '  - He is slicing the leftover roast beef
- putting the meat onto plate, turning over his shoulder to call into living room
The lovebirds in their cage are making a terrible racket
Do you want some mustard with this
(
) No, thank you
(coming from kitchen) Why didn't Annie stay for dinner
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East
Oh
Where d'you want the coffee
Take it into the living room, would you, hon
(seeing the birds) What's the matter with them
Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some French bread
What's the matter with all the birds
She covers the cage
Under the cover, the birds are still tweeting madly
Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment, and then signs heavily
Hurry up with the rest, Mitch
'm sure Miss Daniels wants to get on her way
As she moves into the living room
think you ought to stay the night, Melanie
-   - a sharp look at her daughter
- pouring coffee into the cups set on coffee table
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything
(coming in with two plates) That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie
(he picks up coffee cup, hands it to Melanie) They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet style
If  go across to Santa Rosa 'll come onto the freeway much earlier
(picking up a cup) Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom
Yes,  did
Just listen to them
(to Melanie) Some cream
'll get it
She reaches over for the cream pitcher
Her eye is caught by something in the fireplace
- looking curiously
- a single swift is sitting on the hearth
- turning to Mitch
Mitch
- as dozens of swifts begin pouring from the opening
- frightened now
(shouting it) Mitch
- hundreds of birds pouring into the room
- shrieking in terror, dropping her coffee cup
- full of birds, swooping, diving
Mitch runs to the door, throws it open
(to the others) Get outside
Run
(he turns toward Lydia) -  in terror, surrounded by birds
(
) Mother
- wrenching the cloth from the coffee table, cups, coffee pot, sugar bowl, creamer falling to the floor as he swings the cloth at the birds
- covering her face
- reaching for small fireplace broom
- shrieking as the birds dive at her face
- realizing it's impossible to run
They must stay and fight
(shouting) Cathy, get some matches
- running for the kitchen
Birds swooping after her
- swinging the fireplace broom
- rushing to the fireplace
He is almost knocked over by birds coming out of the opening
He stuffs paper under the logs already in place there
- She lets out a horrified scream
There are birds fluttering in her hair, caught there
- swinging the broom, covered with birds
- (an enlargement of a photograph of Cathy, smiling
) As a bird flutters against it
- running into the room, covering her face with bent arm, rushing to Mitch with the box of matches
- taking the matches
He lights one
bird hits his arm
He drops the match
He lights another one
- falling onto the paper in the fireplace
It flickers for a moment, then catches
Birds are still pouring out, past the paper beginning to catch
- as a bird crashes through it
- rushing to Lydia, swinging the cloth at her head
She is hysterics now,
The  of the birds is a wild cacophony
- blazing
- swooping out of the fireplace, its wings aflame
- less birds in the air now, the single flaming bird flying toward the drapes
- as the flaming bird lands on them
- catching fire
- swinging the broom wildly
Mitch
The curtains
- turning, seeing, his eyes opening wide
- ripping at the flaming curtain
He throws it to the floor, begins stamping on it
- It's working
The fire's working
- only the blazing fire
No more birds entering
- birds bursting through the panes, leaving
- as she beats away another bird
- the birds leaving en masse now
- shambles
Windows broken, furniture knocked over, pictures askew, the floor covered with birds and broken glass
In a corner of the room, Lydia crouches with her hands covering her face, sobbing
The burnt curtain is still smoldering
Mitch is covered with soot
Melanie puts down the broom wearily
The attack is over
-   - reaching down to pick up a dead bird
-  , a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out speeding tickets or warning drunks
He holds the bird on the palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while
That's a chimney swift, all right
- We know what it is, Al
- Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know
Not by the thousands
No,  gotta admit this is peculiar
(pause) Did you have a light burning or something
Yes, but the curtains were drawn
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know
(pause) Sure is a peculiar thing
What are we going to do about it, Al
don't think  get you, Mitch
Do about what
Well
(he feels a little foolish) Well
these birds attacked us
- slight disbelief on his face
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all
- (still a little hesitant) All right, 'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room
But, they didn't just get in
They came in
Right down that chimney
- (trying to make sense of this) My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once
(shrugs) Didn't know how he got in there
Had a broken leg, turned out
Just fluttering all around there
(he shrugs again) These birds were
What 'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know
Ain't much we can do about it
(he shrugs) Tell him about the party
That's right
We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy
Her birthday
Oh, yeah, yeah
(he grins) How old is she now
Eleven
In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children
And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after
- considering this
Yeah
(thinking) Were the kids bothering them or something
'Cause sometimes they'll do that, you know
If you make any kind of disturbance near them, they'll just come after you
seen that plenty of times myself
- The children were playing a game, Al
Those gulls attacked without
Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty strong word, don't you think
mean, birds just don't go around attacking people without no reason, you know what  mean
The kids just probably scared them, that's all
These birds attacked
(nodding) Well, what would you like me to do, Lydia
Put out a pick up and hold on any suspicious birds in the area
(he smiles) Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't it
- Does this room look silly
- No, you got quite a mess here, 'll admit that
(pause) Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney (pause) Seems a little pointless, though
Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years
(pause) You want some help cleaning up
- exasperated
can handle it myself
- giving a small moan
- 'll take Cathy up to bed
- Are you staying
- think  should, don't you
- observing, making no comment
- putting her arm around Cathy's shoulders
'll get my things from the car
Do you want to walk with me, Cathy
- as Cathy and Melanie go out
Well, if there's anything else  can do, Mitch
Thanks, Al
We'll be all right
Goodnight, Lydia
No answer
Sure is peculiar,  got to say that for it
He exits
- It is silent
Mitch looks across at Lydia who sits as still as a stone in her chair
The door closes gently on a note of utter helplessness
-
- Melanie has just gotten out of bed
She is wearing the rather unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store
Her hair is loose
She wears no makeup
She is bent over a lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom
She is busily brushing her teeth
Her head half turns as she ' Mitch
Mitch
Mitch, 'm going to drop Cathy off now
' Okay
' 'll probably drive over to the Fawcett farm
Do you need anything in town
' No
Melanie finished brushing her teeth
She goes to the window and looks out
Outside, we  the  of the pickup truck starting
-    - '
as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck and climbs in
The truck moves out of the yard and down the road
It turns the bend, and moves out of sight
- turning from the window
She goes to the bedroom door, She opens the door
Mitch
There is no answer
Mitch
- coming down the steps from the attic room
The house is empty
The   her into the dining room, where she stops at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on her face
- She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage
The birds at her
(imitating them) Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee
- leaving the cage
She walks to the sideboard upon which is an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall
She feels it with her hand
It is hot
She pours a cup, then peers out of the side window
- '
Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands
thin column of smoke is climbing the sky
- carrying the cup of coffee
She sets it down for a moment to put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand
She picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and
- coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the cup of coffee
It is a beautiful day
She sips at her coffee and then breathes deeply of the air
- fresh, rested
There is a contentment in her which we have not seen before
She looks off toward the shore
- on the shore, working with the rake
The thin column of smoke is climbing the sky
- She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the end of the garden toward the shore
wind is blowing off the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs as she walks
She stands there silhouetted against the sky for a moment
as Melanie scans the horizon
There isn't a bird anywhere in sight
The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in its silence
Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin column of smoke again
In the distance, Mitch sees her and raises his arm in greeting
She waves back at him
He puts the rake down and begins walking toward the house
- There is anticipation on her face now
She watches Mitch coming toward her, her eyes glowing
- closer to the house now
- waiting, anticipating
- He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house
- as first surprised, and then puzzled
The back screen shut off screen
small hurt look crosses her face
- as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the garden, sipping idly at her coffee
screen again
She turns
Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her
- wanted to change my shirt
Melanie is uncomprehending
It smelled of the fire
(nodding) It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it
It's so beautiful and still now
(pause; then sagely) think 've got it all figured out, by the way
Really
Tell me about it
(secretively) It's an uprising
Of birds
Certainly, of birds
Mitch grins
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent
He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen
Growing a beard
(delighted) Yes, of course, he had to have a beard
'Birds of the world, unite
' he kept saying, over and over
So they united
Not at first
Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks
Well, they'll go along with anything
Sure
But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen
"Why should humans rule
" they asked themselves
Hear
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination
Hear, hear
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages
Birds of the world, unite
Take wing
You have nothing to lose but your feathers
They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then laugh again and finally are silent
The garden is deathly still
(attempting to be serious) What it was, probably
Mmm
They're probably hungry, that's all
This was a bad summer
They eat berries and
and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it
With my little sparrow leading team
She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time
Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror story, they are becoming a little frightened
It's so damn quiet out there
It was like that yesterday
What do you mean
After the gulls attacked
hadn't thought of that
(pause) And then the swifts came
It makes you feel as if they're
they're waiting or
resting
or
(trying to make it light again) No, they're having a meeting, Melanie
Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and
- her face dead serious
- waving his little wings
His voice trails
His face becomes serious, too
Again, the garden is silent
- her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming slowly and with the chill of horror on them
They were angry, Mitch
They came out of the chimney in fury
(pause) had the feeling they wanted each and every one of us dead
- He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her
She goes to him longingly
Melanie, Melanie
'm frightened, Mitch
No, no
'm frightened and confused and
think  want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and
and concrete and
Melanie
everything  know
She looks up at him suddenly
- Oh damn it, why did you have to walk into that shop
They kiss suddenly and fiercely
On their kiss, -   - Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate
Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door
She knocks
There is no answer
- Dan
She comes down off the steps, the  , back a little away from the house
Dan
There is no answer
She shades her eyes and looks out over the fields
- - as Lydia crosses to a fence and cups her hands to her mouth
(shouting) Hi, there
- He stops the tractor, turns toward Lydia, shading his eyes
- (shouting) Is Mr
Fawcett home
- (shouting back) think so, ma'm
His missus is in Santa Cruz, but he ought to be here
- Have you seen him this morning
- No, ma'm
reckon he's in there, though
- (shouting it) Thank you
- as she crosses the barnyard again
There are several chickens scurrying about
She walks closer to them, sees an open bag of feed lying against the fence
- getting an idea
- reaching into the bag of feed
She scatters some on the ground
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick
- He struts up to the scattered grain
- watching him
- He seems to be examining the feed
Then he turns away from it and struts off
- a small knowledgeable nod of her head
The chicken's reaction strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett
She turns
- approaching the front door again
She knocks
No answer
Dan
She backs away from the house again
The barnyard is silent
In the distance, we can  the  of the tractor
Dan
Are you home
No answer
- a little annoyed
She glances at the ground floor window closest to the door
- small pane of glass is broken
- puzzled
- going to the front door, trying the knob
- The door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the house
Dan
The house is still and silent
- as Lydia comes in
We can see the living room off to the right, but it looks normal and untouched
Lydia turns to her left and looks down a long corridor
-   - '
a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial light into the corridor
Dan
No answer
- a little troubled
She seems deciding whether or not she should leave
determined look comes over her face
-   - '
as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the opposite end
Outside the door, she pauses
Dan
Are you in there
No answer
Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing the door open
- coming into the room
Her eyes begin to take in the room
- '
starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and continuing a little below eye level, the   : standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, all the panes shattered
The level of the  , and begins a   of the floor
It   broken glass, continues its  to  scattered feathers, continues its to  a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single bedroom slipper, continues to  a pair of legs in pajamas, one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately : - His face
Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their empty staring sockets
Immediately : - a terrified scream erupting from her mouth
- turning and running for the door
The   her in an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still screaming, into the pickup truck
The engine starts, she backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway, - at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide
- at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the highway
It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite direction, swerves, screeches around the curve
- behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight
-   - ' through the windshield, blurring past
She turns the bend leading to the house
For an instant, through the windshield, there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in the garden
Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and barrels into the front yard
- alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck just as it jerks to a stop
- through the truck as he pulls open the door opposite Lydia
(alarmed) What is it
- as he sees his mother
- slumped on the wheel of the car, her head on her arms, sobbing
On her sobs
-
- at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner
She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set with sugar and creamer
She looks up as Mitch comes into the kitchen
- That was Al on the phone
He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place
Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while
(pause) Will you be all right here
Yes
was just taking her in some tea
He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses her hair
But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder
Be careful
Please
She walks him to the door
At the door, they kiss -- a long, full kiss
-- as Mitch goes out
Melanie looks after him for a moment, and then picks up the tray
Outside, we  the  of his car starting
The   Melanie out of the kitchen, through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on the other side of the house
Gently, she
(
) Mitch
- This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a life no longer valid
There are photographs of her dead husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of Mitch's childhood
Under it all, there is a distinct femininity
She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing the tray
No, it's me, Mrs
Brenner
thought you might like some tea
- Oh, thank you
There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, arranges the pillows behind Lydia
Where's Mitch
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm
Why
Didn't Al believe my story
He was calling from the farm, Mrs
Brenner
Then he saw
He must have
He sent for the Santa Rosa police
What good will they do
She sips at the tea
There is a long awkward pause
Melanie walks to the window and looks out over the bay
Do you think Cathy's all right
What
Cathy
At the school
- at the window, her face turned away from Lydia
Her expression clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all right
But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting smile on her face, and her voice is soothing
Yes, 'm sure she's fine
- Do  sound foolish to you
No
keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face
(she shudders) They have such big windows at the school
(pause) All the windows were broken
In Dan's bedroom
All the windows
Try not to think of that, Mrs
Brenner
wish  were a stronger person
There is a long awkward silence
She sips at her tea reflectively
lost my husband four years ago, you know
(pause) It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone
(pause) 'd love to relax some time
'd love to be able to sleep
(pause; the worried look again) Do you think Cathy's all right
Annie's there
She'll be all right
'm not this way, you know
Not usually
don't fuss and fret over my children
(pause) When Frank died
(pause) You see, he knew the children, he really knew them
He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them
That's a rare talent
Yes
wish  could be that way
There is another silence
curious thing is happening in this room
Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her husband's death, is discussing it with another person
Curiously, the person is Melanie
(honestly and simply) miss him
(pause) You know, sometimes  wake up in the morning, and  think ' have to make Frank's breakfast,' and
get up and there's a
a very good reason for getting out of bed until
until, of course,  remember
(pause) miss talking to him
(pause) Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch
(she shrugs a little sadly) Mitch has his own life
(pause) 'm glad he stayed here today feel safer with him here
(she sighs deeply) Would you like to rest now, Mrs
Brenner
No
No
don't go yet
(pause) feel as if
don't understand you
And  want so much to understand
Why, Mrs
Brenner
Because my son is
(pause) My son seems to be fond of you
(pause) And
(pause) 'm not quite sure how  feel about it
really don't know if
like you or not
Is that so important, Mrs
Brenner
You liking me
Yes,  think so
My son is important to me
want to like any girl he chooses
And if you don't
(with a faint smile) Then  don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me
think it might also matter to Mitch
(shaking her head) Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do
(pause) 'm not complaining
That's the mark of a man
But
(pause) You see,
wouldn't want to be
be left alone
don't think could bear being left alone
forgive me
This business with the birds has me upset
don't know what 'd do if Mitch weren't here
(going to the bed; adjusting the pillow) Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs
Brenner
(sighing) wish  were stronger
(she pauses and looks toward the window
) Do you think she's all right
Do you think she's safe at the school
Would you like me to go for her
couldn't ask you to
don't mind, really
Would you
'd feel so much better
'll just clear up here, and then dress
She picks up the tray and starts for the door
Melanie
At the door, Melanie turns
- her face soft
(gently) Thank you for the tea
-  - Melanie's car turns and goes up School Road
-  - Closer shot of the car coming to a stop outside school
Inside the school, we  the children
(
) married my wife in the month of June
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo mo
- smiling as she gets out of the car and heads for the school

) carried her off in a silver spoon

The children's  are  now

Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, Mo, mo, mo
With every rake, she shed a tear
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity, knickety-knackety, retro-quo-quality, willoby-wallaby, Mo, mo, mo
Melanie is at the door to Annie's room now
She opens the door and looks in
-  - '
leading the children in song
She catches sight of Melanie at the door
Melanie wiggles her fingers
Annie points to her wristwatch indicating that she'll be finished in a few minutes and motions for her to wait in the play-yard outside
Melanie turns and starts down the corridor again
- Melanie emerges and strolls up street toward Annie's house
Inside the children are still singing
(
) She swept the floor but once a year
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo
She swore her broom was much too dear
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity, knickety-knackety, retro- quo-quality, willoby-wallaby, mo, mo, mo
Melanie turns back and seats herself on seat in front of play yard
(
) She churned the butter in Dad's old boot
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo
And for a dasher she used her foot
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity, knickety-knackety, retro-quo-quality, willoby-wallaby, mo, mo, mo

Size of shot has seat on bottom of screen
We are shooting three-quarter toward the school

) The butter came out a grizzle-y- ygrey
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, grey
Mo, mo, mo
The cheese took legs and ran away
Ristle-tee, rostle- tee, hey bombosity, knickety-knackety, retro-quo-quality, willoby-wallaby, mo, mo, mo

She let the critter get away

- a nearer cut of Melanie same angle as previous
Waist shot
- again four more crows arrive
- Nearer shot of Melanie smoking
Same angle
Just above waist - bust shot
- Again five more crows arrive
- head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking
There is no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing inside the schoolhouse
Melanie is puffing away at her cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the school
We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going on behind her with the crows
After a wait of about what seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is drawn to something above her
- crows is coming down
- as her eyes follow the flight of the crow
- Crow moving down and  to , the sky and Annie's roof in the background
- Her head has twisted around to follow the flight of the crow
She is almost looking into the play yard
- crow slowly descends to the play yard and as the it down, we see for the first time that the number of crows has increased to an alarming number - almost 200 or even perhaps 250
This last crow settles down with the others
(
) (throughout preceding) asked my wife to wash the floor
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo
She gave me my hat and showed me the door
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity, knickety-knackety, Retro-quo-quality, (the song slows -- it is near the end) Willoby-wallaby, mmmmmmmo, mmmmmmmoo, Mo
-  The    as she leaps to her feet in alarm
Her body has turned, but we are now facing the opposite side of the school yard
- The play yard is full of crows
- Big head of horrified Melanie
- closer view of the menacing birds
- Big profile of Melanie
She turns with back to  and goes toward school looking at crows as she goes away
The her for a few paces and then  so that her image becomes smaller as she goes up steps into - side view of the crows as seen by Melanie
- Melanie in headlong flight toward Annie's room
(
) All right, children
Now please put your books in your desks, and bring the songsheets to the front of the room
No one's going out to play until  have all the songsheets
- Annie is lining the children up near the door leading to the play yard
We're not going outside until we quiet down
Ralph
Did you hear me
The children mutter for a moment, and then are still
All right now
She begins opening the play yard door
Suddenly, the door from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly the room
She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of the way, and  shut the play yard door
- wh
- against a background of children's , as they react to this new excitement
Outside
-   -      - We've got to get the children out of here
These big windows
there's no way to board them up
Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately
- Through the windows, we can see the waiting crows
One moves restlessly into flight, then settles on the equipment again
Quiet down, children
Quiet down
The children modulate into silence
Miss Daniels wants to see how we conduct ourselves during a fire drill
'd like you to
(grumbling in Unison) fire drill
This is our play period, Miss Hayworth
Gee whiz
Etc
'd like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be
The children again fall silent
We're going to go out of the school now
Those of you who live nearby can go directly home
want the rest of you to go down the hill, all the way to the hotel
Do you understand
All the way down the hill
Gee, Miss Hayworth, we never
Home
Why do we
(shushing them) want you to go as quietly as you can, not a sound, until  tell you to run
And then  want you to run as fast as you can
Does everyone understand
(pause - silence) All right
John, would you lead the class, please
The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door
John opens it, and they begin filing out
Melanie turns to look at the play yard
- fluttering at the window, almost in exploration
He hangs there for a moment, then wings back to the playground equipment
- (whispering) Hurry
-   (6) straight on of all the crows
-   (8) but a different angle
-   (10) but a different angle from the others - (12) low angle of five or six crows filling the screen
The screen is filled with crows
About fifty or more
All of a sudden we  the distant  of children's feet as they start running
Immediately the crows rise and the with them into the sky

- It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as officiates behind the bar and  , his wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of booze in him
In one of the booths sits   in his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and efficiently
and   are seated at another table, about to order
party of noisy  is laughing and clowning around throughout following at a table in the rear
The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens
Over her head, the television set is blasting with its perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation
Daddy, there were hundreds of them
No, 'm not hysterical, 'm trying to tell you this as calmly as  know how
All right, Daddy
Yes Daddy
(she takes a deep breath) Just now
Not
fifteen minutes ago
The door to the Tides opens and
, sixtyish, wearing walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what Melanie is saying
At the school
No,  don't
Just a minute
(to Deke) What's the name of the school
Just the Bodega Bay School
(to Mrs
Bundy) Help you, Mrs
Bundy
need some change, Mr
Carter
As Deke opens cash register
The Bodega Bay School
(to Deke) Could you turn that down, please
Deke gives Mrs
Bundy her change, turns off television
don't know how many children
Thirty or forty
Yes
Mrs
Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to Melanie
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school
Crows,  think
don't know, Daddy
Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds
(turning from machine) There is very definitely a difference, Miss
They're different, Daddy
(to Mrs
Bundy) Thank you
(into phone) think these were crows
Yes, hundreds of them
Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them
(exasperated) Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa
Well, all right, but you act as if 'm
all right, all right
(pause) No,  can't come home now
just can't, Daddy
How is it there mean
are there birds
In the sky
But no trouble
Well,  hope
(pause) don't know when
simply can't leave now
Tell Mother not to worry
All right, Daddy, good-by
She hangs up
Mrs
Bundy is at her elbow
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species
The crow is brachyrhynchos
The blackbird is cyanocephalus
Thank you
(to Deke) Do you know Dan Fawcett's number
In the book right here, Miss
As Melanie looks it up
(to Mrs
Bundy) don't see what difference it makes, Mrs
Bundy, crows or blackbirds
If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious
(with a superior smile) hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack
Their brain pans aren't large enough for such
(dialing) just came from the school, madam
don't know about their brain pans but
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss
They bring beauty to the world
It is mankind, rather, who
(going to door leading to kitchen) Three Southern fried chicken, Sam
Baked potato on all of them
from salesman at table
(into phone) Hello, may  speak to Mitch Brenner, please
(pause) Yes, 'll wait
(continuing to Deke) insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet
If it weren't for birds
Mrs
Bundy, you don't seem to understand
This young lady says there was an attack on the school
Impossible
(in background) Mitch
'm glad  caught you
Something terrible has happened
Her background conversation continues through following: (suddenly) It's the end of the world
What's this about the school
Bunch of crows attacked the school, Helen
It's the end of the world
(suddenly quoting) "Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys; Behold, , even , will bring a sword upon you, and  will destroy your high places
The Lord's not destroying anything, Jason
"In all your dwelling places, the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be laid waste
" (he nods) Ezekiel, Chapter six
(quoting) "Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink
" (nodding) Isaiah, Chapter 5
It's the end of the world
Yes, all right, 'll wait for you
Good-by
(she hangs up) (laughing) hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world
(turning to her) These weren't a few birds
- waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation; becoming very nervous
didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range
In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded
- eating
(suddenly, from his table) How many gulls did you count, Mrs
Bundy
Which gulls, Mr
Sholes
There are several varieties
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats
Probably herring gulls
They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or
(leaping upon this) Have you had trouble with gulls
One of my boats did last week
(making a connection) This young lady got hit by a gull only Saturday
' (from kitchen) Pick up the chicken
Now it's gulls
minute ago, it was crows
(she picks up tray, shrugs, goes to table) Deke, 'm still waiting for those Bloody Marys
Coming right up
- as Helen brings food
She is beginning to get really frightened
Could you ask them to lower their voices, please
They're frightening the children
Timmy has a canary
That's nice
Are you Timmy
My cousin is Timmy
' (leaving table, coming to bar) whole flock of gulls nearby capsized one of my boats
Practically tore of the skipper's arm
(coming back) You're scaring the kids
Keep it low
You're scaring me, too
Are you trying to say all these
(he shakes his head) That sounds impossible, Sebastian
'm only telling you what happened to my boat
The gulls were after your fish, Mr
Sholes
Really, let's be logical about this
What were the crows after at the school
What do you think they were after, Miss
Daniels
think they were after the children
For what purpose
To
(she hesitates) To kill them
There is a long silence
Why
Another silence
don't know why
thought not
Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago
, goes to bar, listens
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a
a war against humanity
No one called it a war
Scotch, light on the water
You and Mr
Sholes seem to be implying as much
Are you finished here, Sebastian
Let me have some apple pie, Helen
(to Mrs
Bundy) Who said anything about war
All said was that some gulls
(yelling to kitchen) One apple pie
You want more coffee
No
came down on one of my boats
They could have been after the fish, just as you said
Your captain should have shot at them
What
Gulls are scavengers, anyway
Most birds are
If you ask me, we should wipe them all out
World would be better off without them
(outraged) Birds
Yeah, birds
All they do is make a mess of everything
Who needs them
We need them
Not if they're starting a war
They are incapable of organized warfare
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest
have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do
Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels
You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young
There's a vast difference between
Maybe they're all protecting the species
Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and
Are you discussing gamebirds now
All birds are not gamebirds, you know
don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town
Then fight back
Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth
That would hardly be possible
Why not, Mrs
Bundy
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr
Carter
It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone
The five continents of the world
(muttering) Kill them all
Get rid of them
Messy animals
probably contain more than a hundred billion birds
It's the end of the world
Well, we seem to have more than our share of them right now, Mrs
Bundy
Maybe this young lady's right
Maybe they've all gone crazy
Here's your pie, Sebastian
You want it at the table
No
Here's fine
(he begins eating) Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke
Coming
(angrily) Are we running a business here -- or a bird sanctuary
(beginning to change his mind) Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish
Of course
Makes a lot more sense than
well, an attack
Of course it does
If we believe that birds are attacking, why
why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of
Cockroaches
Urghh
- getting more and more anxious
Hurry, children
Finish your lunch
Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy
Maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this
Admittedly, a few birds acted strangely
That's no reason to believe
This isn't a few birds
keep telling you that
These are gulls and swifts and crows and
And what
Vultures
Hawks
Eagles
Maybe
Is it impossible
Yes
have never known birds of different species to flock together
The very concept is unimaginable
(laughing) Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance
How could we possible hope to fight them
We couldn't
You're right, Mrs
Bundy
(calling from table) Excuse me, may  have a check, please
(concerned) Is everything all right, ma'am
Yes,
'm anxious to get on the road
(coming from kitchen) What's the matter
Something wrong out here
Nothing's wrong
All this shouting
We're fighting a war, Sam
war
Against who
Did the Russians
Against birds
(suddenly) 'm glad you all think this is so amusing
You've frightened my children half out of their wits
'm not scared, Mommy
Keep quiet
If that young lady saw an attack on the school, why won't you believe her
What attack
Who attacked the school
Birds did
Crows
And you're all sitting around here debating
What do you want them to do next
Crash through that window
(frightened by her mother) Mommy
Quiet
Why don't you all get home
Lock your doors and windows
(her hysteria rising) Put on your coats, children
(to Deke) What's the fastest road to San Francisco
The freeway, ma'am
Where do  get it
'm going out that way, lady
You can follow me
Then let's go
Now
haven't finished my drink
(on edge of panic, shouting at her children) Put on your coats
Do you want to get trapped here
can't find my scarf
Look in your sleeve
The door opens
Mitch and Al Malone come in
Melanie
At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily
(going to her) got here as fast as  could
Where's Cathy
At Annie's house
She's all right
Al, why aren't you over there where the attack was
Because  just got back from Dan Fawcett's place, that's why
He was killed last night
By birds
Now hold it, Mitch
You don't know that for a fact
What are the facts, Mr
Malone
Santa Rosa police think it was a felony murder
They think a burglar broke in and killed him
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today
(impatiently, to salesman) Are you coming
Take it easy, lady
(through window) There isn't a bird anywhere in sight
(quoting) "Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow or read, yet your heavenly father feeds them
" 'll never feed another bird as long as  live
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year
The town was covered with seagulls
Can't you please finish your drink
That's right, sir,  recall it large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything
(shaking his head) They always make a mess
We're better off without them
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it
They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened
Poor things
'm leaving
Are you coming
All right, all right
(he downs his drink) Hope you figure this out, folks
It's the end of the world
The Tides is silent for a moment
Well, 'd better get back to the cannery
What do  owe you, Deke
Let's see
Scallops and coffee
Hold it just a minute, Sebastian
Sholes turns to him
- his face very serious
Sebastian, 'm not an alarmist
No one ever said you were, Mitch
(flatly) think we're in trouble
don't know how or why this started, but know it's here and  know we'd be crazy to ignore it
(sarcastically) Ignore what
The bird war
(exploding) Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, the bird plague, you can call it what you want to, they're out there massing someplace and they'll be back, you can count on that
Ridiculous
Mrs
Bundy, why don't you go home and polish your binoculars
Go on, Mitch
If we don't do something now, if we don't get Bodega Bay on the move
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian
(after a long pause) No
don't, Mitch
Because  can't see any reason for it
It's happening
Isn't that a good enough reason
(thoughtfully) like Bodega Bay as well as any man
If  thought
(he shakes his head) Then help me, Sebastian
You're an important man in this town
If you'll help, the rest will
Help how
What do you want to do
'm not sure, but
If you don't even know what you want to do
Listen to him, please
(taking position beside Melanie) You listen to him, Sebastian
only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away
How
Mrs
Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz
About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch
We'll make our own fog
How do you plan to do that
With smoke
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's
We'll use smoke pots
Like the Army uses
What good'll that do
Smoke's as bad as birds
Birds are not bad
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke
Can we go on living here otherwise
Pause
They are silent
(slowly) It's worth a try, Sebastian
There is more silence as they all consider
And then suddenly: Look
They turn toward the window
- Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of the Tides Office
Two more swoop into the foreground of the window and out to the left
(alarmed) Gulls
They're back
They're only the usual
What are you
- The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the attendant who is in the act of filling the car
The owner is seen disappearing into the men's room
quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the Tides Restaurant
- nearer view of the gas station
second gull hits the man on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out and causing it to spill
The third and fourth gulls sweep by
The gas begins to flow away
- inside the Tides
Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie after him
Through the glass windows into the street we see people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas station
At the door, Mitch turns
(to Melanie) Stay back in here
Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch
They both
Melanie dashes back to her original place at the window
The   with her, we come to the window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to rescue the attacked gas station attendant
Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter away as the men appear to beat them off
Suddenly Melanie in the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks down
- on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is flowing to the right into the car park
- flowing down to the car park
- through the window
She suddenly looks toward the gas station
- along the flowing gas back to the station
- She turns back to the car park
' We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked below her
At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, has come to a stop and a man emerges
He is in the act of lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the happenings around the gas station
With this half-drawn attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar
- She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the man
' The man looks about him, holding the match  his fingers
As he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and he drops it
- Her horror-stricken face
- Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's car, and the one next to it go up in flames
- - The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured attendant
- very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the town rushing around the car park and the streets across the highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires
We see automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the parked cars
Some men have managed to start a fire hose and have trained it on the burning cars
Suddenly but slowly the foreground in the sky just below the  begins to fill with wheeling gulls
The whole picture below becomes obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop down on the town
raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone booth and motel off in the background
People are rushing out from the restaurant and look up in the sky
Gulls begin to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the restaurant
Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch: Mitch
Mitch
We see her look up to the sky
- The sky is full of seagulls
- Looking about her frantically
She turns her face up again to see the descending gulls
She is driven to take refuge in the phone booth
-     - slams the door shut
Gulls are now beating at the glass all around her
From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with clouds of birds coming on them
- looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her eyes for Mitch
- - in the phone booth
She turns and looks swiftly in the direction of the car park
Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water from the bay
They are turning the stream onto the burning cars
At this time, the birds are filling the area around them
They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds
- Her eyes turn up quickly
- We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds
Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car
- We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner coming toward her in the phone booth
We can see birds flying in and out of the windows of the car
We can see the arm and hand of the driver trying to beat them away
In the background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive
- as the car comes toward her in the booth
At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth
side view of the car after practically scraping the side of the booth
We see that it's full of birds attacking the driver
As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently give us a view of its interior
- watching the car
The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars
It explodes
- Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun
She turns
- She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no avail
One or two descend upon him
He throws the gun down and rushes back into the Tides Office
Melanie, with a slight turn, now sees: The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop their hose
shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping
At one moment the water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows of the phone booth
- recoils from this water attack
Through the streaming window she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover
To the left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its palomino-colored body covered with crows
It is bucking and leaping and kicking its van to pieces
At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows
His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are covered with attacking birds
He disappears from sight
Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides Town
Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the  and waving the birds away from them with flailing arms
- opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls crash around the booth causing her to go back
- looking out again toward Mitch
Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station
Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the smoking building
- looking across in horror
- For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly Mitch appears with the small child at the window
He calls down
One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office, another from the Tides Restaurant
They both wait below the window as Mitch drops the child
- watching this breathlessly
The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up
He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the windows
They disappear into the building
- holding her breath
- No sign of Mitch
- getting more desperate
- No sign of Mitch
Suddenly a chair flies through the window and Mitch climbs  and drops to the ground
- opening the door of the booth, yells out to him
- sees her and starts running toward the booth
- beating his way through the birds
He reaches the booth
close to the Tides Restaurant entrance
We see Mitch drag Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the through the birds into the restaurant
There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the windows
It is as though they are hiding from a storm
The is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch  , very hurriedly close the door
We see the gulls wheeling outside
There is a kind of stunned silence among the people
We can hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside
Suddenly a woman's voice  out: Why are they doing it
Why are they doing it
Some of the heads of the group turn
It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs
Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and helpless
Mrs
Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some words
([Mrs
Bundy offers a weak explanation of why the birds could have gone berserk like this
This information should be obtained from Dr
Stager
]) - looking across at this slight scene
They turn back and over their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity
(looking up) think they're going
Melanie follows his look
At this moment there is a loud They turn their heads suddenly
-  '  ' And past the heads of the other people who have also turned, we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has gone and gulls are coming in
Two or three of the men who are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the window, beating them out
They succeed in doing this
- They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the street
think it's safe to get out now
Don't let's take any chances
We've got to get Cathy
They open the door and make their way out into the street, running and looking about them desperately
There are one or two gulls flying around
Others are perched on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the sidewalk
There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as they move along past the last street and come into the more countrified part of the town
- We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which we see in the distance
There are some birds perched on the school roof
-   - going up the school road
He stops for a moment and looks up, Melanie following his look
- of wheeling gulls
-   - They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the school
Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt
- '  - There are a few blackbirds on it
' Look
the crows again
- Mitch starts off
Melanie restrains him
Careful, Mitch
The crows may be back in the play yard
- They advance cautiously
When they are level with the play yard, we see what they see
along the play yard
It is again full of crows
They walk stealthily past
the waiting crows
Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they approach Annie's house
Melanie glances apprehensively over her shoulder toward the crows
' Melanie and Mitch arrive
They come to a sudden stop
- ' woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the door
- He reaches the body
He rolls it over
- dead
- The shock registering on his face
- realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment what Mitch's reaction will be
-  - '
He kneels silently by the body
Gently, he touches Annie's face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to keep her warm
He turns away then
- with its    sign
Cathy is standing near the sign, with her eyes peering at something outside
- turning to follow Cathy's gaze
- Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers
- As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at the birds
Melanie dashes forward
(as the birds flutter into the air) Mitch
Don't
She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are now hovering flight
Please
Get Cathy
Let's get out of here
Her words reach him
Breathing heavily, he goes  the house and   carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a state of shock
The   him over to Melanie who holds Cathy to her
as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house
Mitch, you can't leave her out there
He
Melanie watches him
Over her shoulder is the white face of Cathy
We  a   and then a door is
- '
We see Mitch  from the house
The body is no longer in the pathway
He comes toward the
He joins Melanie and Cathy
The    of the three of them as they silently make their way past the crows once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her
They look out cautiously to the right
the crows again
They move forward stealthily,   of them
Another   past the crows
- The  is now behind them
They move away from us and go toward the waiting car
They arrive at the car
You drive, Mitch
She goes round the far side and gets into the car
Mitch slips in behind the driver's seat
The car turns into the and goes down the school road
-   - Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the , tensely
Melanie looks over her shoulder
(holding her breath) don't think they're coming
Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes wide, her lip trembling
They drive in silence, and then suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as the     on her face in shock
On our way back from taking Michele home
we
we heard the explosion and went outside to
see what
what it was
(pause) All at once the
the birds were everywhere
All at once
She
she pushed me inside and
they covered her
(pause) Annie
(pause) She pushed me inside
- as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her
-    flying low over the water, the it
The bay is silent
The gull spreads its wings to brake, and then sits on the water
The  continues low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the Brenner house in the distance
- Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed across the windows
He is on the roof now, testing the two attic dormer windows
He turns to look out over the bay
- covered with sitting gulls
In the distance, the town is still smoldering
But the sky is clear of birds
- picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where the ladder leans against the side of the house
- as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber
- as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her
She is looking out over the bay when he comes to her
This is not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture
Her hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked with soot
But beyond a surface physical appearance, there is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she stands looking toward the distant smoldering town
The town looks clear
The bay doesn't
How long have they been gathering there
The past fifteen minutes
(pause) It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it
They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again
Melanie nods
They are both silent, watching the bay
keep thinking of Annie
(she squeezes her eyes shut) (after a long pause) It
it doesn't look very different, does it
little smoke over the town, but otherwise
(looking) Even the birds sitting out there
It does look very much the same, Mitch
This could be last week
It may not be last week again for a long long time
They are both silent
Look
They're still coming
Mitch nods
Silence
Do you want to try your father again
(Melanie shakes her head
Puzzled, Mitch looks at her) tried a little while ago
The phone's dead
Have we still got power
Yes
(leaning against him) 'm tired, Mitch
'm so very very tired
(
) Mitch
'm getting something on the radio
- Lydia is hovering near the radio
Cathy is sitting on a footstool
The windows are boarded, and the lights in the room are on
tremendous amount of static is coming from the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them can't get any of the local stations
think this is San Francisco
would include formulation of a central financing committee to handle credit and to allocate responsibility for the various facets of the project
vote on the motion is expected early tomorrow morning
- listening
Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area
The round-up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect, but Commissioner Nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of the team of professionals unquote
(pause) In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill
One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety in the town
(pause) On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that
Is that all
(
) drew a standing ovation for the President
The Chief Executive, in discussing our relation to Europe and the rest of the world community said: "These various elements of our foreign policy lead as  have said to a single goal -- (sighing) We're going to need more wood for the fire
We can't let it go out
(continuing as drone in background) The goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states
This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future -- a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age
We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow
We may not reach it in our lifetime
But the quest is the great adventure of our century
We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility
(pause) In assuming the tasks of the Presidency,  said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger
This is our good fortune, and  welcome it now as  did when  first took office
(pause) For it is the fate of this generation -- Of you in the Congress and of me as President -- to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make
But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice
And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of
(pause) Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch
got them all, Mother
When do you think they'll come
don't know
If there are
larger birds, Mitch
they'll get into the house
That's a chance we have to take
Maybe we ought to leave
Not now
Not while they're massing out there
When
don't know when
We'll see what
Where will we go
don't know yet
think we'll be safe here
(Pause) Let's bring that wood in
What happens when we run out of wood
Music begins to play
The music is sweet, with violins and long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the tension being played in front of it
don't know
We'll break up the furni
(shouting) You don't know, you don't know
When will you know
When we're all dead
Like Annie
(shrieking it, her face white) Mother
(at Mitch) If your father were here
(sharply) Mother
'm trying my best
(shaking his head) 'm
trying
my
(trembling, nodding) 'm sorry, Mitch
- the strain showing on his face
He nods briefly
Let's get the wood
Why don't you make us all some coffee, Mother
- as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood
There is a  in the sky
Startled, glancing upward, they begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly scan the sky
- flying in tight formation
- Where are they heading
Inland
Santa Rosa
Maybe
- watching the birds
look of utter sadness crosses her face
It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well
(
) (gently) Come on
Let's get this wood in
Melanie nods
But the look of sadness stays on her face, and her eyes remain on the sky
- Lydia is pouring coffee into cups
In the dining room, we can  the  of the lovebirds
As Lydia pours the sound distracts her
Cathy is sorting candles at the couch
There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, kerosene lamps, a butane burner
Mitch is at the fireplace putting more wood on the fire
Melanie comes into the room and dumps another load
That's the last of it
Did you close the door
And locked it
Mitch, can  bring the lovebirds in here
(snapping it) No
Mom, they're in a cage
They're birds
- studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking
(softly) Let them stay in the other room
- her hand trembling as she pours the coffee
- as they all sit and accept their coffee
The room is silent except for the  of the fire
Mitch rises to put more wood on the fire
In the dining room, the lovebirds still are  wildly
Their chirping is the only sound in the house
Mitch
Why are they doing this
The birds
(putting wood on fire) don't know, honey
Why are they trying to kill people
wish  could say
But if  could answer that,  could also tell you why people are trying to kill people
The room is silent again except for the  of the lovebirds offscreen
And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall silent
- turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, her eyes widening
- waiting
- waiting
- waiting
- dead silent now
Each of them is sitting on the edges of their chairs, waiting
There is the   of splintering glass
Mitch
Shhh
Shhh
Silence
Into the silence, another pane of glass, , the  of a bird against the boards
Silence
More panes of glass
The  of birds striking the boards and the outside of the house begins building, almost like muffled drumbeats
, , with an irregularity of rhythm
Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, is the  of wings
And then, like another section entering, we begin to hear the  and  at the roof
- looking up toward the roof, the  getting louder
She squeezes her eyes shut
- as the child cuddles up into her arms
Over the other sounds, there comes a  , the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat of a woodpecker
It stops
It begins again
Rat-tat-tat tattat- tat
Tat- (in terror) 'm
'm sick, Melanie
want want to throw
Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom
'll go with you
They leave the room
Mitch and Lydia sit in silence
We Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of birds striking the house
- Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire
The  of the birds is still everywhere around the house
He looks at his watch
He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back door
It seems all right
The   him into the dining room
He stops at the cage with the lovebirds
- watching him
Is there menace or innocence in their eyes
He cannot tell
- looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement
There is suddenly a offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing sound of bigger beaks
Alarmed, he turns
- coming into the entry hall
- The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside assail the door
- turning quickly, the   him into the dining room
He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it toward the door
In the entry, he lifts the table on end and piles it against the door
He goes into the kitchen again, He upends the enamel-topped table, drags it to the back door
He is piling chairs against the table when Melanie
She looks at what he is doing with alarm
Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of desperation
Both turn back to the barricaded door
The and the  fills the void
The noise is a din now, insidious and increasingly more frightening
When will they stop
thought they'd have stopped by now
What time is it
Almost two a
m
You must be exhausted
How about you
She shakes her head
They both move into the dining room, the
The lovebirds are sitting in their cage, close together, silent
Mitch picks up a chair, ready to carry it to the front door
He hesitates, puts down the chair, goes to the cage
- looking at the birds, wondering
- looking back at him
Again, it is impossible to read their expressions
Malice or benevolence
- He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage
- watching, unmoving
- ' as he thrusts it through the bars
The birds sit unmoving
One of them tweets
- wonder if Cathy fed them
He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, takes out a small box of bird feed
- as his hand approaches the door
The birds are watching him
His hand hesitates
Then his thumb and forefinger lift the small catch on the cage door
His fingers open the door
Cautiously, in  , his hand goes into the cage
The birds sit and watch
One of them tweets
He removes the small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it in the cage
The birds hesitate another moment
Then, tweeting, they begin to eat
- as Mitch closes the door to the cage
Melanie is slumped against the wall
He goes to her and takes her in his arms
Wearily, she raises her head
The  of the shuffling, pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them
(holding her) You should have left when you wanted to
She shakes her head
You'd have been safe in San Francisco
don't want to be safe
want to be with you
There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like a small child's, confused but defiant
Holding her close, Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him
Exhausted, they stand in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of night sort of way
And suddenly
The lights go out
(in the darkness) The power
Mitch
Wait here
Don't move
The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds
In the blackness, we  the birds clawing and ripping, and the is enormously
flashlight suddenly goes on
- as he comes to her with the flash
We see them only dimly as he directs the beam upwards
We'd better light some of those lamps
No
wait
(pause) Hold me
In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss
It is almost black in the room except for the strange effect of the flashlight as he holds it behind her
think they're easing off
- kerosene lamp is burning
Melanie is awake, watching the fire
Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep on the couch
Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs
Mitch is asleep by the fire
The fire is burning brightly and steadily
The house is almost still
There is no longer the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another now: the sound of  , or dropping in a steady dribbling, difficult to place
- listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning
(whispering) Mitch
- as she turns toward him
(still whispering) Mitch
- asleep
- seeing this, making her decision
The  is still coming from somewhere in the house
She decides to let Mitch sleep, picks up a very long flashlight
- as she goes through the house, checking
She stops in the entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled against the door
Everything seems all right
She goes into the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam on the boarded windows
Satisfied, she goes down the corridor outside the bedroom
She opens the first bedroom door, enters, goes to the windows, plays the beam on them
Everything's all right
She comes into the corridor again, opens the second bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves
- climbing the steps to the attic
She stops outside the first door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light on the windows
Nothing
She comes out into the corridor, goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to the windows
They are boarded securely
She is starting back toward the door when she stops
- looking
- a pile of chipped and broken plaster
- turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling
- huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside
- turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, and suddenly, her eyes open wide
- sitting in the darkness, staring at her
- reacting
- wings spread in the beam of light
- backing to the door
The owl hits her, sends her staggering back, causing the door to slam shut
She looks up at the - a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward her
- in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds attack her
- in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face
- swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her
(
) Melanie
- grotesque and silent as she struggles with them
The room is a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering wings
(
) Melanie, open the door
He hurls himself against it
Inside the room, where Melanie struggles, we  his hammering on it
Melanie is overwhelmed by the birds
She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her
In the spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering of wings as the birds cover her
There is a stronger assault on the door by Mitch outside
(
) (screaming) Mitch, get her out of there
- Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in view
Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside
(
) Melanie
The door begins to open
- as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room
He begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time
He begins dragging her out of the room
Her clothes have almost been shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding
We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at the few birds that have escaped into the corridor
Mother, get a rope
Oh, my God, look at her
(shouting) Get a rope
She rushes off
He struggles grotesquely with the birds
There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication
He will not allow them to defeat him
large bird strikes his hand, knocking the club from it
- as the bird strikes at his face
He reaches out with his hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob
Another bird flutters into the corridor
- in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his hands
He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and is immediately attacked by the other bird
(yelling) Mother
Hurry
- as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a heavy piece of rope
Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily to the floor
Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and compassion
He takes the rope from her, loops it over the doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to the bannister, sealing the door
He turns immediately to Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia following
As they go downstairs: Cathy
Get a blanket and some bandages
(at the foot of the stars, on the verge of tears) Is she all right
- cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely
'm
'm
- as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the couch
Just lie there and keep still
Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket
By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage
But his hands are trembling, and he drops it
Let me do that, Mitch
She picks up the bandage
can handle it
know you can
(her eyes meet his) But 'd like to
He nods
Silently, she begins working on Melanie
(weakly) Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs
Brenner
Shhhh
Shhhh
Please
But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the cuts
The house is still
She works silently and quickly
(as she works) 'm not very good at this, Mitch
You're doing fine
(Apologizing) mean
want to
Pause
Listen
- raising her eyes
The room is silent
There is nothing to hear
They're gone
God have mercy, they're gone
- as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the table and chair
He opens the door a crack
- through the crack
Daylight is almost here
There are no birds visible
- from outside as Mitch opens it wider
The door is scarred and splintered
As he opens the door, one or two dead birds spill into the room
He steps out into the yard
Lydia is directly behind him
- a shambles, all the windows broken
- They're gone
The same pattern
But they'll be back
We won't be here
Where can we go, Mitch
There's no place to go
want to try for San Francisco
There are buildings there
Steel and concrete
(shaking her head) We'd never make it
They're probably all over the road
We have to try it
(a long silence) We can't stay here
(silence) Melanie needs help
(silence) Mother, the house won't take another attack
If
(pause) If
when we get to San Francisco
(pause) If they're already there
They won't be
If they are
We'll worry about that when we get there
'm frightened, terribly frightened
don't know what's out there, Mitch
What do we have to know, Mother
We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other
What else is there
Mother,  want us to stay alive
(nodding; then after a pause) started to say
inside
You don't have to
He holds out his hand to her
think we'd better get started
- It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following until the penultimate shot in the picture
The silence is deafening
There is not a bird in sight
The door to Melanie's convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house together and he helps her to the car
He puts her in the back seat, tucks the blanket around her
In the background is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them
Lydia comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking down at the dead birds
Cathy appears in the doorway to the house
- She is carrying the cage of lovebirds
She hesitates just outside the doorway
She looks at Mitch
- looking back at her
- , , Across the expanse of the desolated yard
May  take them, Mitch
He does not answer
She continues looking at him
They haven't harmed anyone
Take them
(with a slow nod) We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy
He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car
The   on Cathy who gets into the car on the front seat
Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, and looks toward the trees
- covered with waiting birds
- getting into car
Be careful with that door
Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly
Mitch does the same with his door
(weakly) Mitch, if they hear the car starting
if they see movement
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road
(pause) Are you ready
- ' turning the key
The motor springs to life
- anticipation on all the faces
All right
(he takes a deep breath) Here we go
- from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard
The bay is still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it passes the gate and starts down the road
-    - as they begin driving slowly
The wires are down
small fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact
The car continues to move
It turns the first bend in the road
-  - She gasps quickly
-     -  ' standing, waiting silently
-   - as the tension begins to starts
Shhh
Shhhh
-    - as they approach the derelict barge
It is covered with waiting seagulls
- seeing them
Her lip begins to tremble
- turning toward the side of the road ahead
-     - '
covered with waiting birds
(whispering) Mitch, let's turn back
Shhh
Shhhhh
- as the car passes
barricade has been set up on the front porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his hands
The porch is covered with waiting birds
At the boarded window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap
- reacting
-   - '
as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding road to town
The birds are sitting on some of the still- standing wires, watching, waiting
-    -    as the car turns a bend in the road
There are thousands of birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every pole, on every fence
Mitch
- as he stops the car and looks ahead
- in the middle of the road, stopped
Ahead are the birds
- frightened, try not to reveal her fear
Can we turn back
- don't think so
If we get through town,  think we'll be all right
- There is a long silence
It is Melanie who has the strongest reason for fearing the birds
It is Melanie, her fear growing, who makes the decision
Then go ahead, Mitch
- as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds
- as she turns to look out the window on her side
- as the car moves past them slowly
- closing her eyes
- ' through the windshield
The roof and sills are covered with birds
The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the gutter
But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken windows
- , The tension on their faces, - as the car approaches them
The windows are all broken, and merchandise is lying on the sidewalk
Birds are everywhere, waiting
- lying on the sidewalk, clutching a television set in his arms
- strained, looking at the road ahead
- a clear sky, a bird-free stretch, - (almost as a prayer) Here we go
(he rams down on the accelerator) -   - as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead in a burst of speed
- taking wing
- taking wing
- screaming
Mitch
- wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend
- through the windshield, as a flock of birds take wing immediately ahead
- from the inside, as birds flutter against it
- from the inside, as a beak slashes it, letting in a thin line of light
- wrenching at the wheel again, another bend
- navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it in straight lines
- in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over their heads, letting in more light
- More slashes, more light in scattered beams
- her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the owl
- more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way
- (almost a prayer) Dear God
dear God
please, please, what have we done
Please
(and then in anger at the roof and the birds) Can't they leave us alone
(shrieking it) -    all the passengers, as the roof suddenly rips back
- from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof tears back
- This is too much for her
She screams at sight of the birds, and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder
- as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need
She puts her arm around Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close
- racing along as the birds hover over it
- his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal
- streaming canvas ribbons behind it
It turns another bend in the road
-    - (  ) It is arrow-straight, no curves
- in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway
It begins to outdistance the birds
The gap widens
flock of birds attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into them and through them
The gap grows wider and wider
They are well ahead of the birds now
- We're losing them
- only a nod, his face streaming tears
-   ('
) as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the distance
- on the back seat
Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release of tension
Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles Melanie's head on her shoulder
Melanie, her eyes glistening, looks ahead through the windshield
- all their faces visible
Mitch
Do
do you think they'll be all right
In the trunk
Can they breath
(with the faintest smile) think they'll be all right, honey
There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the wind
Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension
They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches up to turn down the sun visor
It looks
it looks clear up ahead
- moving      into magnificent sunrise over the crest of the hills
Further and further into the distance it goes
