href <b>// --> </b> Rocky "" by Sylvester Stallone ,
:      1/7/76  : - " 12, 1975 - " The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can
The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle
The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting
In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black
The white fighter is
He is thirty years old
His face is scarred and thick around the nose
His black hair shines and hangs in his eyes
Rocky fights in a plodding, machine-like style
The   dances and bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy
But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink
He grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead
The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood
They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters
In the thick smoke they resemble spectres
Everyone is hustling bets
The action is even heavier in the balcony
housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet
The   and the fighters return to their corner
Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring
The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers across the ring at Rocky
(to cornerman) 'm gonna bust his head wide open
In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled, balding , who is an employee of the club
He works on Rocky without any enthusiasm
(lackluster) Ya waltzin' -- Give the suckers some action
Hey -- (overriding) Ya movin' like a bum -- Want some advice -- Just gimme the water
2
rushes up to Rocky
He is sixty-five, with yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses
Should  bet the fight don't go the distance -- Ya feel strong
Absolutely
Ya want some good advice
just want the mouthpiece
The
Rocky makes the sign of the cross
The fighters engage in battle
The other fighter grabs Rocky in a clinch and purposely butts him
The butt opens a bleeding cut on the corner of Rocky's eye
Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into the man's body
Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the fighter is out for the night
The fans throw rubbish into the ring
Rocky ignores it
The fans loudly go about collecting bets
The referee does not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher
Two new fighters enter the ring
Rocky slips on a tattered robe
Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion
" Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a six rounder between local lightweights
Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a cigarette from a spectator
The fighter on the stretcher passes behind him
He watches for a moment and continues up the aisle
Before he even reaches the rear of the club the and the next fight has already begun
Rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club
: - Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his locker for his hat
Also in the dingy room are ten other fighters
Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner
3
#1 Tomorrow me an' my woman are gonna tip on down to Atlantic City, man
#2 It's cold, Bro'
#1 That's right,  got the city to myself
Another paces nervously
Two other fighters shadowbox and spit nervously on the floor
young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable that is
The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer and joking with three other fighters
Some of the fighters are smoking
The room is cloudy
short man of fifty enters
He is dressed in a sweater buttoned over a t-shirt
Balboa
Rocky raises his head
The promoter steps over
(continuing) Twenty bucks for the locker an' cornerman -- Two bucks for the towel an' shower, seven for tax -- The house owes ya, sixty-one dollars
The man peels off the money and departs
Rocky closes his locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves
- Rocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly
The trolley is empty except for a thin old black
The black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face
Rocky becomes self-conscious
(almost apologetic) 'm a fighter
4
(tired) Yo' iz an accident
- Rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block
He waves at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back
Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty bookstore
Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway
Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the "   "
He peers into the dark store and sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window
He mumbles to the dog and continues to the corner
'  - short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located in the most deprived section of South Philly
He kicks away the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and enters
'  - The narrow hallway is painted olive brown
single light bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor
'  - Rocky enters
The one-room apartment is drab, with a curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall
Nailed against the far wall is a mattress
The mattress is used as a punching bag
Stuffing spills out of the center
Rocky drops his coat on the floor
He puts on a pair of glasses
He crosses to a small turtle bowl
He lifts the creatures
Look who's home
Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then places an old 45  record on a battered phonograph
The record is a tune, "
" As the   , Rocky picks up his hairbrush
Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the record
He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning to thousands of adoring fans
He then switches into a bullish fighting stance and throws several punches
The water boils
Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands
5
- We  the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it sits majestically above City Hall
- Rocky is walking along the waterfront
He has a bandaid over one eye
He looks at the rugged stevedores going about their business
He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded
Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked car
These men look like blood drinkers
#1 Yo, Rock -- How's your Boss
Real good
#2 Fightin' again
Yeah, here an' there
#1 Mebbe we make sum money togather soon
Give ya boss my best
Rocky shrugs and moves away
He nears a heavy man working the crane
The heavy man looks frightened
He stops the crane and hurries into the ship's hole
Rocky dashes up the gangplank
- The man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked crates and coffee beans
Rocky sprints after him
He lunges and flings the man by the neck against the wall of stacked cargo
(terror-filled) Don't hit the face
Not the face
Mr
Gazzo wants the two hundred now
6
Honest to God 'm broke -- Gimme a break
Mr
Gazzo says  should get two hundred or break the thumb
Please,  need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs
At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by stevedores
Rocky remains cool
Goin' fishin'
The man drops the hook
What's ya name again
Bob
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man
Me,  ain't emotionally involved
Rocky's determined expression strikes home
The fat man quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small wad of bills
(continuing; counting) hundred an' thirty
That's it, 'm broke
That's it
-- Completely
That's it
What about for food an' stuff
7
You have my food in ya hand
Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's flushed expression
The juice is climbin' every week
know the juice is climbin' -- been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest
Ya still light seventy
Waits
-- Be smart
Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars
It's yours
The man quickly removes his coat and extends it
(continuing) See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's don't have to know nuthin'
'll go tape up the hand like ya broke my thumb
Gazzo won't be wise to nothin' -- Be a smart guy, keep the coat, we'll fake like ya broke the hand
The man extends his coat again
Rocky suddenly grabs the man's thumb and bends him to his knees
(almost a whisper) No - no - no - Please - Please - Please don't
Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock
The thumb is fine
That's what coulda happened
(walks off
) 8
- Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in South Philly
The shop is not very prosperous looking
In the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed Kittens -- $1
50"
Rocky stops at this shop every morning
He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies
He taps the window and whistles
He  a girl behind the counter and presses his face against the window and does his impression of the Hunchback of Notre Dame
The girl nervously looks away
The girl behind the counter is
She is not very attractive, but pleasant-looking
Thirty years old
Brown hair pulled back
Light skinned
She wears glasses
Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so painfully shy nothing ever gets started
Rocky enters
- Could you take the puppy out -- It can breathe
Please - Please, nothin' -  paid for this dog and can do whatever want with it -  can throw it through the window if  want - Now give me my two dollars back before  do throw it through the window
Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches the bag out of her hand
He removes the puppy and hands it to Adrian
Get away from me - Give me that
Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it to the lady
She nervously exits
How's the turtle food this week
9
Fine
Me, 'm kinda aggravated
'm sorry
Ain't your fault - Here's the problem
Adrian nods
Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated
The last food  got here had more moths than flies -- An' the moths get caught in my turtle's throat -- That makes them cough -- The , a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and waves at Rocky
(continuing) Yo, Gloria --  was talkin' about the turtle food -- Like was sayin', the moths get caught in the turtle's throat an' makes 'em cough
(coughs) little cough an'  gotta smack 'em on the shell -- An' whatta think they get
Adrian shrugs
(continuing) smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get
What
don't know
Shell-shocked
Both the Owner and Adrian smile
10
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh
Inventin' jokes ain't easy
Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop
Inside is a huge dog
(continuing) How's Butkus this mornin'
Ain't had time to check 'em
Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks very happy
Yo, Butkus -- Dead
Play dead
The dog plays dead
What kinda dog is this again
Bullmastiff
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days - We board it ain't a animal shelter, 'know
Adrian,  want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess
(Adrian nods
) Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop
- Gazzo picks up Rocky
11
'  -  - and his    sit in the front seat
Rocky is in the back seat
He only had a hundred an' thirty
--  think he's good for the rest next week, Mr
Gazzo
(patiently) Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it
Gazzo hands Rocky a twenty
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks
How'd you do last night
Fine
Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the mirror and smiles
Did ya get the license number
Of wa
Of the truck that run over your face
Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky
Yo Rock
Did  give you a job this mornin
How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like  asked ya
When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid
figure if  break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin no more
12
It don't matter
It's my reputation
These guys think they can get off light
It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business
See ya killer
Gazzo gets into his car
(to Bodyguard) The Rock's a good kid
(emotionless) meatbag
They pull away
- Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to Goldmill's Gym
On the way he passes several familiar people and exchanges waves
Out front is a young Irishman who runs a soft pretzel stand
His name is
It is apparent from his face he was a prize fighter
He is blind and mentally defective
See the fight last night
Nah,  was fightin' myself
Apollo Creed beat the bum to pieces
/
- Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy spoons
Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive among themselves
Two winos lean against the entrance
Rocky enters the gym
The place is nearly full
The of   and    makes the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of machinery
Over the loudspeaker  by the Isley Brothers out
The music adds a background to the  of the  ,    and the of
13
The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other
As Rocky walks through the gym many of the  pause to wave and yell greetings
#1 Hey, hear ya knocked Spider Rice out in the sixth
The third -- Shoulda seen it
Rocky passes another  punching the heavy bag
#2 (removes glove) Hey, Rock, touch my hand
How come
#2 'mon, it's important
Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand
#2 (continuing) Can ya tell  just whacked-off
Rocky smiles and moves away
- The dressing room is lined with dented lockers
Wooden benches stretch across the room
On the wall is a sign that reads, "
" Rocky goes to his locker
He tries to open it but fails
He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers
Still it does not open
He shakes the lock forcefully, no luck
Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the situation
After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the bench and smashes open the lock
Opening the door Rocky is taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes
(mumbling) These ain't my clothes
14
He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside of the door
(continuing) These ain't my pictures
short powerful man of thirty-five enters
His hair looks like it has been shaped with hedge clippers
His name is Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here
It ain't your locker no more
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more
Listen, 'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey --  put ya stuff in the bag over there
Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping bag and follows Mike across the room
Mike leans his head into the shower room
Two Latin fighters are lathering up
Hey, Peanut, gimme some soap, Man
(irate) Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you, Nobody -- You don't call me Peanut
Peanut, gimme some soap
The fighters laugh
Inflamed, Mike removes a bar of soap from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter
It hits just above the man's head
The fighters are shocked into silence
Mike turns and exits with Rocky
The fighters curse them loudly in Spanish
15
- Rocky and Mike move past fighters going through their training routines
You were ready to bite that guy's face
Yeah -- See the fight last night
Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad
Creed's great
Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to another chore
- The Owner, , sits on a stool near the entrance
He wears a baggy suit
He is in his late seventies
Rocky approaches
Mickey is conversing with another fighter
don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties -- Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey
(monotoned) What
said, how ya feelin'
(dryly) Do you see me talkin'
Huh
(low) Yeah
16
(spitting) Then stand there an' wait till 'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need
Okay, go to work
(to Rocky) Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want
was talkin' with ya man, Mike
-- Hey, how come  been put outta my locker
Dipper needed it
Rocky turns and looks at  sparring
Dipper is a young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression
(continuing) Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato
Tomato
Facts is facts
run a business here -- 'm cleanin' house -- Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his trainer sings "'
" (continuing) How old are ya
What
How old
Come July, twenty-five
17
More like thirty
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference
-- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker
The legs must be goin'
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature
That was my locker for six years
Did ya fight last night
Yeah -- Did ya win
Yeah, Kayo
Who'd ya fight
Spider Rice
Rice is a bum
You think everybody  fight is a bum
Ain't they
Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers
18
(continuing) Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire
Listen, 'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it
Hey, ever think about retirin'
No
Think about it
Yeah, sure
Shrugging, Rocky moves away
(continuing) think 'm gonna take a steam -- Shoulda seen me fight -- Did good, y'know
Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail
(gesturing towards Rocky) Known him since he was fifteen --  waste of life
Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room
He passes Big Dipper sparring in a ring
Dipper spits a mouthful of water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky
(to Rocky) dig yo' locker, Man
Time, Dipper
19
Dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring
Scene  on Rocky's crestfallen expression
He moves off
- At sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet shop
He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a bag
He taps on the window with a chicken bone
- Inside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter
She hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses
Rocky enters
Wow -- cold
Good night to catch pneumonia
Adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter
Rocky fumbles idly among the pet toys
(continuing) Ah --  came in here for somethin'
Oh, yeah, would ya like somebody to walk ya home
The girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority complex will not permit it
Rocky understands
(continuing) Hey, how's my buddy doin'
(looks into Butkus' cage) -- Nice dog -- Well, 'll see ya later
Goodnight, Rocky
Rocky exits
Adrian watches his departure with mixed emotions
'  - short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar
He throws the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter can
The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George Washington pointing at a pile of garbage
The caption reads, "There was no litter at Valley Forge
" 20
'  - Rocky enters the bar
He sits the Drunk in a booth
Several drinkers wave at him
sets a mug of beer in front of him
Rocky seems to be looking for someone
Catch pneumonia out there -- Seen Paulie
Andy casually nods towards the men's room
Rocky traverses the room and passes   leaning on the bar
'  - Rocky enters the restroom
It is a vile stench hole with years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall
is presently trying to comb his hair in the only remaining piece of mirror in the room
Paulie is in his early thirties
He is medium height
Brown hair
Square shouldered
He has a foul personality
classic misanthrope
Yo, Paulie
(very drunk) Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror
'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror
Yo, Paulie
What
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder
Forget her
You could do better than my sister
Every mornin', every night pass by --  smile
() 21
(') say jokes
Nothin'
She looks at me
(annoyed) Looks, huh
Yeah, like  was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta  need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister
My sister's a friggin' loser
Hey -- Sometimes she gets me so crazy, 'd like to split her head with a razor
Don't get mental, man
Ya caught me in a bad mood
Ya always in a bad mood -- Adrian ain't sharp
The restroom stench is overwhelming
Rocky covers his nose with the neckline of his t-shirt
(continuing) She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old
She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up
'm thirty myself
22
An' you're dyin' alone, too
don't see no crowd around you, neither
(pointing at the wall) wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror
Let's get outta this stink
'  - The restroom door opens
Rocky guides Paulie out
Though stumbling, Paulie talks as he walks
The girl's dryin' up
She's gotta live a little before her body dries up
You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her
'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow
Sure
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right
Absolutely
Paulie smiles and Rocky guides him to a booth
Rocky steps to the bar
Andy leans over to him
That was alotta crap to go through for a dinner invite
Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a suspended television
the nightly sports broadcast is on
The   is at the airport and about to interview the heavyweight champion of the world, Creed is twenty-eight years old
He is a tall, smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee- colored face
23
He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and cornermen
Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on
The Commentator interviews Creed as he and his followers disembark a private jet
How was the flight, Champ
Very high an' very fast
Apollo's crowd smiles almost automatically at everything he says
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson
He was big, an' very nasty so destroyed him in a hurry -- Now 'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- gala occurrence
Still to be held in Philadelphia
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia
-- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year
Where're you off to now
Apollo draws his wife close
24
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls
(looks straight into the camera) Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports
Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker
Apollo's entourage laughs and they move on
The Commentator faces the camera
Jerry Simpson at Kennedy Airport with the Champion, Apollo Creed
The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at the television with a pensive stare
Andy has been speaking the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast
Nobody cares what's happenin' in the world of sports nomore -- Downhill
Baseball, downhill -- Basketball, downhill
Football's goin', too
Bank on it
Baseball use to be America's best sport
Sure -- Nuttin' like squattin' through a great double header, but now baseball's all business
The news report with Apollo ends
Andy drinks
(continuing) Where are the real fighters
The pros
Today we jig clowns
25
Clown
Yeah
He took his best shot an' became champ -- What shot did you ever take
Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with yourself
Fine
But me, gotta business here --  don't need to take no shot
Becoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie slumped unconscious in the booth
Rocky exits the bar
Andy turns to his customers
(continuing; boldly) Take a shot, he says
-- Sure, 'll take a shot
Laughing, Andy pours himself a shot
- Rocky passes an all-night sandwich shop
In the window hangs the sign "  ,
" Out front are several   and
They are much too young to be out so late
boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to Rocky
(aggressively) Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man
No wine -- Bad for ya' brain
'mon, man, it's cold, man
No wine
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar
26
Why
(sarcastically) 'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar
No dollar
Hey, give Rocky a dime
#2 How come
So he can call all his friends
(mildly embarrassed) That's an old one
Buy us some Thunderbird, man
Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall
Is that Marie
-- Marie, ya brother know you're hangin' out so late
The girl, , assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting to impress her friends
Screw you
(awed) What'd you say
Screw you, yoyo
The gang laughs
Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty
Huh
27
Hey -- What
Stuff it, man
(shakes her) Don't you never say that -- (to the gang) -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum
This is our place, dig
The gang reluctantly backs up a step
Don't ya never come round this girl -- Go home
#2 This is our corner, man
You go, chump
Rocky moves forward and they scatter
They quickly move off
(backpedaling) We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun
Pull heat on me
-- 'll dent ya face
Rocky leads the girl away
- Rocky is walking the young girl home
They are presently cutting through a dark public school yard
They pass through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights located at the top of the school building
The atmosphere is somewhat eerie
28
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys
They teach ya bad things
like 'em
If you don't you can f-- Hey
When  was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood
(bored) Yeah
She attempts to light a cigarette
Rocky nonchalantly tosses it to the ground
Make your teeth yella -- like yella teeth
Makes your breath like garbage
Maybe  like garbage
Rocky and Marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'
Why
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty
They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out
() 29
(') Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious
Ya get no respect
gotta use a bad word -- Whore
You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore
'mon, Rocky
'm twelve
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it
What
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say ''you remember Marie
' 'No, who was she
' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop
' 'Oh, now  remember
'
See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep
Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard
Standing in the shadows of the building are three young muggers
The light from their cigarettes flares red in their faces
The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them down the block
Rocky sees them and stops and faces the three
The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of twenty yards
Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander away
Rocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him
(points down the block) That's your house, ain't it
Marie nods
(continuing) Listen,  hope ya don't -- 30
won't
What was  gonna say
Ya hope  don't keep acting like a whore or 'll turn into one, right
Ya, somethin' like that
They exchange smiles and Marie moves away
Rocky has made an impact on her life
Goodnight, Rocky
'Night, Marie
She takes a few more steps and pauses again
Fuck you, Creepo
The girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay
(walks off) Yeah, who're you to give advice, Creepo
'  - and his  and  are seated in the offices of
Jergens, a successful promoter looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of Apollo Creed
Are the doctor's reports confirmed
Definitely -- (reading) -- It says here, Mac Lee Green has suffered a seriously cracked third metacarpal in his left hand
31
Damn
suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green
It ain't just Green, what about the time Apollo's invested -- believe we can find a solution
Solution, nothin' -- What about the Bicentennial fight
Jergens, don't play games with my client
Apollo has already done nearly a million dollars worth of publicity -- Ten million's worth
-- And has made contractual obligations with over twenty different organizations -- He doesn't want to be embarrassed
You best find me another ranked contender an'  mean in a flash, man
(holding up some notes) contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth
32
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth
Hell with Fourth of July, man
Ten thousand things'll be goin' down on the Fourth of July
-- Apollo wants to be first
That may not be possible, Jimmy
This man here is the Star, dig -- Don't cause him to breathe heavy -- Now what 'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes
Went to California and gained fifty pounds -- and  called every worthwhile contender, but they say five weeks isn't enough time to get in shape
Apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid
They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world
Apollo, 'm sure there's a way to salvage this
Nobody wants to be dissected on the country's birthday
33
All  can counter with is that 'm a goddamn good promoter -- 've promoted in every country in the world -- and 've tried to the best of my abilities
Perhaps you're right, and no one wants to be beat on the country's birthday
don't know what else to say -- do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty
You's the novelty, Champ
Give my main man a raise
Everyone laughs
(continuing) Now here's what's goin' down
Listen, 'cause 'm gonna say this but one time
On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial 'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig
snow-white underdog
An' 'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear
An' 'll tell you why, 'cause 'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday
Now that's the way  see it an' that's the way  want it
It's very American
No, man, it's very smart
34
- Late that afternoon Mr
Gazzo's white 1970 Cadillac pulls up to Rocky's apartment
Rocky is in the back seat with the loan shark
Gazzo's bodyguard is driving
Gazzo flips through a small black notepad
Next Wednesday  grab a grand from Snyder
An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli
Ya sure
Hey, screw ya brain on right
Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight
How'd you know
(smiles) You think  don't hear things
Paulie's sister
(abrasively) Hear she's retarded
(dryly) She ain't retarded, she's shy
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo
Does that bum have to say that
The Bodyguard reddens
Gazzo motions to his Bodyguard to relax
35
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems
He's always in a bad mood
(laughs) Count ya blessin's
Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work -- The Bodyguard has been looking at Rocky with murderous eyes
don't like ya face
Don't like yours neither
Kiss my ass
Move your shoulders down
Mr
Gazzo is amused
He steps out of the car, followed by Rocky
(smiles) Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock
Some people just hate for no reason, y'know
Yeah
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time
Thanks, Mr
Gazzo
Rocky enters his apartment and Gazzo drives off
'  - The     Miles Jergens' office
Apollo pores over a large record book
How 'bout this Billy Snow
36
Fouls
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith
Too old, dull fighter
(points at a name) Bobby Judge is a good boy
don't feel heat from the name
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy
Still don't feel no heat
(sighs) Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo
This man
Everybody leans forward
(continuing; much amused) 'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor -- Don't matter -- That name
'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on
(laughs) Who discovered America
An Italian, right
So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors -- He won't last one round
37
Listen,  gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit
don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong
Southpaw, nuthin' -- 'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion
' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie
Everyone laughs
: - Rocky and Paulie walk towards his house
Even though it is cold and dark, a group of kids conduct an energetic game of half-ball
(Half-ball is a variation of stick-ball
) (mimes throwing) usta be deadly at half-ball
hate the friggin' game
'd like to talk some business
What kinda business
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen
Paulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist
(continuing) Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints
Maybe ya should see a doctor
38
don't need a doctor,  need a different job
Maybe another job is the best thing
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo
Tell him 'm a friend an' would do a good job
Tell him  ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector
Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him 'm a good worker
Gazzo's gotta come to you
'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now
- They continue past the Atomic Hoagie Shoppe, Inc
group of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front
Rocky pauses
He sees Marie, the little girl from the night before, hanging around with the guys
She sees Rocky
Marie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the opposite direction
The gang smiles and continues to pitch quarters
Anger and disappointment register across Rocky's face
You know her
Rocky shrugs and the two men move off
Filling the night air is the   of pitching
'  - The men arrive at Paulie's home
It is at the top of a dimly-lit four story walk-up
39
Ya sister knows 'm comin'
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited
'  - Paulie unlocks the apartment door and enters
Rocky stiffly follows
Paulie's sister steps out of the kitchen
large serving spoon is in her hand
The  is on
She stops short and eyes Rocky
She is visibly unsettled by Rocky's unexpected presence
(weakly) Paulie, you're late
She looks at Rocky again
Did you call the hospital
(to Rocky) If 'm ten minutes late, she calls the hospital
Adrian enters the bedroom and slams the door
Paulie follows
An argument ensues and Rocky overhears
the argument is  a   rising from the
(
) Unfortunate luck for fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac Lee Green
The slugging fighter acquired a serious fracture in his left hand after an aggressive day of sparring -- Champion Apollo Creed says he'll be 'shopping for another victim,' to fill Green's vacancy for the Bicentennial Championship Fight to be held in Philly next month
By the way, rumor has it that this will be the most widely-viewed sporting event in the entire world -- and that includes the Super Bowl, folks
Today
swimmers set a new
40
Meanwhile, the argument between brother and sister continues in the bedroom
Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home
Look at me, 'm not ready for this
Like it would make a difference if you were, right
This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out
No
can't
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an'  don't wanna know from nothin'
Paulie, please -- Hey,  want ya out instamaticly
-- 'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live
Do, enjoy life
Like you
Don't get wise with me want ya to stop bein' a loser
can't go out
Why
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving
've gotta turkey in the oven
Paulie turns and leaves the bedroom
He enters the kitchen
Grabbing a large fork, he opens the oven and spears the turkey
With the turkey suspended on the end of the fork, Paulie heaves the dripping bird out the window
41
Adrian has seen this and is shattered
She runs back into the bedroom and locks the door
Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life
Ya hungry, Rock
Maybe ya better forget it
Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice
Rocky walks over to Adrian's bedroom door and begins speaking to the enclosed girl
Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky
Ah, ah -- Ah, it's kinda hard for me to think of somethin' to say, y'know -- 'Cause  never talked to a door before,  mean whatta ya say to a door
Rocky turns away and begins to walk off
(continuing) Maybe  better forget it
Try again, c'mon, try again
Rocky goes over to the door and begins speaking again
Ah, Adrian,  know ya ain't too happy at this moment, but would ya do me a favor -- ain't got nobody to spend Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout you an' me goin' out -- Get somethin' to eat, maybe laugh a little, who knows
Would ya like,  dunno, go out together
Adrian opens the door
She already has her winter coat on
42
(continuing) We'll have a good time
Paulie opens the front door and gives Rocky an encouraging smile
(continuing) What's ya sister like to do
Ice skate
didn't want no turkey anyway
It's Thanksgiving
To you, to me it's Thursday
- Rocky and Adrian enter a deserted skating rink
Looks quiet, y'know
think it's closed
think mebbe we're early or somethin' -- From across the rink a   yells at them
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed
Yo, we're closed
(yells back) Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody
43
(starts to walk over) Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out
(softly) We could go somewhere else an' -- Rocky approaches the Cleaner
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'
Listen,  gotta problem
This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing -- This a con
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise -- Few minutes
Ten minutes
Ten minutes for ten dollars
Yeah, give 'er the Blades
- Adrian has on skates
Rocky follows her onto the ice
He wears street shoes
44
Aren't you skating
Ain't skated since  was fifteen -- That's when started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles
Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more
All  wanted to prove was  weren't no bum -- That  had the stuff to make a good pro
And you never got the chance
The Cleaner yells from the sideline
Nine minutes
Hey,  ain't cryin'
still fight
Kinda do it like a hobby
See 'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded
But  guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right
But you never had a chance to prove yourself
Absolutely
Eight minutes
Adrian slips and Rocky breaks her fall
just dislocated my finger
Ohh
Seven minutes
45
It ain't your fault -- originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight
(opens his wallet) That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' broke my hands on his head -- lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think
Six
How 'bout some Cokes
Cost ya a buck
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes
Adrian does a slight turn and Rocky has to speed up and nearly falls
(continuing) See,  ain't graceful, y'know --  don't move good -- Stink as a dancer too -- But can really swat,  hit hard,		real hard, but 'm a southpaw an' nobody wants to fight a southpaw
-- Havin' a good time
Adrian nods and is very nervous
The Cleaner moves carefully across the ice
(continuing) 'know how  got started in the fight racket
By accident
Here -- Three minutes
46
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- weren't born with much brain so  better use my body
For the first time, Adrian laughs
(continuing) What's funny
My mother told me just the opposite
She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain
' Time
The Cleaner walks over as Rocky and Adrian get off the ice
(continuing) That's ten bucks
must be goin' deaf 'cause thought ya said, 'ten cents
' Rocky hands him a dime
(weakly) How 'bout for the Cokes
Charge it
Rocky and Adrian start to leave
Rocky pauses at the door and fishes into his pocket and hands over eleven dollars
(continuing) Had ya goin', didn't , huh
He grins and leaves
47
- Some people are very shy by nature
suppose
would say you're very shy bu nature
suppose
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me
It doesn't bother me either
Then why did  bother bringin' it up
'Cause 'm dumb, that's why
'know,  think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- 'm dumb an' you're shy
It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug
It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum
don't think you're a bum
'm at least half a bum
Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket
The roughest part is the mornin' after
Morning after
48
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound
Sometimes  feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom
Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts
But the thing 'm proud of is  been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke
That's rare
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad
Guess
(pause) 'Cause you can't sing or dance
Rocky smiles
'  - Rocky and Adrian enter his one-room apartment
She is nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room
Rocky goes to the icebox
Would ya like a glass of water
No thanks
Adrian looks at the mirror above Rocky's dresser
She sees a high school photo of Rocky
He once was handsome and smooth-faced
Rocky steps up behind her and his face is reflected in the mirror
He turns on his cheap
He reaches into the turtle bowl
Here's the guys  was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link
sold them to you
49
(very embarrassed) Oh, yeah,  bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain --  had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off
Do you have a phone
had it pulled
People callin' all the time
Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call
wanna let my brother know where  am
'you really wanna call
Yes,  do
You sure
Yes
Why
think he might be worried
'll call your brother
Rocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn
(continuing) Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's with me
'll call ya later
Rocky closes the window and faces the woman
She is not smiling
She looks frightened
50
(continuing) What's the matter
Ya don't like the room
It's fine
It's only temporary
It's not that -- What's the problem
You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it
don't think  belong here
It's okay
No,  don't belong here
It's all right -- You're my guest
've never been in a man's apartment before
(gesturing) They're all the same
'm not sure  know you well enough --  don't think 'm comfortable
Yo, 'm not comfortable either
(standing) should leave
51
But 'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation
Adrian moves to the door
Rocky intercepts her
(continuing; softly) Would ya take off your glasses
(dumbstruck) What
The glasses
Please
Rocky removes her glasses and looks deeply into her eyes
(timidly) -thank you
Do me another favor
What
Could ya take off that hat
After a moment, Adrian removes the hat
She is becoming rather pretty
(continuing) always knew you was pretty
Don't tease me
The woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing
Rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body
wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't have to kiss me back if ya don't feel like it
Rocky softly kisses the woman
Her arms hang limp
He puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond
Her hand glides like smoke up his back
52
She embraces his neck
The dam of passion erupts
She gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years
'  - The following day, Rocky strolls down the street to Goldmill's Gym
Out front a group of young blacks stop talking and study Rocky as he passes
Rocky's eyebrows knit in confusion
'  - Rocky climbs the stairs and enters the gym
In a matter of seconds, his presence is known and the athletes stare in wonderment
The big black heavyweight contender, Dipper, throws down his towel in disgust and turns away
Mike quietly approaches Rocky
Hey, Rock -- What happened
'Bout what
Mickey Goldmill steps out of his office
Did ya get the message, kid
Message -- What message
Mickey pulls out a card from his breast pocket
He hands it to Rocky
Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed
Ya puttin' me on
Here's the card
When was they here
53
'Bout an hour ago
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners
said that before
Rocky turns from Mickey and jogs out of the gym
Mickey fumbles with his rosary beads
(continuing) Waste of life
- Rocky steps off a bus in mid-town Philadelphia
He hurries down Broad Street
Every few steps he breaks into a trot
He enters a skyscraper
-  - Rocky exits the elevator and enters the office of Miles Jergens' Productions
'  - The  is slightly startled by Rocky's excited expression
May  help you
Rocky hands her the business card
(continuing) Your name, please
Balboa, Rocky Balboa
The Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office
Rocky eyes the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls
The Secretary returns
You may go in
Rocky collects himself and enters
54
'  - Miles Jergens warmly greets him
Hello, Mr
Balboa -- 'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat
Thanks
Mr
Balboa -- (overriding) Rocky
Rocky, do you have any representation
manager
No -- Just me
Rocky, would you be interested in -- Sparrin'
Excuse me
know ya need sparrin' partners -- 'm very available
'm sure you are
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what
What
wouldn't take no cheap shots
'd be a good sparrin' partner
55
Jergens seems very amused
He lights a cigar
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship
Like  said, 'd make a boss sparrin' mate
Did you hear what  said
Sure, an' 'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ
He's just there to help condition the man
Not spar, 'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship
The weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky
For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case as he ponders the statement
He half regains his senses
Ah
Absolutely
The   and becomes a black and white television
'  - Rocky and Adrian are at her home watching an old black and white television
Rocky smiles
The film now cuts to Apollo being interviewed
#1 How'd you like the 'City of Brotherly Love
' like my Philadelphia Brothers
An' 'm patriotic
Apollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting microphone
56
(continuing; mock seriousness) If yo' don't back up 'm gonna send yo' home with a microphone in yo' nose
The Reporters laugh
#2 Why did you agree to fight a man who has virtually no chance of winning
If history proves one thing, everybody gotta chance -- Didn't yo' all ever hear of David an' Goliath
-- 'Course woulda knocked out Goliath
#3 It is a coincidence that you're fighting a white man on the most celebrated day in the country's history
The same coincidence that he's fightin' a black man
#1 What're your feelings about the challenger
He's Italian
#1 What does that mean
It means if he can't fight, bet he can cook
Rocky and Adrian laugh at the interview
Paulie, her brother, takes offense
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out
Paul
57
Rocky's interview now fills the screen
Rocky squints and looks nervous under the hot lights
#2 This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it
Feel
dunno
Happy
#2 How will you fight Apollo Creed
(mind elsewhere) Creed's great, ain't he
'll do what  can
#1 Where did you get the name, 'Italian Stallion
' thought of it 'bout eight years ago, when  was eatin' dinner
#2 Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago
#2 And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
Any comment
Listen,  wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian
Adrian blushes and laughs
Oh, Rocky
(dry) Christ
58
You didn't
Sure  did
You heard
They continue to watch the remainder of the interview
The head  is looking directly into the camera
Bicentennial Fight -- January first
It will be the first sporting event on our two hundredth birthday and is already being called by many the greatest farce in sports history
If this man lasts more than a minute  would say he's on borrowed time
(sarcastically) It's matches like this with their exorbitant prices that give sports a bad name -- Not only is this match bad, people, it's sad
Why a Rocky Balboa
At the State Athletic Commission, Larry Duggan reporting
(irate) The guy's a friggin' moron
Why
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool
-- 'd break his lips
It don't matter
He's takin' cheap shots
It don't bother me none
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right
59
Help what
'know, to help keep ya livin' clean
'll do okay
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh
Nobody -- think 'm gonna train myself
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance
Adrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude
She faces him
Einstein flunked out of school
twice
That so
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- think Rocky has a good chance
'  - Rocky stands in Adrian's doorway
He kisses her
See ya tomorrow
Rocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he converses with Adrian who remains upstairs
His up the stairwell
60
(continuing) How'd ya like hearin' ya name on
don't know --  was shocked
Why did you do that
Ya puttin' me on, right
(smiles) Absolutely -- What time should expect you
'Bout seven
'll be waiting
Rocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the top floor landing
'know how  said that stuff on television didn't bother me
Yes
It did
As Rocky completes the last word, he exits the building and slams the door which  throughout the apartment house
- Gazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front
They are eating hot sandwiches
'know  won't be able to work for ya no more
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it
feel bad about walkin'
61
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses
few bucks
Gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove
Do  have to pay juice
Gazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to imply, "Why's this guy asking such a foolish question
" Gazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at the curb
They enter the cab
Rocky watches
- (smiles) Does Santa Claus charge juice
Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win
Gonna try
Listen, kid, 'm with ya
Ya know, 'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood
You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at
Give it your best shot cause  want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug
Ya got any action on the side
No action
Ya gettin 150 grand killer
Ya got any plans for it
Whatta ya think
() 62
(') Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya
'm gonna do somethin with it
Sure, you do what ya want
Stay away from the stock market
Black market
Same thing
Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together
An'  wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name
-- Gallager --  bought a suit and became a businessman
You put on gloves
An' remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains -- 'd like to lay hands on that bastard
You ain't never had any luck
Even when  owned you in '66 you never had luck
But now think you might be gettin' some luck kid
Whatta you think
Rocky smiles and Gazzo gets into his car
Rocky follows him across the street
Yo, you gonna show, Tony
Where else am  gonna go
(to Bodyguard) Bet three grand on Rocky
He's a bum -- are you kiddin
(slaps Bodyguard) No
'm not kiddin
Rocky walks away
63
'  - Rocky returns home and enters his apartment
After turning on the light, he flips on his
He now feeds the turtles
Look who's home
Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold
He approaches them with a sense of awe
He opens and reads one
Settling on the bed, he reads the other
is
Rocky opens the door
Mickey Goldmill, the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway
(stiffly) seen the light
figure somebody was home
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here
Here, sit down
Rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair
(continuing) Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much
How do you mean
'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint
By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious something important is preying on his mind
Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at having outsiders see how he lives
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy
Yeah
64
What's happened is freak luck
Freak luck for sure
Look at all them other fighters
Real good boys
Good records
Colorful
Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared
Nobody
They got it shoved in their back door
Nobody ever give them a shot at the title
(uneasy) Freak luck is a strange thing
Mickey does not hear
His attention is drawn to the turtles
Whatta' those
Turtles -- domestic turtles
(businesslike) 'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot
Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance
Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes
(continuing) Ya need a manager
An advisor
been in the racket fifty years
done it all, there ain't nothin' about the world of pugilism that ain't livin' up here
He lights a half-smoked cigar
(at a loss) Fifty years, huh
65
(stronger) Fifty years
The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but  don't have to tell you that
How 'bout a glass of water
Rocky, d'ya know what  done
(uneasy) What
(driving each word hard) done it all
've done an' seen everything'
Believe what 'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn,  smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring
But who got the Press
He did
He had a manager -- September 14, 1923
(softly) Ya got a good mind for dates
Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second
Look at this face -- twenty- one stitches over the left eye, thirty-four over the right -- my nose was busted seventeen times, the last being the Sailor Mike fight New Year's Eve, 1940, in Camden, New Jersey -- What a professional pastin'  give him
Here, read about it
() 66
(') (shows a tiny press clipping; points to cauliflower ear) An' he give me the vegetable on the ear
got pain an' experience
an' you got heart -- kinda remind me of Marciano, ya do
Rocky points to his most prized possession
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock
Ya move like 'im
Mickey has rung the bell
Nothing could please Rocky more than being compared to his idol
Really think so
Ya got heart
Heart, but  ain't got no Tocker
Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a crouch
Christ,  know this business
Rocky, when  was fightin' it was the dirtiest racket goin', see
Pugs like me was treated like fightin' dogs -- throw ya in the pit an' for ten bucks ya try to kill each other
We had no management
() 67
(') fought in boxcars, in whorehouse basements, any joint with a floor -- October 1931  fought a bum who put a tack in the thumb of his glove an' punched so many holes in my face  had spit shootin' outta my cheeks --  never had no manager watchin' out for me -- See that picture outside the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,' that's me in my prime
had all the tools
coulda starched any lightweight husky on the East Coast -- But  had no management
Nobody ever got to know how slick  was, but  had a head for business an' stashed a few bucks an' opened the gym -- It's a dirt hole,  know it, but that an' a lotta scars is what  got to show for fifty years in the business, kid -- now you come along with this shot an' feel like it's me gettin' the shot  never got
Yeah, we was treated like dogs -- like them Dago's, no offense, in the Colosseum in Rome there -- An' now  got all this knowledge,  wanna give it to ya so  can protect ya an' make sure ya get the best deal ya can
Rocky rises and opens a window
(continuing) Respect,  always dished ya respect
Ya gave Dipper my locker
(almost begging) 'm sorry,  --  made a mistake
Kid, 'm askin' man to man
wanna be ya manager
68
The fight's set --  don't need a manager
Look, you can't buy what know
Ya can't
've seen it all
got pain an'  got experience
got pain an' experience too
Please, kid
(tightly) Whatever  got,  always got on the slide
This shot's no different
didn't earn nothin' --  got it on the slide
needed ya help about ten years ago when  was startin', but ya never helped me none
Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up
He remains on one knee
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask
Just ask
asked, but ya never helped nothin'
-- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance
(yells) Rocky, 'm seventy-six years old
Maybe you can be the winner  never was -- your shot is my last shot
Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the door
Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves
Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself into bed
Springing up a second later, he runs outside
69
'  - Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form of Mickey
Way in the distance, we  Rocky stop the old man beneath a street lamp
He places an arm around his shoulder
'  - - The following morning, Rocky's     at exactly four
Not accustomed to rising this early, with great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to the bathroom
He turns the light on and roaches scatter
At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams
Rocky fills the basin and submerges his face in cold water
Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs
He cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one swill
his body quivers
'  - - Rocky steps outside
He is dressed in a well-worn sweat suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers
It is pitch dark and his steaming breath attests to the cold
He begins running down the center of the deserted street
He can only be clearly  as his form passes beneath the street lamps
Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass
- Rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight of stairs
He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear into the morning gray
Taking a deep breath, he starts up
From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his legs give way
Standing, he brushes off and descends the stairs
- Rocky passes City Hall and veers to the river
He pauses, heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths
He throws several lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his aching sides
Men delivering the morning papers observe with amusement
Rocky forces himself to begin running again
70
- Heading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an elevated train station
The   overhead seems to blend perfectly with his muscular running style
- The sky is beginning to lighten
The fighter now runs along the piers and past anchored freighters
- It is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform belonging to Eastern Packing Company
Alongside the loading platform come several boxcars
Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door
It soon opens and Paulie guides him inside
Paulie is drunk
- How ya feelin'
(panting) Tight
got whiskey here
No
Rocky notices    lounging alongside theshipping office
This is the guy who's fightin' Apollo Creed
(heavy accent) Good luck -- Kill him, man
(as though rehearsed badly) Hip -- Hip -- Hooray
'mon -- Hip -- Hip -- 71
(walks away) Hooray, man
Rock'll be comin' by every mornin' to pick up some Prime -- can't train on that store crap
Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator
- They enter
The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber
row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the darkness to the far end of the refrigerator
The blower overhead causes the men to speak loudly
(teasing) If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right
Gazzo's a good man
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me
(tightly) Please do me that favor
Keep this job, ya eat better
Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat
He swills whiskey from a pint bottle
'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together
Whatta you think
Ain't sure, what's the story
What
72
The story -- what's happenin'
Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for quite a while
(continuing) Ya really like her
Sure  like her
(nervous laughter) What's the attraction don't see it
dunno -- she fills gaps
What gaps
(shrugs and takes meat) She got gaps
got gaps -- together we fill the gaps
(sharply) You ballin' her
(turns around) Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister
(tersely) 'mon, ya screwin' her
From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes
That's why  can't put ya together with Gazzo, cause ya talk too much -- big mouth
Paulie reddens
He steps forward and slams his fists in a hanging beef
73
The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky responds
Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs
The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging corpse
Rocky moves to the next one and hooks
Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as though he were locked in total battle
Hit the rump
The rump
Ya'll break the ribs
Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of beef
Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every punch, like he were receiving it
Rocky moves into the dark recess of the refrigerator
Only the dull  of his can be
Rocky works his way to Paulie again
Every hanging beef swings and appears surrealistically alive
(continuing) We do that to Creed an' they'll take us to jail for murder
Rocky looks at his hands
They are drenched in red up to the elbows with beef blood
Paulie hands him a package of beef
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister
Rocky takes the package and runs out
Paulie's bleary eyes reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment
'  - The gym is filled to capacity
The  is
Rocky pounds a heavy bag
Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his pocket
74
(passionate) Stop
Stop
can't stand it
It's clumsy
You're off balance
He motions to his bullish helper, Mike
He hands him the string
(continuing) Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack
never had good footwork
Mike completes the task
Forget the footwork -- You're off balance
The legs are sticking everywhere
Marciano had the same problem, an' the string cured it
When you can hit and move without breakin' the string you'll have balance
You'll be a very dangerous person
Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey
Rocky, could we have your autograph
Sure
(irate) Don't you boys ever interrupt when 'm conductin' business, or 'll kill you both -- Go away
The boys depart
75
(continuing) Autographs
Ya wanna be a writer or a fighter
Let's work
Mike looks off across the gym
we got visitors
Mickey strains his eyes to see a group of  and entering his gym
(approaching) Can  help you guys
(to Cameraman) Set the camera up over there
(to Mickey) We're from Channel Seven -- Covering the pre-fight training
own the place
The Reporter has a hundred things on his mind
he turns from Mickey and nods to his crew
the other television crews rush to set up
Rolling here
Speed here
(to the camera) We're here at Goldmill's Gym --  Philadelphia landmark of sorts since 1929 -- The stench of toil permeates every corner
The sweat a trademark of a unique profession
Yet, the most unique fixture is an unprecedented 50 to 1 underdog heavyweight named, Rocky Balboa
The camera turns to Rocky
76
(to Mickey) Should  do this
Mickey nods and Rocky faces the glaring lights
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much
People talk to me more
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout
young punchy fighter yells out: Readin' fuckin' history books, man
The gym explodes with laughter
(flushed) We can cut that out later
Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away
(honestly) Apollo's a great fighter
Do you feel you have a chance
Maybe -- He faces Mickey
Mickey whispers in his ear
(continuing) 'll tear his head off
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion
77
Derogatory
Yeah, he's great
Apollo Creed and his entourage enter the gym
(bellowing) am the Champion of the whole world
The gym freezes
everyone turns and stares in wonderment
Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief
He now realizes it is a publicity stunt
(continuing) (approaching Rocky) Italian Stallion,  come over to tell you to be very smart an' after this fight donate what's gonna be left of your body to science, cause after this fight what's left won't fill a tuna fish can
So beware, Mon Cher
Apollo turns to the cameras
Rocky is speechless
(continuing) This classic fight -- Tha's right, this bicentennial fight's goin' down in the history books 'cause January first 'm gonna be the first man to bounce another man offa the planet Pluto
Dipper stands in the far ring
the attention Rocky is receiving makes him a killer
(continuing) Now  gots a special announcement, y'hear
For the first time in alotta years this championship fight is gonna be on your home
Free -- 'Course that's just for Philly -- My present to the city
() 78
(') Now some ya'll ain't much on likin' me, but ya gotta admit Apollo Creed is one generous, 100% pure, government inspected, Afro-American Folk Hero
Everyone laughs
Dipper moves across the room like a large snake
He brushes people aside and steps behind Rocky
He nudges him
Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it
Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him
(loud) Ya nothin', Boy
Apollo stops his sales pitch in mid-sentence
The television crew faces Dipper
(continuing) say ya nothin'
What's happenin' here
'm happenin'
This pig is takin' my shot --  iz a contender
He's nothin'
(dumbstruck) Yo', Dipper, why're ya -- (shaking his fist) Spar me in front of these here dudes --  knock ya ass to Jersey
Dipper's fat black trainer holds out his hands and Dipper slaps them soul style
(to Dipper) You can forget about sparring, kid
Yo' know  iz the best man here
Yo' said so yoself
79
(almost apologetically to the crew) Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand
-- Take a shower, Dipper
Don't mouth me, old man, 'll knock yo' out too
'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here
Silence looms over the gym
Apollo is apprehensive
The scene is becoming too real
The frightened television crew slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment
(continuing; insanely) Man, yo' best keep them cameras out
Fight me, boy
Let Creed here see the kind of punk he's fightin'
Mike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind Rocky
Don't chance it, man -- He's sick
This is gettin' outta hand -- Rocky will fight in the ring January first, not here
Yo' yellow, old man
Not yellow, cautious
(to the crew) See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt -- Dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard across the side of the head
The gym becomes stone cold
Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it
80
If yo're afraid to fight me, then get down an' kiss my feet, boy
Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds before the blood will run
Rocky stands motionless
(softly) Let's take a walk, Rock
Please, don't take a chance
He wants to hurt you so you can't fight
Rocky swallows his pride
He still has the string around his ankles
He starts to shuffle away with Mickey
Dipper steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again
Mike jumps forward
Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man
Back off, scumbag, or 'll bite your face
Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat
The room reeks of fear
Apollo's eyes flick back and forth between Rocky and Dipper
Apollo taps his bodyguards and they begin to ease away
Now, boy, kiss my feet
Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor
He shuffles forward and stands before Dipper
(continuing; almost in a whisper) Kiss 'em
Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's feet
Dipper smiles
Rocky starts to bend towards the shoes
Without warning, he explodes with a pair of combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs
is and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain
The room is silent except for Dipper's moaning
Apollo is stunned by the scene
The gym has become a very gloomy place
He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of apprehension
He leaves
81
Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill
He shakes his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky
The kid's got cannons -- Print that
The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken figure lying on a dirty gym floor
'  - They enter the dismal apartment
On the floor are at least ten telegrams
Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside
Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams
Don't you open them anymore
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky
' -- What ya got in the bag
Adrian steps to the window
She pulls a pair of short but lovely curtains from a shopping bag
The colorful curtains glare in the dark room
Like
Sharp -- Real nice
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine
No
Sharp -- You look great
Adrian smiles and pulls out a small Christmas wreath
Rocky smiles
His eyes show what he feels for this woman
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But  can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak
Don't want weak legs
82
Can't fool around -- You look very great
-- The legs
Yeah
But  think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know
Rocky approaches in a seductive manner
Adrian uncharacteristically removes her sweater
Underneath is a -shirt that reads "Win, Rocky, Win
" thought it might be cute
Ya right -- (laughs) Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know
- - Rocky is running
for extra weight he carries his huge dog, Butkus
After a half a block he sags under the weight, and laughing, begins to wrestle with the dog on the pavement
Rocky tries to sneak away from the dog, but after a few steps the beast sees him and chases him down the street
- It is early morning and as usual Rocky jogs to the meathouse
He is followed by his new dog, Butkus
He is stopped short when he notices several television news vans parked out front
- He and the dog enter the freezer area and see several reporters and men with mini-cameras milling around
Paulie is waiting for him -- Rocky is upset and goes outside
Paulie follows
83
- Yo, Rock
made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog
Whatta these guys want
To see ya train
Yo, what's with you
-- It was suppose to be private
thought  was doin' ya a favor -- 'mon inside -- 'know, my sister really likes ya
Rocky follows Paulie inside
- points in Rocky's direction and suddenly he is surrounded and led into the freezer area and positioned beside a slab of hanging beef
The camera lights go on
Just relax, Mr
Balboa -- (to the camera) Today we're here with heavyweight challenger, Rocky Balboa
The reason we are standing in a refrigerated box is that Mr
Balboa has an unusual method of training and in a moment he is going to demonstrate it for our viewing audience -- But first, Rocky, how did you ever come to train in an icebox
Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me in one day an'  hit the beef here an' liked it -- An' since become a challenger, the owner don't mind neither
84
Is this a common training method --  mean do other fighters pound raw meat
think me and Paulie invented it
Would you give us a demonstration
Rocky steps over to a hanging beef and begins pounding with incredible intensity
Everyone present is taken aback
Rocky completes hitting the meat and stands there with his hands dripping beef blood
The Commentator is unnerved and Rocky looks straight into the camera lens and holds up his bloody fists
Diane Lewis in the meathouse with the Southpaw, Rocky Balboa
'  - Apollo sits behind Jergens' desk
Jergens is not present
Four middle-aged and younger types and Creed's lawyer sit around the desk
The desk is flowing with forms and charts
How much is being channeled into West Coast closed-circuit advertising
Three hundred thousand
Make it four hundred an' fifty
(to younger man) Send two hundred roses to the mayor's wife from me, get a picture an' make sure it gets all the papers
#3 Do ya want to run the fifteen radio spots in the mid-west
think you could spend the money better in Canadian publicity
85
Yeah, 'd like to get Canada -- see, if we can get a tax break -- Gimme the figures on the Program Concession
Meanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened corner looking at a small television
He is watching Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news
He waves at Apollo
(worried) Apollo, you oughta come see this boy you're gonna fight on -- looks like he means business
Apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork
mean business, too -- (to men) The gross rental of the arena is gonna include the four hundred ushers, right
-- Gimme some coffee
'  - It is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street and enters his building
He staggers up the stairs
'  - Paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a chair
He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen
He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox
As he swills the wine he hears the  of Rocky's and Adrian's traveling from his sister's room
Paulie's face tightens and he staggers towards the bedroom
He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a crack
Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching  in the otherwise darkened room
And he called the reporters -- Yeah
Threw my whole day off
86
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help
Yo --  ain't mad
'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it
Are you going to say anything to him
What's to say
dunno what he wants from me -- Filled with uncontrollable anger, Paulie smashes into the room
Nothin'
want nothin' from you
Paulie
Shutup
want nothin' -- ain't no charity case
Get outta my house
It's not your house -- You ain't no friend no more -- Go home
Outta my house want ya
Don't talk like that to him
Get outta my life both of ya's
Paulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be bordering on a nervous breakdown
(continuing) Outta my house  want ya
87
It's cold outside, Paulie
Paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball bat
Rocky and Adrian quickly follow
don't want ya messin' up my sister no more -- He's scum from the corner,  don't raise ya to hang with no bum
Adrian is speechless
Rocky moves towards Paulie
(continuing; raising the bat) Wanna hit on me
'mon -- 'mon, 'll break both ya arms so's they never work
Rocky freezes
Paulie
Stop now
want 'im outta here -- (to Rocky) Don't think 'm good enough to work for Gazzo
(spits) That's what  think of bums like you an' Gazzo
(spits again) You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs
(spits) give ya meat, an'  give ya my sister, too
Only a pig would say that
Paulie smashes a small table with the bat
(to Adrian) You forget what  went through to give ya the best
88
You gave me what
Knots
You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything
always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag
Paulie smashes a large lamp with the bat
Don't do that again
Get away from me --  could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself
So instead  put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me
-- You owe me
Owe you what
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good
Good
Good, Paulie
've been treatin' you like a baby
Since  can't remember it's so long -- 'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that
So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when 'm with Rocky --  don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me
The brother flares up and threatens Adrian with the bat
You busted
89
What
You a virgin
-- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya
Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya
Mortified, Adrian runs to her room
Rocky steps to Paulie
(fuming) Hey -- Paulie cocks the bat back and tenses
Rocky remains still
(softly) can't haul meat no more
What can  do about it
Christ,  been beggin' ya for a break until 'm sick inside
What break
Huh
What break
Who am  to give breaks
'm a fighter, you haul meat
You do what you do an'  do what do best -- that's it -- that's life, man
Paulie looks ashamed
Rocky walks, then returns
(continuing) An' what ya said to my girlfriend ain't right -- Do it again, 'll kill ya
Rocky goes into the bedroom
Adrian has buried her face in a pillow
She is rocking slightly
Rocky cradles her and kisses her cheek
(continuing) Wanna hear a dirty joke
90
(smiles) Yes -- '  - Mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym
the room is dark
Blankets are tacked over the windows
Rocky is watching 8 mm movies of Apollo Creed in action
Rocky watches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like a huge dancer around the ring
His defense is great, can't lie 'bout that -- You have a rollin' style
Can't retreat as fast -- But your style ain't retreatin'
They both watch the flickering images
(continuing) See how he plays sometimes -- Drives his cornermen nuts
Nobody knows his next move -- Him included
They watch more action
Creed has a fighter helpless against the ropes
(continuing) Killer instinct -- Ya both got the killer touch
Interestin'
See that
-- Right-cross combination
Beautiful
But you got the power to rip the body
They watch more action
(continuing) Rocky, when ya climb into the square, an' know ya' meetin' the best fighter in the world, ya' gonna be ready, ya' gonna be ready 'cause  been waitin' for fifty years -- Fifty years
When 'm done with you, you'll gonna be able to spit nails
() 91
(') You'll gonna be able to eat lightin' and crap thunder -- You'll be a very, very dangerous person
The   on Mickey's voice and Rocky staring transfixed at the images projecting on the wall
'  - Rocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration
As he strikes from all angles, Mickey instructs
'  - Rocky now works on the incline situp board
While doing situps, he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell
The pain is evident on his face
'  - Pushups between two chairs as Mike sits on his shoulders
Mickey coaching drives him on
'  - Mike has on a pair of target gloves and Rocky moves around the ring swinging at them
'  - Drenched in sweat, Rocky hums the speed bag
His expression is hard and flushed
Mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats Rocky's shoulder
He is very happy
'  - Rocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball
Dino hands him a towel
Paulie crosses the gym as Rocky heads to the steam room
thin man crosses the gym and Mickey nods
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock
' This is our cutman, Benny Stein
Yo, Benny
Check the eyes, Ben
92
Benny checks the skin around Rocky's eyes
Ain't bad
Seen worse -- Cover up an' things should be okay
Take a shower
Heading towards the shower, Rocky is intercepted by Paulie who traverses the gym
He stops Rocky at the shower room entrance
Yo, Rock,  think  found an angle to make some bread usin' ya name, ya mind
Exhausted, Rocky studies Paulie's face a moment and nods 'yes
'
Rocky sways into the shower room and Paulie strides off
- Running
Rocky's crowd of trailing boys has tripled
Dashing through the streets, he resembles the Pied Piper
- It is twilight and Rocky is alone at the very bottom of a huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens
Rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never-ending stairs
Halfway up, his body shows the strain
Nearing the top, Rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at the very top
He looks down the steep stairs and swells with pride
He is ready
'  - Rocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide
Rocky is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated behind his wide desk
Sit down, Rocky
Flips open a thick file that lays in front of him
93
(continuing) 've been going over your record -- You've been the busy type -- (reading) Nineteen arrests -- probation three times -- expelled from seven public schools in 1964 and '65
Rocky tries to sink into the chair
(continuing) 'm a very busy man, but just wanted to remind you that you'll be setting an example for thousands of guys like yourself and maybe start them off in a new direction and give our police force a break --  also hope you try your very best and bring pride to Philadelphia
'll try
The mayor presses a button and a photographer enters
Would you stand up, please
Rocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand
Their picture is taken three times
The photographer exits
(continuing) Thank you for coming by, Rocky -- good luck
(turns) Any time
(sitting) Wait
After the fight you'll have nearly a hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- What do you plan to do with it
94
(smiles) Run for mayor
The mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big, friendly laugh, and Rocky exits
'  - Adrian and Rocky are at his apartment
They are looking at new scrapbooks
Newsweek Magazine: Headline: "The Italian Stallion or Donkey
" -- Philadelphia Magazine -- Rocky stands with the mayor
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to
Yeah
She flips through Sports Illustrated, The American Sportsman, Ring Magazine, World Boxing, True, and a multitude of other clippings
The
Rocky rises and walks to the new white object hanging on the wall
(continuing) My first call
Hello
Yeah, speakin' -- Who is this
Bruce
Bruce who
-- Yo, Bruce
How ya been
ain't seen ya for nine or eight years -- Yeah, things is great, how's things with you upstate -- Ya sellin' real estate, hey, that's a good job
Yeah,  gotta advance, but  bought ringside seats for the guys at the gym get the hundred an' fifty grand after the fight
Adrian overhears the statement
95
(continuing) Yeah,  know it's a lotta money -- Condominiums
Nobody uses them anybody
Listen, think a pet shop is a good investment, y'know --  don't care 'bout long hours -- there's no depreciation -- that don't matter none to me -- Yeah,  like animals
Why don't ya give me ya number an' 'll call ya back
Lemme getta pencil -- Rocky makes no motion to get a pencil
(continuing) Okay, what is it -- four- twelve 659-2424
Yeah, yeah, thanks for callin' -- Sure 'll get back to ya, Bruce -- see ya
Rocky hangs up
What was that you said about a pet shop
(distant) What
What did you say about a pet shop
don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more
Is everything all right
gotta go out for a while
Rocky grabs his coat and moves to the front door
(continuing; to dog) Come
96
'  - Rocky arrives at Goldmill's Gym
He unlocks the gym's door
Rocky and the dog move through the eerie shadows of the gym
Rocky moves across the gym with his dog and moves up the steps to Mickey's office
At the top of the stairs he looks down at the ring, reflects for a moment, then enters the office
'  - After turning on the lights, he quickly cleans the cluttered desk and sets up the projector
He goes to the cabinet and removes a stack of 16 mm films
: '  - The office clock indicates it is several hours later
Rocky is engrossed in watching another Apollo Creed film
He sits motionless
Rocky sits upright
Something catches his eyes
He springs at the projector
He reruns the scene several times
: '  - Several hours later Rocky is engrossed in watching another Apollo Creed film
He sits motionless
Something catches his eye
Rocky stops the projector as Apollo is delivering a knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent
Rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it was a priceless painting
He backs off and begins writing on a note pad
: '  - The first light of dawn streams through Mickey's filthy windows
Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he has lost interest in watching the movies
The film has completed its run through the projector and lazily flops around on the top reel
Listlessly Rocky rubs his reddened eyes
97
The door opens and Mickey flips on the light
The two men stare at each other for a long moment
Mickey studies Rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the fighter's mind
know what you're thinkin'm kid -- At least ya gotta shot -- All ya can do is try ya' best
Rocky stands and, with his dog, inches past Mickey and exits the room
Mickey walks over and turns off the projector
He idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it slides off the desk and crashes to the floor
- After leaving Mickey's gym, Rocky and his dog listlessly move down the street and head for home
'  - Rocky arrives at his apartment
Adrian is asleep on the couch
He lowers himself beside her
Her eyes open
Can't do it
What
can't beat him
Apollo
Yeah,  can't beat him
Adrian touches his face
been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere
What're we going to do
dunno
98
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard
It ain't so bad, 'cause  was a nothin' before -- Don't say that
'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me --  just wanna prove somethin' -- ain't no bum
It don't matter if  lose
Don't matter if he opens my head
The only thing  wanna do is go the distance -- That's all
Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed
If  go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' 'm still standin', 'm gonna know then weren't just another bum from the neighborhood
Adrian touches Rocky's face
The fighter gently lowers himself beside his woman
(continuing) No foolin' around
- It is the night of the Bicentennial fight
The location is the Philadelphia Spectrum
The Spectrum is filling to capacity
Grandly dressed celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into their ringside seat
Nearly everyone is holding a red, white, and blue sweater
The arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and blue
High above the ring are huge posters of -   -
,
- - and
'   - Apollo Creed sits in his dressing room

Apollo shakes his head and the trainer removes it and places another one in the champ's mouth
Creed nods yes
'   - Everyone present is motionless as Rocky is in the bathroom
Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying
Completing his silent prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror
Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge of his life
Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans in and nods that it is time
He leaves
Rocky steps out
It's time, kid
Rocky nods and moves toward Adrian
'll wait for you here
Rocky nods and she kisses him
The fighter leaves with his trainers
Adrian is on the verge of tears

Up ahead are three security guards
Rocky rubs his bare shoulders
Yo, Mick, can  have my rob
Rocky puts on the robe
Embroidered across the back in flaming letters is: "  " *Pennzoil* Mike helps him into the robe

#2 Thank you, Bob
The electricity is everywhere tonight
Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier
' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring
His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts

' 102
wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes
people also hurl insults
From the expression on Mickey's face it is also the greatest night of his life
In the audience are familiar faces from the gym
From the back of the arena a  goes up
Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George Washington
He throws silver dollars
The  builds to proportions
Creed's trainer holds the rope and Creed bounds into the ring
He tears off the Washington outfit and it is clearly  that Apollo Creed is garbed in an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit
On his head is a red, white and blue sequined top hat
The robe is sequined red, white and blue
His boxing trunks are red, white and blue silk with stars around the waistband
The boxing shoes match the trunks
On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam beard
#2 You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring -- #1 Am  seeing right
Creed is approaching the ring in a boat
Is he supposed to be George Washington
Obviously so
#2 It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off
#1 agree
Immediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle
He passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit
want you

The crowd loves the taunting
Apollo Creed floats back to his corner
Don't let 'im get you tight

Whatta ya think that outfit cost
The  steps to the center of the ring
Several men in suits stand against the ropes
Paulie is dressed nicely and sits at ringside with a pretty blonde escort
Rocky waves at him
Paulie waves back and secretly gestures at his date
Rocky smiles and gestures back
Ladies and gentlemen -- Welcome to the Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship Fight
We are very proud to have with us four former Great Champions

They must be friends
Now, last but certainly not least -- the former Heavyweight Champion, a son of Philly, Smoking Joe Frazier
rumbles to the center of the ring
The
Apollo puts on a show
He grimaces and gestures like he's going to attack Frazier
His cornermen hold him back
They laugh
Frazier goes to Rocky's corner
Save some of him for me
The Commentators beckon to Frazier as he exits the ring
#1 The former champ looks great -- Can we get Joe over here -- here he comes
Joe Frazier stands in front of the Commentators

The arena  and Creed puts on a display of hand speed
The  motions to both fighters
They step to the center of the ring
As the Referee explains the rules Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes
The Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the screen
Something soulful and frightening is being communicated
Now come out fighting
The fighters return to their corners
God bless ya, Rock
Thanks, Mick -- 'm gonna try
The
Creed dances forward and boxes Rocky as though he considers the man an amateur
106
#1 The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men
#2 The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination
feel sorry for -- #1 Creed is down
Rocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw
Creed is dropped
The arena
Creed's eyes show disbelief
So do Rocky's
Rocky backs into his corner
Mickey and Mike yell at him
You can do it
Goddamnit, you got the power
The body, get the body
Ya got him goin'
Six
Seven
Eight
Creed is up
His playful attitude is gone
he is now all business
His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly
Come at me, sucker
Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed to cringe
107
Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations to the body
The
' How am  doin'
Real good
See how fast he is -- damn
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down
Use the legs and drive through 'im
Attack -- Attack -- Attack
' Apollo does not sit
He stands and clowns with the spectators to prove he is not hurt
(to Trainer) That boy damn near broke my arm
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear
'll carry him 'till the third
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat
The  for the second round
Rocky rushes out fast and furious
Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a goose egg over Rocky's eye
Apollo employs footwork that dazzles Rocky
He has class
He studies Rocky and employs his lightning jab with cutting accuracy
Still Rocky shuffles ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks
108
The round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose
The round ends
Apollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he is beginning to show the strain from the body punches
Man,  rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear
Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home
Rocky sits as Mickey and Benny try to reduce the swelling around his eyes
The nose is shattered
Ya nose is broke
Damn
How's it look
Can't hardly tell
Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs
Don't let 'im breathe
The guy's great
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan
The Commentators are caught up in the action
They speak rapidly into their microphones
109
#2 If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion
Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying
#1 Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell
Round three
Apollo comes out dancing
He skips and side- steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks
An expert ring general, Apollo uses the ring fully
Rocky keeps tearing in and Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling
Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to the heart
#1 Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations
Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple --  mean explodes
The Champ backs off
#2 There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power
#1 No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky
() 110

Rocky releases a terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye
Creed's face contorts with excruciation

Cover up

The
Apollo's corner works frantically to close the wound
The ring  inspects the cut
Bad
Talk to me, man
Deep, but passable
(staring at Rocky) That man's takin' his job too serious
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear
Don't play --  know what ya feelin', but don't play
He got lucky
Luck
You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad

Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly swollen around the eyes
How you holdin' up, kid
Fine

Gimme the water

He ain't losin' nothin'
Keep on him -- You're doin' great
In the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to ribbons, but pays dearly
Both his eyes and lips are cut
Welts across his midsection attest to Rocky's body-battering

Rocky's eyes are closed
But Creed cannot drop him

His eyes are swollen shut
Wanna keep goin'
Would you keep goin'
Yeah
No more, ya wanna lose an eye
No more
114
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes
Mickey nods to Benny
He secretly places a small ring knife between his index and middle finger
In one smooth movement he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers the draining wounds with gauze
It is done so quickly no one is ever aware of the operation
At the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring
She is caught up in the heat of the battle
The   for round fourteen
Rocky bores in close, but Apollo still has spring in his legs
He seems determined to end it this round
Apollo catches Rocky flush on the jaw
Rocky is staggered
Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose with pure savagery
Rocky is driven against the ropes and receives a devastating beating from the Champion
Rocky is dropped
Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring
Everything is a distortion
He looks for familiar faces as though to ask for help
Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him to stay down
Six -- Seven -- Eight -- Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy
He is like a wounded wild animal
The tide suddenly turns
Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his throat

glaze of pain covers Apollo's eyes
It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion upright

Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight
Stop jivin'
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best
Thanks
Rocky no longer resembles himself
His face has completely been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant
How  look out there, Mick
(truly worried) Great, kid, great
The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes
One more round -- How do you feel
Rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life
He cannot be bothered with pain or doctors
116
Fine -- Go away, 'm gonna make it -- 'm gonna make it
Everyone is distraught over Rocky's dangerous condition
We gotta stop it, kid
Ya gave it ya best shot
Nobody's gonna say ya didn't give ya all
can't let ya go out
Rocky stands and eyes them all
(impassioned and quietly) 'll kill ya all
Don't stop nothin' -- The
Apollo moves cautiously out of his corner and circles to Rocky's right
The Commentators stare unansweringly at the fighters
#1 The fight has slowed down to a near stand-still -- Creed circles to Rocky's right
The spectrum is nearly silent -- Neither fighter has made a motion to throw
've never seen anything like it in the last round of a championship fight
Apollo spits blood on the canvas
It appears he is protecting his right side
His ribs were probably injured at the end of round fourteen
() 117
#1 (') It's confirmed, unofficially, Creed's ribs may be broken -- Apollo fakes a left and throws a big tired right -- Balboa's mouthpiece is out
Creed attacks with one hand
Apollo feints and Rocky falls for it
The Champion unleashes a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's mouthpiece into the second row
Rocky sags against the ropes in a crucified position
The insane crowd leaps to their feet
Rocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to come ahead and fight toe to toe
Apollo obliges with a weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have
written on every punch
Rocky counters the assault blow for blow
Gimme ya best
Mickey looks at the clock
(continuing) Gimme ya best
Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside photographers
They are horrified and wipe away the blood
The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit of strength from their souls and beat each other without mercy
They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension far beyond blood and pain
The
The arena  with thunderous approval
118
Their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters
In the midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives
As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step towards each other and embrace
Apollo whispers in Rocky's ear
Ain't gonna be no rematch
Don't want one
Mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to his corner
Mickey embraces him
The Announcer enters the ring with a microphone
Attention, please
Attention
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we have had the rare privilege to have witnessed the greatest exhibitions of stamina and guts ever in the history of sports
The
(continuing) Ladies and gentlemen -- We have a split decision
Apollo did not expect this and tenses
His corner nervously tries to reassure him
It does no good
Rocky did not expect this either and looks in confusion at Mickey, but Mickey is frozen with anticipation
Judge Walker scores it eight- seven Creed
Judge Roseman scores it eight-seven Balboa
119
Apollo is rigid
Fear radiates from his eyes
To lose the crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill him
silence has blanketed the arena
Judge Conners scores it nine- six Creed
Winner and still Heavyweight Champion of the World, Apollo Creed
Rocky sorely smiles and looks at the waves of  fans that circle the ring and reach out towards him
Mickey grabs Rocky's hand and raises it
The
don't care what they say, you're a winner
Yo, can  have my locker back
Mickey and Rocky look at each other and grin
Mickey hugs Rocky like a son
Mickey raises Rocky's hand again
Rocky turns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's shoulder
Benny smiles wearily
Rocky stares across the ring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face and body are badly distorted
The two men lock stares that reflect admiration
Apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners
Rocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well- wishing fans rumble forward
Mickey's eyes show mounting apprehension as the fans become abnormally active
They shove the police aside and clutch wildly at Creed
Creed's army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity
Apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried along by a legion of fans
120
On the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be frightened by it, like Apollo
Mickey tries his best to control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing clamor
The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to their shoulders
Rocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against each other
chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed
' Rocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky
' Paulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he starts swinging
Both Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the crowd
They are being passed overhead and remain helpless as their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands
The
Fearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move forward
Running headlong into the crowd, she angles through the mass to get to Rocky
She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions, but she keeps her feet
She sees him
In the distance, Rocky floats   and Adrian flattens against the wall and waits for the procession to pass
The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's unbelievably battered but smiling face
He appears to be king of the world
The procession approaches and passes Adrian
She jumps on her toes and waves frantically but is not seen
She screams Rocky's name
Somehow the delicate voice knifes through the racket and reaches Rocky
Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages to see Adrian jumping up and down waving
The crowd is carrying him away
He attempts to lower himself but the crowd won't permit it
121
Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's heads and shoulders
He resembles a man trying to go up a down escalator
People are jammed so tightly together Rocky manages to crawl across them to Adrian
Still suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up and they lock in an embrace
love you --  love you -- love you
The two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can remember
