Written by Moira Buffini Adapted from the novel by Charlotte Bronte 2ND 6TH  2008 -
First light
Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked with dew
She carries a shawl and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder
She trips, falls to her knees; looks back
Expressive eyes, open features
She is desperate
We see the house she is running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion
Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise herself to her feet
She runs
She reaches an antique stile by a brook
She lifts herself on to it
She lands on the road
And runs
/
/
The sun is higher in the sky
Jane exhausted, now running down a main road
Her spirts lift at the sight of an approaching coach
She flags it down
Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand
He looks at her money then suspiciously back at her
terse nod indicates she can get in
: Jane sinks into a dark corner
Her fellow passengers look shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early hour
She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her emotional state
She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl - although her breathing threatens to
Slowly, unable to bear the day, she closes her eyes
Sunset
whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads meet on a barren moor
The coach driver opens the door
With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out
She looks around, dismayed
In each direction there is open moorland for as far as the eye can see
The driver sets off at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger
Jane puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings
It is not there
She runs as fast as she can after the coach
It is receding towards the horizon
She comes to a halt, objectless, lost, alone
She pulls her knitted shawl around her
She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the gathering dark
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2
Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock
The night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her
She is trying to calm herself with a prayer
Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun
She is like someone numb with pain
She watches a lizard crawl over the rock
She is mesmerised
Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light fades
She hungrily licks the juice from her hand
Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around her
red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side, watching her
It is Helen Burns
Helen reaches out
She touches Jane's hand
Jane wakes
She sits up
She is alone
Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by
The sky is overcast
The first big drops of rain land on the stones
Jane makes no movement
raven lands on a rock nearby
Jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage
She picks up a stone and hurls it at the bird with a raw cry
The gesture exhausts her
She watches the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour
It is raining hard
Jane sees a small girl come out of the farm with some leftovers
She drops them into a pigpen
: Jane leaning into the pigpen
She picks a stiffened mould of porridge out of the mud
She lets the rain wash it
She eats it ravenously
It has stopped raining
Jane is huddled under a tree
She is shaking, shuddering
The life has gone out of her eyes
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3
The moors rise away above her to the horizon
Jane looks up at the sun starting to set
The clouds are red and gold
She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her
The girl turns, looks back at Jane
With her last strength, Jane follows
Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again
Jane is struggling through a marsh
Her boots are stuck
She falls
Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed against the earth
She doesn't move
She has reached the point of despair
The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her
Jane looks up
Where the child should be, she sees a light shining across the moor
Jane starts crawling
/
Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the light
It has become a window
brief flash of lightning shows her a low stone cottage
Helen Burns is sitting on the gate
: Jane is crawling through the narrow garden
On her knees, she peers through a window
On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women
They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in black
One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides her gentle eyes behind spectacles
The other, Mary, is very young; no more than seventeen
Each has a book on her knee
They are talking intimately
They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy that it pains Jane considerably
: Jane knocking at the door
Hannah, an old servant answers
She is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch
What do you want
Jane manages to find her voice
Shelter
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 4
can't take in vagrants
Here's a penny
Now take it and go
have no strength to go
You can move off
And if there are others with you tell them we are not alone
We have a gentleman here, and dogs
() But  must die if  am turned away
The door slams shut
Jane lets out a hopeless wail
(') God help me
will die
She turns away, her hope gone
As she collapses, she finds herself supported by a strong pair of black-clad arms
All of God's creatures must die
But not prematurely - and not on my doorstep  hope
Jane is lifted up
She finds herself looking into the face of the handsomest man she has ever seen; St John Rivers
He lifts her over the threshold into the warmth of Moor House
-
fire is roaring in the stove
Hannah is bent over it
We've had a beggar woman come, Mr Rivers
sent her - For shame
Hannah falls silent as she sees Jane
You did your duty in excluding her
Let me do mine in admitting her
He sets Jane down before the hearth
She can barely stand
She is soaked to the bone, filthy with mud
Her skin has a ghastly pallor
Diana and Mary enter
St John, who is it
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 5
don't know;  found her at the door
() thought her one of the gypsies from the cross
She's as white as death
Jane can hold herself up no longer
Diana moves forward
She and St John catch Jane and help her into a chair
The rain hammers on the windows
Hannah, some water
She's worn to nothing
She looks like a spectre
St John, if you hadn't taken her in, we would have fallen upon her dead body in the morning
Mary
She's no vagrant; 'm sure of it
There's milk and bread for you
Jane tries to mouth her thanks
She sips the milk
Eats a mouthful of bread
Diana kneels at her side
Ask her her name
-  am  - Jane cannot speak
She's incapable of uttering her own name
She hears John Reed's voice calling from far away
Jane Eyre
Please, tell us how we may help you
Can we send for anyone
Who are your people
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 6
The questions are deeply troubling to Jane
She is losing consciousness
She sees an image of a small girl of ten, running away through a great darkening room
Jane tries to follow her
The action draws her up out of the kitchen chair
She hears John Reed's voice again
(
) Jane Eyre
Where are you
Jane, panicked, looking for somewhere to hide, passes out
-
Rain hammers against the windows
Jane aged ten, looking hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide
She springs behind a curtain
John Reed enters; a fourteen year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes
He is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword
Come out, rat
know you are in here
Come out now and  won't punish you
Jane watches him pass by her
He practises a perfect lunge
(') Rat
He exits
Jane breathes a sigh of relief
She slowly pulls the curtain across, making the window a private sanctuary
There is a book lying on the seat
She opens it
: Jane is sitting cross-legged, completely absorbed in her book - a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant
She runs her finger over it
We hear the sound of great waves plunging on to a shore
Jane, aged ten, is sitting cross-legged on an isolated rock, her eyes locked with those of a stooping black cormorant
St John's voice comes from a long way away
(
) Diana, Mary help me get her upstairs
The cormorant raises its wings like a great black cloak
Jane watches as it takes off and flies away
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 7
-
Jane has her eyes closed
great Atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine
Suddenly the curtain is pulled back
John Reed stands in front of her
Jane shrinks back
have been looking for you these last ten minutes
What do you want
Say forgive me, Master Reed
have done nothing wrong
Master Reed
John grabs the book
Who gave you permission to read my book
wasn't aware it was yours
Everything in this house is mine
You're lucky to live here with gentleman's children like us
Your father had nothing
You should go and beg
Jane stares him out
John can sense her contempt
He belts her with the book
Jane hits her head on the window clasp, drawing blood
She is shocked
(') That's for the look you had on your face
You bad animal
Jane snaps
She throws herself upon him, the rage in her released; pummelling, scratching, hurting him in any way she can
She is barely coherent
Wicked and cruel - you are a slaver - a murderer - shall tell mother - hate you John Reed
hate you - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 8
John is flabbergasted
Like all bullies, he is terrified
Mamma
Mamma
There's a rat
Rat
Jane bites him
Hard
At that moment, Mrs Reed appears on the scene
John screams
We see Mrs Reed's shocked face
She is an overweight woman pushing forty in a bright, elaborate dress
- Dinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes off; one at each side of her
Jane is distressed, approaching a delirium
She resists them
-
Jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two servants, Miss Abbot and Bessie - one at each side of her
She is still resisting
For shame, hitting your master
If you don't sit still you must be tied down
The fight goes out of Jane
She sits, defeated
Bessie, young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead
She has some compassion
Miss Abbot has none
What we do is for your own good
If you are passionate and rude like this, your Aunt Reed will send you away
You're worse than us servants
We work for our keep; you do nothing
Pray for forgiveness Miss Eyre or something bad will come down that chimney and fetch you away
The door slams
They are gone
Jane slowly grips the edge of the stool
The room is chill, silent
Red walls and curtains, murky in the fading light
In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth
Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale reflection stares out
Behind her, a bed supported on pillars of mahogany, hung with red
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9
The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white
Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room
sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like fingernails
distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of the black hearth
Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the pitted mirror
Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face, her eyes glittering with fear
It is a phantom
The eyes are black, the skin a deathly grey
Blood
Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror
She can't get her breath
We hear blood rushing through her ears
It sounds like the beating of great wings
Slowly, a light appears over her
It may be something shining in from outside
But to Jane it seems as if it is surrounding her, enveloping her
The figure in the looking glass opens its mouth
The scream, held in so long, finally rips from Jane's throat
-
At the sound of the scream, Mrs Reed, slumbering, almost jumps out of her skin
-
Miss Abbott almost drops the tea tray she is carrying
-
Jane is banging on the door, screaming, hysterical with terror
Bessie rushes to the door and unlocks it
Jane flies into her arms
Miss Eyre what is it
Bessie
Have you seen something
There was a light
We see Bessie's own fear as she glances into the dark room
Mrs Reed is storming towards them, furious
Bessie,  gave orders that she was to be left in the red room until  came
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 10
But she screamed so loud ma'am
It is play-acting
Let her go know your tricks Jane Eyre and abhor such artifice
Loose Bessie's hands, child
Mrs Reed prises Jane away from Bessie as she speaks
(') You will now stay here an hour longer
No - Aunt, have pity - And only when you are perfectly submissive will  let you out
Please -  cannot bear it - Silence
This violence is repulsive
shall be killed - Get back
Have mercy, have mercy  beg you - Mrs Reed throws her back into the room, slams the door and turns the key
We hear Jane's unspeakable howls of terror, her anguished bangs upon the door
Bessie is looking at Mrs Reed aghast
Mrs Reed withers her with a frozen glare
-
We see Jane in her distress, hitting her head on the door
She falls back
On the floor, her arms and legs move beyond her control
She is having a fit
When it is over, we see Jane unconscious
She is lying in a pool of ghostly light
-
Through the light, Jane sees Mary and Diana Rivers at her side
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 11
She's awake
St John approaches in his parson's collar, blocking out the light as he looks down
Jane gazes at him remotely
'm sure we'll find she's simply had a misunderstanding with her people
hope she's not done anything deplorable; there's nothing so sad as a fallen young woman
Look at the suffering in her eyes
They're like dark pools - Diana smiles at Mary's tendency to over-dramatise
She has a peculiar face;  rather like it
She's not at all handsome
She's so ill, St John
Ill or well, she'll always be plain
Jane's eyes slide away from him and close
-
bright morning
huge clergyman dressed in black is staring down at Jane, blocking out the sun
We see him from her ; his expansive chest, dramatic facial hair, huge flared nostrils, frowning brows
He is Brockelhurst, the epitome of grim
There is no sight so sad and so deplorable as that of a wicked little girl
Do you know, Jane Eyre, where the wicked go after death
They go to hell
And what is hell, can you tell me that
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 12
pit full of fire
And should you like to fall into that pit and be burning there forever
No sir
What must you do to avoid it
must keep in good health and not die
Mrs Reed is by the fireside in an ultra-feminine dress
She puts down her tea cup in irritation
've been her sole benefactress and her kindest friend
But she shows no gratitude and brings nothing but discord into my house
What is her parentage
She's an orphan
Her mother was my late husband's sister
On his deathbed he exhorted me to care for her
have always treated her as one of my own
Jane silently revolts against this lie
(') If you accept her at Lowood school Mr Brocklehurst, keep a strict eye on her
Her worst fault is a tendency to deceit
'm sorry to tell you that Jane Eyre is a liar
Jane's eyes flash with outrage
All liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone
She shall be watched, Mrs Reed
wish her to be made useful, to be kept humble
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 13
You can rest assured dear lady that we mortify our girls in the sentiments of vanity and pride
They are taught to be quiet, plain and modest
passion of resentment is forming in Jane
(') We shall root out the wickedness in this small, ungrateful plant
Mrs Reed smiles sweetly
And as for its vacations, it must spend them all at Lowood
-
Jane is climbing the staircase
John Reed blocks her way
So, Rat, you're being sent away
It's as  thought; you're not fit to associate with me
Jane snaps
She cries out: You are not fit to associate with me
-
Mrs Reed is at her desk
Jane appears in front of her
You said  was a liar
Well  am not
If  was,  should say that loved you and  don't
dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed
He is a liar, not
How dare you speak in this manner
'll never call you Aunt again as long as  live and if anyone asks how  liked you 'll say that the very thought of you makes me sick
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 14
You wouldn't dare
'll remember how you thrust me back into the Red Room and locked me there to my dying day
Even when you knew it was haunted and begged to be let out
People think you are good but you are bad and hard-hearted and 'll let everyone at Lowood know what you have done
Children must be corrected for their faults
Deceit is not my fault
But you are passionate
My Uncle Reed is in heaven and can see all that you do and think; so can my mother and father
They know how you hate me and wish me dead
They can see
They see everything you do and they will judge you, Mrs Reed
Mrs Reed has turned quite pale
Jane blazes with victory
-
Bessie is waiting with Jane while her belongings are loaded onto a public coach, its top laden with passengers
You're such a queer, solitary little thing
If only you could make yourself more appealing
Perhaps if you tried smiling from time to time, people would find you more pleasant - Don't scold me Bessie
know you dislike me - don't dislike you Miss; 'm fonder of you than of anyone
You don't show it
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 15
Miss Jane - Jane throws her arms around Bessie and embraces her with great force
Bessie returns the embrace, surprised, moved
Jane gets into the coach
Bessie looks up at the driver
(') You take good care of her
Jane's small, pale face peers out of the coach window, watching Gateshead recede
She doesn't cry
But Bessie can't stave off her tears
-
Jane, half asleep is carried out of a coach and into a howling gale
She is taken under a stone inscription: `Lowood Institution'
She is set down in front of a woman with striking features and intelligent eyes; Miss Temple
She bends down and looks into Jane's face
What's your name, child
Jane Eyre
You are very young to be sent alone, Jane Eyre
She gently touches Jane's cheek with her finger
Jane manages the ghost of a smile
-
Jane is lying back against clean white pillows
Her hair brushed and neatly plaited
Diana and Mary are full of kindness but St John's face is cold, dispassionate
My name is Jane Elliott
Jane Elliot
Where do you come from, Miss Elliott
Jane gives no answer
Who can we send for to help you
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 16
No one
There is an intake of breath from Mary
Do you mean to say that you are absolutely without home and without friends
Yes sir
How did you come to be roaming the moors, Miss Elliott
Don't upset her, St John
She must not be interrogated so
Mr Rivers, you and you sisters have done me a great service, the greatest man can do - you have rescued me from death
How are we to help you if we know nothing about you
'll tell you as much as  can am an orphan; brought up a dependent; educated in a charity school where  passed six years as a pupil and two as a teacher
left a year since to become a private governess - - good situation, where remained until
Diana, didn't  say so
Didn't say she was a governess
We did wonder
We mean no offence but you have a certain look
Mary and  work as governesses too
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 17
(with great interest) Do you
We are currently trying to teach ourselves German, so we may find better positions
You're not working at present
We came home only for our father's funeral
He died three weeks ago
am very sorry to hear it
St John has no patience with the change of subject
Why did you leave your place of employment
Jane sinks back in the pillows
It was a catastrophe
What did you do
am free from any blame, sir was happy
Jane is deeply distressed
That's enough for now, St John
You must rest, Miss Elliott
The name sounds strange to Jane
Why did you start
Because that is not my name
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 18
You haven't given us your real name
Jane shakes her head
Why not
Because  must not ever be found
Diana and Mary glance at each other, fascinated
- Jane is dressing herself
She stops, weakly holding the back of a chair for support, looking out of the window at the sun setting over the hills
(
) Merciful Jesus, enlighten thou me with the brightness of thine inward light
- Diana is helping Jane down the stairs
(
) And take away all darkness from the habitation of my heart
- St John is praying over Jane, Diana and Mary as they sit at the table
Mary catches Jane's eye, gives her shy smile
Join me to thyself with an inseparable band of love
For thou, even thou alone, dost satisfy him that loveth thee
Jane finds herself staring at St John, who prays ardently
(') And without thee all things are vain and empty
Amen
St John opens his eyes and looks searchingly at Jane
She immediately looks down
, , Amen
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 19
Welcome to our table, Miss Elliott
'd appreciate it if you called me Jane
It is my own name
It's wonderful to see you on your feet, Miss Jane
Jane turns her attention to St John
trust  will not be eating long at your expense, Mr Rivers
You wish to be independent of my charity
wish to work, sir
Show me how to work or how to seek work; that's all  ask
You're not fit enough to work
My sisters have always taken pleasure in keeping injured birds but 'm more inclined to put you in a way of keeping yourself - and shall endeavour to do so, if that's what you wish
With all my heart, sir
It's a shame she has no choice of helpers, St John, and must put up with such crusty people as you
This school you were at, Miss Elliot, this charitable institution; what did it prepare you for
: We see a bundle of sharp twigs come down on a girl's bare neck, like a whip
: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 20
Jane flinches at the memory
(') Was it a thorough education
Most thorough
-
Miss Scatcherd's bitter life is in her face and voice
Burns, Helen Burns
Jane, aged ten, looks up
She is wearing a brown stuff frock with a puritanical cap like all the other girls
Silence reigns in the school hall
red haired girl of about thirteen stands up; Helen Burns
Miss Scatcherd holds up an apron in which a hole has been mistakenly cut
(') You're a slattern and a disgrace
Helen Burns undoes the back of her dress
The punishment is given; a dozen sharp, stinging whacks with the birch twigs
Jane is appalled
But to her astonishment and awe, Helen Burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression
As the strokes go on - seven, eight, nine - Helen seems like one in a trance
Jane is deeply affected
On the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting party walks in: the Brocklehurst family
Miss Temple escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two smart, bombastic ladies
Mr Brocklehurst follows
Helen's punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet
Jane, in a panic, drops her slate and breaks it
Brocklehurst's eyes sweep the room
They land on her
might have known
The new girl
Step forward, Jane Eyre
Filled with dread, Jane steps forward
(') It is my duty dear children, to warn you that this girl is not one of God's own lambs
We see the look of frustration on Miss Temple's face
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 21
(') She is a castaway and an alien in his flock and you must be on your guard against her
For this child
is a liar
He points to a tall stool
Jane stands on it
(') This is the pedestal of infamy - and you'll remain upon it all day
You'll receive no sustenance and no comfort, for you must learn how barren is the life of the sinner
Children,  exhort you to shun her, exclude her, shut her out from this day forth
Withhold the hand of friendship and deny your love to Jane Eyre, the liar
-   -
The hall is empty but for the small figure of Jane, high on her stool, feeling her isolation like pain
Across the room is the slightly bigger figure of Helen, hunched, the back of her dress still open, the skin on her neck raw
The sun is setting
At last Jane starts to sob
Come now, don't cry
You're not allowed to speak to me
must be shunned
Mr Brocklehurst is not a God
He's not liked or admired here - He said  was a liar
- am not a liar
If your own conscience approves you, then so will
Jane is deeply gratified
How do you bear it
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 22
Bear what
Being struck
'm a trial to Miss Scatcherd
She hits me to improve me
If she hit me  would get that birch from her hand and break it under her nose
You'd just be punished even more
It's part of life here
have always been excluded and alone and hated
Miss Abbott used to call me an ugly little toad
Helen approaches Jane
You're not ugly
Do you know what is inside you
What
The spark of your spirit, the principle of light and thought, pure and bright, as perfect as anything created
What do you mean
Your soul
Your soul is beautiful, your soul has value - more value than anything on earth
Is that true
Yes
God sees your beauty
Even as you stand on that stool, there is an invisible world around you, a kingdom of spirits
It is everywhere
Angels see your pain
Angels know your innocence
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 23
Angels
Helen smiles a wide smile
Do you not believe in angels
They hear the door
Helen runs back to her place; cowers
Miss Temple appears in a shaft of light at the door
Come here, Girls
The girls approach, dreading more punishment
(') shall investigate Mr Brocklehurst's claims against you, Jane
And unless they are proved, you will be exonerated
Miss Temple looks over her shoulder
(') Also,  understand you girls have had no food today
She quickly presses a slice of hard cake into each girl's hand and walks away
Jane and Helen look at one another, deeply moved by her kindness
-   /
Jane stands between Diana and Mary high above Moor House
They are dressed similarly in bonnets and cloaks
They watch a hawk dive, their heads moving in unison
Their eyes land upon Moor House
We've lived here all our lives but the house must be shut up now
Why
We can't afford to keep it on
Diana and  will return to our charges in a few days and St John will go to his parsonage
Down below them, St John leaves Moor House and walks towards the village
Jane watches him
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 24
It'll be a hard parting for us
We may not see him again for years
Why ever not
He means to be a missionary
He's going to India to do Gods's work
Can he not do God's work here
This quiet parish will never do for him; he almost raves in his restlessness
It breaks our hearts
St John burns with talents and ambition
But he lacks the means for advancement here
Our poverty thwarts him at every turn and so he has chosen to lay all his gifts on God's altar
We've tried to persuade him to stay but in some things our brother is - he is - Inexorable as death
We are now without father
We'll soon be without home and brother
Jane feels a powerful compassion for them
In one thing you are fortunate
She looks over at the horizon
(') You have each other
-
Jane is looking at the high wall which is the horizon of her world at Lowood
Her eyes come to rest on the main door
Two men are carrying a small coffin out of the school
Brocklehurst follows it with a menthol-soaked cloth over his mouth and nose
He becomes aware of Jane's eyes on him
He looks away
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 25
-
Jane is creeping down a corridor in her night dress
She peers in through the dormitory door
It has been turned into a sanitarium
Camphor and vinegar are being burnt
Jane can hardly look at the sick girls
Miss Temple, pale with exhaustion, is speaking intimately to Madame Pierrot, the French mistress
Jane overhears
This is the result of semi- starvation and neglected colds; Brockelhurst's idea of mortifying their bodies to save their souls
- Miss Temple can't say more
Write to the governors
You must
Jane creeps on
-  '
Jane opens the door
small bed has been set up at the foot of Miss Temple's
In it lies Helen Burns
candle is set on a table at her side
Jane takes her hand
Helen
Is it you, Jane
Have you come to say goodbye
You're cold
'm very happy
am going home
Back to your father
My father has a new wife
He'll not miss me much
Then where
To my future home, where all is light
am going to God
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 26
No
Jane is devastated
She climbs into bed next to Helen
For a moment, they hold each other
Jane's tears silently fall
Don't be sad
will escape great suffering by dying young
No
don't have any talent to make my way in life
should be always at fault
But God is my friend
He loves me
Then he must save you
He is saving me
Jane cannot articulate her distress at Helen's words
(') feel like  could sleep now like to have you near - won't leave you
You're so warm and alive
Jane, you have a passion for living
-  '
We see Miss Temple looking down at the bed in the dazzling, morning light
Jane, waking, has her small arms around Helen, as if fiercely protecting her
Helen is ashen, her eyes open, staring at some unseen thing
She is dead
Miss Temple lifts Jane away
Jane
Jane realises what has happened
We hear the sound of her distress begin
She is inconsolable
No, no, no - (
) Jane

-
Jane is staring out at the Autumn rain
She surreptitiously wipes her tears away and smiles up at Mary
Have you something for me to do
You are doing something already
May  see
Jane hands her a book
She has drawn a bride
That's Miss Temple on her wedding day
She was my teacher; a great influence on me
Under her guidance  became a teacher too
Mary turns the page
It shows a sketch of St John Rivers
Mary gasps in delight
She takes the book straight to St John, who is diligently working at his desk
St John - No, Mary, please - See how skilled Jane is
St John looks at the sketch of himself
He is quite taken aback
He looks over at Jane, who is quite embarrassed
(') She is better than any drawing master we have ever had
For a moment, St John seems to be weighing up whether to be insulted or not
How fierce  am, Miss Elliott
Mr Rivers,  wondered if you had yet heard of any work that could do
found you a situation some days ago but 've delayed telling you because the work is lowly and fear you'll scorn it
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 28
shan't mind what  do
As  am poor and obscure, the help  can offer is of the meanest sort
St John, what are you going to offer her
Not washerwoman,  hope
When  took over the parish two years ago it had no school opened one for boys;  now intend to open one for girls
The school mistress will have a two-roomed cottage paid for by local benefactors and she will receive fifteen pounds a year
You can see how humble, how ignoble it is
On the contrary, Jane is deeply gratified
Mr Rivers,  thank you heartily and  accept with all my heart
But you comprehend me
It's a village school - cottagers daughters
What will you do with all your fine accomplishments
will save them until they are wanted
They will keep
Jane smiles at him
St John is impressed
-
Jane is at the blackboard in a freshly painted school room
In front of her are about twenty village girls, aged from six to sixteen
They are hanging on her every word
Jane is writing a neat line of 'a's
- '
Jane's first home is like a doll's house
She walks through it from the whitewashed bedroom with its little single bed, through the parlour with its tiny fireplace into the scullery kitchen
She retraces her steps back into the parlour
She turns round and surveys it
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 29
Silence but for the crackling of the fire and the blowing of the wind
She feels glad, grateful, but very, very alone
She hears Brocklehurst's voice
hear you are to leave us, Miss Eyre
She spins around as if he is there
Brocklehurst is at the church door; Jane looking at him coldly
She holds a bunch of wild flowers
Yes
Excuse me
She walks into the graveyard
There are over forty small graves marked with wooden crosses, each bearing a child's name
One of them says Helen Burns
Jane lays down her flowers
She looks up at Brocklehurst
He cannot meet her eye
We hear the voice of Mrs Fairfax
(
) If Jane Eyre of Lowood School
- '
Jane tries to quell her great unhappiness
She springs into action, straightening her furniture, stoking her fire
(
) Who advertised in the Yorkshire Herald, possesses the acquirements mentioned
Jane, younger and more hopeful, with her belongings in a small trunk, awaits an approaching public coach
(
) And if she is in a position to give satisfactory references, a situation can be offered where there is but one pupil, a little girl under ten years of age and where the salary is thirty pounds a year
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 30
- '
Jane is in her scullery putting all her energy into scrubbing dishes
(
) Jane Eyre is requested to send references and all particulars to Mrs Fairfax at Thornfield Hall
Jane closes her eyes, trying to banish her thoughts
It is no good
The memories crowd in
-
smiling lady dressed in black approaches her through the darkness - Mrs Alice Fairfax
How do you do, my dear
What a long and tedious journey you must have had of it
John is quite the slowest driver in the county
You must be cold to the bone
Are you Mrs Fairfax
Indeed  am; come and warm yourself in here
Mrs Fairfax leads Jane up the dark corridor and into a cosy parlour
Leah, a young maidservant, follows
(') Your poor hands must be quite numb; here, let me help you
Mrs Fairfax undoes the ribbon on Jane's bonnet
Jane is taken aback, unused to motherliness of any kind
(') Leah, make a little hot port and cut a sandwich or two
Leah eyes Jane with great curiosity
She hurries away
Draw nearer the fire
John is taking your trunk up to your room
Knitting apparatus lies abandoned on a fireside chair
Mrs Fairfax moves it and gestures for Jane to sit
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 31
(') 've put you at the back of the house;  hope you don't mind
The rooms at the front have much finer furniture but they are so gloomy and solitary  think
Jane can't help noticing that every surface is covered in lace, embroidery, or fine crochet
The whole room is an advertisement for Mrs Fairfax's skill at handicrafts - and testament to the hours she has spent alone
(') 'm so glad you are come
To be sure this is a fine old house but must confess that in winter one can feel a little dreary and alone
Leah is a very nice girl and John and Martha good people too, but they are servants - and one cannot talk to them on terms of equality
Am  to have the pleasure of meeting Miss Fairfax tonight
Who
Miss Fairfax - my pupil
Oh you mean Miss Varens; Mr Rochester's ward
She is to be your pupil
Who is Mr Rochester
Why, the owner of Thornfield
thought Thornfield Hall belonged to you
(bursting into laughter) Oh bless you child, what an idea
To me
am only the housekeeper
Forgive me - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 32
There is a distant connection between Mr Rochester and  - his mother was a Fairfax - but 'd never presume on it
Heavens, me, owner of Thornfield
She continues to laugh
bashful smile is playing on Jane's lips
Mrs Fairfax is beginning to thaw her
-   /
Mrs Fairfax is carrying a lamp across the great hall; the only light
Jane can perceive grandeur looming out of the darkness; Jacobean fireplace, coat of arms, head of a stag
Very gloomy, eerie
Her breath is vaporising in the cold
We shall have a cheerful house this winter
As Jane follows Mrs Fairfax up the stairs, light is thrown on portraits of dour, craggy, long dead ancestors
(') With Miss Varens here - and with you - we'll have quite a merry time of it
-
Dark heavy drapes, another striking portrait
dark, voluptuous woman in an 18th Century gown, ruby lipped, one full breast exposed
Jane glances away, taken aback by the woman's bold expression and her nakedness
'm sure that last winter - and what a severe one - if it didn't rain it snowed and if it didn't snow it blew a gale - last winter declare that not a soul came to the house from November to February
Mrs Fairfax leads Jane through the wood-panelled darkness
(') got quite melancholy night after night alone
When spring finally came  thought it a great relief that  hadn't gone distracted
She opens the door to a small but delightful room
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 33
(') Here
Jane looks in: a fire burning, a lamp lit by her bed, a soft quilt, pale chintz curtains
- She is utterly speechless
Her eight years of physical discomfort and hardship are over
Good night, my dear
hope you'll be comfy
Thank you
Mrs Fairfax can see how affected she is - and how hard she is trying to button it down
- '
Jane opens the curtains
She draws her breath in at the sight of the grounds
They are beautiful
-
Jane enters a magnificent room
Mrs Fairfax is dusting
What a beautiful house
Mr Rochester's visits here are always unexpected
He doesn't like to arrive and find everything all swathed up, so keep it in constant readiness
Now, come and meet Miss Varens
Did  mention she was French
-
Adele Varens, an exquisitely dressed child of eight, is chatting animatedly to Jane and Mrs Fairfax
At her side is Sophie, her nurse - a desperately shy and lonely girl
( ) Sophie has been crying because no one understands
Nobody can speak to us except for Mr Rochester and he has gone away
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 34
Would you ask her about her parents
Mr Rochester's neglected to tell me anything about her
( ) Where did you live Adele, before you came to Thornfield
( ) With Maman - but she is gone to the Holy Virgin now
Her mother has passed away
( ) Maman used to teach me to dance and say verses
When gentlemen came to see her  used to dance for them or sit on their knees and sing
May  sing for you now
( ) Well - that would be lovely
(To Mrs Fairfax) Adele is going to show us her accomplishments
Adele adopts a lovelorn pose
She sings an operetta song; a forsaken lady plotting vengeance on her lover
Her high voice warbles with pretended emotion
The effect is rather weird
Jane and Mrs Fairfax watch, open-mouthed
How very French
-  '
Adele's song continues as a voiceover
Mrs Fairfax is finishing a shawl
Jane is showing Adele pictures of little objects that she has sketched
Adele names them in English
The song ends
Jane gives Adele a sketch of herself
Me
It is me
Mrs Fairfax shakes out the finished shawl and puts it round Jane's shoulders, departing before Jane can protest
Here
For you
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 35
Jane is delighted at the kindness of the gift
- Jane holds a candle, the shawl around her; the moaning sound of a gale outside
She holds her candle up to the portrait of the voluptuous woman
She stares at it curious, both as a girl and as an artist
She brings the candle close, to see how the brushwork has achieved the effect of flesh
She hears a low, knowing laugh in the darkness behind her
She is startled
Who's there
Her own huge shadow is the only thing that moves
She hears the laugh again
She follows it through the darkness, alert with fear
door clicks shut at the end of the corridor
To her relief Jane sees Mrs Fairfax approach with a lamp
(') Who sleeps up here
No one
This part of the house is quite empty, except for you and me
heard someone
You can't have done
laugh
Someone laughed
Mrs Fairfax flounders for a second
Oh - that must be Grace Poole
She likes to sit up here with her sewing
Rather an eccentric soul
(She shouts sharply) Grace
Grace
door opens
Jane sees a broad-faced woman with slow, intelligent eyes
She looks as if she has just woken up
(') Miss Eyre has heard a laugh
Grace looks at Jane with sly curiosity
She leaves the sewing room and opens a door through which a flight of steep steps are revealed
Grace climbs them and disappears
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 36
-
Jane is on the turreted roof, looking up at the cawing rooks - and down at the view; a white, frosted wilderness
Jane senses a presence behind her
She quickly turns
Mrs Fairfax is coming through the rooftop door
thought  might find you up here
've been waiting to pour our tea
'm not in need of tea, thank you
Mrs Fairfax approaches, concerned
What is it, child
You've been here three months now and 'm worried that the position is not enough / to occupy your - Oh, Mrs Fairfax, no
'm so thankful to be at Thornfield
Please don't think 'm so ungrateful as to be discontented
But it's a quiet life, isn't it
This isolated house; a still doom for a young woman
Jane looks out at the view once more
wish a woman could have action in her life, like a man
It agitates me to pain that the sky- line over there is ever our limit
long sometimes for a power of vision that would overpass it
If  could behold all  imagine
've never seen a city, never spoken with men
've never even seen a town of any size
And  fear my whole life will pass, without ever having
Mrs Fairfax's troubled look makes Jane fall silent
Mrs Fairfax looks as if she is about to say something - then puts on her practical face, the moment of intimacy gone
Well now - exercise is a great cure for anything, they say
() Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 37
(') have some letters to post; will you take them
Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters
The exercise is lifting her spirits
The sun is sinking, turning the frost gold
brook runs close to the path; half frozen
Its slow trickle is the only sound to be heard
Jane moves slowly, acutely aware of everything around her
Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across the path
Jane slips on it as she passes
The noise of her feet echoes
She steadies herself
She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and begins to freeze as she watches
It is held suspended as if the whole winter is contained in it
The moon is mounting the sky
Jane hears a sound like the beating of wings
The blood is rushing through her ears
Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet
The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush of an approaching horse
It is almost on top of her before she can move
Her shocked, pale face, her black garments startle both horse and rider
What the deuce - The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only to have his horse slip on the ice
Both man and horse fall with a crash
The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo with the sound
The horse is on one side; the man is lying, trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester
(') Hellfire
Jane is confounded
(') Pilot, get down
Can  do anything, sir
Rochester stares at her; a tiny black figure, surrounded by darkening frost, the low moon behind her
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 38
Get back
Jane doesn't move
Rochester turns to his horse
(') Mesrour
Mesrour
With much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to its feet
Rochester seems relieved
He tries to stand himself
His ankle will bear no weight
He lets out an involuntary cry
It echoes: (') Damnation
Are you injured, sir
Rochester looks at her once more
He manages to get himself off the ice
He sits on a nearby stile
Jane approaches him
She now has the moon on her face
She begins to look less like a phantom and more like a girl
(') If you are hurt and want help can fetch someone from the village
'm on my way there to post a letter
Rochester looks as if he doesn't believe her
Where do you come from
Thornfield Hall
Whose house is that
Mr Rochester's
Do you know Mr Rochester
No, 've never seen him
Rochester is trying to place her
She is a puzzle to him
You're not a servant there
am the governess, sir
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 39
The governess
( slow smile) Deuce take me,  had forgotten
Examining Jane once more, he laughs a low laugh
(') The governess
Jane does not like to be laughed at
(') Have you got an umbrella  can use as a stick
No
Then try to get hold of his bridle and lead him to me
Jane doesn't like his imperious tone
She looks at the horse; huge, trampling, nervous
Rochester is amused
(') If you would be so kind
Jane obeys
She endeavours to catch the bridle but the horse rears away
Jane falls on the ice
Rochester bursts out laughing
Jane picks herself up
(') Perhaps it would be easier to bring me to the horse
Come here
Jane resists
(') Forgive me
must beg of you to come here
Jane approaches
Rochester instantly leans all his weight on her
She almost crumples under it; the first time she has ever touched and been touched by a man
She holds him up
And walks him closer to his horse
(') Mesrour
The horse approaches him
Rochester calms it
He springs into the saddle, grimacing as he wrenches his sprain
(') Thank you
(He bows
) Now, make haste with your letter
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 40
Rochester's spurred heel makes the horse start and rear
Jane steps back
The horse bounds away, the dog rushing in its traces
All three disappear
Jane doesn't move until the sound of hooves has faded away
Her face is flushed, her eyes glitter in the dark
/

Jane runs up to the front door
She pushes it open
To her amazement, there is a fire burning in the stone fireplace
The whole hall is lit
The double doors are open into the library
Mrs Fairfax is hurriedly approaching
Mr Rochester is here
Oh
Go and change your frock; he wishes to meet you
have to change
Oh yes -  always dress for the evening when Mr Rochester is here
But all my dresses are the same
() You must have one that is better
He's in a terrible humour; the doctor has been
His horse fell in Hay lane and his ankle is sprained
Mrs Fairfax anxiously hurries back into the library large dog wanders out
Jane finds herself looking at Pilot
She smiles
-
Jane enters
Rochester is in front of a superb fire - one foot bandaged and supported on a stool
Pilot is at his feet - and so is Adele, gazing adoringly at him
Rochester is looking through Jane's portfolio of sketches and watercolours
Jane feels utterly exposed - as if her diary is being read
Mrs Fairfax timidly interrupts

Here is Miss Eyre, Sir
(Without looking up) Let her sit
Jane sits
Rochester continues to study her work
(') have examined Adele and  find you've taken great pains with her
She's not bright, she has no talents - yet in a short time she's made much improvement
Adele is gazing at him uncomprehending, her face radiant
Thank you
You've been resident here three months
Yes, sir
And from whence do you hail; what's your tale of woe
Pardon
All governesses have a tale of woe; what's yours
( ) was brought up by my Aunt, Mrs Reed of Gateshead, in a house far finer than this
At ten years old went to Lowood school where received as good an education as could hope for

Where are your parents
Dead
Do you remember them
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 42
No
And why are you not with Mrs Reed of Gateshead now
She cast me off, sir
Why
Because  was burdensome and she disliked me
Lowood; that's a charity school, isn't it
Yes
How long did you survive there
Eight years
No tale of woe
daily thank providence for sending us Miss Eyre
She's a kind and patient teacher and an invaluable / companion - Don't trouble yourself to give her a character

She began by felling my horse
Sir
have her to thank for this sprain
Mrs Fairfax looks at Jane, bewildered
Rochester lifts one of her watercolours
(') Adele has brought me these; are they yours
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 43
Yes sir
swollen sea
cormorant, a golden bracelet held in its beak
girl's arm coming out of the water, white and deathly, her drowned figure underneath
Where did you get your copies
Out of my head
That head  now see on your shoulders
Yes sir
He turns the next
The top of a hill
An expanse of twilight sky
Rising up, a girl's shape, her forehead crowned with a star, red hair flowing; Helen Burns
Who's this
The evening star
Rochester gives her a direct gaze
Why did you bewitch my horse
Jane cannot reply
-
Jane is by the blackboard, where she is writing sums
Tonight  will have my cadeaux
He always bring me a cadeaux
Mrs Fairfax breathlessly enters
Sorry to disturb
He's asked for your art
Jane looks at her in disbelief
What for
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 44
He wishes to have it
Why
To show to his company,  should think
Is this it here
Thank you
Jane watches helplessly as Mrs Fairfax takes her portfolio
-  /
Jane is crossing the landing holding Adele's hand
Downstairs, the library doors swing wide open
The sound of male laughter can be heard; gentlemen walk out into the hall
Rochester follows, walking with a stick
Monsieur
All eyes turn upon the landing
Jane tries to find a shadow to back into but there are none
Adele curtsies
Ah, there she is
It is unclear whether he is referring to Adele or Jane
He makes a bow
The men are staring at Jane with great curiosity
It makes her uncomfortable
She tugs Adele away
-
box tied with ribbons sits on the table
Ma boite, ma boite
Rochester is leaning against the mantelpiece, drinking
Take it away you genuine daughter of Paris and amuse yourself with disembowelling it
We'll open it together, shall we
Mrs Fairfax kindly leads Adele away
Jane is about to cross the room with them
Miss Eyre
Sit there
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 45
He gestures to a chair by the fire
Jane obeys
She studies Rochester
He is intent on Adele, who is pulling a pink satin dress out of the box
(') 'm not fond of children
Oh Ciel
Que c'est beau
Nor do  particularly enjoy simple-minded old ladies
But you might suit me - if you would
How, sir
By distracting me from the mire of my thoughts
Adele, irrepressible, runs across the room embracing the dress
She drops on one knee at Rochester's feet
Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte
She looks up, seeking his approval
(') That is how Maman used to say, is it not
Precisely
Let's try it on, shall we
Adele skips off with Mrs Fairfax
( ) And that is how she charmed my English gold out of my English breeches pocket
Rochester notices how keenly Jane is observing him
(') Your gaze is very direct, Miss Eyre
'you think me handsome
No sir
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 46
Rochester laughs
(') was too plain;  beg your pardon
What fault do you find with me have all my limbs and all my - Mr Rochester, it was a blunder
ought to have replied that beauty is of little consequence - Now you stick a knife under my - You have other qualities, sir
Just so; other qualities
When was your age  was a felling enough fellow
might have been insulted then
You're blushing Miss Eyre
Not at all
And though you're not pretty any more than  am handsome,  must say it becomes you
( ) And now  see you're fascinated by the flowers on the rug
Jane senses his mockery
(') 'd like to draw you out
Come, speak to me
What about, sir
The choice of subject is entirely yours
How can  introduce a subject when  don't know what'll interest you
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 47
The fact is, Miss Eyre,  don't wish to treat you like an inferior
Yet you'd command me to speak
Well  probably have a right to be a little abrupt and exacting on the grounds of my superiority in age
There must be twenty years between us and a century's advance in experience
don't think you have a right to command me just because you're older
Your claim to superiority depends on the use you've made of your time and experience
've made indifferent use of both
And this is why  sit, galled by my own thoughts - and order you to divert me
Are you very hurt by my tone of command
Jane smiles
There are few masters who'd trouble to enquire whether their paid subordinates were hurt by their commands
Oh yes
paid subordinate; 'd forgotten the salary
Well on that mercenary ground, will you consent to speak with me as my equal - without thinking that the request arises from insolence
'd never mistake informality for insolence, sir
One,  rather like
The other, nothing free born should ever submit to - even for a salary
Humbug
Most free-born things would submit to anything for a salary
But  mentally shake hands with you for your answer
() Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 48
(') Not three in three thousand schoolgirl governesses would have answered me as you've just done
You've clearly not spent much time in the company of schoolgirl governesses
'm the same plain kind of bird as all the rest, with my couple of accomplishments and my common tale of woe
envy you
How
Your openness, your clear conscience, your unpolluted mind
If  were eighteen  think we truly would be equals
Nature meant me to be a good man, one of the better kind and as you see,  am not so
Are you a villain then, sir
'm a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the dissipations that the rich and worthless try to put on life
( ) When  was your age, fate dealt me a blow
was - cursed with a burden to carry through life lacked the wisdom to remain cool and  turned desperate
Dread remorse, Miss Eyre
It is the poison of life
Rochester takes in her open, compassionate face
(') And since happiness is denied me, 've a right to get pleasure in its stead
And  will get it, cost what it may
Then you'll degenerate still more
Are you preaching to me
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 49
'm reminding you of your own words; remorse is the poison of life
But, Miss Eyre, if the pleasure was seeking was sweet and fresh; if it was an inspiration; if it wore the robes of an angel of light
what then
don't know
To speak truth, don't understand you at all
My heart has long been a charnel house
Perhaps it'll transform into a shrine
Sir,  find the conversation has got out of my depth
You're afraid of me because talk like a sphynx
'm not afraid
Yes you are
've simply no wish to talk nonsense
If you did it would be in such a grave, quiet manner that  would mistake it for sense
Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre
This question cuts Jane to the quick
(') Only rarely, perhaps
But you're not naturally austere, any more than 'm naturally vicious
can see in you the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive
Were it but free, it would soar
Cloud high
Jane opens her mouth to speak - but she cannot

Jane is playing battledore and shuttlecock with Adele
Her playing is full of energy, very free
Her cheeks looks almost rosy
It is spring
Just as it turns to come down - that's when you hit it
Adele serves
The game continues apace
Rochester wanders out of the open double doors of the library
He watches
Something lands at his feet
rook's feather
He looks up at the battlements
shape disappears, too fast to see
Rochester's features cloud over with an expression of shame and detestation
He stands in a terrible inner conflict
Jane notices him - she misses her shot
(') Mademoiselle has got to rest
Because  start to win
Have mercy, Adele
Play with Pilot for a while
Rochester is leaning over the balustrade, his head bowed
(') Is our game disturbing you, sir
He looks up
hard and cynical expression has mastered his countenance, something resolute
Jane is taken aback
On the contrary
like your game
like this cold, hard day
like Thornfield
Rochester picks up the black feather
He starts to walk across the grounds at a fast pace
Jane follows
(') 've been arranging a point with my destiny, Miss Eyre
My destiny stood up there by that chimney, like one of the hags who appeared to Macbeth
'You like Thornfield
' She said
'Like it if you dare'
Well,  dare
It's felt like a plague house for years - He turns, the whole house now in his sights
He shouts: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 51
(') But Thornfield is my home and shall like it
Adele is running after them
Mademoiselle - Il faut jouer - Rochester snaps at her with shocking ferocity
Get back
Keep at a distance child, or go in
Adele's face crumples into tears
Rochester sees Jane's shock at his outburst
He walks away
Jane isn't sure whether she has been dismissed or not
Adele has run back to Pilot
Jane watches her
She suddenly finds Rochester is back at her side
He walks her along
(') She's the daughter of an opera dancer, Celine Varens
Celine was a beauty and she professed to love me
Her ardour was so great that, ugly as  am,  believed myself her idol
So  installed in her in a hotel, gave her servants, gowns cashmeres, diamonds - in short, was an idiot
To fall in love, sir
You've never felt love, have you Miss Eyre
Your soul still sleeps
Does it
You're still floating gently in the stream of life, unaware of the rocks ahead waiting to dash you to pieces
Were you dashed to pieces, Mr Rochester
Not by Celine
How can one ever truly love a woman one has paid for
() Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 52
(') It ended when  visited her unexpectedly one night and caught her with her handsome, charmless lover
overheard her waxing lyrical on all my defects - she was mercenary, heartless, senseless
The whole intoxication fell away like a dream
left her money to support the little French floweret over there, whom she swore blind was mine
see no proof of my grim paternity in her features;  think Pilot is more like me than she
But you took her on
Adele is curled up, seeking comfort from the dog
Some years later,  heard that Celine had abandoned the brat, disappeared to Italy and left it destitute
So  lifted it from the mud and slime of Paris and brought it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden
My one good work in a sea of countless sins
Jane is looking at Adele full of compassion
(') You listen, Miss Eyre, as if it was the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to an inexperienced girl like you
Adele
Adele looks up
Rochester speaks graciously
(') Forgive me; for keeping Miss Eyre from your game for so long
Adele is immensely gratified by his apology

Jane, aged ten, is walking along the long gallery
She opens a door and finds herself in the Red Room
She stares into the mirror, searching the pale face of her reflection, as if trying to find an answer
murmur seems to come down the gaping chimney; a woman's deep sigh
Jane's throat tightens with fear
Something moves in the shadows behind her
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 53
She scans them, her eyes full of terror
Jane knows beyond all doubt that something is there
She hears a low laugh
It seems to be right next to her
She tries to scream - -
Jane wakes
Her curtains are open; moonlight spilling in
She hears it again; the laugh from her dream, right outside her door - low and deep
Who's there
Footsteps run away
Jane springs out of bed and pulls the door open
door shuts at the end of the corridor
There is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush matting, flickering in the draft
Jane picks it up
She notices something else - a curling wreath of grey smoke
She follows its trail through the pitch darkness
It is coming thickly from a half-open door at the front of the house - Rochester's
Jane rushes in
Rochester's bed is on fire; the hangings, the curtains, all are alight
The flames are leaping
Rochester is asleep
She shakes him
(') Wake up
Wake up
Sir
Rochester only stirs
The smoke has stupefied him
Jane pulls the burning sheets off - then stops; he is naked
She takes his basin and douses the bed - soaking him
Who's there
It is , Jane Eyre, sir
Jane takes the ewer and throws water on the curtains
She pulls the soggy fabric from its rail and smothers the burning couch
When all the flames are out, she rushes to the windows and opens them
Smoke billows out
She stands in the moonlight, coughing
Rochester is sitting up, staring at her
What in the name of all the elves in Christendom have you done with me
For heaven's sake get up
Somebody has plotted something; you must find out who
'll light the lamp - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 54
Light the lamp at your peril
Rochester is springing out of bed
Jane turns away, mortified - having caught sight of his silhouetted shape
heard a laugh outside my door loud enough to wake me
opened it
Someone was running towards the third floor
Rochester is putting on a dressing gown, lighting the lamp
(') And a candle was left burning in the middle of the floor
Shall fetch Mrs Fairfax, sir
What the deuce can she do
Then 'll wake John and Martha
Not at all
Stay here
You're shivering
Rochester gets his coat and puts it round her
(') have to go to the third floor
Don't make a sound
Sit there shan't be long
He goes
Jane looks at his ruined chamber; The blackened drapes on the four poster bed, the fireplace, the huge wardrobe
It is not unlike the red room
- '
Half an hour later
First light
Jane is in an armchair
She has snuggled up in the coat
She takes in a breath, smelling its owner
She nuzzles her head against it
She closes her eyes, running her fingers down the lining
She looks up
Rochester is watching her
His expression is peculiar
She holds the coat closely around her
Did you see anything when you opened your chamber door
Only the candle on the ground
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 55
But you heard a laugh
Yes
Have you heard that laugh before
There's a woman who sews here; Grace Poole - She laughs in that way,  think
Just so
Grace Poole - you have guessed it
Well, you're no talking fool; please say nothing about this
- will account for this state of affairs
Go back to your room and say nothing
Yes, sir
(She takes off his coat) Good-night
Is that how you're going to leave me
You said  should go
Rochester approaches her
Jane, fire is a horrible death
You have saved my life
Don't walk past me as if we were strangers
What am  to do then, sir
At least
shake hands
Rochester holds out his hand
Jane takes it
They shake
Rochester wraps Jane's hand in both of his
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 56
(') have a pleasure in owing you my life
There is no debt
knew you would do me good in some way
saw it in your eyes when first beheld you
Their expression did not - did not strike delight into my very inmost being so, for nothing
People talk of natural sympathies
You
Rochester is drawing her slowly closer
Jane, disconcerted, is trying to resist
Good night then, sir
So you will leave me
'm cold
Go
At last, he relaxes his grip
She backs away
She goes
'
Jane is keeling on the windowsill, looking out at the rising sun
She is lit by its glowing rays; inspired
It's a rare feeling that prompts her mood, as new and unfolding as the day itself - happiness
- '
Jane looks in to see Leah and Martha cleaning the soot from the woodwork and windowpanes
To her amazement, Grace Poole is there, calmly sewing rings to new curtains
Good day to you, miss
What's happened here
() Only master reading in his bed last night
() Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 57
(') Fell asleep with his candle lit and the curtains got on fire
Managed to put it out with the water from his stand
Did you not hear anything, miss
did
heard a strange laugh
It's hardly likely the master would laugh when he was in such danger
Perhaps you were dreaming
was not
Then you didn't think of opening your door and looking out
Jane is infuriated
She turns on her heel
-  '
Jane walks in
Their meal is laid out
Has Mr Rochester not sent for us today
Why, he's gone away
Were you not aware
He left after breakfast
Jane takes this piece of news like an invisible shock
(') He's gone to The Leas, Mr Eshton's place, about ten miles from here
believe Blanche Ingram is there
She's a great favourite of his
Oh
saw her two years ago when Mr Rochester had a party here
Oh, she was a beauty;  daresay the most elegant girl 've ever seen
So tall, with raven hair cascading down her back;  don't know how she'd had it done
She sang a duet with Mr Rochester
They made a lovely harmony
() Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 58
(') was quite surprised he didn't make a proposal
Perhaps that is his intention now
-
Jane is at the window, brooding
Outside the rain is pouring
Adele, dressed in yellow frills, is concerned
Qu'avez vous mademoiselle
(without looking at her) Nothing
Speak in English, please
Jane turns, expecting to see Adele
-
Jane finds herself in front of her class
They are looking at her expectantly
She looks back at them curiously
Eager faces, plain rural clothes
She has quite lost her place
Thank you, girls
You may go
-
Jane is tidying up at the end of the day
The classroom is empty
Her life is bare
It shows on her face
She looks up
St John Rivers is watching her from the door
Do you find the work too hard
Jane immediately puts on a sprightly face and continues clearing up
Not at all
'm getting on very well
Do you feel the solitude an oppression
hardly have time to notice it
Then perhaps your accommodations have disappointed you
They are in truth scanty enough - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 59
few months ago  had nothing was wretched
Now  have a home and work; free and honest wonder at the goodness of God and at the generosity of my friends
St John approaches her; speaks intimately
What you had left before  met you,  don't know
But  counsel you to resist firmly every temptation to look back
It's what  mean to do
We can overcome every kind of human weakness
year ago  was myself intensely miserable
considered my life was so wretched that it must be changed - or  would die
After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke
heard my call from God
Put your trust in him, Jane
Let him lead you to your future
Thank you
St John is turning to go
(') Why were you intensely miserable
year ago,  was weak enough to fall in love
Jane moves involuntarily towards him
(') Don't pity me;  have no compassion whatsoever for you
regarded this love as a fever of the flesh; not a thing that would ever touch my soul
scorned the weakness, fought hard against it - and won
Jane is incredulous
St John is at her desk
It is covered in her drawings
He glances through them
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 60
(') could have listened to temptation, sunk down in the silken snare and known a feverish and delusive bliss
could have squandered my future upon it
You could have been happy
slave in a fool's paradise
'd rather my life had purpose - St John suddenly snatches up a piece of paper
(') Is this yours
Yes
His eyes, in an instant, seem to take in everything about her
He opens his mouth to speak - then checks himself
(') What's the matter
Nothing in the world
He folds the paper and takes it
(') Good night
He goes
Jane looks after him, puzzled
-
Mrs Fairfax approaches Jane with a letter in her hand
He's back in three days he says - heavens that's Thursday - and not alone
He gives directions to prepare all the best rooms
'm to get more staff from the George Inn
The ladies will bring their maids, the gentlemen, valets
We must accommodate them all
Supplies to be got; linen, the - Mrs Fairfax has worked herself up into quite a panic
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 61
(') 'll get started
'll go to the George
No, 'll tell Martha
Jane can sense that the old lady is overwhelmed
May  assist you, Mrs Fairfax
We see Mrs Fairfax approach Jane in a rush of gratitude
-
Jane wears a housekeeper's apron over her dress
She enters Rochester's room with an armful of bed linen
It has been returned to its former glory
Adele is jumping up and down on the bed
Sophie is trying to coax her off it
Jane gives Sophie the sheets
Adele leaves the room with Jane and skids all the way down the newly polished gallery in her stockinged feet
Jane can't help smiling
-
Jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table in order to dust them
The kitchen is a hive of activity - except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by the fire, smoking a pipe; Grace Poole
Leah and one of the hired under cooks are talking abut her
She gets good wages, 'd guess
Wish  had as good; not one fifth what Mrs Poole receives
Jane affects not to listen, but is keenly interested
(') And she's laying it all by shouldn't wonder if she's saved enough to keep her independent
She's a good hand,  daresay
Not everyone could do it, that's for sure, not even for the money
No wonder the master relies on - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 62
Leah notices Jane's curious glance
She nudges the under cook
Jane, picks up the bottles and carries them away
As she passes she hears: (') Doesn't she know
At that moment, Adele rushes in
They're here
They're here
Mrs Fairfax tries to get her apron off
She becomes flustered
Jane helps her
Thank you
Mrs Fairfax and Adele go
Jane looks out of the window
Her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the arriving party; Rochester and Blanche, the dark beauty at his side
She is laughing at something
The sun shines behind her
Jane is dazzled
She turns away
-
Jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just as the ladies start to issue from their rooms
She stands back in a dark corner
There is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by
They descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist
Jane steps out
She walks right into the path of Blanche Ingram, who is dressed in white
They both startle
Excuse me, miss
Blanche gives her a look of ice
Rochester is at the top of the stairs
Good evening
They both turn
Rochester has seen Blanche, not Jane
He offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration
Jane sinks back into the shadows
(') May
Blanche lays her gloved hand on Rochester's arm, barely touching him
They glide away
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 63
-
Adele and Jane sit on the stairs, listening to Blanche and Rochester sing
Their voices thrill
Jane is trying not to feel
But when Rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful note, she involuntarily closes her eyes
Adele leans into Jane
She is crying
What is it, darling
She sing like Maman
Jane, full of compassion, takes Adele back to her room
-
Mrs Fairfax enters in a great hurry
Tonight
He wants you both in the drawing room after dinner
Adele leaps up, delighted
Jane is crestfallen
Not me, surely
It's his particular wish
He was being polite
'm instructed to tell you that if you resist, he'll come up and get you himself
You needn't stay long
Just let him see you and then slip away
Don't worry; no one'll look at you
-   / Jane is delivering Adele into the centre of the company
May  present Miss Adele Varens
Bon jour, mesdames, monsieurs
Jane finds it hard to get a proper impression of the guests, as she cannot raise her eyes to look at them
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 64
Adele makes a dainty curtsey - pink frock, hair in ringlets, little lace gloves
In the midst of the crowd is Blanche
Why, what a little puppet
(mutton dressed as lamb) Is this your ward, Mr Rochester
Yes
(English rose; nineteen) What a love of a child
Adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses
Only one guest is still looking in Jane's direction; Blanche
Her lip curls in distaste
Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of refuge
She closes her eyes
great Atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine
When she opens her eyes, Rochester is in her line of vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men
He senses her gaze; glances at her
Jane looks down, pulling her work on to her lap; a beaded purse
She does not lift her eyes from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class - and of her love
Blanche sidles up to Rochester
thought you weren't fond of children
You're right; 'm not
Then what induced you to take charge of that little doll
Rochester turns away from Jane
She was left on my hands
Why don't you send her to school
She has a governess
Jane glances up; sees Rochester's back to her, throws her eyes down, once more
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 65
You should hear mamma on the chapter of governesses
had half a dozen in my day - all detestable, ridiculous incubi - were they not, mamma
Did you speak, my lily flower
said governesses
The reaction is instant
Oh, don't mention them; the very word makes me nervous
've suffered a martyrdom from their incompetence and caprice
thank heaven we're now done with them
have just one word to say of the whole tribe; nuisance
Jane's fingers sew
Only the briefest flash of her eyes towards the company shows her mortification
Blanche has started playing a brilliant prelude on the piano
(') We shall have music - and new subject, if you please
Signor Eduardo, what shall it be
Donna Bianca,  give you beauty
Beauty
Why there's nothing new to be said
give you back male beauty
Mamma, what's your idea of male beauty
My son, of course
Hear hear
Oh, Tedo's quite typical of the young men of today
They're so absorbed in the pursuit of fashion that they've forgotten how to be men at all
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 66
say - woman who neglects herself is a blot on humanity
But a man should pay no heed to his looks
(Glancing at Rochester) man should possess only strength and valour
He could be a gentleman or a highwayman
His beauty lies in his power
So a Levantine pirate would do for you
() As long as he resembled you
Rochester laughs loudly
Jane is heading for the door
(') am serious
To my mind, a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him
Jane closes the door on Blanche
She breathes in fresh air, nauseous
Blanche's splendid prelude drifts out
Rochester comes into the hall from the other door
Jane instantly bends down and pretends to be tying her shoe
Why did you leave the room
am tired, sir
Why didn't you come and speak to me
haven't seen you for weeks
It would have been normal and polite to wish me good evening
You seemed engaged, sir
What have you been doing while 've been gone
Teaching Adele
You look pale
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 67
am well
You're depressed; your eyes are shining with tears
What's the meaning of this
Jane catches sight of Mrs Fairfax, who is watching them with an expression of unease
Rochester glares at her
gentleman has arrived to see you, sir
Who
He says he's travelled a long way, from Spanish Town, Jamaica - Rochester seems winded
(') And indeed  think he must have come from some hot country because he won't take off his coat
Spanish Town
Mr Richard Mason
He says you're old friends
've put him in the morning room
Rochester cannot speak
(') Have  done wrong
Not at all
Please tell him 'll see him directly
Mrs Fairfax goes
(') Oh Jane - Jane
This is a blow
Can  help you sir
In the drawing room, Blanche's prelude finishes to enthusiastic applause
Rochester has Jane's hand
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 68
Jane, if all those people came and spat at me, what would you do
Turn them out of the room sir, if could
And if they cast you out for adhering to me
should care nothing about it
You'd dare censure for my sake
Jane is frightened of his passion
For the sake of any friend who deserved it
Rochester lets her hand go
He steps back
He goes to the morning room
Jane peers through the door, worrying how her last words have given offence
She sees a man rising to meet Rochester; handsome but gaunt and painfully thin
His smile doesn't reach his eyes - as if his soul is not quite his own
Fairfax
Richard
How the devil are you
They embrace, Rochester doing a fine impression of delight
-
Jane is standing on the pedestal of infamy, ten years old
Helen Burns is walking towards her with something in her arms
The rising sun is all around her
He is yours
Jane looks down at the bundle
In it, is a newborn boy
Jane looks up to ask Helen for help
But Helen has gone
Jane alone with her burden, teeters on the stool
The baby starts to cry
Jane panics
The crying becomes deafening, terrifying
It is not a baby's cry but a human scream
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 69
- ' /
Jane wakes, hearing a savage, sharp shriek of such power and intensity it seems to tear the night in two
Overhead, the sounds of a struggle begin - a deadly one
Jane hears footsteps rush past her door
She starts to pull on her dress
She hears a man's voice from above: (
) Help
Rochester, for God's sake come
great stamp on the floor above; something falls with a thud; silence
Jane grabs her candle and leaves her room
The guests likewise are all issuing from their rooms; some with candles, some stumbling into the dark
The gallery is filling with terrified ladies and shocked gentlemen
Their shadows dance grotesquely on the walls
Oh what is it
Who is hurt
Where the devil is Rochester
Rochester comes forth from the door at the end of the gallery, holding a candelabra
'm here, be composed
Blanche flies towards him like a banshee
What awful event has taken place
She embraces him
Rochester patiently removes her
servant has had a nightmare, that's all
She's an excitable, nervous person and has taken a fit with fright
Jane, the only person behind Rochester, sees by the light of her candle that his dressing gown is trailing blood
(') Now  must see you back into your rooms because until the house is settled, she can't be properly looked after
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 70
Is there anything  might do
Miss Ingram, ladies, please return to your nests like the doves that you are
You'll take cold for certain if you stay in this icy gallery any longer
The candles flicker and fade as the guests make their way back to their rooms
Rochester sees Jane
(') Come this way
Make no noise
-
Rochester stops by a low door
He puts a key in the lock
Be steady
need you
He unlocks it
room hung with tapestries; a four poster bed with its curtains half drawn
One part of the tapestry is hooked up over a hidden door - which lies open to an inner chamber
dull, sickly light shines out
(') Wait
He goes to the inner chamber
grim laugh greets him
(') Thank you, Mrs Poole
He locks the door
Jane shudders
He goes to the bed
(') Here
Bring the candle
Jane obeys
Richard Mason is lying, one arm and all the linen soaked in blood
Jane controls her reaction and makes herself useful
Rochester is cleaning the wound
Am  dying
No
She bit me - while the knife was in - Bit me - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 71
It was folly to attempt the interview tonight and alone
thought  might have done some good
It makes me impatient to hear you
She sucked the blood
Said she'd drain me - like a vampire - Think of her as dead, dead and buried
Say nothing
Mason is silenced
Rochester puts the bloody sponge into Jane's hand
(') am going for a doctor
must leave you here with him
Sponge the blood away when it returns
Give him water if he wants it
Do not speak to him for any reason
And Richard - on pain of death - do not speak to her
Rochester takes the candelabra
He is gone
Mason is staring at Jane
There is something about the pupils in his eyes that she finds deadly, chilling
She dips the sponge in the bloody water and wipes away the trickling gore
She hears a low moan
She looks over at the door to the inner chamber, aching to know the mystery behind it
Mason makes her start by taking her wrist
He is trying to say something
Jane puts her finger to her lips
She is begging him not to speak
-
Rochester and Dr Carter are carrying Mason down the stairs
only wish  could have got here sooner
He'd not have bled so much
Jane, make sure the way is clear
Jane looks out on to the gallery
She is pale, drawn
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 72
-
carriage waits
Rochester lifts Mason in to Dr Carter
Jane hands in Mason's great coat
She stands back
'll ride over tomorrow to see how you do
Goodbye, Richard
Fairfax - Let her treated as tenderly as may be - do my best and have done it and will do it
The carriage goes
Jane prepares to go inside but Rochester walks her towards the orchard
(') Come, Jane
That house is a dungeon, don't you feel it
It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir
It is slime and cobwebs
-
The orchard is a different world; the dawn light illuminating dewy trees
Rochester is silent
Jane is trying to fathom him
Will Grace Poole stay here now
Oh yes, don't trouble your head about her
But sir - Grace Poole is not the danger
He walks off, pulling the heads off flowers as he passes
(') You've noticed my tender feelings for Miss Ingram
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 73
Yes sir
Keep vigil with me again, the night before  marry
For now you've met my lovely one and you know her
She's a rare one, isn't she
Yes sir
strapper, a real strapper; big and buxom
He throws a cankered rose across the orchard
Jane manages to articulate her anxiety
'd do anything for you sir, anything that was right
() And if  ever bid you do what was wrong, you'd turn to me, quiet and pale and say ' cannot do it
' And you'd be as immutable as a fixed star
Rochester, gazing at her, seems to have decided something
He turns a corner and is gone
Jane is left alone
We hear the sound of a blow
-
The brutal face of John Reed, aged fourteen, triumphant after hitting Jane
That's for the look you had on your face
-
Jane enters as Rochester helps Blanche to line up a shot
He is leaning intimately over her
She coyly permits him
Excuse me, sir
Jane has ruined Blanche's shot
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 74
Does that creeping creature want you
-
Rochester has followed Jane out of the billiard room
If you please,  want leave of absence for a week or two
What to do
Jane shows him the letter
This is from my old nurse, Bessie
She says my cousin John Reed is dead
He ruined himself and has committed suicide
The news has so shocked his mother, my Aunt, that it's brought on a stroke
What good can you do her
She's been asking for me parted from her very badly and can't neglect her wishes now
Promise me you won't stay long
Sir, it seems you are soon to be married
What of it
Adele should go to school
To get her out of my bride's way who might otherwise trample her
And  must seek another situation
intend to advertise
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 75
At your peril you advertise
Trust it to me
'll find you a good situation in time
He is on the point of returning to the billiard room
And sir
Forgive me but  have had no wages as yet
How much do  owe you
Fifteen pounds
Rochester looks in his wallet
Here's fifty
That's too much
Take your wages
cannot
Then  only have a ten
( ) Now you owe me five
Just so
Come back for it quickly
Meantime,  shall safeguard it in here
He taps the wallet, which is in his breast pocket
(') Do you trust me to keep it, Jane
() Not a whit, sir
You are not to be trusted at all
Rochester strides away, grinning
Jane turns

How is Mrs Reed
She may linger yet a while
She's spoken of you daily
At first we couldn't tell what she was saying but when her speech came clear we heard 'Jane Eyre, get Jane Eyre
' Shall  see her now
'll take you up directly
But look at you
What a lady you've become
Why you're almost pretty
-  ' Jane takes her aunt's hand
Mrs Reed looks very near death
Aunt Reed
It is Jane Eyre
You sent for me, and here  am
Mrs Reed, with an effort, pulls her hand away from Jane's
No one knows the trouble  have with that child
Such a burden
Left on my hands
Speaking to me like a fiend
The fever at Lowood
She should have died
Why do you hate her so
Her mother
Reed's sister - his beloved
When news came of her death he wept like a fool
Sent for the baby
Sickly thing - not strong like mine
But Reed loved it
Kept it by his bed
Made me vow to bring the creature up
Why did he not love mine
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 77
The words are a revelation to Jane
Mrs Reed gazes at her
(') Who are you
am Jane Eyre, Aunt
You
Is there no one in the room
Jane motions Bessie to go
We are alone
've twice done you wrong broke the vow  made to Reed - Please, don't think of it - am dying;  must get it out
Mrs Reed indicates a box on her bedside table

Fortune has blessed my endeavours and as  am childless  wish to adopt her and bequeath her at my death whatever may have to leave
Yours, John Eyre, Madeira
' Jane is stunned

Why did  never hear of it
Because  wrote and told him you had died of typhus at Lowood school

You were born to be my torment
'll never forget how you turned on me and raged

Forgive me
You cursed me

My life has been cursed
Please, let us be reconciled
Mrs Reed shrinks from Jane's touch
Jane wipes her tears
(') Then love me or hate me as you will
You have my full and free forgiveness
Now ask for God's - and be at peace
Mrs Reed's eyes close

The morning sun is pouring in
Jane goes to the bed
She puts her hand upon it, gently, as if thanking her uncle for all he did
She notices a picture on the wall
miniature of a brown-haired woman with elfin eyes
Jane takes it off the wall
Bessie comes in
My mother
Bessie nods
tear rolls down Jane's face
She clasps the picture, looking round the room
(') Why ever was  so afraid
coach pulls up in the lane near Thornfield
Jane gets out

) My dear uncle, some years ago, my Aunt Reed mistakenly informed you that  had died

All is green and verdant and bathed in sunset light
There seems to be life everywhere

) am writing to tell you that am very much alive and living at Thornfield Hall, where  am currently governess to the ward of Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester - (
) There you are
Jane turns
Rochester is sitting on the stile where they first met
For a moment, her every nerve is unstrung
(') Just like one of your tricks to steal into your home along with the twilight
Where the deuce have you been this last month
have been with my aunt sir, who is dead
Rochester laughs
true Janian reply
If  dared 'd touch you, to see if you were real
Jane puts out her hand
Rochester takes it
He helps Jane over the stile
(') Go home - stay your wandering feet at a friend's threshold
Jane lets go of his hand
Thank you Mr Rochester
'm strangely glad to get back again to you
Wherever you are is my home
Jane, knowing she has said too much, turns and runs over the fields towards Thornfield

We're expecting the announcement very soon
He went down to London only last week to buy her a new carriage
Then we must accept it
He'll soon bring home his bride
Mrs Fairfax nods
- Jane is alone, drinking in the beauty of the evening - looking at the gardens as if she may never see them again
She turns a corner and sees Rochester staring intently at something
His back is to her
She is about to tiptoe away
Come and look at this fellow, Jane
Jane approaches, wondering how he has sensed her presence
Rochester is looking at a huge moth
(') Look at his wings
He looks West Indian -  have never seen one like him, here
There; flown
They watch the moth as it flies towards the house

Yes, but it can't be helped soon hope to be a bridegroom

They're such warm-hearted people, they say
It is a long way away, sir
From what
From here
From you
We've been good friends, Jane haven't we
But with the Irish sea between us you'd soon forget me
Jane's great distress escapes her

've known you Mr Rochester - Then why must you be torn from me
Because of your bride

But you will have
Yes,  will

As we are
Jane struggles away from him
Let me go
- 'm a free human being with an independent will, which  now exert to leave you
Rochester releases her
She stands in front of him
Then let your will decide your destiny
offer you my hand, my heart and a share of all this
He gestures towards the house, the land
Jane is stunned

Jane, you are my equal and my likeness
It is you intend to marry
Are you mocking me
Do you doubt me
Entirely

You have no faith in me
Not a whit
You little sceptic
Your bride is Miss Ingram - What love have  for Miss Ingram
What love has she for me caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was lost and got instant coldness
wanted to make you jealous, to move you to love me
It's you - you strange, unearthly thing
love you as my own flesh
You - poor and obscure as you are - please accept me as your husband
Jane begins to believe him
Are you in earnest
must have you for my own
You wish me to be your wife
swear it
You love me

Then sir,  will marry you
They embrace
Neither Jane nor Rochester moves
Darkness is almost complete
Still the intensity of the embrace is held
It will atone

Rochester and Jane run to the front entrance
He holds his jacket around her
Lightning
They reach the dry hearth inside
Thunder
They are both euphoric, breathless, laughing

Good night
Good night
He kisses her
They kiss again
Jane will not let him go
Good night
As Jane runs upstairs she sees Mrs Fairfax, deeply shocked
-  ' Jane wears a lilac gown
Mrs Fairfax is very concerned
Have you accepted him
Yes
Well  never would have thought
Jane is hurt
Am  a monster
Is it so impossible that Mr Rochester should love me
No, 've long noticed that you were a sort of pet of his
But you're so young and so little acquainted with men
don't want to grieve you child, but let me put you on your guard
Gentlemen in his position
Let's just say they're not accustomed to marry their governesses
Until you are wed, distrust yourself as well as him
Please, keep him at a distance - Jane has heard enough
She turns away
Thank you

She laughs as he raises her off the ground
Is this my pale elf
This sunny faced girl with the radiant eyes
It is , Jane Eyre sir
Soon to be Jane Rochester
It can never be, sir
Human beings were not meant to enjoy complete happiness on this earth
It's too much like a fairy tale
( ) Let the fairy tale begin

Rochester is rolling out reams of beautiful silks
Jane gets more uncomfortable as she looks at them
This morning  wrote to my banker in London to send certain jewels
In a day or two  hope to pour them into you lap - Oh, no sir - will put the diamond chain around your neck myself - don't want jewels - 'll dress you in these satins - Then you won't know me
'll not be Jane Eyre any longer but an ape in a harlequin's jacket
Put them away
Jane pushes the silks away
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 86
Well for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your equal
'm naturally proud
And hard and flinty
You ought to know what sort of bargain you've made while you've still got time to rescind it
want only one thing from you, Mr Rochester
And what's that
Your regard
Jane puts her arm through Rochester's
He smiles
It's your time now, little tyrant but it'll soon be mine and when have seized you, to have and to hold, 'll attach you to a chain, like this
Rochester flicks his watch into the air

She is dressed in a nightgown - like a shroud
Over her head, she wears Jane's bridal veil; a phantom bride
Jane is paralysed with terror
The form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half; bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect
The last thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly
Her eyes are glittering with hatred
The figure takes the candle and bends down to Jane
Her intention looks deadly
Jane's breath catches
She cannot breathe
The figure moves closer, then blows out the candle

He slows the horse

It must have been half-dream, half- reality

It was not Grace Poole
Rochester keeps talking over her
You know how strange she is
What did she do to me
To Mason
In a state between sleeping and waking - was not asleep
You noticed her entrance and her actions but you've ascribed to her an appearance different from her own
That was your nightmare - know what  saw
see you'd ask why  keep such a woman in my house
When we've been married a year and a day,  promise 'll tell you
Are you satisfied Jane
Do you accept my solution
Jane clearly doesn't

Rochester grips her hand
They quit the house

Rochester, grimly resolute, is striding at a pace Jane can hardly follow
Her satin shoes are muddy
She is becoming breathless

Rochester is striding purposefully towards a small church of ancient design
Jane stumbles
Rochester is contrite
Jane tries to collect herself

At the altar, Jane glances at Rochester
He is looking straight ahead at the clergyman, Wood

There is not a sound

Two men rapidly enter
One of them Briggs, hurries up the aisle

Rochester moves, shaken
Proceed
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 90
The ceremony is quite broken off
An insuperable impediment to this marriage exists
Proceed

Wood is utterly dismayed

Briggs starts to read out a document

) affirm and can prove that Edward Fairfax Rochester was fifteen years ago married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason at St James church, Spanish Town, Jamaica
Jane looks at Rochester
She forces him to look at her
He denies nothing; defies everything
(') The record of the marriage will be found in the register of that church - a copy of it is now in my possession
Signed, Richard Mason
Rochester turns to Briggs
That does not prove that my wife is still living
She was living two months ago
How do you know

Produce him or go to hell
The figure by the door steps out of the shadows
It is Richard Mason
Rochester flies down the aisle, a groan of rage escapes him

He turns towards Jane
She remains where she was abandoned - at the altar - tiny, under he vaulted arch
The bouquet falls from her hand
Rochester walks to her
This girl knew nothing
She thought all was fair and legal
She never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch
tiny breath is the only noise Jane utters
Rochester pulls her from the altar to his side

He unlocks the inner door with one hand; the other won't let go of Jane

Rochester leads Jane and the men into the room
There is no window, no furniture except for Grace's chair; only a mattress on the floor

She closes her eyes
Jane lies curled up on a rock at the bottom of a dried-up river bed
All of nature is suspended in stillness
Far away, we hear the sound of a flood loosened in the remote mountains
We hear the sound of the torrent approach

First light
Jane is running; flushed, breathless, her dress soaked with dew
She has her bag of belongings over her shoulder
She trips; falls to her knees
She looks back
For a moment she seems paralysed
She returns her gaze to the route ahead
Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forwards until she is able to raise herself to her feet
She reaches the stile; lifts herself on to it; puts her arms around the post
She holds it, as if it were beloved
Her eyes close
We hear the sound of a winter blizzard
'
Jane opens her eyes
She is sitting at her fireside
Outside, a snowstorm howls
On her knee is a sketchbook
She looks down at it
Rochester's dark eye is beginning to appear on her paper
She puts a line through it; scribbles it out, blinding him
She stands up, trying to escape her thoughts
She whispers: Edward
There is a loud knock on the door
Jane starts
: Jane opening the door
Rochester is there, standing in the frozen hurricane and howling darkness
Jane
Jane pulls him inside
She falls into his arms
They embrace passionately
Jane is actively pulling him towards her, delirious with love and longing

St John Rivers is there, having waded through the drifting snow
Mr St John - What on earth brings you away from your hearth on a night like this
Has anything happened
There's no bad news hope
How easily alarmed you are
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 102
He takes off his cloak; stamps the snow off his boots
(') The snow was up to my waist at one point
You are recklessly rash about your own health
Nonsense
St John's eyes alight on Jane's charcoal drawing
Jane snatches it away too late
There is a moment of silence
Why are you come
An inhospitable question
mean on a night like this - got tired of my mute books and empty rooms
Besides 've been told half a story and 'm most impatient to find out the end
Please
Jane motions to St John to sit
He doesn't
She becomes increasingly uneasy as he speaks
Twenty years ago, a poor curate fell in love with a rich man's daughter and married her
She was disowned by her family and two years later the rash pair were both dead
They left a daughter which charity received into her lap - as cold as that snow drift  almost stuck fast in
Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations
It was reared by an aunt-in-law;  come to names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead
Jane starts
She is on her feet
(') Mrs Reed kept the orphan ten years and at the end of that time she was sent to Lowood school
() Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 103
(') It seems her career there was very honourable
She became a teacher like yourself, and left it, like yourself, to be a governess
She undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr Rochester - Mr Rivers
- can guess your feelings but hear me to the end
Of Mr Rochester's character  know nothing but he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl and at the very altar she discovered that he had a wife yet alive
His subsequent conduct is a matter of pure conjecture but when the governess was enquired after it was discovered that she had fled Thornfield Hall and no trace of her has since been found
Now isn't that an odd tale
Since you know so much, perhaps you can tell me how he is
Who
Mr Rochester; how is he
'm ignorant of all concerning him
St John opens his pocket book and removes a piece of paper
(') Well, since you won't ask the governess's name,  must tell you
have it written down here in black and white
He hands her the paper
On it are doodled the heads of some of her pupils
She has absently written Jane Eyre in the margin several times

This paper resolved my suspicion into certainty
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 104
The solicitor - Mr Briggs - does he have any news of Mr Rochester
Are you not going to enquire why he has gone to such lengths to find you
What does he want with me
Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr John Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he has left you all his property and that you are now rich
What
You are rich; quite an heiress
Silence
Jane is flabbergasted
(') Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the will and all the necessary documents
You can enter on immediate possession
At last, Jane looks questioningly up at him
(') Your forehead unbends at last; thought you were turning to stone
Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth
How much am  worth
Oh a trifle
Twenty thousand pounds - but what of that
The news literally takes Jane's breath away
Twenty thousand pounds
St John begins to laugh at Jane's reaction
She has never seen him laugh before
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 105
If you'd committed a murder and 'd found you out, you could scarcely look more aghast
There must be some mistake
It's two thousand, surely
It's twenty
You look desperately miserable about it,  must say
Jane still cannot take it in
She frowns in disbelief
Why did Mr Briggs write to you
You see, that is the strange thing
It makes me wonder what power or providence led you to our door
Your name is Jane Eyre
Yes
Then 'm you namesake

St John Eyre - My mother had two brothers, one was a clergyman, your father, the other was John Eyre of Madeira

Your mother was my father's sister
Yes
My uncle John was your uncle John
That is correct
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 106
So you, Diana and Mary - We are cousins, yes
Jane is deeply moved
Oh,  am glad
-  am glad
She throws her arms around St John
Tears of happiness start to flow
He, finding it peculiar to be held, gently tries to calm her
Here you are neglecting essential points to pursue trifles
You were utterly downhearted when  told you that you were rich and now, for a matter of no moment, you are deliriously happy
Of no moment
You have sisters and maybe don't care for a cousin but have nobody
have been alone, always
And now three relations are born into my world full grown
Oh, am glad
You, who saved my life - You must try to tranquillise your feelings
Jane finally releases him, still radiant with joy
Write to Diana and Mary
Tell them to hand in notice and come home
They will have five thousand each and so will you
've told you the news too quickly
You're confused
Don't put me out of patience, cousin
am rational enough
Twenty thousand divided equally between the nieces and nephews of our uncle, gives five to each
This is acting on first impulse

There is a lightness to all three as if a great weight has been lifted from their shoulders
Diana is setting Jane's hair into curls like her own

-
The girls each have a candle
St John kisses Mary
He kisses Diana
Good night
You call Jane your sister but you don't treat her as such
You should kiss her too
Jane turns to Diana, embarrassed
Di, you are very provoking
As she turns back, she finds St John's face right in front of her
He kisses her
kiss with no warmth; an experiment
He examines its effect
He is satisfied
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 108
Good night

Jane closes the door
She puts her hand across her lips
The icy kiss has agonised her with the full force of her loneliness
She curls up in a ball, desperate

glorious summer sunset
Jane is digging at a flower bed, putting all her passion into the task
She is flushed with exertion
St John watches
You are wasted here
Am  not being useful
You should look beyond Moor House, beyond the selfish calm and comfort of affluence
Beyond to what
go to India in six weeks
So soon

Come with me
Jane is utterly crestfallen
(') God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife

You're far too humble

St John have mercy
feel my mind shrinking - Don't be afraid
You are diligent, faithful, docile, courageous, gentle and heroic
Cease to mistrust yourself
trust you unreservedly
Let me give you time to think
But know this; in you, recognise a fellow soul, a soul that would revel in the flame and excitement of sacrifice
Jane is chilled to the bone by his words
St John leaves the garden and walks away over the moors
: Jane leaning against the garden wall, trying to think, trying to compose herself
The sun is setting
-
Jane carrying a candle, opens the door
St John is at the table working by lamp light
The moon shines brightly in
used to long for a life of action, to overleap the horizon, to move in the world of men
Maybe God is giving me this
And what is there for me here
Pain and longing for what can't be
don't know how long  would survive in India
My frame isn't strong
But 'll go with you, if  may go free
Free
You and  had better not marry
Why not
Because  am your sister
But you'll go with me
Conditionally - as your curate

Jane,  don't need a curate; need a wife
must have my heart and mind free, my own self to turn to couldn't become part of you - part of me you must become or the whole bargain is void
How can , a man not yet thirty take out to India a girl of nineteen, unless she is my wife
Don't offer God half a sacrifice
He must have all
And undoubtedly enough of love would follow to make the union right, even in your eyes
Jane is shocked
Enough of love
Yes, quite enough
St John,  scorn your idea of love
scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer and  scorn you when you offer it
St John is mortified
slow rage begins to boil in him
've uttered nothing that deserves scorn
Forgive me but the very name of love is an apple of discord between us
My dear cousin, please abandon your scheme of marriage
No; and if you reject it, it's not me you deny but God
Jane is stung
St John has turned from her
His face is icy in the moonlight
Do not be angry with me please
It makes me wretched
want us to be friends
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 111
We are friends
hope we can be more
cannot come as your wife
Why this refusal
It makes no sense
If  were to marry you, you'd kill me
You're killing me now
() 'd kill you
am killing you
Your words are violent, unfeminine and untrue - You'd kill me without drawing any blood or receiving on your conscience any stain of crime
What nonsense is this
You'd experience no pain - but tell you it would kill me
Why
Because  would inevitably come to conceive love for you, because you are so talented and good, because there is such grandeur in your look
You wouldn't want this strange and torturing love; if showed it you would find it unbecoming
And my lot would be wretched
( ) Jane
You're a good man, but you forget the feelings of little people
We'd better keep out of your way lest you trample us
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 112
St John's anger has faded
He is compassionate
This is far harder to resist
wouldn't trample you
You'd walk at my side towards God's altar
He'd be your solace, heaven your reward
We seek to do the greatest work, to open death's gates, to save souls
Love God Jane, love God
St John puts his hand on her forehead; Christlike
Jane is falling under his power
(') Give up your heart to Him
He is love
Jane falls to her knees
St John's face is angelic
If  were sure; if  were certain - She suddenly hears a voice: Rochester's; clear, urgent
(
) Jane
Jane
Jane
She springs away from St John, crying: Oh God, what is it
She looks wildly about the room; rushes to the window
What have you heard
What can you see
Jane glances at him, seeing him for what he is; a cold, controlling man
She shouts: am coming
She runs out, leaving St John aghast, behind her
Jane runs on to the moors
Wait for me
She looks all around her at the moonlit landscape
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 113
(') Where are you
The moors send her question back in an echo
We see Jane's face
Her path is clear
Jane is waiting for the coach at the crossroads where she arrived, almost a year before
It comes pounding towards her
She hails it
This time, the coachman respectfully descends to take her bag and help her on
She is so confident and so changed that he doesn't recognise her
-
Jane is walking through the orchard
It is wild, neglected
Its untended state worries her
She looks up
Rooks are circling, cawing
: Jane finds herself at the side of the house
The ground is pitted with weeds
The windows are dark
She half runs round to the front
What she sees takes her breath away
The great walls and battlements are blackened with fire
Windows gape on a hollow shell
The inside of the house has collapsed
Through the hanging door, only its charred remains can be seen
Weeds grow through utter devastation
Jane gazes in horror and distress
/
' Jane knocks on the door
Mrs Fairfax opens it
They sent me from the inn
've been up at the house - Jane can say no more
Come in, come in
Is he dead
Mrs Fairfax takes Jane in her arms
No, no
Mr Rochester still lives
Jane is crying tears of relief
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 114
Tell me - please - Why did you run away in the night like that
would have helped would have helped
' Mrs Fairfax has sat Jane on a settle near the fire
He sought you as if you were a lost and precious jewel
He didn't rest
And as days turned into weeks and no word came, he grew quite savage in his disappointment
He stayed at Thornfield
Didn't leave the house
/
-   /
Rochester, unshaven and unkempt is standing at his threshold
(
) Shut himself up like a hermit
He only went out at night, when he walked like a ghost through the grounds
We see what he is looking at: an open carriage piled with luggage, into which Mrs Fairfax is helping Adele
Leah and Sophie are already sitting inside, dressed for a journey
(
) (') He'd have no one near him
Adele was sent off to school
He placed me here
Only John and Martha stayed - and Mrs Poole of course
Adele looks back at Rochester with tears in her eyes
He walks across the dark hall and slams the library doors
-
Rochester, in his shirt sleeves, is looking at the tree where Jane promised him her hand - now dying, cleft by lightning
The rising moon inhabits the sky
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 115
(
) It was harvest time when it happened
No one knows how she got out
Rochester hears a cry from the top floor
He sets off, a look of finality on his face
-
Grace Poole is asleep, her empty jug of gin beside her
(
) My theory is that when Mrs Poole was asleep, having taken too much of the gin and water
Rochester takes Grace's keys
- Rochester opens the door to the inner chamber
(
) The mad lady must have stolen her keys and let herself out
Bertha Antoinetta Mason, standing in the last patch of daylight thrown down from her skylight, sees that it is Rochester
She calmly walks towards him
Rochester graciously bows, indicating that she may leave
Bertha glides past him
She is free
- Bertha walks past an elegant vase
She tips it to the floor
It smashes
Rochester pays it no heed
-
Rochester has stood Bertha at his desk
case of jewels is open before her
She has put on a tiara, a diamond necklace, bracelets
She is gazing at a ruby brooch
She turns to Rochester
His expression is calm, resigned
Bertha begins to laugh
She takes the candelabra from the table
She admires herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feathers, the jewels
She holds up the candelabra and sets the huge curtains alight
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 116
Rochester is impassive; he does nothing to stop her
As she passes, Rochester realises he is bleeding
She has run the brooch pin across him
-  /
Bertha knocks a lamp onto the floor
The oil springs into flames, licking the tapestries and the paintings
Rochester sees his ancestors begin to burn
- The conflagration is growing
Rochester sees Bertha leaving Jane's room
As he passes, he sees everything inside it being consumed by fire
He can't bear to look
-
Bertha is watching the rooks
Rochester goes to the edge of the roof
Bertha looks at him
The invitation is clear
Rochester is ready to die
Bertha sees the rooks wheeling away
She runs at the edge of the roof
Rochester sees her intention too late
He puts out his arm to stop her
For the perfect fraction of a second, Bertha flies
Rochester sees her fall; almost falls himself - saves himself
Life reawakens in him
Behind him, he sees Grace Poole, coughing, crawling up through the door
Antoinetta
Responsibility floods over him
He goes to her side, lifts Grace, helps her down the stairs
(
) He didn't leave the house until everyone was out
Some say it was a just judgement on him for having her confined there all those years but for my part,  pity him
' Jane is deeply affected
He's alive child, but many think he'd be better off dead
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 117
Why
When he was taken out from under the ruins, a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him, partly - but his eye was taken out and his left hand so crushed that he lost it
The other eye inflamed and - he is blind
He's blind
Tears fall from Jane's eyes
(') know
it's a terrible thing
had dreaded worse
'd dreaded he was mad
great sense of urgency is coming over her
(') Where is he
-
Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track
Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end
She comes to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between granite pillars
She walks through them
She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe
Jane stops
Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester
He is in his shirtsleeves
He stands strong, stalwart, brooding
His hair is still raven black
He is looking sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a hawk
His strength is undiminished
He walks fifteen paces from the house
It brings him into the middle of the semicircle of grass
He is close enough for Jane to see his scarred eyes
She walks towards him, silent
few drops of rain begin to fall
Rochester puts out his right hand to feel them
He raises his face up to the sky as if he is looking for something from there
He is absolutely still; his expression, serene
Jane is very close
She steps on a twig
It breaks with a loud crack, shattering the silence
Rochester is immediately on guard, his expression turning wary
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118
He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of it passing an inch from her face
Jane steps back
Rochester swipes again
She holds her breath
He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there
He turns and walks fifteen paces back to the house
He disappears into the dark interior
Jane starts to breathe again
-
Jane lightly taps on the side door
Martha opens it; she is astonished
Jane puts her finger over her lips
-
Rochester is in an armchair in front of his fire
Pilot is at his feet
Jane carries in a tray with a candelabra and a jug of water
can see the candles, Martha, at your side like a luminous glow
And the fire; a red haze
Pilot notices Jane
He leaps up with a whine, wagging his tail, madly
Jane spills half the water
She cannot help finding it funny
Her entrance has been ruined by the dog
(') Martha
Jane giggles
Rochester's face falls
(') Martha, is that you
Martha is in the kitchen, sir
Who's there
Pilot knows me
Will you have some more water
've spilt half the glass
Rochester stands, holding out his hand
If you are real, touch me
Jane touches his fingers; puts her hand in his
Rochester pulls her into his arms
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 119
, Her hand, her shape, her size
And her voice
Jane Eyre - Jane Eyre
My Edward,  am Jane Eyre:  have found you out
am come back to you
For some while neither is able to speak
You're not lying dead in some ditch
Not an outcast among strangers
've been with good people; far better than you, quite more refined and exalted
() She insults me - And 'm an independent woman
My uncle in Madeira died and left me five thousand pounds - This is real
This is practical
'm here
'm home
am where love best
: Jane curled on Rochester's knee by the fire
He is running his fingers over her face, feeling its contours
You're altogether a human being, Jane
conscientiously believe so, sir
She is running her hands through his hair
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 120
(') But  see that you're turning into a lion
It's time someone undertook to rehumanise you
'm a sightless block - know
She kisses his eyes
(') And the worst of it is, 'm in danger of loving you too well for this, and making too much of you
Am  hideous, Jane
Very
But you always were, you know
smile cracks Rochester's face
Jane runs her fingers over it, feeling its contours
He holds her
Silence falls
