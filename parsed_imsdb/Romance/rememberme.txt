--  --                  1 It's very late
It's quiet
Just the sounds of The City , an attractive Hispanic woman in her thirties, waits at the   for the  train
Linda looks great
She's dressed festively but tastefully
Next to her is her eleven year old ,
She is twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday party they attended in The City
Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink handbag
We notice a   with four-leaf clovers on her right wrist
The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station platform
wait at the other end
They speak soft, to each other
Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates
She watches them as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand
The Boys approach
Linda tenses
At the last second the boys make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell
It's quiet again
Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter
The is rounding the final bend into the station
Their focus is on this train
It's getting closer, louder
And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the stairwell behind them
Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his gun
Linda puts her arm around her daughter
Alicia looks terrified
The train roars    as Linda quickly hands over her purse, her watch
She hands over her engagement ring and her wedding band
One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her
The other boy fumbles the wedding band
The ring  to the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away
We hear '  echoing up the stairwell
Now the Boys are boxed in
And starting to panic

--      --
The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform
Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a The boy clocks it
Who does she think she is
--       -- When a     reaches out and stops the car doors from closing
forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car
There's a muzzle flash
a distant
a cloud of smoke a mist of blood
and Linda's body collapses on itself
Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood

2 , lots of uniforms and light, a white sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell
dances against the stairwell wall where a man is taking the stairs two at a time
Late thirties, big, plain clothes, he is
When he reaches the platform, he stops
Craig kneels before the white sheet
Peels it back
We stay on him
We don't see what he sees
We just see how he sees it
Then he turns
It's been tagged and numbered as evidence
Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it into his pocket
Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face
Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her legs not quite working
Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting her as the blanket falls to the ground
Alicia makes little gasping noises
Trying to speak but can't
Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world
He reaches the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee
Alicia gasps

Composure
deep breath
Then as quickly as he went down, he's back up
Craig looks back now, taking it all in
Is it real
Sees all the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs
above the station until we find ourselves with a clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the 3

There is a   under the bed
, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard
He is sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a blanket
is on his lap
Tyler has propped some well worn, hand written pages of  against a box of off-brand laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration etched in his face
forgettable  lies sleeping on the bed
Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of the    in front of him
He is completely lost in the moment, with   in his fingers
By the next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple of hours
The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone
(out of it) Hello
Tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock
His eyes widen in alarm
Yeah
(listens) Of course

Tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark suit pants
Before he pulls on his white undershirt we observe a  that simply says "Michael" over his heart

He searches through a beat-up chest of drawers, seeking a reasonably clean button down shirt

gorgeous day
Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty coffee cup in his teeth
He sorts a rumpled wad of singles and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse
Time is money
Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket pocket then lights up a smoke
He takes one long drag then extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket
He begins towards the mourners
His mother
, a beauty
Past burdens etched in the lines on her face
Dressed tastefully in expensive bohemian
She smiles like someone who's been crying but doesn't want anyone to know she has
(sweetly) Hello, your majesty
How are you
'm fine
you look good
He kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his stepfather
, Unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and tie
They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos
5
The weight of Tyler's gaze falls to  , his diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister
She's holding a little paper bag
She flashes him a look
He kneels besides her and whispers
Thanks for organizing everybody
Caroline makes a face
Turns her nose away from him
You smell like Listerine and beer
He snorts and kisses her cheek
Caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names: "Mom" "Tyler" "Les", "Dad", "Caroline"
She begins to arrange them in a little circle on the grave
Tyler's father
, late fifties, breathes power, precisely dressed, two hundred dollar haircut

Charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive

The four adult family members stand side- by-side
They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline sits on the ground, arranging the stones

' --  --                   5 The family sits together in a booth
Tyler rolls a Bic lighter over his knuckles
Caroline draws a funny portrait of Tyler on her napkin
He is smoking nine cigarettes at once
Diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention
Les is eyeing the Cheesecake
Charles subtly aligns his silverware
6
This is nice
think it's nice that we still do this
(gently) Mom
forgot
'm trying to purge "nice" from my vocabulary
Michael would like that we still do this
Tyler takes out a cigarette
Lights it
Without saying a word his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass
(to Caroline) Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait
Caroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at her mother, then at her brother
She adopts a very motherly tone
Tyler, did  tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait
Why no, Caroline
What did your art teacher say about your portrait
(smiling) You two

She flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les' hand
She was very impressed

Les dives in
Charles is having toast
He sips a glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek Phillippe

'cause Whistler really fell off late in his career
He's the Michael Jackson of European art history
She suggested your sister take Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and that's hugely prestigious
Caroline looks a bit sheepish, Tyler high fives Caroline
Diane, again, flickers a glance at Charles
would be the youngest one, ever, practically
Tyler, would you please pass the butter
Beat
Caroline was speaking
(to Charles) Are you really this clueless
Are you really dismissing her like this
Diane touches Caroline's hair
Caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed
Caroline, are you feeling dismissed
'm okay
(solicitous, to Caroline) didn't mean to change the subject
What was the subject

Excuse me
The subject we were discussing
What was it

Now's not the time for your heroics Tyler No
It's the perfect time
Charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar
Father and son lock eyes until
(whispering, to Caroline) Do you need me to take you anywhere
Caroline shakes her head
'll stay with mom
Diane glares at her ex-husband
Tyler rises and kisses his sister's forehead
Then 'll see you after school

He exits as Caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's eyes

Aidan doesn't
Aidan remembers something, smirks

You sold my who

That voluptuous, delightfully oblivious little blonde you left in your bed this morning
sold her a toothbrush
Got three bucks
Congratulations
Are in order, yes
Because that sale inspired our newest business venture: "The

We throw in some make-up, toiletries, cell phone charger, cab numbers
Retail it at S19

And you think women would buy this
With money
Hey one-night-stands happen
It's a part of life
like stubbing your toe
Sometimes you misjudge a corner and bend back your pinky toe, other times you wake up in a freshman dorm wearing a field hockey tee shirt wondering why your balls smell like cinnamon
(nodding sagely) Of course
Yes
Don't underestimate the novelty gift market
Think about it
instead of giving that token slutty friend a ten-inch purple dildo for her birthday, you hook her up with "The

What do you say
Are you down
'm down with getting you on some sort of medication
fine

just remember at some point in history two people had a conversation just like this about the light bulb
One of them went on to fame and fortune and the other one probably went to work at Mickey 's or something
Or Denny's

The Town Car stops at a crosswalk for a    in jeans and tee- shirts on their way to a local Public School
Caroline sees them through the tinted glass
They couldn't see her even if they wanted to

Their  addresses the few students paying attention
in the wake of terrorist attacks these insurance company actuaries are provided a unique opportunity to raise premiums and profits to protect against events that will likely never occur again
One girl, a focused brunette with beautiful eyes, takes notes relentlessly
She is present, absorbing the material
She raises her hand
Isn't that also an ethical question
Tyler shoots her a glance
He takes in her lovely face, her casual dress, and the   with its four leaf clovers
this is Alicia "Ally" Craig, now 19
Tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope

The statue is warm, the bronze absorbing the late spring sun
Tyler is perched on the Mad Hatter, his face turned towards the sun while Caroline hides with the dormouse
Tyler lights a cigarette
glares at him
Why don't we make this a non- smoking statue
(emerging) Yeah, Tyler
Why don't we make this a non-smoking statue
He makes a face
You promised you'd quit
know
You're gonna get emphysema and then you're gonna have to drag an oxygen tank with you everywhere
You think that would be the worst part about having emphysema
Everywhere you go, Tyler
Even the bathroom
Tyler takes a final drag
Tosses it on the ground
Why do you think Dad doesn't wanna
like, listen to me
Dad loves you
Caroline gives him a look
So
You can love someone and not want to spend any time with them
Caroline is climbing around Alice
Her hands on Alice's hair
13
You've got that right
Mom loves Aunt Sara
But at Christmas, last year, she wouldn't let Les leave them in a room together 'cause she said there would be a "yule tide homicide
" That's because Aunt Sara drinks
You don't drink, right
Duh
So why would anyone wanna avoid you
Caroline shrugs, not convinced
silent moment passes
Michael used to drink
Yeah
He did
But Michael was 21
All 21 year olds drink because it's new and exciting
Aunt Sara drinks because she wishes she was 21

You're 21
Tyler's smile fades

Aidan on the floor, eating two pieces of pizza, folded down the middle, at the same time
What about Atlantic City for your birthday this year
Get a suite
Couple of ladies
You could call Toothbrush Girl, what do you think
think 'd rather be sodomized

Hey, it's your day
He gestures to the shelves
What's the point
How do you know where anything is in this place, anyway
There's like
/ "Eight Miles of Books
" don't expect you to appreciate this, but the schematic for this particular shelf is authors who were sleeping together
No shit
And ended up dead or in prison
Beat
This is why chicks dig you
Tyler laughs
Seriously
They like this freaky poetic crap
ran into Megan yesterday
She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight
She wants us to stop by
She practically begged me
Eh
Aidan, visibly frustrated with Tyler's reluctance, grabs the rolling ladder and pushes Tyler into the Romance novels
Hey
Hey nothing
You've been a ghost the past couple weeks
You never wanna go out
'm feeling unappreciated here
() 15
(cont'd) can't deal with this brooding introvert shit anymore man
'm ready to set up an intervention

You realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking

Come out for one drink
When's the last time you had one drink

Aidan and Tyler make their way through the crowd to a congested bar where the   is swamped
Hey, Megan
She ignores him
You look great
Can  get two Heinekens
Do
Not
Speak
Tyler snorts with laughter
(genuine) Is she mad at me or something
No no
Girls are like that when they're way into you
Oh
Two nubile young  approach Aidan
Tap his shoulder
#1 Excuse me
16
Aidan flashes a winning smile
Well, hello
#1 Could you take a picture for us
She holds out her camera
Aidan hesitates, then smiles
My pleasure
The girls pose
Aidan takes the camera
Turns it around
Extends it
Smiles
And promptly
He casually returns the camera to the confused young woman
Megan returns and practically flings the beers at Aidan
Thanks
You've met my roommate
hope you die
Tyler laughs his ass off
She's all over you
Cheers
They clink bottles

All are thoroughly intoxicated
There is a knot of   halfway down the block, drinking and having a fine time
love this street
love this city
Where are you guys from, again
' Miami
Miami
Miami, Barcelona, Rio
New York is it, man
God broke the mold when he made this city
17
You ever actually been to any of those places
What's your point
There's a gust of wind
Aidan's girl shivers
She's wearing a tiny dress
' What are we doing
'm freezing
Shoulda worn a jacket
Like me

/ Michael
Mi-i-chael
Tyler turns towards the sound
It's as if he's trying to spot a train in the distance
His hand goes to his pocket and fishes out his pack of cigarettes
' (to Aidan) Asshole
She walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed
' Are you coming
Tyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied
' (to her friend) Hold on, Lauren
The girls step away
Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to convince her friend to stay
Aidan watches them, hopefully
Tyler isn't watching them
He's watching two cool looking , crossing the street with the , carrying quartet of  pulls up at the light in front of them in a car, aggressive music playing
The Neanderthal at the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them
18
#1 glares, but gives no further response, he just wants to get across the street
The Neanderthal revs and lurches again
#2 slams his hand on the hood of the car
#2 What's your problem
My problem
Keep your hands off my car, asshole
#2 Blow it out your ass, Guido
#1 Go back to Long Island
The car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the front of the car
The driver is holding a mini baseball bat at his side
'm from Queens, faggot Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver starts wailing on the other with the bat
Tyler watches as the Neanderthals overpower them
The altercation has turned into a full on assault
The Musicians are getting stomped into the pavement
' So we were thinking we could go
Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her
(under his breath) God damn it
Aidan runs off after Tyler
Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the guy's face
He fights like a pit bull
Not feeling, not stopping
Aidan gets punched in the face
Tyler elbows the nose of the guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood
Then someone hits Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the chin
The musicians get back to their feet and fight back
It's a brawl
19
Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops
Tyler's girl, following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near enough to the brawl to imperil herself
Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl
She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement, splitting her lip on impact
Tyler head butts the guy

from the brawl are lined up on the curb
, a little older and heavier than when we first met him at the train station, is standing with the Girl, who is a mess
Her nose bloody, her dress torn
Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to her and her friend as the two girls   at the Neanderthals
Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction
Craig's , ,  , a few years younger, is on the radio to Dispatch
Craig snaps his fingers at one of the
's and receives a blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl
Then, to his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan
Cut those two loose
Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys
(quiet) Take a walk
Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup
Aidan, rubbing his wrists, gestures "Let's go"
Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl and
Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1
Anything in here that's going to stab me, Einstein
Craig finds a packet, or a vial
Nice
You like to get high and hit women
20
Aidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug
Tyler's caught up in the action
#1 don't even know the bitch
Rage flickers across Craig's face
Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going through their pockets
How about you two
Tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action
#1 It wasn't us, man
#1 That cocksucker kicked my car
Shut up, genius
#1 (to Neanderthal) Eat shit, pencil dick
Alright
That's it
Everybody goes downtown
Tyler steps forward, interrupting
It wasn't them
Aidan, who has been edging away, jerks around to his friend
(sotto) Tyler
(quietly, to the guys) Take a walk,  said
Hey
Craig, big angry Irish cop, turns to Tyler
21
They didn't do anything
They didn't start this
Those assholes did
Why do these guys have to go downtown
What are you still doing here
This is bullshit
It was those gorillas who started this
Craig moves slowly toward Tyler and starts going through Tyler's pockets, roughly
He finds his wallet
Starts rifling through
Well, Mr
Roth
What makes you think  give a shit
You're a police officer
You're supposed to
What the hell
Craig looks from the guy he was frisking to Tyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket
She spits blood
He turns a bit to Tyler
It's a great relief to me, Mr
Roth, to know that you're on top of the situation
Now go the fuck home
He turns back to work
Tyler looks briefly at Aidan
Aidan looks desperate "Please
Let's get out of here
" Tyler  '
Aidan's jaw drops
Leo takes several silent steps in
Craig looks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler
The kid must be out of his mind
How about you do your job
Craig takes Tyler's legs out, driving his face into the pavement, a  opens above Tyler's
Tyler lies there dazed and disoriented as Craig, with one knee on Tyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground
He slaps the cuffs on
22
17
--                            17 Who knows what time it is
lovely , Tyler and the musicians are in lockup
Everybody looks like shit
Tyler sits on a bench in the holding cell, looking quite relaxed
The lock up door slides open and Aidan is returned to the perch
The   shouts across the din to Tyler
You can have your call now
'm good
The door slides shut behind Aidan
You're good
Thank God you're good
Beat
What are you trying to do
What did you want from that cop guy
That was a messed up situation
Those guys
He cups his hands to make a megaphone
Are pussies
From Off Screen a chorus of: #1 / Faggot
#2 / Candy-ass faggot
#3 / Fag
There was no justice in that situation
No justice
Okay, Green Hornet

(cont'd) You may not be actually matriculating in school, you may be having a nice time by yourself lurking in the stacks of your book store, but  actually plan on graduating, and having a career and a wife and a girlfriend and a divorce and a mid-life stalking episode and erectile dysfunction, and  will thank you to keep your complexes and nihilistic bullshit
Did you just say "nihilistic"
Yeah

Tyler smiles
The Escorting Officer returns with a white male wearing a two thousand dollar suit

Yeah,  called your dad's office

So when would that be available
No, that's sooner than 'd thought
And is there any kind of deposit
Okay
Craig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket and starts washing his hands at the sink
'll call you back
Thanks
Ally hangs up
Makes a quick appraisal of her dad
He has a little blood on his cuff
He splashes his face with water
24
On automatic pilot, Ally flips on the toaster, pours some hot coffee into a Sesame Street Mug, pours in a measured dose of brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of Aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug
She packs up her back pack with school stuff as Craig gulps his coffee
What did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight
The toaster dings
She extracts an English muffin and squeezes honey from a bottle shaped like a bear
Breathe
Did you
did
'm breathing right now
Who was that
The lady from student housing
We talked about it
Remember

Sure
Ally grabs her sweatshirt
Mrs
Lippman is going to drive me
'll drive you
She flounces out the door, holding her own cup of coffee and the English Muffin
Craig dries his hands, grabs his jacket and a set of keys from the counter
19
19 Outside their red-brick row house at the end of a block of red-brick row houses
Ally has her mug on the roof of the car and is searching through her bag
25
Craig comes around the driver's side and slides Ally her keys across the roof
She drops them in her bag
Mrs
Lippman said she'd do it
Craig is in the driver's seat, waiting
Ally grabs her coffee mug and gets into the passenger seat
She hands him his English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the car
She flips down the visor and checks her very light eye makeup
You're exhausted
When you have a stroke 'm going to abandon you on a park bench
They start to back out
This drive is too long

English Club chairs, green baize on the walls types away across the room
Tyler takes out a cigarette
Lights it
Draws the ire of
You know you can't smoke in here
Tyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee table in front of him
It's clearly never been used
So what's with the ash tray
It completes the room
Tyler takes a long drag, grinding out the ember on the pristine surface
He smiles a charming smile at the aggravated woman
Tease

He's ready for you

She looks him up and down, doesn't like what she sees
You're too skinny
And you smell like french fries and cigarettes
Nice to see you too
You want me to lie
Tyler smiles, he likes that she doesn't lie
Janine scrolls through a Palm Pilot as she walks
They approach the double doors to Charles' office
Try not to give him a heart attack
Okay
Tyler bangs through the doors
Janine grimaces

There's a lot of leather, brass and rich wood, breathing power
There's a flat screen computer, but no personal effects anywhere
Charles sits at his massive desk
As Tyler enters, Charles registers his injuries
flicker of something over Charles' face
Tyler stands
came to see how much it costs, because 'm giving you the money back
How much what costs
27
That lawyer
Beat
Ah
That lawyer, Tyler, costs 450 dollars an hour
In spite of himself
Christ
Tell me about it
wanted to make sure you understood it wasn't me who called you
understand
You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail don't want to be bailed out of anything
Charles looks at his son
'll get an invoice from Janine
Tyler leaves, slamming the door behind him

23 Tyler stops, catching himself, realizing the emptiness of the gesture
He looks up and sees Janine looking at him

24 Tyler in the same booth, surrounded by a commotion of businessmen and women
He's writing in his Journal, his foot tapping fast
We see the very act of writing eases him, loosening his strangled grip on the pen, slowing down the manic rhythm of his foot
28
25
25 It's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a 6TH
One of them dips her head towards Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret
Whatever she says makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls snicker
Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car
His bike leans on a fire hydrant
(to Caroline) Hey
He looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell
The girls have a group swoon
He takes Caroline by the elbow
Excuse us, we're due in surgery
He gets his bike and leads her down the block, towards Fifth Avenue
What happened to your face
Horrible threshing accident
You're so retarded
Don't mock the afflicted
Here, brought you something
He hands her the book of Myths
This was my favorite book ever
Michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until  read it
Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings
The illustrations are amazing
Caroline opens the book carefully and has a peek
She smiles
29
Ooh
These are cool
Thanks
Where are we meeting mom
Guggenheim
What's up with those girls
just
they think 'm weird
Sometimes  sort of space out
When you're drawing
Yeah
Other times too
Madamoiselle Fleischman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today
And everybody laughed and they all think 'm a freak of nature
Caroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder, towards the school
Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature
" Caroline smirks
Mon dieu, mon soeurette
Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature"
Sacre Bleu
French Toast
What are you going to tell mom about your face
finally found something 'm good at
26
--      --             26 Aidan appears to have cornered a  on her way in or out of the building
The woman looks tired, annoyed, like she just wants to go
Aidan talks fast, even faster than usual
30
know by every numerical measurement  didn't pass but what was hoping was that maybe you give me a grade on my trying to pass
My commitment to effort
My commitment to commitment
Since the semester is nearly at it's terminus
Craig's car rolls to a stop just in front of the flags
Ally gives him a kiss on the cheek
She gets out, and walks up the stairs, right past Aidan
(distracted) mean
uh
life's only about what we put into it
It's about people
And what they put into it
And 'm -- ah, screw it
Aidan runs off leaving the befuddled professor on the steps
27
--   --                    27 Tyler, again with the guitar
Aidan enters, excited
He's got a daughter
Who
The cop
The cop who busted your face all up
He's got a daughter
And she's hot
smell revenge
Revenge
What do you want me to do, kidnap her
You introduce yourself
go on a few dates
be your charming, gentlemanly self
And then, flip the script
What does that mean
31
Screw her brains out and make her call you daddy
Steal her underwear and sell it on ebay
Put her in Clown Shoes, take lewd photos and post them on her high school's home page
don't know
Be creative
You should be incarcerated on general principle
Hey
What happened to you was very emasculating
Tell me you don't want to get that asshole and 'll drop it
don't want to get that asshole
Just meet her
don't want to meet her
She's cute
don't care
You're meeting her
'm not meeting her
28
-             28 Student Hangout
The place is bustling
Numerous move, sit, eat, lounge
Aidan scans the crowd
Tyler stands beside him looking far less enthusiastic
This is one of those moments 'm already regretting
She was here yesterday
32
What am  supposed to say to this girl
"Hey doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties, wanna make out
" Well don't call her doll face
Ally enters
She wears a big sweatshirt
Aidan spots her
There
The brunette
Tyler watches her settle into a couch with a big cup of coffee
know her
mean,  don't know her, but, 've seen her
She's in my global politics class
There you go
Something to open with
Now get over there
Tyler sighs, begins toward Ally
Shazam
Tyler glares
Aidan gives a big thumbs up
Excuse me
Ally briefly looks up from her book
My name's Tyler Roth
was wondering if  could bother you for a minute
He gives her a charming smile
You're already bothering me
Beat
The smile usually works
Um, 'm doing kind of a sociological experiment
was hoping you could help me out
33
Ally looks at him, a little wearily, holding her place in the book
What are you, kidding me
Tyler is genuinely taken aback
No,
may  ask your name
Anonymous
It's Greek
It means "you don't have a shot"
surprised laugh escapes from Tyler
Okay, Anonymous, do you see the guy across the room, pretending to read a text book, looking in this general direction
Aidan holds a   at an awkward angle to mask his obvious interest in Ally and Tyler's conversation
Subtle
have this theory that an objective third-party, having no prior contact, would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him
Ah
He's my roommate
And 've witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that 'm biased as a subject, but 'm convinced that he has an aura, that people can actually perceive
So, just take a good long look
And tell me what you think
She looks at Aidan, briefly, who shifts to avoid her gaze
Then she takes a peek at Tyler's profile
Who else do you plan on asking
34
No one here
The parameters called only to sample attractive women in their early twenties
'm nineteen
In their late teens
(beat) Well, look, you typically get something for participating in these things and 've run out of those big foam fingers, so  was thinking maybe  could take you out some night
She looks at him
Or you could just go out with me on the off chance we'd have an interesting conversation
don't date sociology majors
they're a rowdy bunch
Indeed they are
Lucky for you, 'm undecided
About what
Everything
Tyler smiles
Ally tries to hide a smile
She closes her book and extends her hand
'm Ally

--   --                   29 Caroline in art class amongst a sea of green plaid
The girls work in relative silence, drawing, painting
35
walks amongst them looking over their shoulders, sees a lot of amateur art work, then she comes upon Caroline and stops
The teacher finds herself captivated by
of Diane and Les kissing in the doorway of their brownstone
Diane has a bit of a manic smile and Les is half her size
Caroline notices her teacher staring
She doesn't like it and shifts to block her view
The teacher gently eases her back
Smiles softly
Caroline smiles back as her teacher moves across the room
Caroline has just put her pencil back to paper when
The   we've seen before start whispering and smirking
One of them mouths
Kiss ass freak
Caroline's smile shrinks away and she goes back to work
30
' --           30 Ally in sweat pants, an ancient tee-shirt, her hair in a Scrunchie, eating Mallomars from the bag and reading
Craig yells from the bottom of the stairs
He carries a bag from a video store
Don't be mad
Dad, we've seen freaking Erin Brockovich twice already
You always cry
/ do not
It's embarrassing
Her cell phone rings
Hello
36
31
31 Hey
It's Tyler
: Ally winces
Hi
You're going to stand me up
can feel it in my bones
'll be devastated
No
was just
You were just sitting around in your pajamas watching
No
'm not watching
'm just
getting dressed
She wipes her hands on her sweats, smearing them with chocolate
And 'm going to meet you at the place at
what time again
Eight
Right
yes
Eight
okay
She hangs up
Shit
She whips the Scrunchie out of her hair and heads for the bathroom
32
32 Ally comes down the stairs, putting on her earrings
37
Craig looks at Ally, confused
'm going out
can see that
Well, you're a trained investigator
She is moving quickly, grabbing her bag, her wallet
Craig tosses her keys
Who are you going with
boy from school
Beat
Okay
wasn't asking for permission
(sharply) know
(more gently) Have a good time
Here's cab fare
He peels off a couple of twenties
Thanks
Should  wait up
Dad
Craig puts his hands in the air in surrender
33
--                                33 hole in the wall Lower East Side Thai restaurant
Tyler and Ally sit together perusing menus
approaches
38
(to the waiter) What desserts do you have
Dessert special fried bananas a la mode
Great, 'll have that
glass of skim milk
Then the mussels, please
Tyler and the Waiter share a look
Pad Thai and a Sapporo
Thanks
The Waiter takes the menus
have my dessert first
Is this a political statement medical condition
just don't see the point in waiting for something  know  want and am going to have
What if  die eating my mussels
Is that probable
It's possible
If an embolism burst or an asteroid hit the restaurant, 'd die without having eaten the thing  wanted most
But the odds are,  mean
Fine
'll tell you what, you guarantee me
Swear to me on your eternal soul that 'll make it through my entree
And 'll wait
Tyler goes to answer
Ally holds up a hand
39
Before you answer, keep in mind, if die, you'll have to live the rest of your life knowing that you not only lied to me, but denied me my last indulgence
My last wish
Are you prepared to shoulder that kind of responsibility to prove a point
Tyler thinks about it
Smiles
Don't worry
'll share
34
--                                 34 Tyler and Ally exit out onto the street
Tyler immediately takes out his cigarettes, his lighter, then he notices
Ally looking at him disappointed
Really
Tyler takes the cue puts the packet and lighter away
beat
had a nice time
You had a nice time or you're having a nice time
Ally considers
Because if you're having one, why rush to end it
35
(   ) --   -- 35 They approach a  , one those ubiquitous basketball tosses
badgers passersby to test their luck
hang all around it
Tyler pays the Attendant, gets the basketballs
Tosses one, two, the third, then nothing
Game over
Did  tell you 'm Caucasian
40
Apparently
Tyler pays again, wipes out again
Game over
Tyler pays again
Loses again
He's visibly frustrated now
Can't we just stroll while  feed you ice cream with fireworks in the background
No
If  stop, he wins
Who, the attendant
No, the frigging Giant Panda
Tyler hands the  another dollar
36
--                                        36 Ally carries a   under her arm
Tyler walking beside her with a self-satisfied smile
don't know what you're smiling about
won
Paying off the attendant is not winning
It's cheating
just paid a premium to cut out the middle man
That's innovation
That's free market enterprising
That's what made America great
Aha
By the way, what happened to your eye
Tyler touches the bandage
Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight
41
How butch
know
'm practically a pirate
Okay, Captain Morgan
(laughing) You've got some serious timing
It's getting late
'll walk you to the train
'll take a cab
37
--                                 37 Tyler is just hailing her a taxi
He stands there holding the door open
Thanks
Beat
Tyler leans in to kiss her
Ally turns away
Not tonight
Not never
just
not tonight
We goin' or what
Hey
Turn on the meter
Tyler respectfully leans back
So dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid
yes
Kissing guy you're obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown New York night
no
42
Ally considers
She gives him a quick but tender kiss
You're really weird
She gets in the cab
(to the driver) 'm going to Queens and  don't wanna hear about it
Off she goes in the taxi
Tyler watches her go
38
38 Caroline exiting with the crowd
One of the Bitchy girls shoulder checks her from behind as she passes
Tyler, waiting on his perch, catches it, walks up to her
Happy end of sixth grade
Finally
39
--     -- AFTERNOON39 climbing all over the bronze statue
Caroline among them
She sits on a mushroom cap, letting her legs dangle
Tyler watches her from their usual bench, his bike leaning next to him
They have me in this art program summer thing at Pratt
heard
It's very prestigious due to my artistic greatness
Don't pretend
know you're proud
You should be
Caroline allows herself a tiny grin
43
There's, like, a thing
thing
(sheepish) show where you show what you've done and stuff
Will you come
Let me check my book
Abso-freaking- lutely
'm camping out
'm sleeping there the night before
Caroline is secretly thrilled
You're so retarded
Mom's been hyperventilating with joy
Good
'm sure Les was
/ "Really supportive"
Your school's over, right
Yes, it's over
Did Mom and Les get the beach house again
Yup
What are we going to do for your birthday
Nothing
Can we have a party
No
little one
At Mom's
With Aidan
'll make Mom behave
No crying
Like that's possible
44
Caroline smiles
40
--  --                40 Ally explores Tyler's living room with a tumbler of wine
It's in a state of medium disarray
He clocks her looking
know
But we have coasters
don't do coasters till the third date
She looks over his posters, pictures, etc
Tyler scans a stack of CDs, he selects Radiohead's  , puts it in
The hypnotic first track fills the room
Ally comes across a   of a band on stage
The lead guitarist looks like Tyler with long hair
Is that you
That's Michael
My brother
He looks like you
or you look like him
Does he play around here
Not any more
Ally notices the old guitar in the corner
Do you play
It depends who you ask
If  asked anybody
They'd say no
try but it turns out you need talent
So what talents do you actually have
45
Falconry
come from a long line of falconers
There's a lot of money in that
Tyler smiles
He's actually a hair nervous
Well there is one thing
Tyler walks to the kitchen counter where a cleaned and polished    sits
What's that
Our appetizer
Tyler lifts off the cover to reveal a
He's written a message in the icing: "In Case Of Ast-- and then a piece has been crudely cut out
Ally's surprised
It used to say "In Case Of Asteroid" but  took a shower and Aidan got high
41
--                              41 Ally and Tyler stand in front of a sink full of dirty dishes, up to their elbows in soapy water
So what kind of grade did you end up with from Vogelstein
don't actually get grades
Beat
'm not technically enrolled worked out an auditing thing
Oh
And The Strand is not a significant career choice
46
like the books
He indicates the dishes
You don't have to help me, you know
At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation
can say  knew you when
He flicks a bit of water on her shirt
Ally takes a beat
This is the playful, you get me all wet part
Right
(horsing around) You make it sound so cheap
Ally's not having it
It is cheap
've seen this scene a hundred times
Tyler's a little confused
'm sorry
didn't
You know what never happens in this scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go- to-school
Tyler-who-doesn't-really care-about-his-job
Tyler blinks helplessly
This
An entire enormous pot of pasta water up ended on the host
Bits of spaghetti cling to him, tiny tomatoes and zucchini on his shoulders like little barnacles
He sputters and gasps and blinks
No, that usually never happens
47
She calmly goes back to washing dishes
Beat
Spaghetti guy stares at her
She gives it right back to him, 100% New York City
Beat
In one move Tyler slings Ally over his shoulder
She grunts, unglamorously
42
--                                 42 Tyler bursts through the bathroom door
Ally over his shoulder
Never one to waste a moment, she uses the opportunity to check out what's in his wallet
He turns on the shower
She has his drivers licence
Apologize
Never
Your middle name is Keats
Your parents are pretentious as hell
Tyler turns on the shower and tosses Ally into the water
She dances to avoid the stream
Ally grabs the portable shower head and turns it at him
Tyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray
They wrestle for the shower head
Apologize
'd rather eat monkeys
This cracks Tyler up
He stops struggling for the shower and gasps a little with laughter, putting up his hands in surrender
Ally stands there, holding the shower head, giggling
They lock eyes for a moment
The air is charged
Ally spritzes him in the face
surrender
Oh my God, you're relentless
48
He slides down the wall until he's sitting in the tub, Ally follows
Victory at all costs
43
--                                        43 Tyler and Ally lie side-by-side, drenched
Their feet hang over the edge of the tub
Tyler reaches into his pocket and removes a dripping cigarette packet
He squeezes out water
Now
'm furious
He tosses them in a waste basket
You should quit anyway
Really
Why
Are cigarettes like bad for you or something
Ally playfully slaps him
She notices the tip of Tyler's peeking out of his undershirt
Is that a tattoo
Let me see
It's not really
Please
It's very bad ass
All that ritualistic scarring
Tyler peels the soaked garment off his back as Ally offers polite applause
Michael's name becomes clear
Ally takes a long look
She sees Tyler's not smiling anymore
She gets it
'm sorry
didn't
didn't realize
She looks at him
Asking with out asking
He killed himself
Beat
49
When
When he was 21
He had just started working for my father
Ally is gently picking spaghetti and tomatoes off Tyler
thought he was a musician
He was
But he wasn't making a living doing music and my father's a very compelling guy
Mine too
Ally looks away for a moment
Tucks a curl behind her ear
Then they look at each other
Ally opens her mouth to speak
Aidan bursts in
He's drunk, loud, wearing an Irish Flag like a cape
He carries a bottle of whiskey and a can of Guinness
Damn, you're not naked
You're not Irish
, What happened in the kitchen
It looks like somebody's water broke
(notices Ally) Hi
Ally, Aidan
Aidan, Ally
Aidan takes Ally's hand
Kisses it
Don't feel bad that you're more attracted to me than you are to him it happens to all of them
Ally looks at Aidan closely, trying to figure out where she knows him from, it dawns on her
Oh
You're the assaholic
50
Well, -- (realizes what she said) Wait
What
Tyler and Ally laugh
Aidan's too drunk to care
Alright, you two
Up
Dressed
Let's go
"Around The World" party on the third floor
a lot of ugly but a lot more alcohol
Let's go
can't,  would, 'd love to, but 've gotta get home, my dad's waiting up
Ally
Ally
Listen to me, young lady
One drink
From any country
'll even put France on the table
One drink
Your choice
And we're gone
(to Tyler) One drink
(to Aidan) One drink
(innocent shrug) One drink
44
--                                     44 Ally  in their toilet
Tyler holds her hair back
Aidan appears in the doorway still wearing that flag
Hey, how we doin'
Ally tries to speak, all we hear is a series of groans
Then she dry heaves again
Tyler shoots Aidan a look
What
What do you want me to say
That 'm sorry
You want me to say "m sorry
() 51
(cont'd) You want me to apologize for showing a nice girl a good time
Is that it
Tyler just looks at him
Aidan considers
'm sorry
Tyler
Tyler kneels down
Ally pushes her purse at him, she looks like she's about to pass out
, need, you
to call
my dad
Tyler and Aidan share a look
Aidan shrugs
Oh
Sure
Tyler pulls out her cellphone - the battery is dead
Your phone's dead
Just tell me the number and 'll call him
Tyler turns around to find Ally passed out on the floor
He tries to gently nudge her awake
Ally
Ally
(
) know Ally's a good kid, Leo
45
-- '  --         45 The bedside clock reads 3:47
Craig is on the phone while searching through Ally's desk drawers
For anything
He finds a note book with a red cover and starts flipping through it
She was supposed to be back
She's not back
call Ted Proferes
and what's his face in the 9th
and call me back
Just do it, Leo
Craig hangs up the phone
52
Beat
He picks it up again and starts dialing, still flipping through the notebook
46    '  --                            46 Ally wakes up alone in Tyler's bed, hung over, confused, trying to put the pieces together, then she sees the clock
And a wave of panic washes over her as she jumps out of bed
oh God oh God oh God oh God
47
--                                     47 Tyler sleeps on the couch using Aidan's Irish Flag as a blanket
Ally comes in pulling on her shoes
Tyler stirs in time to see her run out the door
48
--                               48 Craig sits at the table, dialing someone, anyone
Ally enters, drops her keys on the counter
Her father doesn't look at her as she pours herself a coffee
'm sorry
fell asleep
Craig squeezes honey into his coffee, practically strangling the Bear
Not looking at her
Ally notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to the phone
You turned your phone off
forgot to charge it
It dawns on her
That's mine
From my desk
Craig says nothing
Just stirs his coffee
Ally is furious
How could you
53
You were gone all night
was trying to get some information
How could you go through my stuff like 'm a suspect
Then stop acting like one
What is the matter with you, Dad
You have no respect for me and the way 'm feeling, my privacy
We talked about this
You're totally paranoid
You watch your mouth
You don't do anything
You don't go anywhere except work
You have no life
My life is right here
In this house
The same place as yours
But you're spitting all over it
Jesus Christ, Dad
went on a date
smell alcohol
Right back at him
So do
Beat
Dad
54
He hits her, hard, open hand, from across the width of his body
Ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on the cabinets
Ally
His face is contorted with panic and shame
Ally's disoriented
Her ears are ringing
Her lip is split knot is starting to form where she hit her head
She straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has no idea who he is
Beat
Craig tries to envelop her
With a guttural snarl she pushes him away, getting a little bit of blood on his shirt
She scrambles up the stairs
49
--  --                          49 Sunshine beats down on a little make-shift rooftop hideaway, a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench
Aidan works out with an old set of dumb bells
Tyler sits on a beach chair, trying again with the guitar
So
She just left
No good bye
Tyler nods, strumming like he's wearing boxing gloves
Aidan finishes up a set
Maybe she heard you play the guitar
You were the one dumping Jello shots down her throat
You almost killed her
Aidan lies down to do the bench press
there's a lot of weight on the bar
There are sins of omission and sins of commission, my friend
've dealt with mine and 've forgiven myself
you should do the same
55
Aidan lifts
It's too heavy and falls to his chest
Tyler forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle
Aidan strains
little help,
little help, little help, lotta help
Tyler blows three perfect smoke rings
Finally he puts down the guitar and helps get the bar up
Aidan panting, rubbing his chest
What the hell was that
Penance
have to get to work
50
--   --                    50 Tyler and Aidan come into their apartment, Aidan still rubbing his chest
Ally is standing there in the middle of the living area
packed bag at her feet, her face a mess
didn't know where else to go
51
--                                 51 Aidan sits on the couch still in his gym clothes drinking a protein shake out of a blender
Tyler comes out of his bedroom gently closing the door behind him
How's she doin'
She's pretty shaken up
Tyler takes a seat beside him
Takes out a cigarette
We've really got to fix that dead bolt
My bad
Sorry
Don't be
You think she'll sleep
56
You realize if she had had the If looks could kill
Too soon
silent moment passes
told her she could stay here
Are you alright with that
As long as she needs
52
--                         52 Tyler has just finished making up the ratty sofa as a bed
Ally appears from the bedroom, framed by the open door
She has slept in one of Tyler's button down shirts
You're up
Beat
Can  get you anything
She nods
'll be out here if you need me
Beat
Ally takes off the shirt and lets it fall
She stands there
53
'  --                              53 We interrupt Ally and Tyler in the throes of passion
Tyler sits on the edge of the bed
Ally is on top
She kisses his neck
Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed
He takes control
Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop him
There's noticeable aggression to their love-making
57
In the midst of everything, the pair slow almost to stopping, a caesura
They stare into each other in a moment of surprise and recognition
Then again
Young, hungry, aggressive
They lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each other
Tyler gives a little sound of contentment
Ally, in her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place
Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in this dream state, to make love all over again
54
--                                 54 The sheets have been torn loose from the mattress
Ally lies asleep, curled in the comforter
Tyler lies awake beside her, he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to brighten
Tyler gets out of bed
Grabs his journal
propped up next to the bed: "Please don't leave
'll be back
" 55
--                                        55 Tyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop
56
--                       56 The place is empty
few early  get coffee to go
He sits in the same booth, his journal held open by the binder clip
He writes, a bag of Bialys next to him
Janine enters
Orders two coffees
She sees Tyler, smiles
She picks up her coffees and approaches him
can't believe you still come down here
Tyler looks up, grins, nods to her coffees
It's not so far
can't believe you still get his coffee
three sugars, no milk
58
(shrugs) Old habits
You're not writing anything bad about me, are you
Not today
gotta run
Early meetings
Janine turns to go, remembers something, turns back
probably won't see you before Saturday so
happy birthday
Tyler nods, tries to smile
Janine glances back as she goes
'll be sure to tell your father that you said hello
Tyler nods sheepishly

--   --                    57 Tyler returns with breakfast
From Aidan's room, a pathetic croak
/ Bialy
Tyler tosses him a Bialy like he's tossing fish to a seal
Ally lies on the couch
Curled in a blanket
cup of hot tea in hand
She sips it
It stings her lip a little
Hey
Hey
Tyler sits
She shifts and curls next to him
Where did you go
Downtown
59
Why
Tyler pulls his  from his pocket
Hands it to her
There's a coffee shop
brought you a Bialy
New York is full of coffee shops
This one was our place
Michael's and mine
We had breakfast there all the time
Maybe not as many times as  think we did
But enough times
Anyway we ate there that morning
It was the last place saw him
Oh
So you go there to write
To him
Maybe
Sometimes
don't know
But guess  wanted to tell him about you
Ally is moved, you can see it in her eyes, but she chooses not to overdo it
She flips through the journal
She hands it back to him
Then out of nowhere
My mom was murdered eight years ago
The same year your brother died
Tyler is stunned
You don't need to say anything, know you're sorry
Everyone's always sorry, you know
He does
It's just,  need you to know that, my dad, he's not an evil guy
() 60
(cont'd) don't want you to think that because 'm here he's some kind of belligerent psychotic, he's not don't know, it's just recently, he seems really
She looks at Tyler's face
His eyes are so patient
Ally tears up
Wounded
Our house is like the recovery room, or the critical care unit or something
Tyler strokes her hair
don't feel like that, though feel like 'm getting stronger and like 'm leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself
She is weeping
Tyler pulls her to him doing the best he can
Holding her and kissing her hair

Tell me something, Matthews, do you like paperwork
No, sir
Craig is working up a head of steam
Me neither
Nobody likes paperwork
But paperwork keeps our ship afloat
Paperwork makes it possible for me to keep track of all the scumbags
But  can't do that if newbies like you are incapable of remembering standard filing
Leo interrupts
Jim
61
Craig snaps his head around
What
Leo gestures to speak privately
Ally called Sharon
What
She said to tell you, she's with friends, and she's fine
What friends
She didn't say
That's all
His partner nods
Craig looks away
'm sorry, Jim
Listen, why don't you come over this weekend
We'll get the grill going
Sharon wants to see you
We can have some people, nice people
You can circulate a little
No
Jim
Leo, no
Stop

The rings

Aidan goes to answer it
Hello
Aidan, it's Diane
He blinks
Oh, hey Diane
He throws down the keys, then yells towards the roof
It's your mom
With Diane's knock the door swings open
Hey Diane
He gives her a kiss on the cheek
You really have to fix that door
'm so sorry to just show up called but your phone was busy
Aidan looks and realizes that the phone is indeed off the hook, as just the handset, wrapped in duct tape, is visible on top of the sofa
No problem
Come on in
Tyler and Ally enter the apartment through the fire escape Hey mom
Hey
'm so sorry honey
tried to call but
It's okay
Mom, this is Ally
Ally, this is my mom, Diane
Hi
Nice to meet you
Diane is thrilled
She has a huge mom grin
63
Ally
It's lovely to met you
Just lovely
Diane is pumping Ally's hand like she's drilling for oil
Sit down, Mom
Can  get you something
She navigates the  carnage and sits on the sofa, the joint smoldering in the ashtray in front of her
Aidan ever the gent, removes the ashtray to the window ledge
Yes
Aidan, would you bring back that spliff, please
Beat
Uh
okay
Tyler looks completely befuddled
Aidan passes Diane the joint
She takes a deep hit
Thank you
How's work, Diane
Well
( exhale) just found housing for a family that had been in shelters for three weeks
So that's good
On the other hand,  have six other families
The women measure each other
But Tyler,  wanted to talk to you
Come on, Aidan
What
Nice to meet you, Diane
64
She starts to drag Aidan out the window, back up the fire escape, but he makes a brief detour
Don't freaking bogart that joint, Diane
Sorry
She hands it back to him and Aidan and Ally climb away
Tyler sits next to his mom and lights a cigarette
Well, first, your sister is all excited about your birthday at the house
wish you'd told me
wish she'd told me
It was a unilateral Caroline decision
Will you make sausage and peppers
Of course
Tyler, Your father is driving me crazy
shouldn't even be discussing this with you
can't get him to say he'll come to your sister's exhibit
Her art exhibit
He says he's in the middle of an
Tyler rubs his eyes
Les says  shouldn't broker should let them be on whatever road they're on
Beat
'll get him there
She cares about this, even though she's pretending she doesn't
'll get him there, mom
You will
65
Yes
She looks relieved
Thank you
Thank you
She kisses his cheek, and rises to go
He takes her to the door
Why don't you bring that lovely girl to your birthday
(a warning) Diane
Sorry
Sorry
love you, darling, but this place reeks of marijuana
She goes, shutting the door behind her

60 Aidan and Ally on the roof, they've arranged themselves in the deck chairs
That was weird
assume most moms don't smoke weed in front of their son's
um Piece of ass
You know, you're a poet
Hey
know one thing
know that in the time 've lived with Tyler, he has never introduced a girl
woman
female
to his mom before
It's not like he had a choice
She ambushed us
66
Yeah, but he would've shoved you in a closet or something
Or literally pretended you were a hallucination
Ha ha
mean it
It's the first time
Ever
Did it ever occur to you that that's kind of weird
No
Ally throws up her hands

Okay
He punches a button
Tyler, you're on speakerphone

63 It's about Caroline's show
Are you planning on attending
/ What
There are people here
You'll have to speak up
Tyler holds the phone away from his face and screams at it, silently
Caroline's show
/ What about it
(ready to kill him) You are coming, right
/ Fine
Yes
'm coming
We'll go to dinner first
Alright
(to Janine) Janine
Dinner
That's not
'll make a reservation and have Janine call you

Caroline enters from the kitchen carrying Tyler's She has obviously decorated it herself
She has drawn (as best as she could, given the medium) the characters from the  statue in frosting
It reads "     ", and has "22" in numerical candles and "+ 1   " written next to that
68
She's singing
Aidan, Ally, Diane are all singing
There's a flash from a camera off screen
It's Les
Caroline puts the cake down in front of her brother and Ally takes her hands away just as they finish the song
Tyler's face in the candlelight as he sees Caroline's efforts
He takes a huge breath
Make a wish
He looks at her and blows out the candles
Everybody applauds, Diane longer than anyone else
Her eyes are shining

Her door is ajar
Ally enters, mouth agape as she lays eyes on Caroline's collection of artwork on the walls
Wow
Caroline's working on a       , cigarette dangling from his bottom lip
perfect rendering of a fleeting moment
May
Caroline shrugs
Ally looks over Caroline's shoulder
That's exactly him
It's like the cigarette is the last Coca Cola in the desert
Caroline smiles
can't believe he smokes in front of you
Don't worry, 'm not that impressionable
Ally smiles
Caroline goes back to work
Ally looks around at all the portraits papering her walls
It stirs a memory
You know when  was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and  would go to museums to cool down
she loved them all but The Met was always her favorite
Mine too
The Met is one of my favorite places in the world
So
heard you've got an art exhibit coming up
70
(skeptical) You wanna come
Was it that obvious
But only if you're  with it
don't want to impose and 'll completely understand if you don't want some random girl there
Caroline considers this
You're not random
you're Tyler's girlfriend
Ally has never heard anyone say it so plainly
She seems a bit perplexed, then grins
It's okay with her

You like

You just want to skip dinner

She hands him a simple blue tie that matches his eyes
Beat
was going to make a joke about how 'm not prepared for the commitment of exchanging accessories and how neck wear especially is a slippery slope, but should probably shut up and say thank you

You're learning
Tyler puts on his tie in the mirror
He scowls

68 Tyler and Ally sip cocktails at the nicest table in the place
There's an empty seat
Tyler's eyes flicker towards the door
Twice
He touches his tie
Have you ever been here
Ally tries to lighten his mood
(joking) Yeah
Every Tuesday with my pop
This goes right past Tyler whose eyes flicker towards the door again
He's allowed to stand me up
But he's not allowed to stand you up
Or my sister
Tyler finishes his drink, signals a  who glides to the table
'll have a whiskey
Get me one too
Like a stealth bomber
At least this moment rescued the men from actually having to greet each other
Yes
For the lady
'm fine, thank you

This is Alicia Craig

Yes
But with an area of focused responsibility
It's easier to find a job that way
What will your area be
Criminal Justice
Tough area

don't think it's any harder than that
The Mets, huh

Dad's a Yankee fan
It has something to do with the payroll
It has to do with significant ball playing
You were a Yankees fan when you were little
You were Lou Piniella for Halloween

How long has your dad been a cop
Twenty-two years
His cell phone lights up

Would you excuse me please

Tyler, not able to help himself, shoots him a glance

It's just a call
He held out 'til dessert

'm sorry
And your mother
She passed away when  was eleven
Ah
She was murdered
was there

Why are you saying this now

The exhibit runs til nine
You guys take the car

That's all there is, Tyler
It's not good enough

You have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her
If  have any questions about what my daughter may believe, 'll let you know

She's communicating
Why aren't you riveted
Why isn't this the most important thing
At least for one night of your life

You have no idea what it means
Maybe not
Maybe Caroline doesn't either
Where would she have learned it

have provided her world
And yours
That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do
Who the hell do you think you're talking to
You pedaled down here on your bike for Christ's sake
You have to take care of nothing
You are responsible for no one
You're a kid
You think you're the first one to lose anything
Do you think that there is anything you feel that  haven't already felt
You didn't find him
found him
And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch

As Tyler walks into the light-- his face white with anger, practically crying-- her eyes widen

Oh my God
She runs to him, he falls into her
He's a mess
He won't let her see his face
She pushes at his hair, trying to see and understand
He kisses her, so she won't see
Tyler is completely lost in the storm and Alicia Santana Craig is going to get him through
Okay
She yanks his head up
It's okay

She brings his hands up into her hair, around her face
They kiss

Does she know
Cops never ask a question they don't know the answer to
No

figured you'd probably leave that up to me when you're done with her

Stop smiling
You look insane
Diane can't help it try as she might

Like an end of the summer send off
Caroline rolls her eyes
Have fun
Caroline goes into the lobby
Diane heads back to her car

She follows her into the next room where the other watch a movie

Caroline smiles sheepishly
Some of the   are there, One of them gives her a perfunctory smile

Tyler and Aidan are watching   2
Aidan slurps from a super mega sized soda, laughing, enjoying himself
He turns to his friend
Tyler sits, completely drained, looking like the loneliest guy on the planet
Aidan gives him a nudge
Tyler looks at the screen for a sec and half smiles, then slips away again
Aidan is genuinely concerned

She looks horrified, she has one hand covering her mouth and is whispering into a cell phone
Caroline is on the kitchen phone
Her long hair has been    while she slept
She is crying

Craig appears in an apron
Aidan smiles
Hi
Beat
Is this the, uh, that is, does, uh, Alicia Craig
Does she live here
Craig nods
Oh great
'm
You think  don't remember you
No, sir
Who is it Dad
Ally sees Aidan
She touches her father's forearm
It's
Craig steps back into the house
Six inches
Really
He backs into the hall
Aidan and Ally are alone
What do you want
Look, 'm a prick
And
Craig popping back like an eel from a wreck
He's got the mangled Honey Bear
Dad
93
He goes again
Pfft
Aidan's visibly relieved
Tyler's not
She starts to close the door
Wait
Shit
This isn't really my thing
He lied to me
He's in love with you
He'd like to think he is
Aidan doesn't get it
don't know what that means
've seen him look at one other girl the way he looks at you
She's a lot shorter and shares his
Ally looks away
You don't have to forgive him today
just forgive him
Craig reappears from the deep
Thanks for stopping by
Father and daughter go back into the house

Are you telling me, Ms
Spencer, that you intend to let those girls stay in your school
Of course they're all sticking to the same story and that story is a load of crap
She slams a cabinet closed as Les picks up the tray and down the hall to '
Les is speaking on his cell phone
(sotto, into the phone) She's pretty traumatized
wanted to pull some names together in case we all decide she should talk to someone

92 Caroline and Tyler are lying on Caroline's bed
Her head is nestled on his shoulder
She looks even tinier than usual
Tyler is reading to her, softly, from The Book of Greek Myths, his other hand stroking her butchered hair
She looks pale, wasted
Her eyes are sunken and she's fighting sleep
losing battle, she's exhausted
Her lids finally shutter to the sound of her brother's voice
Les, at the door, places the tray on Caroline's desk
(on the phone) There's no witnesses and it didn't happen on school property
The school won't do anything
They'll probably get away with it
Tyler's eyes, registering anger and shock, jump from the page as he hears this

93 Diane opening the front door for Aidan and Ally
Aidan wraps his arms around Diane and gives her a hug
Ally hangs back a bit, unsure, then embraces Diane
Tyler emerges from the hallway

He sees Aidan and Ally
Stops short

Ally comes out the front door, softly closes it behind her
Last one ever
swear
don't care
Beat
know you're not here for me but, thank you for being here
silent moment passes
For what it's worth,  think you're amazing
It's not worth much
You made everything between us a lie
'm sorry
Okay
Now what
'm supposed to just forgive you

Charles stands in the doorway watching her sleep, we get the feeling he hasn't seen her asleep in some time
Diane appears at his side
How long do you think she'll sleep
think she'll be out for a while
Would you like to wait
Thank you
can't
'll call her later
'll tell her

He's still watching his daughter

Caroline and Tyler enter
The entire class is watching
It's dead quiet
Caroline puts her trembling hands in her pockets
Tyler looks at a few of the girls
They look back, unconcerned, almost amused
Tyler walks his sister to her desk
(to Caroline, whispering) You okay
Caroline nods, although her eyes are brimming
As she slips out of her jacket, the contents of her pockets clatter noisily to the floor
Tyler immediately bends to help her
Have you done something different with your hair
love it
Caroline looks like a deer in headlights
Okay, okay
Enough

Tyler moves towards an
Some girls keep snickering

He stops pushing the broom and stares

The students sit paralyzed

Tyler deciding
Tyler nods
Charles appraises his son
Try not to vandalize any more schools in the meantime

Tyler calls after him
Thank you for bailing me out
Charles, without turning around, No problem

102 No mimes, just dealers
Ally with a girlfriend, walking towards the East Side
Tyler catches up to her

Shakes the friend's hand
After a beat, Ally agrees to walk with him
He reaches for her hand
She pulls it away, but walks next to him
103

103 Tyler has convinced Ally to come uptown and meet Caroline with him
Tyler and Caroline climb all over the Alice, while Ally watches from a bench
As befitting a seventh grader, Caroline turns her face to the sun and arranges herself to take advantage of the early September tanning possibilities
Tyler walks over to Ally's bench, sits next to her

Using the little sister is dirty pool

He is bathed in the pool of light streaming in
(nuzzling) Hey
Hey

Hmmm

(sleepily) Do you want french toast or pancakes for breakfast
Whichever tastes better a la mode

Charles
Good morning Diane
What are you doing here
Tyler's coming by the office, but thought 'd ride to school with Caroline first
Diane is speechless
This is a first
Um

yeah

She's not ready though, she's going to need at least twenty minutes
Charles hates waiting

Are you canceling all together or are you just running late

109 Tyler rounding a corner

'm already here
'm taking Caroline to school
He looks at his daughter
She looks back at him, then looks out the window
Tyler considers
Take your time
'll just wait in your office
It may be a while
That's okay
Tyler hangs up and joins the herds of suits heading down the street

Tyler heads down the hall
The Receptionist rolls her eyes

It's dark, quiet
He opens the blinds
Sunlight fills the room

Tyler walks around the office
Picking things up, putting them back
Tyler sits at his father's desk in his executive chair
He leans back
Puts his feet up and his hands behind his head
Tyler notices the
He turns on the monitor and puts his hand on the mouse - but doesn't move it
His hand just stops and stays perfectly still
Tyler stares at the monitor where his dad's   is scrolling through
These photos are all of his
"Michael's first Christmas, Tyler's eighth birthday, Diane in the hospital with Caroline in a pink blanket, Charles and his kids build a sand castle at the shore"
they just keep going
Tyler finds himself watching a slide show of his life

Charles' Town car rolls to a stop
Caroline gives him a kiss on the cheek
It registers, sort of
She gets out
Charles watches her all the way into the school
His  sees him watching Caroline in the rear view mirror
Charles gives the Driver a look "you're waiting for an invite

Good Morning, Mister Roth
Did you know about this
Janine walks around the desk in time to see a photo of Tyler and Michael naked in the tub pop up
She smiles
Who do you think scanned all the pictures
Tyler smiles
Janine smiles, Then a photo of Michael comes up
Those smiles fade
Silence
How old would he be
Twenty-nine last May
Tyler stands and looks out one of the floor-to-ceiling windows separated by columns
He stares out at mid town and a perfect blue sky
Janine looks befuddled
It's really been that long could've sworn it was
May 18, 1993

Janine reflecting

It's okay

Until we see Tyler framed in the window surrounded by eerily familiar grey metal siding
Until we see can barely see Tyler and the base of a giant white antenna
Until we can no longer see Tyler as he's disappeared into the composite of the building and we've pulled back far enough to reveal that Tyler is standing in a window on the
92nd Floor of The North Tower of the World Trade Center

The Towers
The blue sky
Then we hear the faint sound of  Flight 11's  as it closes in on the North Tower
Silence
Darkness
