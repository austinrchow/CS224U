: - lies on his back in bed
He is a frail-looking man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair
On top of him is a much younger
Although her back is to us, we catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side to side
We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman
She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts
She reaches down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him deeper inside her
They move together -- faster -- and faster
The  slowly begins to
As it does we see what we are watching is on a
Further back still
We see standing before the television watching the act
The  begins to pan around the room
Rain streaks down the windows of the room --  flashes outside is set up on a tripod
More   , looking, dusting, talking
We continue to
We can now see it is the same room on the tape
the bed lies the naked body of  , a sheet covering his lower torso
His face is ashen, mouth open, his dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare
The last instant of his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain
- fills the night sky
overhead
The wind whips the  furiously against anything in its path
The  moves slowly along rows of beautiful
At the end is a cul-de-sac
Several   are in the driveway, their
four-door  pulls into the driveway
steps out into the rain
He is a handsome Latin in his thirties, with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair
He does not run through the rain -- he walks
, a man who looks more like an accountant than a homicide detective runs out to meet him
Is it Marsh
Yeah
Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face
It lasts an instant, then it's gone
Sir, do you mind if we get out of the rain
Cardenas doesn't move
He ignores the question
Who found him
His Secretary
Joanne Braslow
She was here
No
She stopped by to pick up some papers
Show me
Reese starts for the house
Cardenas looks up into the night sky

,  -    - Pull back to reveal a   snapping pictures of Marsh in bed
Cardenas enters followed by Reese
He moves through the and
Anything Cardenas feels about the gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of indifference
Standing by the bed is   , , a short, baby-faced man
Cardenas looks down at the body, then over at the  ,
McCURDY, a portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes
How long
About three hours
Cause
Not sure
'll have everything you need tomorrow
Take a look at this
Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it
On top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal spray
Inside are ,  and an assortment of This guy was into some kinky shit
Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of the room
- sits on chair
Her eyes are tired -- red from crying
She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right cosmetics
She has a corporate look to her
Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her
Miss Braslow -- 'm District Attorney John Cardenas
You arrived at what time tonight
little after eleven
Why did you come by
had some papers to pick up
Do you know who Mr
Marsh was with
assume his girlfriend
Her name
Rebecca Lawson
You wouldn't know her address, would you
No -- but  can get it for you
Thank you
,    - Cardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy
Marsh wasn't alone
We found traces of sperm on the sheets
The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood
What'd he die of
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest
The official cause
That's what my report will read
But there's more
They reach a door and stop
It's speculative at this point
Marsh had advanced Arterial disease
His heart attack was induced by excessive aerobic activity -- in conjunction with the drug
McCurdy enters the room
Cardenas thinks for a moment, then follows
'  - Spacious and sparsely furnished
The walls are empty
No commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the office
Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who is already seated next to Reese and Troxell
(to McCurdy) What are you saying, Henry
That his girlfriend fucked him to death
Yes
trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face
He walks over to the window and stares outside
Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait as he thinks
beat
Cardenas turns back to the room
What can we prove
We know Marsh had a head cold
We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand
The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time
He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking
Any prints on the nasal spray
Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's
What if he did know what was in it
lot of users put it in nasal spray bottles so they can use it in public
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene
man across the street from Marsh saw her drive up about four thirty Sunday afternoon
And her prints are all over the place
Cardenas stands and walks to a   on the wall
He gathers the , moves back and tosses one
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day
Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose
What did he say about Miss Lawson
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office
Cardenas throws another dart at the board
So she knew about his heart
Had to
also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh
There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson
What about the will
That's the best part
She gets it all -- everything

He supports his weight with the aid of a
The service concludes
Sattler along with several other offer her their condolences
Joanne Braslow is there
She does not go over to Rebecca
stand off to the side by a large oak tree
Cardenas watches and waits
He steps forward as Sattler leads the woman by
Miss Lawson
The Woman stops
Her back is to Cardenas
'm District Attorney, John Cardenas
removes her hat and veil and slowly turns around
She is in her late twenties
deep pain fills her face -- controlled, but evident
Her eyes are tired -- heavy from crying -- but no tears show now
This is a woman whose grief is private and not displayed for others
Although emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful
So beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide how impressed he is
don't think that this is the time, or the place
just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry
An inquiry into what
For starters 'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime
Did  say it was a natural death
Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes
Rebecca stares at him genuinely shocked by his accusation
Cardenas nods and walks away
In the b
g
we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with hostility
,   - Large and homey
fire roars in the fireplace sits on his couch as he goes over some
He is mid- thirties, powerful, self-assured
enters
She is an attractive woman in her early thirties
She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his aside and sits down on his lap
You're on vacation, remember
You're supposed to be relaxing
am relaxing
(pushing the papers aside) This is not relaxing
(playfully) Really
Really
(playing along) And  suppose you're going to show me how to relax
If you want me to
'm always open to learning new things
She kisses him -- soft, gentle kisses
Dulaney puts his arms around her and kisses her harder
'm beginning to see what you mean
Why don't we go upstairs and work on the advanced course
can't
've got to finish a counter offer on the Bergman property
The moment is passing by
trace of frustration shows on Dulaney's face -- this is obviously not a new occurrence
Can't it wait
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow
The moment is gone
Dulaney forces an understanding smile
He looks towards the door and sees his    , Hey, Slugger
Ready for bed
Michael walks over to this parents
Uh huh
The
Dulaney answers it
(into phone) Hello
Hi Raymond
What
Well,  was sort of planning on
Alright
Okay, goodbye
(hangs up; to Sharon) That was Sattler
He thinks the 's going to file on Rebecca Lawson
He wants me in the office tomorrow morning
We're supposed to go to the lake
know
What can  do
He is the boss
He could let you have your vacation
Dad -- is it true what they're saying about that Miss Lawson Lady
10 What are they saying
The kids at school say she humped Mr
Marsh to death
Hey, you know better than that
What did  teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something
She allegedly humped him to death
Dulaney grins
Sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh
swear -- the both of you
(to Dulaney) Some example you set
(imitating her) Some example you set
He makes a funny face at Michael who  and makes one back
Dulaney grabs him and starts  him
Michael with  as he tries to tickle him back
Dulaney then starts   -- Michael helps him
Sharon  with and falls to the floor
The three of them roll around hysterically
'  - Sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee
Dulaney sits across from him
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man
trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet
Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten
'd like you to go with her
'm supposed to be on vacation
11 know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files
Why
Because  told her you were the best criminal attorney we have
Raymond, 'm the only criminal attorney you have
(jokingly) Well,  guess that makes you the best
(candidly) Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars
As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us
All 'm asking you to do is talk to her
Dulaney thinks about it for a moment
Alright, 'll talk to her She's waiting in the conference room
Dulaney stands and walks towards the door
(continuing) You know,  knew Andrew Marsh for almost twenty years -- or thought did
What do you think would make a man in his condition do the things he did
Dulaney stops at the door and looks back
think the question is:  What is it about her that made him want to do it
12 - Rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her hair
She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that clings to every curve of her body
Dulaney enters the room
When he sees her he can't help but stare
Rebecca notes his gaze
Miss Lawson, 'm Frank Dulaney
She raises the cigarette to her lips
Dulaney notices despite her outward composure her hand is shaking
(nervously) Are you going to represent me
There are no charges against you
'm here to decide if 'm going to represent you should that occur
(beat) Did you kill him
Rebecca appears hurt by the question
You don't waste any time, do you
Dulaney doesn't answer
He studies her -- his eyes probing hers
(continuing) Do you think  did it
don't know
That's why 'm asking you
You must have some feeling
Some immediate impression
young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will
And the things that went on in that house
Such wild sex
What kind of picture does that paint
Not a very good one 'm afraid
13 And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me
That's why need a very good lawyer, Mr
Dulaney
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges
Rebecca's anxiety begins to surface
She feigns a weak smile
He'll file
He's an ambitious man
Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others
You still haven't answered my question
She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering
She looks at Dulaney
Displaying emotions is not something that comes easily
Tears well up in her eyes
(emotionally) loved him
big part of my life has been torn away from me, Mr
Dulaney
part  can never get back -- and on top of that people are saying that  am somehow responsible for it
They've taken everything that is good and caring about two people in love and made it dirty
single tear streams down her check
She knows what he wants to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it
No --  didn't kill him
,
'  - Cardenas walks down the hall, sipping a cup of coffee
Troxell walks towards him excitedly
They walk together
think 'm going to make your day
How
14 Troxell points to an Office
Through the glass partition we can see a  sitting at a table
is a well-groomed man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good
've got this guy in my office
Doctor Alan Paley
Wait until you hear what he has to say
Cardenas and Troxell enters the room
Cardenas shakes hands with Paley and listens with great interest as he starts to talk
'  - Dulaney and Sharon are in bed
Dulaney reads some
Sharon finishes reading her
She puts it on the nightstand and looks at Dulaney
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard
If he files are you going to take the case
don't know yet
want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow
What's she like
Attractive
Bright
Distant
Charming when she wants to be
Dulaney's description seems to bother her
She sounds like quite a woman
(joking) Yeah -- but can she cook
Sharon hits him on the arm playfully
15 The whole thing gives me the creeps
mean -- what if she really humped him to death
Dulaney grins at her choice of words
Humped (grinning) Yes
can think of worse ways to go-- Dulaney rolls over, gathering her up in his arms
(continuing) --and speaking of humping
He reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the
As Dulaney and Rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by a  of
Dulaney puts his arm around Rebecca and ushers her through the crowd
'  - Dulaney and Rebecca sit on one side of a table
Reese stands
Cardenas sits at his desk
didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr
Sattler called me at home that night
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty
She's not denying she was there
Did you have sex
16 Yes
What time did you leave
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine
have
Did you use it the night Marsh died
No
haven't done it in years
Did Marsh use it
No -- never
It had to get there somehow
It didn't get there from me
Were you aware of Mr
Marsh's heart condition
No
Mr
Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr
Marsh to their office on at least two occasions
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition
He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious
He never mentioned his heart disease
17 She just said that
Why do you think he lied to you
That's something only Marsh would know
think Miss Lawson knew it too think she slipped him the coke and he popped his cork giving her the high- hard-one
Dulaney's anger shows
He stands
That's it
My client doesn't have to take this crap from you
Sit down, Frank
No
Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions
She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted
So, either you charge her now or we're leaving
beat
Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes
Cardenas shrugs his shoulders
Fine
Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up
She stands and they walk to the door
Reese looks at Cardenas
Cardenas nods
Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest for the murder of Andrew Marsh
Rebecca is stunned -- frightened
She looks at Dulaney in disbelief
Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily
Reese removes his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca
You have the right to remain silent
If you give up-- 18 (to Reese) don't think the handcuffs will be necessary
You can finish giving Miss Lawson her rights outside
Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door
She looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes welling with tears
(frightened) Frank
'll have you out in a few hours
Reese ushers her through the door
beat
Dulaney and Cardenas are left alone
Cardenas starts fishing through a can of , carefully extracting the cashews
Dulaney continues to stand
Lookin' to make the papers, John
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will
That's motive
She admits to being there the night of his death
That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle
(continuing) You can't show intent
Cardenas looks at Dulaney wryly
He knows that Dulaney is trying to discover his game plan
Cardenas looks into his can of nuts and fishes for another cashew
(continuing) Can you
Take your pole out of the water, Frank
The fish ain't biting today
You're bluffing
John, it's me, remember
've known you since your name was Juan Carlos
Cardenas doesn't appreciate Dulaney mentioning his real name
19 (continuing) 'mon -- think about it
If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find
She planned this
She wanted us to find the nasal spray
Why would she want that
Because she's clever
Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction
The
's report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use
Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning
We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her
don't buy it and neither will a jury
We're going all the way on this one, Frank
Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five
'll tell her but she won't take it
Then she's not as smart as  thought she was
You've seen her in the depositions
Tell me you don't have any doubts
20 She's innocent
Aren't they all
Yeah
Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that
Dulaney gets up slowly and leaves
,   - Dulaney waits at the counter
barred door slides open and Rebecca is led out by a
Even in these surroundings she maintains her composure
She walks to the counter and waits silently
- As Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled by , screaming questions, asking them to verify Rebecca's arrest
Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in tow
- Gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain
Tall birch trees line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn is approaching
Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging path cut along the bank
want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty
Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud
They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path
Andrew hardly needed leading
He was a very passionate man
He was eager to explore
gave him what he wanted
We fulfilled each others needs
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex
21 'm used to being on the outside looking in
The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together
Those same men will be sitting on the jury
am who  am
can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are
like sex different --  like it wild
That's not a crime
(emotional) loved Andrew
We made love together
We made it differently, but we still made love
It was our way
It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice
If  was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me
She stops walking and stares out over the River
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr
Dulaney
They have such passion -- such savage emotion
They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other
Not really
No pain, no gain
Something like that
We're not animals
As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated
22 Of course we are
Our primal urges are still there -- but we've taken sex and intellectualized it, refined it down to its most essential components
It's bland, easy, mechanical
There's great passion in the struggle -- such craving in denial
Do you know what it's like to yearn for something
'm not talking about wanting, or needing
'm talking about an urge so deep that your skin burns and every cell in your body pulses with desire
Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside
(awkwardly) think we're getting a little off the subject here
thought the subject was sex
As it pertains to you -- not me
(beat) Did you always know you had different
tastes
Yes
How
don't know if it's something  can explain to you
Why not
Because -- it's beyond intellect
It's emotion
It's passion
It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined
Try
Rebecca thinks for a moment
23 When  was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard
So did this family down the road used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries
It wasn't easy
The stone walls were high and 'd scrape my knees as  climbed over
On the other side were wild rose bushes
The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as  lowered myself down
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it
Dulaney appears lost in her words
This isn't lost on Rebecca
She walks off
Dulaney stares after her intrigued
' ,   - light rain falls outside
Dulaney picks at his food
He stares out the window
He seems oblivious to the conversation between Sharon and Michael
Albert's got the stomach flu
That's too bad
No, it's not
Now  get to pitch
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well
Not even if they're a dork
Not even if they're a dork
You should go by and see how he's feeling
24 No way
Jerry Milner stopped by and Albert puked right in front of him
Sharon tries to suppress a grin
Don't use language like that at the dinner table
Sorry
Sharon looks at Dulaney
He is still staring out the window, deep in thought
- Dulaney is at his desk, looking at  of Marsh and the bedroom
Sharon enters
Frank --  know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him
He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him
'll talk to him later
Why don't you talk to him now
Because  go to trial in seven weeks
've got a lot of preparing to do
(angry) No one's asking you not to work just think you could make some time for your son
'  - Michael lies on his bed, doing his homework
The door opens and Dulaney enters and sits beside him
'm sorry if it looks like 'm not paying attention to you lately
25 Michael looks at Dulaney somewhat confused
Dulaney tries to explain it another way
(continuing) You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends
How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you
Yeah
Well, that's kind of how  am right now
Is Mom yelling at you too
Dulaney grins
Yeah -- a little
Dulaney leans over and hugs Michael
love you
love you too, Dad
'  - is a tall, wiry black man
Street-wise, but basically good humored
He is tossing a   through a basketball hoop mounted on the wall as Dulaney enters
How you doin' Mister
Fine, Charlie
You familiar with the Marsh case
26 Yeah --  hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that
It could've happened to anyone
(ghetto accent) 'm sorry, man -- but  ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy
Dulaney grins in spite of himself
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal
So -- where do we start
want you to hit all the dealers in town
Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use
Then  want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley
He lives up in Roseburg
Dulaney's '  crackles over the intercom
() Mister Dulaney,  have Rebecca Lawson on one
Dulaney picks up the phone
(on the phone) Hi
No,  don't
One o'clock is fine
Alright La Brasa
Bye
Dulaney hangs up
Biggs is staring at him with a grin
La Brasa
27 (defensive) 'm taking a client to lunch
Where should  go, Taco Bell
Biggs tosses the ball to Dulaney, then raises his hands indicating he is backing off
He leaves
Dulaney shoots from his desk
- Dimly lit
Dark wood and leather
Dulaney sits at a table with Rebecca
She removes a  and holds it, waiting for Dulaney to light it
Dulaney fumbles through his pockets and removes a book of
He lights one
Rebecca doesn't lean forward to meet him
He must go to her
She looks into his eyes as she cups her hand over his
beat
She lights the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling '
She watches him as it burns down towards his fingers
After a long moment she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his hand
How'd you meet Marsh
was at a cocktail party
Very trendy
Andrew was in Chicago on business
He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling
He looked so helpless
a few tables away are staring at her
Rebecca sees them
-- And then
We started talking
In fact, we talked until four in the morning
We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests
After that we were together all the time until he left
He used to call me every night after he came back
Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him
've never left
Why didn't you live together
28 Andrew was worried about how it would look
in a booth are looking at Rebecca and whispering
Rebecca and Dulaney notice them
Can we get out of here
Sure
Where to
Rebecca stands up
She doesn't answer
She just walks off
'  - Dulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's
They get out
Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door
This is your house
(walking towards the door) know
Dulaney stops
don't think this is a good idea
Rebecca stops and turns towards him
Why not
Because, 'm your attorney shouldn't be going to your house
Is it against the law
No -- it just doesn't look right
Rebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney
No one's looking
29 She walks to her front door and opens it
She enters, leaving the door open
Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows
',   - Dulaney enters
Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room
Her back is to Dulaney, but she knows he is there
Dulaney looks around the room
He stares at a group of  on the wall
On the other  is a
'  - filled with     -- sensual but not vulgar
Rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies the artwork
What do you think
think the photographer's probably a voyeur
'm the photographer
Oh -- Well, they're different
That's not an answer
It's not my taste
(seductively) Tastes can change
Rebecca looks up to the top of a high cabinet
Sitting on top of the cabinet is a
There you are
She stands on her tip toes as she reaches up
Dulaney watches her -- the arch of her back -- the hem of her skirt rising up her legs
She lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and sits down
The slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs
Dulaney's eyes trace along them
Rebecca notes his gaze
30 What are you thinking
Dulaney looks up quickly
Nothing
Not true
Shall  tell you what you were thinking
You were wondering if was wearing anything under my skirt
The fact that he doesn't protest confirms that she is right
She runs her finger lightly along her thighs
am
Dulaney walks to the window and stares out
Rebecca seems amused
She puts the cat down and walks over to him
Sorry
wasn't trying to embarrass you
He slowly turns towards her
Yes you were
Dulaney stares at her for a moment, then places his briefcase on the table and opens it
-    - fork digs into a large strawberry
as we follow the strawberry into Sharon's mouth
Dulaney sits across from Sharon
His eyes are on the strawberries
His mind is someplace else -- and it isn't hard to guess where
--he said it might be too expensive to add another room
He suggested we might convert the garage into a guest room
He's going to check with the contractor and let me know
'll let you know how much and we can decide
Alright
31 Dulaney looks up slowly
It is not so much that he has heard the question -- it is more that he is aware that Sharon has stopped talking
beat
Sharon isn't sure he has heard her
Is that alright, Frank
Yeah -- fine
Excuse me
'll be right back
He stands and leaves the table
,  - Dulaney walks to a   near the bathrooms
He thinks for a moment, then dials a number
Rebecca answers
() Hello
Hi
It's Frank
() Hi, Frank
(awkwardly) just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow
() Yes -- she did
Great
'll see you at the office at nine
() No -- not at the office
've got a better idea
,   - An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake
Dulaney and Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it
figured if we have to talk all day we might as well do it someplace nice
32 (looks at the cabin) Isn't it beautiful
Yeah
(sadly) Andrew loved this old cabin
(fondly remembering) He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum
(a sad smile) could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful
Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind wish he'd had a chance to do it
Her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant memory
(snapping out of it) Sorry
It's okay
,  - Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore
soft wind blows through her hair
Tell me about Doctor Paley
hardly know him
He wanted me and he couldn't have me
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off
(confidently) It won't be that hard
33 She walks off
- Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing
Did you always want to be a lawyer
No --  wanted to be a professional hockey player
Really
Yeah
That seems so far away from who you are now
What happened
broke my ankle skating
That ended that dream
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it
To let go of what you want
Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light of the setting sun
Their eyes meet
He starts to lean in towards her -- then stops
He gets up and walks away
'  - Rebecca's car pulls up in front
Dulaney gets out
'm going to put the car away
You can let yourself in
There's a key under the flower pot
Rebecca drives to the rear of the building
Dulaney walks to the door
He lifts the   -- removes a  -- opens the door and goes inside
- Detective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house
He glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad
34 '   - Rebecca walks over to the  and turns on the The room fills with soft, sexy
Dulaney stands in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move
Yes -- it would be nice
What would
You and me -- making love
Is that what you think  was thinking
No -- that's what  know you were thinking
Before Dulaney can start to protest she continues
She slowly walks behind him
Dulaney stares straight ahead
How often do you make love to your wife, Frank
Once a week
Sometimes twice
There once was passion, wasn't there
But now it's bland, predictable
Tell me, when you do it -- do you always think of her
Or do you wonder what it would be like to be with someone else
Someone wild
Someone who would force you to lose control
Her words strip his thoughts bare
He is vulnerable
(continuing) There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank
You take a lot for granted
Dulaney starts for the door
Rebecca's cool exterior fades, giving way to her vulnerable side
35 Please stay, Frank
don't want to be alone
don't expect anything from you -- no demands -- no complications
just need to feel close to someone
Dulaney turns back towards her
beat
He thinks for a moment, then walks back into the room
Rebecca smiles warmly, invitingly
'll be back in a minute
Help yourself to a drink
She disappears down the hall
Dulaney stands were he is, wondering what he is doing there
He walks over to the  and pours a
He looks down the hall
- ' The bedroom door is open
The room is  -- Lit only by the moon
Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head
washes over her body,  her
She runs her hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her round, full breasts
She stops for a moment -- and we sense she knows Dulaney is watching her
Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized
He knows he should turn away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look
One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing her sheer, white panties
She bends forward slightly and slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of them
We can see the desire on Dulaney's face
He looks away
The conflict inside him grows
He looks back
Rebecca walks into the hall
She is barefoot --  wearing a long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's
If she wasn't aware he was watching her before -- she is now
It doesn't seem to bother her
She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes inviting his
Dulaney moves towards her
They meet in the middle of the room
She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can smell her
She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to bring his lips to hers
The longing overcomes him
He kisses her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back
She bites his lip
36 (whispering) My way
Dulaney ignores her
He tries to kiss her again
She turns her head away
She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door
Dulaney follows
He tries the door -- it's locked
He starts to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room
He starts to leave -- stops
He looks at the bedroom door
His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him
He moves quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination
He breaks the door open with his shoulder
Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting for him
He moves to her
She can see the fire in his eyes
He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly -- feeding his craving for her
My way
He is lost within her now and doesn't hear her
She pulls his hair, jerking his head back
Her eyes command him to follow her demand
Something in him snaps -- a new door opens
He pushes her back onto the
He kisses her, running his hand up her thighs, hiking up her dress
She wraps her legs around his waist
They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and bottles to the floor
He lifts her -- carries her to the bed - - lays her down and rips her dress from her body
Their passion is unleased
They grope and claw for one another hungrily
She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the shoulder
His face tenses from the pain, but he  with pleasure
'  - Dark
Sharon is asleep
The door opens and Dulaney enters quietly
He walks towards the bathroom
'  - Dulaney splashes a handful of water across his face
He unbuttons his shirt and takes it off -- wincing as he does
He turns his back to the mirror
Several deep are dug into his back
He looks at himself in the mirror
37 ,   - Dulaney and Biggs walk down the hall to a water cooler
Biggs pours himself a glass
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke
You've got to get me something  can use, Charlie
'm trying
Sattler walks over with another
He ignores Biggs
Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from the
Times
He'd like to ask you a few questions
It's an incredible story going on here
(as if quoting a headline) Woman accused of using sex to kill lover
'll say -- it's gonna give a whole new meaning to the state nickname
Biggs  and walks off
Sattler glares at him
Dulaney smirks
(confused) What's the state nickname
(dryly) The Beaver State
- Rows of new Town Houses line the street
Dulaney drives up and walks towards the front door of one of them
He
answers
She stares at Dulaney innocently
38 '   -   - Sparsely decorated
Very trendy
High tech furniture and designer lights
Joanne sits on the couch -- Dulaney on one of the chairs
There is  on the table
worked for Mr
Marsh for six years
He was a good man -- until she came along
What changed
He did
Look,  know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well
Joanne stops as emotion fills her
Her eyes well with tears
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you
don't know
It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca
take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much
really don't know her that well
We would say hello to each other when would come to the house, but that was about it
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her
Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had
39 How do you know what kind of sex they had
wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking
'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew
'd find their little toys all over the place
Did Mr
Marsh use drugs
No
What about Miss Lawson
Yes -- cocaine
Dulaney is shocked by this
How do you know that
was at the house one morning -- thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr
Marsh
When  went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial
Dulaney looks like he's been kicked in the stomach
Is something wrong
beat
Dulaney looks at her slowly
What
No -- nothing
Thank you for your time
He gets up and walks to the door
Joanne stands and stares after him with a trace of a grin
'  - Rebecca opens the front door and Dulaney barges into the room
40 You lied to me
What
just left Joanne Braslow
She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house
She's mistaken
(Yelling) That's not good enough, Goddamit
It isn't true
You have to believe me
No,  don't have to believe you
The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them
don't use cocaine anymore
If she says she saw me doing it she's lying
Why would she lie
don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out
Dulaney is confused, struggling to decide if he believes her
,   - Sharon is getting a load of washing ready
She picks up one of Dulaney's tee shirts and notices several thin stripes of near the shoulder
' ,   - falls
Dulaney enters the room to find Michael on the Dulaney appears nervous -- anxious
41 Michael -- get off the phone
Why
(impatiently) Because 'm expecting a call
-- But it's Sunday
(snapping) know what day it is
Get off the phone
(hurt; into phone) gotta go
'll call you later
Michael hangs up and leaves the room
Dulaney stares at the phone -- struggling against himself
He picks it up and dials
' This is Rebecca Lawson
'm not in right now
So if you please leave a message-- Dulaney slams down the phone
He checks his watch
- Dulaney wears another tee shirt as he sleeps
Sharon is awake, staring up at the ceiling
beat
She rolls over and carefully lifts up Dulaney's tee shirt
She sees the scratches on his back
She does not wake him
She just lays there, deep in thought
,  - Rebecca walks down the hall
In the b
g
we see Dulaney walking quickly to join her
called you all weekend
Where were you
went out on the boat
42 (concerned) Alone
Of course
- The gallery is crowded with  and
Dulaney sits beside Rebecca at the defense table
Cardenas stands before the jury
Dulaney and Cardenas are seated at their respective tables
Rebecca sits beside Dulaney
She is wearing a beautiful, well tailored dress
She looks beautiful and has surprisingly made no attempt to down-play her looks
, a confident   in his fifties sits behind the bench
He is strong-willed -- tough but fair
There is a rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets
This trial by its very nature is explosive
The press is going to have a field day and  will not tolerate any activity in my courtroom that will fuel it
(to Dulaney and Cardenas) Both of you are going to be delving into very personal aspects of peoples lives
warn you now
When you do so -- if you cannot establish a clear line of relevancy early on in your examinations  will stop you
Is that clear
Dulaney and Cardenas both nod
Mr
Cardenas
Cardenas stands and walks towards the
(points to Rebecca) You all can see the defendant, Rebecca Lawson
But as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the defendant -- she is the murder weapon itself
43 (stops and thinks for a moment) Is that possible
Can a person actually be a weapon
The answer is yes
If  hit you and you die -- am the cause of your death
But can sex be called a weapon
Yes
And what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson made of it
The State will prove that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh -- that she put increasing sexual demands on him while she secretly administered cocaine
All the while knowing that he had a severe heart condition
(beat) She is a beautiful woman -- but when this trial is over you will see her no differently than a gun, or a knife or any other instrument used as a weapon
She is a killer
And the worst kind -- one who disguised herself as a loving partner
Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down
Mr
Dulaney
Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury
know what you're thinking -- and it's a mistake
You look at Miss Lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was involved with an older man -- and you think she looks like the type
She could've done it
And that's exactly what the District Attorney wants you to think
Yes, she is beautiful
So what
Does that make her a killer
Of course not
This case is not about appearances
It's about facts
(beat) As Mr
Cardenas presents his case you will see that there are very few facts -- that the bulk of the States evidence is circumstantial
'm confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just have a reasonable doubt
You will have no doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson is innocent of the charges against her
44 -  - McCurdy is on the witness stand
Cardenas stands before him
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death
massive cardiac arrest
What was Mr
Marsh's physical condition prior to his death
Very poor
He was suffering from severe arterial disease
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes
No
What induced it
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood
So, Mr
Marsh used cocaine
don't think so
The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage
Then how did it get into his body
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand
It was filled with water and cocaine
Mr
Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death
believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine
45 Cardenas holds up a bottle of   in a
He brings it over to McCurdy
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand
(examines it) Yes
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit
(to McCurdy) Were any fingerprints found on the bottle
Yes -- those of Mr
Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's
Dr
McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr
Marsh's condition
Increase his heart rate
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine
It would be an added stress to his heart
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr
Marsh and then induced him to make love
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy
(to Dulaney) Your witness
46 Rebecca looks at Dulaney for his opinion of McCurdy's testimony
Dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he stands up and approaches McCurdy
Can you say with any certainty that Mr
Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine himself
No -- but it seems highly unlikely that a man in his condition would use cocaine
That's your opinion, Doctor -- but 'm asking you if there is any scientific test that can tell who actually put the cocaine into the Dristan bottle
No
Thank you
-  - Cardenas stands before  , a thin, pasty-faced man in his fifties
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr
Marsh had heart disease
About a year and half ago
Did Mr
Marsh change his lifestyle after that
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly
He did everything he could to take care of his heart
Yes
47 Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr
Marsh to your office
Yes
Just one last question
What does the sign on your office door say
Doctor Steven Trammel
Cardiologist
Cardenas walks back to his seat, signaling his examination of the witness is over
Dulaney stands
Dr
Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr
Marsh's condition
No
Did Mr
Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness
No
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr
Marsh inside during his examinations
No
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr
Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits
No
No,  don't
-  - Joanne Braslow is on the stand
She is wearing a smart business suit and large-framed glasses
Her hair is pulled back tight
Cardenas stands before her
48 How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary
Six years
Did you ever see Mr
Marsh use Cocaine
No -- never
What about Miss Lawson
Yes
Tell the court about that, please
opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial
Did you see Mr
Marsh the day before his death
Yes
How did he look
Horrible
He was tired and pale
Did you talk about Miss Lawson
Yes
What did Mr
Marsh say
49 He was worried
He said that she was acting stranger and stranger
He said that if this kept up she was going to kill him
That his heart couldn't take it
There is an audible  from the crowd
For the first time Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with genuine concern
Thank you
(to Dulaney) Your witness
Cardenas sits down
Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards Joanne
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom
Yes-- (thinks a moment) It was on a Friday
remember because  was going to visit my sister for her birthday
It would be October twenty-eighth
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr
Marsh said to you the day before his death
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him
That his heart couldn't take it
Didn't Mr
Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile
50 Yes -- he mentioned it
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving
That must cause tremendous anxiety
Sleepless nights
Incredible stress
suppose
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love
That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him
That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it
waits anxiously for her answer
Joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks
She appears confused
don't know
'm not sure
Well, think about it
Isn't it possible
(begrudgingly) Yes
suppose it's possible
Cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated
Rebecca breathes a sigh of relief
- Quiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for the day
Dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with Rebecca
You were brilliant today
It's only the beginning
51 Strong endings start with strong beginnings
(growing excitement) love the way you twist what people say around --  manipulating their own words against them
They reach Rebecca's car
Can  see you later
You can see me now
Rebecca presses against him, raising her knee gently into his groin -- as she kisses him passionately
Dulaney is lost in her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around
Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of her car
She takes one of the shoes and hits the The  breaks sending the area in darkness
What are you doing
She steps down and kisses him again
For a moment he tries to resist
want you inside me
His desire fills him
He pushes her back onto the hood of her car, hiking up her dress with his hands, as she reaches down and unbuttons his pants
'  - The room is dimly lit
Dulaney is in bed
He appears to be deep in thought
Rebecca enters wearing a sheer, silk bathrobe and carrying a tea service on a tray
He places it on the bed and sits beside him
Something wrong
Paley could be a problem tomorrow
52 'm sure you'll be able to handle him
'm glad you have such confidence in me
Don't worry about Paley
He can't touch me
No one can
've thought it all out
(sits up; very concerned) What does that mean
You've been thinking about the case
Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh
The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face
She looks away from him
beat
Dulaney thinks
He feels bad for asking such a question
'm sorry
(she doesn't look at him) Rebecca -- 'm sorry
Really
He takes her hand
She slowly looks at him and smiles
She points to the tea service
Sugar or honey
Honey
She lifts a   of  and starts to pour it into a cup
She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney, then parts her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her thigh
She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently pulls him forward
He kisses her knee and slowly runs his tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards
She arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from the pleasure of his touch
'  - Dark
The door opens -- light from the hall streaks into the room
Sharon is asleep
Dulaney enters quietly
He watches her
He looks over at the nightstand
53 of Dulaney and Sharon on vacation
Dulaney is carrying her on a beach
He is wearing a
They are both laughing
Dulaney looks back at Sharon
He is a man lost within himself
He walks to the bathroom
Sharon opens her eyes and stares at him
- Court is in session
Cardenas stands
The State calls Doctor Alan Paley
Doctor Paley stands and walks towards the witness stand
- Paley has been sworn in
Cardenas examines him
Where did you meet Miss Lawson
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago
Did you ever see her again after that
Yes -- several times
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson
We stopped seeing each other
Why
Well --  realized that she wasn't interested in me
She was just trying to get information out of me
54 What kind of information
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart
from the crowd fill the room
Did you suggest any
Yes -- Insulin and others
What did she say
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned
She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high
-- And what did you suggest
Cocaine
More  from the crowd
Rebecca's remains calm, but her eyes glare at Paley hatefully
(to Dulaney) Your witness
Cardenas sits down
Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile
Dr
Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson
We had dinner at a restaurant
55 Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot
No
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her
No
If necessary  can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence
Paley thinks for a moment
He is nervous
Well -- as  remember it, we had an argument
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not
(hesitantly) Yes
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson
No
Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a   from a cardboard box
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine
would like to play it now
Objection
Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from
Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made
56 Dulaney takes out two pieces of  and approaches the bench
These are reports from two independent audio labs
They each state that the voices were recorded over the phone and that no alterations have been made
Judge Burnham studies the paper
'll allow it
Dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the
We a , then
' Rebecca --  know you're there, Godammit
Answer the phone, you bitch
You can't treat me like this
We  a  slam down
Another
' You want to play games with me
Who the fuck do you think you are
Okay - - we'll play
You'll be sorry
Dulaney stops the machine
He takes a dramatic pause, letting the words on the tape sink in
Cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration
Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous
(quoting) You'll be sorry
was angry
You're still angry, aren't you
Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson
No -- she asked me about cocaine
suggest it never happened
57 (angrily) You can suggest anything you want
It happened
No further questions
Dr
Paley's temper explodes
He is a loose cannon
may have been infatuated with her - - but  wouldn't perjure myself
That's all Dr
Paley
'  - , streaking along the bedroom windows
light the room
Dulaney and Rebecca are on the bed
She sits on top of him, writhing back and forth -- lost in the rhythm of their love making
- He is asleep, laying on his back -- the sheets pulled up to his waist
outside -- a  of  follows
He stirs and wakes up
Another    illuminates Rebecca, who is standing over him in a sexy silk
Dulaney starts to sit up but something restrains him
He is  to the What the
What are you doing
She sits next to him -- looks at him fondly -- gently strokes his face with her hand
(nervously) Rebecca -- take these off
Tonight we open new doors
58 She slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach -- to his chest
Dulaney follows it with his eyes
Rebecca picks up a on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back and forth over his chest
What are you going you doing
Are you scared
He doesn't answer
He doesn't have to
She can see the fear in his eyes
She tilts the candle -- a stream of  pours out on his chest
Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on the bed, his hands straining against his restraints
She smiles -- a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a thin trail of   that moves down his chest towards his stomach
Dulaney's face cringes
He stares at her through eyes filled with fear
(whispering) love you, Frank
love your strength -- be strong for me now
She continues to pour the wax in little , filling his navel and working her way towards his groin
(pleading) Rebecca -- please
No more
Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly
told you in the beginning that it was my way
My way can be many things -- pleasure or pain
She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn
He tenses as she pours it on his chest
-- then relaxes when he realizes it's water
He breathes a  of relief
You see how life is, Frank
We judge things
We look at things from the outside and assume we know what's on the inside
She takes a sip from the bottle
59 Water
But you assumed it was vinegar -- because you were only looking at the outside
Her meaning isn't lost on Dulaney
She watches him -- as if studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the belt of her
The robe parts revealing the beauty of her body
She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her breasts against him
Dulaney's breathing quickens in excitement
Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach
She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower
he stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion
Soon the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him
His eyes close
The pain that only moments ago filled his body is replaced with pleasure
'  - It's late
Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs comes on
Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting
Late night
Her voice startles Dulaney
Yeah -- what are you doing up
We have to talk
What's wrong
That's what  was hoping you'd tell me
Dulaney enters the living room
Sharon, it's late
Can we get to the point
Where have you been
60 Working
Charlie and  were going over some statements
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you
(beat) You were with her, weren't you
Yes
Why did you lie to me
Because  knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking
Sharon springs off the couch
This isn't a courtroom
Don't try to turn this around on me
'm not
You're sleeping with her, aren't you
No
It's bad enough that you are
It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me
She starts to walks out of the room
Dulaney grabs her by the arm
Sharon
She swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at him angrily, her eyes filled with tears
You bastard
Do you think 'm some kind of idiot
That  don't have fuckin' eyes
see
feel hurt
61 She walks out of the room, leaving Dulaney alone with his thoughts
- is on the stand
She is a   in her thirties -- thin and tired-looking, although we get the impression she once was pretty
She is dressed in what is obviously her Sunday dress
Cardenas questions her
Mrs
Crawford, you were Mr
Marsh's maid for nine years
Yes
Did Miss Lawson and Mr
Marsh ever argue
Like cats and dogs
What did they argue about
You name it -- they argued about it
Mr
Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her
Did they argue the day before he died
Well -- he died on a Sunday and have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon
What was the nature of the argument
Sex
Could you be more specific
62 She was calling Mr
Marsh an old man -- making discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities
She said that she had needs and that if he couldn't fulfill them she'd find someone who could
Dulaney jots down a note
Cardenas continues
Did you ever see Mr
Marsh use cocaine
No -- never
(to Dulaney) Your witness
Cardenas sits down
Dulaney approaches Ester with a smile
Did you go to college, Mrs
Crawford
No
High school
No
Your Honor,  fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case
was just about to make my point, Your Honor
Do it quickly, Mr
Dulaney
(reading from note pad) "Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities
"  Who told you to say that
63 Ester doesn't answer, but her eyes drift past Dulaney and focus on Troxell
Dulaney follows her stare
Did Mr
Troxell help you with that phrase
Troxell and Cardenas squirm a little
heard him say it
Then -- those are not your own words
No
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say
Objection, Your Honor
The fact that Mrs
Crawford heard Mr
Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened
(to Cardenas) 'm just curious to see if Mr
Troxell reconstructed anything else
Your Honor -- please
'll see both of you in my chambers
Right now
'  - Judge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his desk
Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him
64 Mr
Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch
Do you
No, Your Honor
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs
Crawford comes from -- but do
came from a neighborhood just like hers
This is a whole other world for her
She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people
So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible
(beat) Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr
Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics
- Dulaney walks down the steps
Cardenas joins him
'm surprised you can walk after the way Burnham chewed your ass out this afternoon
Cardenas grins
His comment was meant as a friendly jab between old friends
Dulaney doesn't see it that way
(coldly) 've got work to do
Hey -- the bell's sounded
It's between rounds
didn't hear it
65 What's happening to you, Frank
You're acting like you're on trial here
This has become personal to you
Back off, John
Cardenas studies him for a moment
You're sleeping with her, aren't you
Dulaney forces a laugh
It's not a very convincing one
That's ridiculous
'm talking to you as a friend now
Don't ruin your life, your career for her
She'll spit you out when this is over
You don't know what you're talking about
Really
What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning
You've been following me
Her
It's an obvious move
'm building a case against her, remember
Something in Dulaney snaps
He grabs Cardenas and pushes him up against the wall
Cardenas pushes back
If your head wasn't up your ass you would have thought of it too
You're losing perspective
Get out while you can -- before she takes you down with her
66 - Dulaney walks towards his office
Biggs walks quickly down the hall and joins him
've been waiting for you to get back
You got something on the coke
No -- but  got something
Biggs steps into Dulaney's office
Dulaney follows
'  - Biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the couch
Dulaney sits at his desk
During lunch  was watching some of Marsh's home videos
Biggs clicks the control
On the  we see Rebecca on top of Marsh in the bedroom
He was really into recording this stuff
The
's office found a box full of tapes
Watching Rebecca with Marsh bothers Dulaney
This girl has really got some moves, huh
Dulaney stands up and turns off the television
If you want to get your kicks go to a video store and rent a porno movie
Biggs studies Dulaney for a moment
Dulaney's reaction bothers him
He turns the  back on and fast forwards the tape
The screen turns to  where the tape has been recorded over
This tape was recorded over an existing recording
67 Over what
Biggs raises a hand signaling patience
still fills the screen
would have missed it -- but the phone rang and  let it play while talked
It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't
It's been erased without any input signal coming in
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased
It's very good -- because when the 's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it
Why
Because it hasn't all been erased
Biggs looks at the screen
beat
The  dissolves and a picture fades in
The   only about five seconds
We see Rebecca from the back as she straddles Marsh, grinding up and down on the bed -- her hair flowing down her back
Marsh raises his hand
His
She turns her head to the side and as she does we see that it is not Rebecca -- but Joanne Braslow
The Tape clicks off
Dulaney stares at the blank screen
(quoting Joanne) Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that
- Joanne Braslow walks to her  325i
She is about to open the door when Dulaney approaches her
need to speak with you
68 don't think we have anything more to talk about, Mr
Dulaney
She starts to get in the car
You were sleeping with Marsh
She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this
There is now a different quality to her -- an edge
Who told you that
He video taped you
That bastard
thought he was a kind, gentle man
Joanne doesn't appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in her face
Yes,  slept with him but that was a long time ago
You're lying
Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape
It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson
He dumped you for her, didn't he
Joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building
Yes
It must have been horrible
Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you
was jealous
Of course  was hurt
He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with
But didn't kill him
69 Dulaney studies her
(continuing) 'm a practical woman Mr
Dulaney
Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest
As it is 'm out of a job and 'm not in his will
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow
Dulaney walks off
Joanne stares after him
Her face is cold, showing no sign of emotion
- Dulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant
Cardenas stands up
The State calls Jeffery Roston
As soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense, nervous
Dulaney notices it
He checks a list
Your Honor,  don't see a Mr
Roston listed as a prosecution witness
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr
Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago
Judge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach the bench
Your Honor, Mr
Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr
Roston earlier
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago
Alright -- 'm going to allow his testimony
70 But Your Honor-- That's it, Mr
Dulaney
Take a seat
Dulaney walks back to his chair
Rebecca appears genuinely nervous
- Cardenas stands before  a handsome man with salt and pepper hair in his late fifties
Mr
Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson
We were lovers
How long were you together
For about one year
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson
Intense
know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific
It was wild
She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things
tried to satisfy her the best  could, but it was difficult in my condition
What kind of condition are you referring to
had a bad heart
71 There is an   from the crowd
Cardenas waits, giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of Roston's last statement
Dulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded
He tries to control his surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't
He stares ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the testimony
What happened next
had bypass surgery
And how are you now
Fine
The doctors say if  keep taking care of myself  can live to be a very old man
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery
It didn't
Why not
She left me
Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca
The anger and his sense of betrayal show on his face
Why did she say she was leaving
She didn't
She just left
Why do you think she left you
Well --  think that after the operation she realized that
It takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question
He is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Roston's testimony
72 Objection
The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness
Your Honor, Mr
Roston lived with the defendant for many months
feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view
Objection sustained
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving
Objection
The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation
Mr
Cardenas,  suggest you move on to another line of questioning
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could
She called it opening new doors
Can you give the court an example
It was like sex was a game to her
She got off on the control
She always used to tell me it had to be her way
This strikes a chord with Dulaney
73 (continuing) It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is
What would she do that made it hard to resist
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality
Sometimes felt she could read my mind
It was uncanny how she knew exactly what wanted
few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me
She had handcuffed me to the bed
There are a few  from the crowd
Dulaney is thinking about the familiarity of Roston's testimony
Judge Burnham his
The crowd becomes silent
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors
asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen
What did she say
Roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of his life
Mr
Roston  know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did
She said she was going to fuck me like 've never been fucked before
More noise from the Crowd
Judge Burnham is annoyed
He his gavel again
Due to the sensitive nature of this witness' testimony and the inability of the spectators to allow him to complete it,  am clearing the courtroom
Sounds of protest fill the room as the  start to usher out the crowd
74 The gallery is empty
Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas, Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials remain
What did she do next, Mr
Roston
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me
She reached down and put me inside her
My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that
You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her
How deeply you want to please her
(beat) At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built
Every time  got close to an orgasm she would stop
Eventually  started to have trouble breathing
Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster
No matter what  said she wouldn't stop
really thought for a moment  was going to die
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it
couldn't help myself
You get lost inside a women like her
It was like a drug
It was the best sex  ever had
What happened after that
woke up the next morning and she was gone
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson
75 Yes
Who was your primary beneficiary
She was
Thank you
The State rests
Mister Dulaney
Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought
He doesn't appear to hear the question
Mister Dulaney
Dulaney looks at the jury
What he sees isn't good
He thinks for a moment
He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca
We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated
Rebecca says something
Dulaney looks at Roston
beat
Dulaney stands
Mr
Roston, you said it was the best sex you ever had
Is that the best sex with a woman, or a man
Cardenas bolts from his seat
Objection
'll rephrase the question
Mr
Roston isn't it true you are bisexual
Objection
Mr
Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial
Your Honor, 'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was
Judge Burnham thinks for a moment
76 The witness will answer the question
Mr
Roston
Yes
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson
Yes
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover
Yes
And she left shortly after that
pause
Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision
No
We worked things out
It was three weeks later when  told her about the heart surgery that she left
Roston looks around the court room
He is embarrassed, filled with emotion
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her
(very upset) Yes
No further questions
Roston looks at the jury -- their disapproving stares
He is on the verge of tears
77 '  - Rebecca opens the door
tired-looking Dulaney enters
They walk to the couch together in silence
Dulaney sits
Rebecca lifts a  of  out of an ice bucket
What's that for
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court
(suddenly ice cold) Fuck him
He tried to shatter mine
He was only doing what he thought was right
You're too weak, Frank
When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it
If something gets in your way you remove it
Dulaney stares at her
The person he sees has no feelings -- no empathy for anyone
You killed him -- didn't you
knew you were thinking that could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom
You're wrong, Frank
need you to believe that
You don't need anybody
do need you
No matter what you think of me --  didn't do it
78 (beat) could see the looks on the juror's faces
To the men  represent what they can never have
'm a cold, heartless bitch -- and this is their chance for pay-back for every woman that's ever blown them off in a bar
To the old women 'm a vulgar whore and to the young ones  remind them of what they'll never be
It doesn't matter to them that 'm innocent
They've already convicted me
'm dropping the case
(matter of factly) No -- you're not
Rebecca picks up a   from the coffee table and pushes a button
of Dulaney making love to Rebecca fills the screen
It is wild, passionate
he is dumbfounded as he watches
The implications of what this tape could do to him run through his mind
Something in Dulaney snaps
He grabs Rebecca
They struggle, falling down onto the coffee table
The  bottle crashes to the floor
Rebecca rolls off the table to the floor
She sits up and moves away from Dulaney by pushing herself backwards
Dulaney lunges at her
His hand grabbing her ankle
Rebecca kicks -- breaks free -- stands up
Dulaney gets to his feet -- runs after her
He grabs her by the throat and smashes her into the wall
He slaps her across the face
thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth
She smiles
It gets easier, doesn't it
Once you open the door it never closes
Dulaney realizes what he is doing
He stares at her in horror, then walks towards the door
He stops
Goes back to the machine
He pushes the   on the , removes the tape and destroys it
79 've got another copy
How do you think your wife would feel if she saw this -- not to mention your colleagues
Dulaney's temper is near the breaking point again, he strains to control himself
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but  didn't kill Andrew, and 'm not going to prison for something  didn't do
You're a monster
No -- 'm a survivor
' ,   - Dulaney, Sharon and Michael sit at the table eating dinner
There is a tense silence
Although Michael does not know what is going on he can sense the tension
The
'll get it
- Dulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited
'm sorry to barge in -- but figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news
You got something on the Coke
Biggs grins
Do
talked to one of the dealers put the word out to
He's been following the trial pretty closely
He said at one time he wanted to be a lawyer before he became a dealer
80 Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon
Right now
Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years
Dulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't have a clue
Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow
Confusion fills Dulaney's face
- Court is in session
Rebecca looks around the courtroom, trying to get a feel of the ' opinion
Dulaney is not there
She looks at the door anxiously
The rooms waits beat
Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as if she isn't there
- Dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an in his thirties
Dr
Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice
Oriental medicine
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours
Yes
've been seeing her for over a year
Why does she come to you
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps
81 Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps
Yes
What did you prescribe for her
Chinese peony root
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like
It's a white powder that comes in a vial
There is a  from the
Cardenas looks at Troxell
How do you instruct your patients to take it
tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water
previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth
According to your records when did you prescribe the drug
Dr
Wong checks his records
October twenty-seventh
One last question, Doctor
If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine
Yes -- quite easy
82 (to Cardenas) Your witness
Cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this witness
No questions
You may call your next witness
The defense calls Miss Margaret Sellers
Cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her mid twenties approach the stand
Miss Sellers appears a little nervous
Dulaney smiles warmly
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr
Alan Paley
Yes
Where did you meet him
'm a nurse
used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital
Dr
Paley's on staff there
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr
Paley
We dated for about a month last year
Then what happened
realized he wasn't serious
He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so ended it
83 -- And what did Dr
Paley do after you stopped seeing him
He used to call me -- tell me that couldn't just walk out on him
He said that if  didn't come back he'd make my life miserable
Did he make your life miserable
Yes -- he did
How
Cardenas stands again
Objection
May  remind Mr
Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr
Paley
Your Honor, 'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr
Paley's behavior with women
Objection overruled
The witness will answer the question
He'd call me in the middle of the night
Show up at my house and bang on the door
Finally after two weeks went to his office one day to tell him to stop
What did he say
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over
Do you remember his exact words
84 Yes
He said, "If you want to play games, we'll play -- and you'll be sorry
" Another  from the
Cardenas inwardly cringes
What happened next
While  was seeing Dr
Paley mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary
Three days after  spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs
What happened
There was an inquiry
It was his word against mine
They believed him
was fired
'  - Dulaney is at his desk
Biggs enters excited
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting
followed her today to an attorney's office
Joseph Koehler
Joe Koehler
know him
He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney
She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will
Dulaney thinks for a moment
He grins as an idea enters his mind
Not this will
85 - Dulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of papers
Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper
Here it is
According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
What good does that do -- it's the old will
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing
Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it
Pretty slick
' ,  - Dulaney is washing up for dinner
He speaks to Sharon who is in the bedroom
was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael
Sharon leaves the room
Dulaney reaches for his  -- picks up a  of
It is empty
He stares at the (to himself) Drug store
- 86 Dulaney looks worn, tired -- the tension between him and Rebecca shows
Mr
Dulaney, are you ready to call your next witness
Dulaney doesn't seem to hear him
Mr
Dulaney, are you with us
Dulaney snaps out of it
Yes, Your Honor
The defense recalls Joanne Braslow
As Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at Rebecca
It's as if he is trying to make up his mind about her
Joanne takes her seat
Miss Braslow, 'd like to remind you that you are still under oath
How often do you use cocaine
Cardenas shoots out of his seat
Objection, Your Honor
(impatiently) Counsel approach the bench
Dulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench
Mr
Dulaney, 'm getting tired of seeing you this close to me
Judge Burnham looks at Cardenas indicating he will hear his argument now
Whether or not Miss Braslow uses drugs is not an issue here
87 Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr
Marsh died
How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing
can back it up
You better
(to Joanne) Please answer the question
've tried it
You've tried it
Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years
This is clearly embarrassing for her
've been to a few -- yes
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you
(hesitantly) No
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr
Marsh before she came along
Isn't that true
Yes
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr
Marsh's house
Yes
88 Dulaney moves the questions along, quickening their pace, building a rhythm
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you
(breaking down) Yes
--And that Mr
Marsh paid less attention to you
Yes
--and that he changed his will
Yes
She has blurted out the answer before the full implications of the question has dawned on her
Her face reveals her mistake
Cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat
In his previous will Mr
Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out
Why do you think he did that
She talked him into it
She wanted everything
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money
That must have made you pretty angry
Yes
Dulaney picks up a small    and walks towards Joanne
You testified that you returned to Mr
Marsh's house at eleven o'clock the night of his murder
Is that correct
89 Yes
Well - 'm a little confused
(holds up the paper) This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr
Marsh had an account
It's dated the day of the murder
(hands it to her) Is this your signature
(nervously studies it) Yes
There's an item you picked up that's marked
Will you read it
Dristan nasal spray
Would you read for us the time of the purchase
Three fifteen
-- or
You see that's what bothers me
No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house
The police looked
There was only the one bottle
But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr
Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death
How do you think it got there
don't know
90 Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought
(nervously) No
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle
No
Why would  want to kill him
Because you were jealous
Because he cut you out of the will
Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored
fills the room
Members of the  look at Rebecca, they are confused -- doubt fills their minds
The defense rests
'  - Dark
Dulaney is standing by the window, watching the outside
Sharon enters
We can't go on like this, Frank
Dulaney continues to stare out the window
know
Talk to me
He shakes his
Please -- this is ripping us apart
91 (emotionally) can't talk about it now
She senses his pain and moves to him, wrapping her arms around his shoulders
Don't shut me out
Let me in
He turns and faces her
She can see the pain on his face
You wouldn't like what you'd see
You don't know me anymore
don't know me anymore
We can't pretend this isn't happening
Please -- not now
Why didn't you come to me
don't know
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me
It's more involved than that
It was a place to start
You think that's the answer
Sex
Is that what you want
You want me to make love to you
don't want our lives ruined because of this
love you, Frank
want this to work -- but you have to help me
You have to come back from where ever it is you are
92 Dulaney's confusion and emotion begins to surface
She kisses him, softly, gently
Dulaney closes his eyes
He kisses her harder - and harder
His passion builds -- his anger grows
He runs his arm over his desk, brushing everything to the floor
He grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk
He kisses her forcefully, his lips pressed hard against hers
She struggles against him
His hands tear at her blouse
It is rough, angry sex and it frightens Sharon
(screaming) Frank -- stop it
Stop it
Is this what you want -- huh
Is it
She is crying now -- struggling futilely against him
Let me go
Godammit, Frank let go
() (racked with fear) Daddy -- stop it
Dulaney stops and looks
Michael is standing in the doorway, his face filled with fear and incomprehension
Tears streak down his face
Dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him
His face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total effect of his behavior
(softly) Oh -- Jesus
Filled with pain and embarrassment Dulaney runs from the room
,  - falls in sheets
Dulaney sits inside the small structure, huddled against one of the pillars
He is a tragic figure, desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once knew
93 '  -  - continues to fall
Dulaney is standing across the street, staring at the house
He crosses over and is half way to the door when he stops
He starts to leave
The front door opens and Sharon steps out onto the porch
Frank
He turns around slowly
He can't bring himself to look at her
She walks out into the rain
He lifts his head
Tears flow down his face and he cries
When she begins to cry with him he breaks down
(ashamed) 'm sorry
God -- 'm so sorry
He slowly drops to his knees -- holding on to her as if she were a strong tree in a wind-storm
Help me
Please -- help me
- Dulaney sits beside Rebecca
There is tension between them
He does not look at her
Mr
Dulaney
Dulaney stands and walks over to the jury
The Prosecution's case is built on theory -- speculation
Could Rebecca Lawson have done this
Is it possible that she did that
Where are the facts
The evidence
The State has presented two spurned lovers and a jealous secretary
Hardly what would call impartial witnesses
Where is one shred of conclusive, irrefutable evidence
don't see it -- and  don't think you do either
Do you know why
Because there isn't any
94 (beat) What's the issue here
That Rebecca Lawson likes wild sex
No
But the District Attorney is trying to make you think if Rebecca Lawson could stray from the path of normal, accepted sexual behavior, then she could be capable of murder
Did she force Andrew Marsh to make love to her
Did she hold a gun to his head
No
Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and why wouldn't he
She's beautiful, alluring -- the type of woman men dream about
As Dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing arguments to himself
It's human nature
We want what we want -- when we want it
We don't think about the consequences of our actions
When desire fills us we all do things that we know are bad for us
We live for the moment
(beat) Here was an exciting young woman who unlocked doors
Doors that led into a new world
world he entered willingly -- eagerly
He wanted to please her -- and so, he did not tell her of his illness
know it might be difficult for you to understand wanting something so badly that you are willing to risk everything -- but that's what passion does to you
It's a fire -- uncontrollable
It consumes you -- and the only thing you can do is let it burn
Andrew Marsh let it burn
It was his life - - his choice -- and maybe his mistake -- but making love is not a crime
(beat) We all have fires inside us -- secret desires
We guard them --hold them in the cages that we've built
When someone comes along and opens the gate, they rush out and feed blindly on their pleasure
Rebecca Lawson loved Andrew Marsh
She didn't kill him -- if anything did, it was his own passion
95 Dulaney walks back to his table and sits down
Rebecca looks at him warmly
Dulaney does not look at her
Cardenas stands to address the jury
It's true -- we all have fires burning inside us
Rebecca Lawson was very aware of the fire burning inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked those flames -- fanning them until they burned so hot that reason and judgement left him
Is making love a crime
Of course not -- but the question isn't as simple as that
Rebecca Lawson used her seductive qualities to entice Andrew Marsh
She used sex as a catalyst and cocaine as the terminus
The combination of the two provided the conclusion of a premeditated act
(beat) She asked Dr
Paley about cocaine
Her fingerprints were found on the nasal spray bottle that contained the cocaine -- and she was the sole beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will
She planned it from beginning to end
She knew about his heart
She secretly administered cocaine, then used wild and physically demanding sex to induce a heart attack
(beat) Making love is an act of passion between two people to affirm their vows of love
This was not an act of love -- this was an act of greed
This was betrayal
Rebecca Lawson killed Andrew Marsh -- and 'm counting on you to punish her for that crime
,  - Dulaney sits on one side of the room -- Rebecca on the other
The room is quiet -- tense
enters and nods to him
(to man) They're back already
It's only been three hours
96 - Dulaney sits beside Rebecca
In the row behind them is Sattler and Biggs
The  enters
Their faces betray nothing
One by one they file into their seats
Cardenas sits with Troxell -- both of them watching anxiously
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict
The   stands
We have, Your Honor
The  walks over and takes the   from the , then walks over to Judge Burnham and hands it to him
Judge Burnham reads the decision
He hands it back to the Bailiff who takes it to the
She waits nervously for the Court Clerk to read the verdict
he taps his pen against the desk anxiously
He opens the verdict slip and looks at it
He stands slowly
The jury finds the defendant -- not guilty
Relief floods Rebecca's face
Dulaney shows no emotion
Sattler and Biggs shakes hands, then lean forward to congratulate Dulaney
Rebecca turns to Dulaney to hug him -- before she can, Dulaney has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom
- Dulaney walks towards his car with Biggs
There is no sense of victory or elation
What are you gonna do now
97 Take some time off
You think the
's gonna file on Joanne
don't know
Dulaney reaches his car
You did a good job, Charlie
Thanks, Mister
Biggs walks away
Dulaney takes out his keys, opens the door to his car
He is about to get in when he senses someone behind him
He turns around
Joanne steps out from behind a pillar
She stares at Dulaney hatefully
Her hand is inside her purse
That bastard should have left me something
worked for him for six years -- and he goes and gives it all to her
Dulaney looks around the parking lot
He is alone
Joanne is obviously very high on something
Her mind seems to wander, her eyes drift
You take what people say and make it ugly
You make others believe what you want them to
She should have been found guilty
She shouldn't have gotten off
Then you would have gotten your money
Yes
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne
98 Do you think if  did 'd be stupid enough to tell you
Dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse
What do you have in your purse
What do you think 've got
gun
Maybe 'm gonna kill you too
Maybe 'll blow your head off right now
Her hand starts to come out of the purse
Suddenly, Biggs appears, rushing her from behind a pillar
He grabs her hand and pushes her against a car
He pulls her hand from the purse
She is holding a piece of paper
(crying) 'm gonna go to jail
know they're gonna make it look like  did it
They gotta put it on someone
Why'd you come here
(holds up the letter) To show you this
It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler
He wrote it to me the day after  saw him
He's the one who told me  could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail
You didn't know about it before that
No
Dulaney is suddenly very confused
Then why did you go see Mr
Koehler in the first place
Because he called me
Dulaney is stunned
He looks at Biggs with a knowing stare
99 - It is  lightly
Dulaney waits at the door of a nice two story home
It is answered by a heavy-set man in his fifties, Hi, Joe
Frank -- what are you doing here
need to ask you a question
What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow
You know  can't talk about that
'm not asking for names or specifics
just want to know what prompted you to make the call
Sorry
Koehler starts to close the door, Dulaney sticks his foot inside, blocking it
His face is filled with determination
Koehler sees it
Please --  need your help
Koehler thinks for a moment
He can sense Dulaney's need
All  can tell you is  was contacted by an interested party on Miss Braslow's behalf
'  - Dulaney stares through the windshield, straining to see the road through the heavy rain
His
Hello
() Frank -- It's Rebecca
need to see you right away
've got the tape
100 calmness spreads over his face
'll be right there
'  - fills the sky
Dulaney drives up -- finds a   down the street --  gets out of his car and runs to the door
As he  as loud  on overhead
Dulaney waits impatiently
He lifts the , removes the key and opens the door
- The dim glow of a   is the only source of light
Dulaney moves through the room slowly
Rebecca
Two   are on the floor by the couch
Dulaney looks on the coffee table
- is open and on its side
and  lay next to it
pile of   has been dumped out
Several lines of cocaine have been drawn
Dulaney starts to move towards the living room
He is almost at the door when the
We see the tape of Dulaney and Rebecca making love
() Is this what you're looking for, Frank
Dulaney turns around to find Rebecca standing behind him, a remote control in her hand
(distant) You killed him
You killed him -- and  got you off
That's crazy
101 Is it
Joanne Braslow was perfect, wasn't she
You knew we'd see her on the tape and find out about her coke problem
After that, the digging should have been easy -- but we missed the will
You knew we were following her, so you called Koehler and had him contact her
That put us right back on track
All we needed then was to prove that she had an opportunity
The drug store took care of that
She dropped off the stuff and you came back and killed him
Didn't you
She shrugs her shoulders
His frustration clearly amuses her
She grins slightly, almost taunting him
want the tape
Dulaney starts into the living room
've been thinking about that
've decided to give it to you after 've collected the inheritance
You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy
That wasn't the deal
(provoking him) So, sue me
(as cold as ice) Things have changed
think you should go home -- and after you leave see no reason for us to ever have contact again
(growing angrier) 'm not leaving without that tape
Don't push me, Frank
might lose my temper and send it out just for spite
Dulaney loses control
102 You fuckin' bitch
He grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall
Rebecca struggles, but it is little use -- he is a man consumed with rage
Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall
Rebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a   and stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck
Dulaney  and lets go
Rebecca starts to runs into the living room
Dulaney follows
- Dulaney catches Rebecca -- grabs her -- spins her around -- then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground
In the b
g
the  of them in bed plays on the screen
Dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair
He repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor
' Let her go
Dulaney stops
He looks behind him
Standing in the bedroom doorway is Dr
Paley
He is holding a at Dulaney
Dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder
short, breathless  drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it all together
Rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries to catch her breath
(to Rebecca) Are you alright
Rebecca
Her face hardens
You've got to kill him, Alan
What
103 She's right, Paley
You've got to kill me
She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her
You supplied the Coke
You're an accessory to murder
Shoot him
Paley struggles to make a decision
The gun shakes in his hand
Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney
Don't you see what she's doing
She needs you to kill me
She's planned it that way from the start
That's why she phoned me tonight
You called him
No -- he's lying
How's it supposed to work Rebecca
You and Paley celebrate your victory
You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me
(to Paley) After that  figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in
That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court
Don't listen to him
Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me
104 (continuing; to Paley) Here's the good part
The truth dies with me and she turns State's evidence against you
It won't matter what you say
No one will believe your version -- you've already discredited yourself in court
You'll go away forever and she'll have the money all for herself
She's played us both perfectly
Paley is becoming more and more confused
Dulaney moves towards him
Paley lowers the gun slightly
Alan, listen to me
If you don't kill him it's over
Everything we did will be for nothing
Shut up, Rebecca
She's good isn't she
But maybe with you it's the real thing
(points to the screen) 'm sure all those nights she was fuckin' me she was thinking of you
Confusion crowds Paley's mind
'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked
That's enough
mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- 'm sure she didn't enjoy it
(softly) love you, Alan
You have to believe  love you
Kill him
Kill him and we can be together forever
105 That's right, she loves you
Just like she loved Roston and Marsh and me
Don't be a fool
You're nothing to her
The second you pull that trigger she'll turn on you
Betrayal fills Paley's face
His eyes fill with tears
(to Rebecca) loved you
(tense) Alan, don't let him do this
You're everything to me
(she moves closer) Give me the gun
Give me the gun and 'll do it for you
Paley stares at her -- his mind races
Pain fills his face as he fights to make a decision
Suddenly, his face tenses
He starts to raise the gun at Dulaney -- then just as suddenly he turns it on Rebecca and
The bullet hits Rebecca in the chest
The force blows her off her feet
Paley stares at her blankly
He slowly lowers the gun and drops it to the floor, then staggers over to Rebecca
she stares up through glazed, dead eyes
Paley takes her pulse
He breaks down, weeping over her body, his tears signaling to Dulaney that she is dead
'  -  - Police cars are lined up outside, their
'   - Members of the  , along with   go over the area
Dulaney sits on the couch
He looks indifferent -- as if all emotion has been sucked out of him
Troxell is beside him, taking notes
Dulaney looks up
on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room
106 Dulaney follows it with his eyes
Cardenas enters from the bedroom
They lock eyes
Paley's confessed to the whole thing
It's like he's got no will to live now that she's gone
(thinks for a moment) She almost got away with it
Ironic, huh
Do you believe in karma, Frank
Dulaney doesn't answer
Well -- call it what you want
Fate
Destiny
We usually get what we deserve in the end
beat
Dulaney looks at him wearily
Can  go
(to Troxell) You get his statement
Yeah
Then you can go
Dulaney gets up and starts for the door
Cardenas watches him
Frank
Dulaney turns around slowly
Cardenas reaches into his pocket and take out a
found this video in her room
It has your name on it
The two men lock eyes
There is a long silence between them
Dulaney waits for Cardenas' next move
(holding it out) assume it's yours
Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it
hint of a grateful smile shows on his face
He takes the tape
107 Thanks
'  - light  falls
Dulaney walks out and heads towards the street
He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down the street towards his car
