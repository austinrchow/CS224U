1 , a darkly beautiful girl in her early 20's, is smoking furiously on the porch of an
She glances impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell phone
As she exhales,   the rumble of thunder
Irritated, she crams her cell phone into her bag
a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling , an irate patient who is screeching
want my fucking Zippo now
Walter starts yanking at his hair
Walter, that is a behavior
(raking his nails against his forearm) Fuck you
And you are making a choice
Her cell phone rings
(to Walter) Hold on
Hello
God
Don't you get it yet, Waldo
She's making a choice not to give you your lighter because you'll torch the Self-Help library again
'm Walter
Kill anybody recently
Run anybody over with a fucking car
Kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke but gives no signal that she's heard anything
She yanks her cell phone out of her bag as

Yes
Finally
Rosa takes two of Kym's several bags
They are oddly matched
Coach tote, a fake Prada, a Gristedes bag, and a World Wildlife Fund tote bag
You're not letting her get behind the wheel are you
Are you
Walter, you are only responsible for yourself
(To Kym) This is all your stuff
You know you never gave me your cell number
(sotto) It was a mistake
'm lucky didn't get fired
We've discussed this
(She offers her hand) Good luck
Kym doesn't appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand barely
so very, very faintly
Kym's dad,  , a tired, prosperous man in his late 50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps
He is wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy
They hug
Kym talks rapidly over his shoulder
Oh my god
Here you are
thought you were going to abandon me in rehab
It's 12:30
You guys are half an hour late
've been standing here with these lunatics
You look so great
Paul offers his hand to Rosa
Hello

We met last time you came up
(doesn't remember) Of course, of course
Let's go, let's go
Where is everybody
, a handsome woman in her 40's, waves from the car
(loudly) Hey Carol
How are ya
Hello Kym
So where's Rachel
Carol, where's Rachel
Kym slides into the back seat as Paul loads the car
Getting everything ready at the house
There is so much going on at the house  can't tell you
You know your sister's doing all of it herself
(eyeing the rearview mirror as she arranges her bangs) My sister is bending the environment to her will
Really
No wedding planners or anything like that
Just her and Sidney and a lot of their friends
She is so thrilled you're here
Is that everything, sweetheart

Can we go
Is there anyone you want to say goodbye to
God no

2 The station wagon travels through a constantly changing series of environments as they journey out of New York City on their drive to suburban Connecticut
Right away though, Kym lights up a cigarette and Paul and Carol crank their windows
So are all these busy young wedding helpers staying at the house
Because after eight months of constantly revolving cell mates and crazy people
You weren't in a cell, Kym
groups groups
And nobody was crazy, nobody was in a rubber room
was looking forward to a little privacy for once
The only extra person staying at the house is Emma, who's actually been staying in your old room
But she can move,  guess
Rachel and Emma
Oh, great
How relaxing

Nachtmare
Nachtmare
It's a nightmare so bad it's in German
Rachel must be totally freaking out
Is she too tense
She's a wigwam
(right on top of him, rifling through her bag again) Is she eating
Or are all her latent food issues rearing their heads
Is she hoarding Snickers and Cool Whip under the bed like in high school
She never did put that one to sleep
(genuine) don't think that that's a problem for her
No offense, Dad, but you never thought that was a problem for her
'm kidding
It'll be great to see her
Foodies are the worst, though
They never get it together
There were six of them on my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom
They would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of them was a guy
can't wait to see Mom

There are several late model cars parked in the driveway of the ,
Young people crawling everywhere in the midst of  , wrapping garlands and hanging paper lanterns

The atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and friendly
Paul unloads Kym's bags

She doesn't

They stare at her as she runs up the stairs to the second floor We hear
' Can we raise this hem half an inch
' Yeah, yeah
Here, let me just

--                             8 Kym slams open the master bedroom door and finds her older sister, , trying on her wedding dress with the help of her best friend
Radiant and sexy, Rachel glows like an angel in her creamy white and gold sari
Emma has pins in her mouth and a tape measure around her neck
Oh my god, you are just mi-nute
Kymmie
(to Kym) You can't smoke in here-- Rachel and Kym squeal and embrace
Rachel is slightly awkward as Emma frantically tries to keep the billowing fabric from combustion
Ow
have pins all over me
You look great
'm fat
Rehab makes you fat
All the vending machines
Look at you, missy
'd swear to god you were puking again

Kym
Emma
(To Rachel) No seriously, you're so tiny it's like you're Asian
Dad wants us to sleep in the same room so you'll be able to watch me while he's asleep and  won't sneak out of the house and blow dealers and shoot heroin
Dad did not say "blow dealers
" told him 'd just sleep in Ethan's room
Beat
You can always shoot up in the tree house
Kym laughs
little too loud
Kym, 'm not remotely surprised you're starting your drama already, however it's Rachel's wedding and this week it's about her
Emma, you still have your tiny core of rage
What a relief
Kym flops on the bed and gazes adoringly at her sister for a moment
Rachel beams back
So are you an actual shrink yet
Even though you're like twelve years old
Psychology
Not psychiatry
You know the difference, right
() 10
8   :                                                8 You should prescribe something soothing for Emma
Like Vicodin
will have my PhD
in a year and a half
And psychologists don't get prescription pads, right Kym
They do in Guam
Would you please put that out
Emma designed this dress and there's forty-seven yards of it and 'll go up like the Hindenburg
Kym takes a last drag even though she's down to the filter, then flushes the butt down the toilet in the tiny bathroom
(over the flushing toilet) Since when are you a designer, Emma
while
She has this great little boutique in Greenwich
She says things like "you need a fabulous jersey pant
" That's so great
think  heard that
Isn't this your fifth incarnation or something
Weren't you an actress

(right on top of her) ate so much cookie dough and did so many whip-its with Angela Paylin
know
And she confessed to you her secret Elvis Stoyko fantasy spied on you
Oh my god
Elvis Stoyko the figure skater
In her fantasy, she was wearing her hair up and very serious, responsible eyeglasses, because she was a world renowned judge at the Winter Olympics for Men's Figure Skating
And Elvis Stoyko was skating in the finals to "Could It Be Magic" for the gold medal
And just when Barry Manilow is singing "Now/ Now/ Now and hold on fast
" there's this electric connection between them and he stops in the middle of his triple lutz
axel
And he skates over to the judges table, all panting and sweaty, with his spangly Neil Diamond shirt open to the chest
There is silence as he stops in front of her, their eyes lock, and he reaches for her hand
and Angela takes it
To the roar of the crowd and the shock of the Olympic judges

And he gets disqualified but he doesn't care
Where'd she get the skates from
They collapse in laughter
Kym studies her ass in the mirror
should call her right this second
Is she really coming
Who are all these energetic young people decorating the house
She's got everyone she knows pulling elf duty
(squinting at her ass) What about me
What am  doing
Rachel and Emma exchange a look
Hello
Well,  think you'll be assisting on floral detail
want everything all drippy and luxurious and Mom's a little bit tasteful-- --Mom's in charge of flowers
--and  don't want to upset her
(to Kym) And you're such a diplomat

'm like Kofi Annan
In rehab they said  was the maternal hub of my peer group
was always the referee for softball
Rachel snorts
was
was the only one who could convince the methamphetamine freaks that no one was chasing them when they ran around the bases
It's softball
Someone was chasing them
Whatever
They have trust issues in the first place
'm going downstairs to find Olive and get some unconditional love
Kym swans out of the room
Anyway, 'm doing some lighting already got the candles and everything
Rachel and Emma share a look
(') Forget Mom and me and the fucking flowers

Speaking of dawgs, when am  going to meet this fiancee of yours anyway
He went to get stuff with Kieran
They'll be back

She stands there looking around
She takes a moment

the winding corridors are a little spooky, despite the openness and light, it feels haunted up here
looking into her old bedroom, seeing Emma's stuff inside

-- --               12 Paul comes to the bottom of the stairs, yelling up
'm making hot dogs and hungabungas
Who wants what
Rachel and Emma shout back down
It's too hot
don't eat gluten, Paul
What don't you eat
Gluten
Where's Kym
Kym appears, down the back stairway, behind Paul, not shouting
Here
Besides 'm in my dress

Can  see
Paul starts up the stairs
/ No
Okay, okay
Paul has stopped half way up the stairs
He turns to Kym, beams at her
Kymmie, what can  make you
Actually there's a meeting  have to make
And  have to pee in a cup
And register as a general biohazard
'll drive you
(heading downstairs) Just tell me which car  should take
Paul doesn't say anything
Carol floats to Paul's side
Which car
Would you do me a favor, Kymmie
have a license
You wouldn't believe my insurance
And 'm not
that comfortable
Could we figure something else out

Hi

Okay

The meetings are over in the other building

Someone will be right with you
Have a seat
Several people are waiting in chairs
They look at Kym

Kym slams in, frazzled and late
few people look at her as she grabs a folding chair from a stack leaning against the wall and the other chairs slide to the floor with a huge clatter
Only once
My dealer
was really broke
The room breaks up
Kym struggles to rearrange the fallen chairs
She is pissed
Let's see

Paul has been watching for her out the kitchen window while doing dishes
He waves and yells to his wife
Carol, she's here
Where did you think  was
made you a sandwich, sweetheart
Meatloaf
Kym's shoulders slump
Watching from an upstairs window, Rachel observes Kym wheel the bike up the driveway and Paul hurrying from the kitchen to meet her, carrying a meat loaf sandwich and a glass of milk
There is an awkward exchange of items
Paul hugs and mushes Kym and kisses her on the forehead
Rachel opens the window, calls down
Kymberly

Kieran is on a ladder
He is the same   from the meeting
Sidney is completely wrapped, chest to knees, in twinkly white lights and he unspools himself as needed
Rachel arrives with Kym who is holding the aircraft carrier sized meatloaf sandwich that's oozing lettuce and ketchup and the enormous glass of milk
She holds them both like they're suspended in formaldehyde
Emma is working on her tan
No

Oh
thought you said Satan Claus
thought she said Panty Hose
Or Panda Claws
Pandas are endangered

We're having an endangered Panda fleeing for its life for the ice sculpture
Or impaling itself on some bamboo
Kym
This is Sidney Williams, my betrothed
Sidney, meet my sister, Kym
Oh my god
You're black
(To Rachel) Sorry  called him a dawg
That's fine
No biggie
You don't look like a record producer
You're supposed to have a hapless lackey next to you with an umbrella
Usually  do, but Mom's out simonizing my car
Funny, you don't look like Lucifer's Cupbearer

Kym gives Emma a look
Emma smiles sweetly

And this is Best Man Kieran
Kym looks up the ladder at Kieran
Hey
Hi there

23 Kym and Kieran, having  in the cavernous basement
It runs practically the length of the house and there are nooks and caves everywhere
An ancient sofa, riddled with cigarette burns, some futons, dragged down and thrown haphazardly in corners, Unicorn posters hideously and pornographically defaced, and squat jars of ancient household products (Oil of Olay, self tanner) filled with cigarette butts offer proof of years of inhabitation
-- Kym lights up
Well, that was so wrong -- Gee, thanks
No, believe me, that was so lovely, But in the program -- as you know -- and we just heard earlier today in fact -- It is kind of lurid, isn't it
The best man and the maid of honor
furtively slipping off to the coal bin to have it off while the rest of the wedding party labors away at preparations for the big event

Kym examines herself in the mirrors of the private salon
The girls look like jewels against the lush fabrics, pillows and curtains
Rachel sits at a vanity trying on dangling earrings and shakes her head gently, the gems glimmer and sparkle
Isn't the lilac fabulous
You look like a freesia
(to Rachel) love the grey
We're all wearing lilac
(heedless, grabbing the grey fabric) Look at this
love this
It's like a cloud
Emma looks at Rachel
You guys know how  am
never wear lilac
It's good to have a principle
Kym ignores her
You wore a lilac sweater with a cat face on it on the cover of Seventeen Magazine when  was at Fat Camp
Sure, but  got paid for that and was on horse tranquilizers
So why aren't  the Maid of Honor
Why is Emma the Maid of Honor
Because
() 23
24   :                                               24 What does that mean
wasn't entirely sure when you were coming or even if you'd make it
Kym looks sharply at her
wasn't sure if you'd have time for a fitting
Bullshit
It's a sari
You take a bolt of cloth and wrap it around you
Jesus Christ 've been home one day and  can't get a straight answer out of anybody
What are you talking about
'm talking about Dad offering me food every ten seconds
Dad offers Irish Hunger Strikers food every ten seconds
No
He has to know where  am and what 'm doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust issues
That's odd
Shut up
Blow me
Oh, leave Dad alone
() 24
24   :                                               24 'd love to but he won't let me feel him watching me all the time
And Carol and you guys too
know  have nothing better to think about
Everybody's looking at me like 'm the visiting sociopath
What are you people waiting for me to do
Burn the house down
They both look at her
That was a mattress fire and it wasn't even at home
It was on a sleep over
God
should just get tattooed on my forehead for you people
Stop
You're like a harpy
Is being my "Maid of Honor" this important to you
didn't think you gave a shit
Beat
How could you fucking say that to me
Jesus
Emma
What
Emma, would you be horribly offended and hurt if  asked you to step down as
(exaggerated, practically with quote fingers) "Maid of Honor
" Yes

Like she needed one
Is it what you want
For an instant, conflict and pain flicker over Rachel's sweet face
Not really
Fine
The crown is yours, First Runner Up
Thank you, Emma
No, thank you
It's not about you
It's about sisterhood
Hooray for sisterhood
Sisterhood conquers all
And bludgeons all and pillages all and leaves all for dead

Andrew looks foxy in his Abby-selected Armani, but he has the shoulders and knuckles of a heavyweight

Dinner is mostly over
Waiters are discreetly clearing plates, etc
from the table, pouring more drinks
(something like) 've known Sidney most of my life
He personifies many of life's grandest cliches, even as he breathes fresh life into most of them
He has never, ever "ceased to amaze me," and only in the best of ways
The magnitude of his artistry and his business acumen are matters of public record and delight
He's been a great friend "through thick and thin," and sometimes it's gotten very, very thin -- but he "stood by me" at all times, so it is my privilege and honor to stand by him on this profound occasion
-- Emma rises and bangs her glass with her spoon
It shatters
You're paying for that, Emma
Of course
'd like to make a toast to the happy couple because  want to come visit them in Hawaii

Whoops and hollers
Commence embarrassing story
That wasn't it
Rach, do you remember the time was teaching you to drive in the Wagoneer and you sideswiped that taxi driver and knocked off his side mirror
have no memory of that whatsoever
Do you remember trying to outrun him and leading him on a high speed chase across 96th street
Gotta say no

27   :                                               27 Well  would like to share with everyone that Miss Rachel-before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive- out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street to the East river, handily avoiding two guys loading an old lady on a gurney, while at the same time, applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the rearview mirror
Bravos all around
Wait, wait
She actually got the number of one of the
guys and went out with him
Twice
(loudly) Was that the guy with the peroxide hair
Abby, not looking at her daughter, shushes her
Anyway, when the taxi driver finally caught up with us, Rachel talked him down from his Middle Eastern fury in pretend Farsi, and ended up using his radio thing to call his dispatcher and recommend this guy for a commendation
Mahamoud
Such a nice man
We were driving so fast
It was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life
sadly
but  knew that Miss Rachel would make it okay
So here's to you, my dear, dear friend
woman who can drive fast, pick up a paramedic, make up languages and get you home in one piece
Sidney, you are a lucky bastard
Hear hear

'm Shiva the destroyer and your harbinger of doom for the evening
want to thank you all for coming and welcome you even though  haven't seen most of you since my latest stretch in the Big House
Scattered low giggles

During the twenty minutes  was not in the hole for making a shiv out of my toothbrush,  actually did participate in the infamous 12 Step program
12 Steps
Step-ball- change, step-ball-change

Some guests laugh
Sidney grins
Carol, Paul, Rachel, and Abby sit silently
Andrew moves in towards his wife

Everyone is staring at Kym

27   :                                                27 (') So  spent a lot of time calling up people who barely remembered me - who barely remembered anything - and apologizing to them for bouncing a check or passing out in the bathtub and flooding their house, or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were desperately trying to forget
had to call this one girl who was, think, fourteen, but  couldn't talk to her because her Mom took out a restraining order
Kym thinks this is hysterical
Paul does not
(') Anyway,  did a lot of apologizing to people who were practically strangers so  very much want to take this opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, thank you very much, and her adorable, impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials
but also to apologize to my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in matters of the mind, for
Everything
And  really mean that, Rachel
've been a nightmare and you've been a saint
'm so damned glad 'm here with you and Sidney and his family and ours, and  am so happy for you guys,  really am
So,  am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends
Sidney, you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it's most vital ingredients, and it's only member still willing to lend me money

Sidney and Emma share a look
Rachel drops the dictionary on the dining room table
Oh, god
Dad
Kym looks to her father
Carol returns with a tray and a huge watermelon that's been impaled with an enormous kitchen knife
Amends

Offset a disability or frustration by development in another direction
Rachel blinks at her sister
(exaggerated) Yes
You've never said anything to me, that's remotely apologetic
Yet, all of a sudden, at my wedding dinner, in front of everybody, you decide to grace us all with your development

Anyone for some rehab humor
Because 'm really fine with acknowledging my disease
And now watch me be really selfless, and weave a lovely blanket apology to my sister for being a tad out of her loop
" Rachel giggles
Sidney and Kieran, staying out of this, exchange a glance
(chewing) You're so cynical
Dad, since when has she been this cynical
She's making an effort, Rachel
An effort
That's what it was
Because  think she presumes that since everything has always revolved around her disease, everything else is going to revolve around her recovery
That's what think
Rachel
She just got home
Again

Kymmie, your sister's got a lot on her plate

Absolutely, a wedding will take it right out of you, boy
Yeah, it would be so lovely if we could all just
(removing seeds) You people need to purge
You people really should go to Nar-Anon or something
mean it
Oh my lord
Kym, we have gone through Nar-Anon, baby
You know that
(turning her head) You people
You mean the people in this room
Your family
All of you people living in this little world of judgement and paranoia and mistrust
can feel it every second
At the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement it's like the freaking Salem Witch Trials around here might as well be
(pouncing) Don't even start
(standing next to her husband) Nobody can make you feel any way unless you let them, Kym
() 39
30   :                                               30 Thank you Carol, for your inevitable pearl of wisdom, but you people are my family
You people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day
You try living under Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it
What constant monitoring
"'ll drive you
" "Carol, she's back
" "Don't sleep here, sleep there
" "Here
Eat this
" Dad, you're obsessed
Please
That's hardly news
You may not know this
sure you do
the only way to engage Dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name
"Have you heard from Kym
How's Kym
" It resuscitates him
It jars him into the moment
Like an alarm
That's unfair, Rachel
And completely untrue
And she's even worse
"Dad, you're never going to believe this, but lost the car again
" "Dad, you're never going to believe this, but that check you sent me never showed up and my landlord hates me
" "Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare and you're never going to believe this but  need to go to the emergency room and my neighbor's suing me and my checkbook got stolen

The two of you are like a double helix of crises
In the language of psychology one could say you both suffer from acute boundary issues
Rachel
It's nice that you're getting your Ph
-- (she throws up her hands
) --Oh god-- --but don't be patronizing
It's ugly
It doesn't become you
How come she gets to spout off about paternal issues, but god forbid  should even reference the "boundary thing," even though actually know what 'm talking about
(waving her arms) Hello
By the way
'm not in crisis
haven't been in crisis for a year
You just got out of rehab
Why is this so difficult for you people to understand
It's like you're not happy unless 'm in some kind of desperate situation
You have no idea what to do with me unless 'm desperate
God
Why am the only one who's willing to say this stuff
Oh, poor you
You're so much more evolved in your suffering
You know what
Your suffering is not the most important thing in the world to everybody

Paul hugs Rachel and kisses her hair
Sidney and Kieran hug

Hugging all around
Kym is pissed
Paul grabs Kym and Rachel, and hugs both daughters at once
Rachel and Kym's faces are mushed right next to each other
Kym is impatient and stiff in the dreaded double mush
Kym breaks from Paul's vice-like grip

How much pregnant
Did you tell your mother
We told her at dinner
She was so happy-- Wait
Stop
You can't just drop that tectonic bit of information into a completely separate conversation, Rachel
You can't do that
Kym, you're going to have a niece
Or a nephew
Oh, god
Of course 'm happy for you
But you can't tell me when we're talking like this
It's a total set-up

Oh, Rachel darling, and Sidney, couldn't be happier
She wasn't serious, was she
Do either of you want anything sandwich
You must be hungry
There's cold Saagwala and a little Aloo Gobi left over
No thanks, Dad

You're pretty everything

Holy cow

Paul raises the Cautionary Finger in Sidney's direction
Sidney stops with the music
Let me help, it'll be quicker
Now the Cautionary Finger is levelled at Carol
Don't mess with the King
Okay,okay
Hands in the air, Carol leaves the room
Wow
That's it for me too, you guys
Good night everybody
Kieran lays a manly, buddy hug on Sidney
Congratulations, man
Thanks, my friend
Kieran leaves

Paul is beaming like a klieg light

The floor of this entire section of the basement is now covered with all of the carefully arranged mattresses and futons that were stacked down here before
All of Kym's mismatched bags have been moved down here too
There's a little lamp there now as well but it's not on
Only one of the small, cobwebby windows casts a dappled light onto the scene
That was such a set-up
She probably didn't realize she was doing it
Ha
She's such an operator
Now 'm the bad guy again
Or still
They're lucky to have you
Thank you
Otherwise they'd have to pay attention to their own suspicious lives
Nobody actually wants me to actually change, you know
What would they obsess about

On graph paper
He goes all out with the response, my dad
Not unlike this great nation in which we live
Meanwhile an ex-heterosexual ex-boy friend of mine actually rang the door once and tells my mother, "Kym is sitting in her apartment
With the shades drawn
Doing all this heroin and cocaine
And  think she's going to, like, die
" And Mom smiles and says "Thank you" like he was speaking in Sanskrit
You can't actually speak in Sanskrit
Exactly
nodded out into the poached salmon at Dad's wedding two years ago and he told Carol he thought it was jet lag
did that in soup once
It made such a mess

We were having so much fun
We were leaping around in huge piles of leaves

Darling, look, no one's defending any body
Why are you protecting her
don't want her to feel like we don't want her
Sometimes  don't want her
It's my fucking wedding, don't you get it
want my table to be perfect
Paul kisses her on the forehead
Stop it
She's your sister
They look at each other
The screen door swings open as Emma, Carol, Sidney, Kieran, and Norman Sklear carry the lunch plates to the kitchen
Kym follows, carrying the salt shaker
Okay
Dishes
'm going to load the dishwasher
Paul
Paul, listen, 've been thinking about it
did some preliminary sketches, 'd love to show them to you

Hee hee hee
Paul gives him a look
Sidney starts humming ' Sidney, you're a nice young man
You make a lot of money and the world is your oyster
But you don't know shit about loading a dishwasher
Sir, with all due respect, the mantle has passed
Paul takes a moment to size Sidney up then spins on his heel to the dishwasher
-- Sidney has his sleeves up and starts to load
What's the time limit
Two minutes
Are you comfortable with that, sir
could spot you thirty seconds
You young people should all go fuck yourselves
Dad
Ha
You see Paul,  think your problem lies in lid placement

It's passe
Rachel, you're out of the will
Observe
With a flourish, Sidney presents a beautifully stacked dishwasher
Paul pats his shoulder somberly
Clean out this machine please, boy
So  can break out the whup-ass
Screaming all around
Kym jumps up and down with her arms on Rachel's shoulders
Rachel glances at her sister, laughing
/ (delightedly) He's breakin' out the whup ass
Paul is loading the dishwasher like a champ
Carol and Emma are smiling and giggling
Kieran has his eye on the clock
Sidney trash talks from the sidelines
You know one of the early signs of senile dementia is an obsessive need to organize
Rachel, go fetch me my dart gun
find it touching but ultimately sad when the warriors of yesteryear are reluctant to lay down their plastic containers from Zabar's and retire gracefully
Kieran, how's my time

39   :                                                  39 You have twenty-five seconds
need more dishes
You amateur
What
No way
Somebody give me some dishes
Kym yanks open a cupboard and passes a handful of dishes to Paul
He begins to load them
He has a bowl in his hands
We see the bowl is a plastic child's bowl with Engines and Cabooses all over it
Paul turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel
It dawns on Kym that she's handed her father Ethan's bowl
She is stricken
Paul looks to Carol
He seems bewildered
The kitchen falls silent and Carol takes Ethan's bowl and places it in the sink, out of sight
She leads Paul gently out of the kitchen

Sidney follows her
Emma and Norman Sklear step out onto the porch

Got it
Wow
Nurturing and growing things from the soil
Textbook, right
Kym
Can we talk about the candles for a minute
Because -- Yeah, exactly
Candles and rice paper -- all lit up during the ceremony
It's a way of honoring Ethan, Ethan's
spirit, you know
It will look really nice too, mainly
Millions of little candles all over the place, and one huge rice paper candle - representing Ethan - glowing near the couple
That would be you and Sidney
Oh my god, no
Don't
Just don't
That would kill Dad
And Mom
And me

Please, Kym, please please please don't do that

Rachel is intently working on a crossword puzzle
Are you getting a manicure
Rachel silently waggles her fingers
Kym glances back at her magazine to discover one of the stylists standing close by, gazing at her face
Kym does a little double-take
You don't remember me, do you
Kym looks sharply at the stylist, noting his sincere face, the warmth of his eyes

"The Human Mirror: Seeing With a Fresh Perspective" Like Secret Santas of despair

Kym gives him a quizzical look
You drew poodles in the margins know it's supposed to be anonymous and everything, but you were so brave
The way your uncle abused you and your sister, and how it led to your sister's anorexia, and how you stayed up nights when she was down to fifty pounds holding a mirror to her face to make sure she was breathing
'll never forget reading that,  swear to God
Rachel's stylist is removing her foils while Rachel chokes on her Diet Pepsi and it comes out her nose
Kym looks nervous
' (to Rachel) Do you want a tissue
Rachel looks horrified, holding her hand over her nose
(To Kym) found it so profoundly inspirational that you could be there for her during your own incredible ordeal
thank God that you came in here today
never thought 'd ever have the chance to thank you
It was your strength that gave me the courage to confront my own abuse and help me turn my life around
Rachel slams down her magazine and leaves the salon
Kym runs after her

never had anorexia
You sure as hell didn't watch over me while was sleeping and  ' -- (interrupting) --That we know of

She is furious

You don't hate her
Don't tell me what  don't hate hate, hate the lies

She lied to the people who were working with her
Who were trying to help her

Why not

Dad, stop

was on your side
still am
Do you have any idea what that means
Do you have any idea how lonely it was with everybody gone into your terrible world
There was nothing left
Everybody was just empty
You think they remembered  was alive or needed anything during your
life
And after all that loneliness and Mom and Dad blaming each other and worrying and death and divorce and that stupid hopefulness and Dad not even being able to listen to music, you were in the hospital, lying about us
Instead of telling the truth about yourself
God, Rachel
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
What's this all about
Apparently she has a whole history of sexual molestation
What
Kym, what is your sister saying
Did you say you were sexually molested

Not by you
It was a long time ago
Were you
No
Why in god's name would you say something like that
It was anonymous
It seemed like a good idea at the time
The three on the couch are stunned for a moment
Dad, look at me
'm right here
'm telling you that after Ethan died  wanted her to get better or just die
And look
She is better
Nice, Rachel
Thank you
(to Paul) And Dad, she was lying and she didn't give a shit about the rest of us
Recovery can't work if you lie
She knows that
was worthless to her
We all meant nothing to her
You're not worthless
You're my sister
love you guys
need you guys, but you don't get to sit around for the rest of my life deciding what 'm supposed to be like

You were not present for his life
You were high
He was like a pet to you
You drove him off the bridge
And now he's dead

For god's sake Abby

Well, last time you called the police looking for her she was upstairs, asleep in the guest room
She wasn't asleep, she was unconscious
And 'm glad  called the police because it took twenty minutes to wake her up and at least something was being done
Paul, 'm trying to help
You're trying to dismiss everything
She's not a criminal
You're disregarding everything 'm saying, and this failure to listen, failure to understand what is right in front of you is exactly why you will never be able

The wedding guests are slack-jawed
Mrs
Williams (Sidney's mom) looks like she's passing a stone
Abby stands quietly with Andrew in the first row
She looks composed and lovely and has the tiniest hint of a bruise on her chin
The procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns to face Rachel and Paul
Paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side of the house and across the terrace to the living room
She glows in her white and gold Sari
They reach the altar of blossoms
Rachel kisses her dad's cheek and he hugs her
Things are set up so that Rachel and Sidney stand just inside the living room, facing the beautiful backyard
Kym reaches for Rachel's bouquet but Rachel has handed it to Emma by reflex
Kym tries to cover her gesture
Rachel and Sidney join hands
We're here on this beautiful day
Somebody's baby starts to cry

Abby is drying her own eyes
Rachel makes her own declaration to Sidney
Norman Sklear hands Sidney an acoustic guitar and Sidney strums it and plucks a delicate melody
For you

(sings) "She used to work in a diner Never saw a woman look finer used to order just to watch her float across the floor She grew up in a small town Never put her roots down Daddy always kept movin', so she did too
You know it ain't easy You got to hold on She was an unknown legend in her time Now she's dressin' two kids Lookin' for a magic kiss She gets the far-away look in her eyes
Somewhere on a desert highway She rides a Harley-Davidson Her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind She's been runnin' half her life The chrome and steel she rides Collidin' with the very air she breathes The air she breathes
The air she breathes
The guests join in on the last chorus, with spontaneous ad- lib instrumentation from some of the musician friends
The song ends with a huge eruption of laughter and applause

Rachel suddenly stands on a chair and bangs on a glass with a spoon
Friends and family, family and friends

'm the bride and 'm knocked up
Surprised whooping and hollering
'm exercising my bridely, knocked up prerogatives and demand that everybody starts dancing
And this means you too, Mom

Oh yay
Dad c'mon

Look at me, 'm dancing
She drags Paul to the temporary poolside patio dance floor
Paul is a fantastic dancer
Sidney drags his dad to the dance floor
He's dramatic and weird

Rachel and Sidney have changed into awesome party outfits
Inside the tent, yet another group of musician friends are currently laying down an evocative, hypnotic and extremely cool, jazzy "world music" groove as the same attractive and immaculate young servers (from the rehearsal dinner) circulate with trays of delicious appetizers, wine, seltzer, etc
Kym is still wearing her sari
She stands next to her mother
They are doing their wedding party duties
Neither woman is looking at the other

75 The tent is fairly packed now with about 60-
Everybody is getting along fine
With a single dramatic gesture, Norman Sklear silences the band
Upon Norman's instructions, the drummer works his cymbals in such a way that the party-goers realize that something big is about to happen
Norman Sklear now gestures for complete silence and he gets it
Rachel and Emma grin madly at each other
:     , approaching the tent entrance from the moonlit backyard
-- the swimming pool lights shimmering outside as -- -- The musicians blow whistles and bang on drums
The cafe-au-lait beauties gyrate and pull guests out of their chairs
Rachel leaps from her chair into Sidney's arms and he gives her a huge, sexy kiss as he rubs her tummy
Wedding guests scream with delight and rush to the floor
The drummers become more   impassioned with every beat
They travel allover the dance   floor, a trail of guests behind them
Sweat is dripping,   the girls are glistening wet, the guests are pulled into a   massive pulsing heartbeat on the dance floor
Emma, Kayra and Victoria are dancing together screaming until Cousin Joseph, Matt and another male friend muscle their way in
Little kids swing each other around in circles
Rachel and Sidney are practically doing it on the dance floor
Brazilian beauty shimmies over to them, her headdress bobbing, her smile enormous

After a beat Rachel does too, laughing
: Carol stands quietly besides Paul and takes his hand and whispers to him
Though not dancing, they are clearly enjoying the carnival
Paul gives a little shimmy
Abby and Andrew are huddled together at a table, talking intensely
It's like they are blind to the spectacle
Kieran offers his hand to Kym
She leaps up, spilling her flowers
Kieran pulls her to the middle of the crowd
They circle each other
They come together almost violently and dance like there's no tomorrow
Kym's head is thrown back
Shoulders heaving, Kieran swings her around by the waist
:
Emma shimmies wildly with her partner, her hair a mess
Mr
and Mrs
Williams clapping wildly and doing the limbo/hustle/drunken parent dance
Guests stomping and cheering
The brown, glittering dancers are shaking thisclose to the drummers who have their shirts off
dancer rocks with an older gentleman who gulps oxygen from a tank
Rachel and Sidney are bathed in sweat, kissing
Sidney is gulping champagne
Kieran and Kym have their foreheads together and their eyes closed, chests heaving
Carol and Paul watching, laughing

76 The exotic tent looks beautiful out there in the sprawling backyard, reflections of the   shimmering off its sides
The whole backyard is enchanted -- with magically deployed twinkle lights, Japanese lanterns and other special lighting effects adding to the aura
"Rachel Loves Sidney" is being played in a mellow, super- romantic trumpet solo mode now by Christian Scott
An assorted bunch of guests have relocated to the poolside patio in their finery
The oxygen guy and his matronly wife are seated on a transplanted living room couch, talking intently to a be-feathered headdressed Dancer
Norman Sklear and Emma are sharing a stylish, quietly triumphant slow dance, whispering punctuated by gusts of laughter
Angela Paylin is out there too
Little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing with  the Dog
Kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed by anyone
wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the water, supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper
couple of smaller candles surround the slightly larger one
Kym lights the candles, extinguishes the match, gently slides the illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool, watches
Kym rises and walks towards the house, looking for something
(to Kym) can do a handstand
She executes a truly terrible handstand
That sucked
The girl throws a rebellious dance move in Kym's direction
Ouch
The girl laughs and runs off

() 91
77   :                                               77 where she finds Rachel and Sidney slow dancing alone and dreamy in the center of the darkened room, the walls still covered with the ceremonial flowers
single candle flickers nearby
The dancers are oblivious to Kym's presence
(to Rachel) Hi
Where's Mom
Rachel has her head on Sidney's shoulder, her eyes closed
Taking a break
How can you take a break from your own daughter's wedding
Mom doesn't actually participate in things
And anyway, she hasn't even done anything all day
was thinking about getting her a cat
Cats are really annoying
At some point you have to deal with them, right
Or they starve to death and piss on your sheets
It's so nice here
Suddenly Kieran sweeps into the room
You can run but you can't hide
Kym shrieks as Kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her, dipping her to the floor
They careen into Sidney and Rachel
Sidney grabs Rachel and starts molesting her
(totally into it) Stop
Stop you fiend
Rachel and Sidney fall to the floor writhing, sounding way too amorous
Then: () 92

Hello
The ceiling light flicks on overhead and Abby enters the living room
Blinking against the light, Rachel struggles to her feet smoothing her dress
Mom
Here you are
(from the floor) Hello Abby
You're lovely
And 'm not looking up your skirt
Kieran is busting a gut not to laugh
've been looking for you all over the place

Where are you

Andrew pops his head in
They're bringing the car around
All right
You're leaving
Darling, 'm exhausted

Those dancers were so beautiful
But weddings are really for young people

You could make a little scene
And here  am making it
Andrew and are going to Washington in the morning
Why are you going to Washington
It's the mother of all fund raisers at American
thought  mentioned it
We're going to stay on about a week - there are lots of meetings
thought since you two are going away soon
(to Kym) and 'm sure you don't want any grown ups around checking up on you
Will you still be here when get back
Kym doesn't say anything
What about our post-nuptial wedding gossip reconnaissance, Mom
Well, can you come by early
Um
Of course you don't want to do that
It's your wedding night
You don't want to get up early
have to get Andrew organized
He's hopeless
And we'll be back in a bit
It was such a lovely wedding, darling

Rachel wraps one arm around Kym's neck and the other round her mother and hugs them both to her
She has her eyes open
They have their eyes open
They are stiff as boards
Rachel stops hugging and looks from one to the other
Her mom and sister look at her and each other

Will you call me every day about
She pats Rachel's tummy
Yes
Of course
All right, then
Goodbye Abby
Good bye, Son-in-law
Kym and Rachel watch their mother leave the room

Kym sees Abby and Andrew crossing the front porch through the window

Speak of the devil
You remember Susanna Galeano
(she doesn't) Hi
Hi Kym
Kym is looking out the dining room window between Paul and Susanna -- she spots Abby and Andrew walking down the driveway towards the  at the street
Susanna has a public relations firm and she just lost one of her assistants
Weddings
They're an epidemic
Your father gave me my start about a hundred years ago
No, no
Hardly
Well
We could definitely use an extra body right about now
Have you ever thought about Public Relations
The public is kind of afraid of me
Susanna and Paul laugh
The firm is opening an office right here in town, just in time for the holidays
You could stay right here
Have you ever thought about
Kym
Logistically it's just a dream
You could stay in your old room could chauffeur you around
You wouldn't have to worry about rent

78   :                                               78 Have you already talked to Carol about me staying here
Of course
She's fine about it
You could stay in your old room
Why don't you give me a call on Monday, okay
She hands Kym a business card and kisses Paul on the cheek
Goodbye Paul
It was just beautiful
Bye Kym
She leaves
Suzy's first rate
can be fascinating
You always said it was stupid
meant stupid
Do you want me to hold that for you
You've got no pockets
've got it
Thanks, Dad
'll be right back

79 At the edge of the porch Kym sees Abby standing in the moonlight at the front of the driveway with Andrew, waiting for their car
Kym pauses
Abby turns her head slightly in Kym's direction
Kym, in the half dark, watches her mother
Abby does not move a muscle
Kym steps off the porch
The valet pulls up in the car, jumps out

She collects a few snapshots of her sister and brother and stuffs them in her shoulder bag

She is in her underwear, heading for the bathroom
She stops at the sight of Kym
They stare at each other
Emma gives a tiny wave
Kym responds, heads down the stairs

She moves to collect her weird mish-mash of bags waiting by the door
Kieran is there
Oof
You scared me
Making a break for it
Yeah

like noise
was coming to find you
My ride's outside
Okay
If you need anything
If  need to post bond
Kieran hands Kym a folded piece of paper
No
If you ever need anything
Thank you, Kieran
Maybe you'll come visit me in Hawaii
That would be nice
He smiles, kisses her, tenderly
She hugs him fiercely
have to go

Like a ghost, Rachel appears on the porch
Kym jumps a little
The sisters lock eyes
Kym looks pained
Paul is still moving around in there
She wants to go
Rachel floats down the porch stairs and joins her sister at the car

Hi

Rachel nods
