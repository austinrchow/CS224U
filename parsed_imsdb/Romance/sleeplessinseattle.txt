by Jeff Arch Rewritten: Nora Ephron & Delia Ephron May 10, 1992 -------------------------------------------------------------- : card: Chicago
He's in his thirties
His neck is pinched into a crisp dress shirt and tie
His expression is vacant, faraway
breeze blows but he doesn't react to it
In the distance the architecture of the Chicago skyline
Mommy got sick and it happened just like that and there was nothing anybody would do
(continued) And pull back to reveal: -   - Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9
Sam's hand is on his shoulder
As the mourners go past and each takes a turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave -- If we start asking why we'll go crazy
So, rule number one
We don't ask why
: Pretty, blonde, animated
Jeans, a -shirt, a Baltimore Orioles hat
Why
just want to know why
That's my first rule
always ask why
Come on
Tell me
'mon, c'mon, c'mon -- And pull back to reveal: - Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy named
They're carrying packing boxes into the house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago
The same stunning architecture in the b
g
They go up the back wooden staircase to the house
There's no why, Annie
'm just not up for it
never said  was
Is there somebody else
Nope
You don't love me, is that it
Nope
Follow them into: - As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to assemble them
How about
you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way
(agreeably) That's good
: '    - An attractive, thirtyish couple,  and  are stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a months
number of friends and relatives talk quietly in the living room beyond
Sam stands alone by a window that looks into the backyard
We can see a garden of flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife
Five minutes in the microwave
Any one of them, five minutes and done
Ready to eat
Do you know how to make juice
Microwave
Five minutes
: '  - Packing boxes
Seth is moving out
You take the microwave
What am  going to do with a microwave
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time
So you're angry
Big deal
: '  - large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high- rise
Lake Michigan out the window
large space with several architects consulting, drafting, etc
Sam is at his desk, working
An older colleague, , comes over to him
Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind but a little stuffy
Young man, it's none of my business, but maybe you should talk to someone
myself have consulted a professional
used to be up tight
On Sam's face
It's hard to imagine Rob being any more uptight than he is
Sam takes some business cards out of his shirt pocket and reads them off
Hypnotherapy
Shiatu Massage
Loss of Spouse support groups
Single parent discussion nights
Parents without partners
(starts riffling, angry) Partners without parents
People who need people
Guys who go into the woods, beat drums and bond
Get a shrink
Hug a friend
Hug yourself
He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring at him
Quickly they pretend they weren't paying attention
Someone whispers something to a client
(continued) Don't mind him
He's the guy who just lost his wife
(beat) What  really think is we need a change
Good idea
Take a few weeks off, get some sun, take Jonah fishing -- (shaking his head no) real change
New city
Someplace where every time  go around a corner  don't think of Maggie
And hold on Sam for a moment and-- : - Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field
It's a gorgeous day for a game
They high-five each other
(
) Where you going to go
And cut back to: '  - As Sam snaps out of it
was thinking about Seattle
- The Living Section of the paper
Annie is blowing her nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her boss,
Honey, he wasn't right for you
(blowing her nose) know
He wasn't even wrong for you, like cosmically wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting
however long it was
know
(blowing her nose again) She pours Annie a cup of hot water
Annie pulls a teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water
Maybe you should see a shrink
want my money
Go home for the weekend
(after a beat) That's what 'm going to do
'm going to go home
(she thinks about it) quit
Laurie,  quit
'm going back to Baltimore
(she's giddy) How does a blonde do a high- five
She smacks herself in the head
: '  - The  where walkway  crosses with walkway
Coming down walkway  are Sam, Jonah, Suzy, Greg, their son , and several other friends
And coming down walkway  is Annie with Laurie and a couple of  from the paper,  and
They pass each other going in diagonal directions and continue on
We stay with Sam's group: (to Mack) Dad says 'm going to get used to it, but  don't think you can ever get used to a designated hitter
overlap: (to Sam) Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone
Move on
Right
That's what 'm going to do
In a few months, boom, 'll be fine, 'll just grow a new heart
'm sorry -- Sam, she didn't mean -- Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for the Seattle plane
know,  know
(emphatic) Look, it doesn't happen twice
: Annie's group, as they approach the gate for the Baltimore plane
'm going to meet someone, someone nice and stable who wears a hat so he won't catch a cold, and 'm going to marry him and have three children and live happily ever after
mean,  am not cut out for this -- For what
For life as we know it
Just make sure he isn't fat like my Michael or you'll spend your whole life worrying he's going to drop dead
God, you guys are so romantic
Do you know how long romance lasts
(she snaps her fingers) That long
Steven still brings me flowers every Friday and we've been married 10 years
(to Diane) Honey, nobody wants to hear that
(to Annie) Here, darling, have some Tic Tacs
Kissing everyone
Annie starts toward the plane, loaded with stuff
The next time you see me  am going to be incredibly happy
- Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the runway
He notices his father's distractedness, reaches over and takes his hand
Sam comes back into focus
'm your dad
Don't ever forget that
That's rule number two
(beat) It's you and me, kid
- Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the runway
(to herself) guess it's just us
She gulps
'  - The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for instructions
And now they both start to take off
In opposite directions
And we pull back back back back as the planes take off, one flying east, the other flying west
And further and further back as they soar into the air and leave the frame
The night sky
Stars twinkle
And now tilt down to see the United States
It looks like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by Saul Steinberg
light goes on in Baltimore
light goes on in Seattle
They are the only lights on the map
-   - As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with , a tall, handsome man who wears a hat
They're carrying an armful of Christmas presents
They're walking toward the parking lot
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene -- -- who's married to -- Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back -- -- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't -- And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to
Betsy -- -- who is the most competitive woman in the world -- They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and pull out together
- Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park their cars
They get out assembling presents
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the  or the Federal prison system
Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff -- hope he doesn't get out his slides
Am  what they had in mind
They're going to love you
As they start toward the house
: : ' '   - Everybody
Annie has an announcement -- Walter and  are engaged
And the family's at the diner table
Annie's family is a completely normally-looking  family -- only everyone is a little eccentric
Annie's mother , a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman, claps her hands together
Her father , who's at the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss
Annie's brother  and his wife  are at the table, along with cousin  and her husband , who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother
There are about   there, too
That's wonderful, Annie hope it lasts
for years and years
(the competitive one) Do you have a ring
No
Not yet
Oh
Well
How will anyone know
Because you're going to call them all and tell them
Congratulations, Walter
He claps Walter on the back
Walter sneezes
And sneezes again
Are you all right
It's nothing
Nothing
It's probably just the flowers -- We'll move them -- Don't touch them
feel terrible sneezing at a time like this
This is a big moment for me -- (overlapping) He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it -- Bees
'm allergic to bees
Not salmon  hope -- If he eats one tiny piece of a nut -- (cheerfully) My head swells up like a watermelon and  drop dead
It's the same with Harold and bees
Your mother and  had salmon at our wedding, and  really think a wedding without cold salmon -- 'm not allergic to salmon don't think
But you never know
You never know
Oh, honey,  feel terrible, we used up this magnum of champagne we were saving on something else, what did we use it for
Uncle Milton's parole -- Right
And it was delicious
It was, wasn't it, Milton darling -- When are you getting married, Annie
In early June
In the garden
Does it have to be in the garden
What about Harold and bees
We'll spray you
Cold salmon
lovely cucumber salad
Strawberries
'm afraid 'm allergic to strawberries
No strawberries
Annie smiles at Walter
(to Walter) Is that all right with you
(to Lou Gehrig line) Today  consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth
What are you wearing
don't know
wish you would wear my dress
only wore it once, and you'll barely have to do anything to it except take it in in the bust -- have something that might do -- - Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides of cloud formations in Guatemala
In the next room Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas carols
- , one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to burp
- The sound of Christmas carols from below
The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with her mother
They come to a dressmakers dummy with a sheet over it
Barbara removes the sheet
beautiful antique dress
veil sitting on top of the dummy
The Historical Society wanted this and  never would give it to them -- Granny's dress
Oh, Mom
notice these things are back in fashion
Oh, honey
(tears are rolling down her face as she tries the veil on Annie) He's a lovely man, Annie
know
He's wonderful, isn't he
Are his folks nice
You'll love them
We're going down to
tonight to be with them Christmas morning
How did it happen
Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back of the dress and remove it from the dummy
It's silly, really
mean, 'd seen him at the office, obviously 'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and  got his lettuce and tomato on white
(utterly without irony) How amazing
It is, isn't it
You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life
Destiny takes a hand
Oh, please
Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread
How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna
It wasn't a sign
It was a coincidence
Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie steps into it
Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie
was in Atlantic City with my family
Cliff was a waiter
He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier
've probably told you this a million times, but don't care
And then he held my hand
was scared
All sorts of thing were going through my head
But after a while  forgot about them
At one point  looked down, at our hands, and  couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his
And  knew
(hearing it for the first time) What
You know
(she doesn't know, but she doesn't want her mother to know she doesn't know) What
Magic
It was magic
(repeating) Magic
knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter
Walter
It's quite a formal name, isn't it
(lowering her voice) One of the things  truly knew was that your father and  were going to have a wonderful time in the sack  believe you call it -- Mom
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while -- Mom, we already
Well, fine, fine
Fiddle da dee
And how's it working
Like
clockwork
She turns to look in the mirror
The dress doesn't fit at all
It's completely lopsided
One shoulder is higher than the other
The waist is in the wrong spot
The effect is quite comical
So you'll get married in a new dress
It's a sign
(gently) You don't believe in signs
- The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out
They loved you
told you they would love you and they did
love you
love you, Walter
(beat) Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter
Nope
Even when you were young
Nope
Not even when  was young
It's starting to rain
You sure you don't want to drive with me
How will  get back to Baltimore Saturday
(remembering something) Oh God,  forgot my present for your stepmother --  took it inside by accident
'll wait
Don't be silly
'll just be ten minutes behind you
- As Annie drives back toward Washington,
Raining
- Annie driving
Presents on the front seat
She's singing "Sleigh Ride" and doing all the sound effects and clipclops and giddyups
After a moment, she realizes she doesn't know all the words and turns on the radio
' ' Welcome back to "You and Your Emotions
" 'm Dr
Marcia Fieldstone broadcasting across America from the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago where we would have a fantastic view of Santa Claus and his reindeer if there was a -- oops, never mind
Tonight we're talking about wishes and dreams
What's your wishes this Christmas Eve
Maybe the best present you can give yourself is a call to me
The number is -- Give me a break
Annie changes the station
The subject of the evening's medical update is You and Your Spleen and our host -- She flips the dial back the other way
(
) Our caller is from Seattle
Annie changes the station
Coming up, Jingle Bells backwards, sung by the New Jersey Cape Mayettes -- Annie twists the dial back the other way
We hear a 's voice
'  (
) Hello, this is Jonah -- (there's a bleep as Jonah says his last name) Annie's hand lingers on the dial
(
) No last names, Jonah
Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers
How come you're up so late
(
) It's not that late in Seattle
(
) Got me there
What's your Christmas wish, Jonah
(
) It's not for me
It's for my dad
think he needs a new wife
Annie shakes her head
(
) You don't like the one he was now
(
) He doesn't have one now
That's the problem
(
) Where's your mom
(
) She died
Annie closes her eyes for a moment
don't believe this -- - As the car drives along
(
) 'm sorry to hear that, Jonah
(
) 've been pretty sad, but think my dad is worse
- (
) And you're worried about him
(
) 'm worried about him, he's worried about me,  ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like 'm not supposed to know he's there
Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas
They lose their minds and call crackpot doctors on the radio -- (
) Have you talked to your dad about this
(
) No
(
) Why not
(
) It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff
It's like it makes him sadder
(
) You want me to talk to him
Perfect
Sandbag the father
(
) And you crazy
He thinks shows like this are dumb
If you didn't have an 800 number could never get away with this -- (
) Is he home right now
(
) Yeah
(
) Well,  think  can help a little more if  talk to him directly
(
) don't know -- (
) 'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him
(
) Okay, but if  get yelled at, 'm never gonna listen to this show again
(
) Fair enough
'  - Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the houseboat he lives in with Sam
He's got the phone cord coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's standing near the kitchen end of a large living area looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting in a deck chair looking out at the sea
Dad -- What is it
(
) There's somebody on the phone for you
(into phone) His name is Sam
This is completely disgusting
- Sam pokes his head in the back door
He looks much as he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is a little longer
He picks up the phone extension
Hello
(
) Hello, Sam, this is Dr
Marcia Fieldstone on Network America
Sam looks across the room to Jonah
'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling
(
) 'm not selling anything
Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife
(he really didn't get her name) Who is this
(
) (repeating herself) Dr
Marcia Fieldstone of Network America
Jesus, are we on the air
Jonah, for God's sake -- Don't be mad at me, Dad
Sam can see Jonah
He's frightened
Sam immediately feels how upset Jonah is
(
) He feels that since your wife's death you've been very unhappy
He's genuinely worried about you
Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's standing on
(to Jonah) 'm not mad at you
Okay, 'm not mad at you
(
) think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this
Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better
Sam hesitates
Please -- '  - This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind -- (
) All righ
(
) Good
How long ago did your wife die
- It's been about a year and a half
(
) Have you had any relationship since
No
Sam is very uncomfortable about this -- (
) Why not
Look, Doctor,  don't want to be rude, but -- (
) And  don't want to invade your privacy -- - Sure you do
(
) (overlapping) Sure you do -- Annie smiles
Look, we had a tough time at first, but  think 'm holding my own as a dad, and Jonah and will get along fine again as soon as  break his radio
Annie laughs
So does Mr
Fieldstone - Jonah is smiling too
(
) have no doubt that you're a good dad
You can tell a lot from a person's voice
But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud
Tell her how you don't sleep at night
How do you know that
Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally talking to each other on the phone within their own house, but also
can hear you walking around sometimes
At first  thought it was a robber
Go ahead, tell her, Dad
don't think  have to now
Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers
On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench
Look, it's almost Christmas -- (as the two of them sit down together on the bench) kid needs a mother -- He puts an arm around Jonah
- As Annie listens
She's softened considerably
(
) Could it be that you need someone just as much as Jonah does
Yes
Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment
'm losing my mind
- As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop
(
) We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, your response, to the things we've been discussing
The number to call is
What's she talking about
This is where other people get to call in and dump on what you said
We hear the beginning of a commercial
- Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio reverie
She goes to the counter to order some coffee
There's a commercial on the radio
The counter is talking to the customers -- who include a at a booth
, a short-order-cook, is visible through an open window to the kitchen
'll bet he's tall, with a cute butt
'll bet he hasn't shaved in a week
'll bet he stinks
Shut up, Harriet
(to Annie) What'll it be
Coffee, please
Black
To go
Maybe  should hustle myself out to Seattle
Give him a little present for New Year's Eve
You can go there if you want but don't open his refrigerator
They don't cover anything when they put it in the fridge
They just stick it in and leave it there till it walks out by itself
Harriet, ever since you divorced your last husband, you've been no fun
'm looking, and this guy pops my tarts
Come on, Loretta, you're going to have to jump-start this guy
His battery's dead
And look at me
Mister Ever-Ready
Every six minutes, another charge
'm looking for someone sensitive
Come on, nobody wants a guy who's sensitive on the radio
(
) Let's take a call before we get back to Sleepless
Knoxville, Tennessee, you're on
Yes,  would just like to know where  could get this man's address
(to the radio) Honey, get on line
- As Annie gets into her car
,
- Annie driving toward the house where Walter's parents live
(
) Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife
Maybe even more
(
) It's hard to imagine
And cut back and forth between the car and the houseboat
Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap
Sam is stroking the boy's hair
(
) What are you going to do, Sam
don't know
When  met my wife, it was so clear
just knew
Annie is listening now
(
) What was it that made you know
don't think  could really describe it
(
) Why not
And if  could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show
(he laughs to himself) But what the hell
It's not one specific thing
It's more of a feeling
(continued) Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in Washington,
, the motor running
She's hooked now, she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it all
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly
you're home
It's almost like
Magic
Magic
realizing she has just said this
Realizing that it must mean something but not knowing what
'
(
) Well, it's time to wrap up, folks -- appears at the passenger side window, which Annie doesn't notice
She's wiping the tears away with her hand
(
) We hope you'll call again soon
The figure  on the window -- (muffled, outside car) Annie
(
) and let us know how it's going
-- and taps again
Annie
She turns
He's pointing at the locked door
She searches for the button
Finally finds it so that Walter can open the door
'm sorry, Walter
just heard the most amazing thing on the radio
They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's
People call up these shows and you can't believe the stuff they say
It's the end of privacy as we know it, this country is just one big global village with everyone out there going blah blah blah -- As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see a Christmas tree, glittering with lights
: as we pull back to reveal: - As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut from gift to gift: which Jonah loves and which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing to open: which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his neck
-- the kind that's used in schoolrooms that pulls down from a roller
And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind the door and Jonah opens -- - As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam takes his picture
-  (
) Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he made in woodworking class
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing  feel it in my bones -- It's a spice rack
We desperately need a spice rack
Desperately
: - And we desperately need spices
Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper, salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which has room for at least twenty more
Jonah is methodically making pancakes
Dad
About last night
It's never happening again
Right
Right
There's a knock on the door
Then it never happened
Sam goes to answer the door
are standing there
Both are wearing quite a lot of Spandex
One of them is named
It says so on her jacket
The other is
Hi
Hi
Sam
Yes
(looking in and seeing Jonah) You must be Jonah
Jonah nods
(to her friend) See
told you
Sam and Jonah
'm
This is JoBeth
JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks
(continues) We live two piers over, don't we
Number 12, right
We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by
Thanks, but
we've got plans
Well, here's the number
If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call
We also
do babysitting
She winks
JoBeth nods
Sam nods
Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down the dock
Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam
Not
My feelings exactly
- Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy
How many people do you think heard that thing last night
It plays in 50 states
What
Nobody else is going to know it was us
You're right
(after a beat) You better hope so
- - large open newsroom-type space with  at computers
Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned offices and meeting rooms
Inside one of the offices is , the Lifestyle editor of the Sun
She's at a table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and two other colleagues --  and
Wyatt is playing Gameboy
This man sells the greatest soup you've ever eaten, there's a line around the block, and he is,  am not kidding, the meanest man in America
(beat) feel strongly about this, Becky
This is not just about soup
Do it
What else
New Year's Eve
Please don't make me write it
Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy
Wyatt,  do not mean to remind you of your mother, but if you don't put that game away, no for a week
(pushing it to the center of the table) Would someone look this up, don't tell me where
Becky is riffling through some papers on the table, among which are some tearsheets from the Associated Press wire
Listen to this
Phone service in the greater Chicago area was tied up for two hours Christmas Eve because some kid called a phone-in show to get a wife for his father
Two thousand women called in for the number
Jesus
heard it
This kid calls up and says my dad needs a wife and 'm talking to myself in the car saying, this is completely disgusting, you're taking advantage of a child, and then the father gets on and this shrinkette says, do you want to talk about it
And he says no as a matter of fact don't, and  am saying, bravo
Right on
Don't talk to her, it's none of her business -- (she's completely into this story now) -- and then suddenly, for no reason at all, he's talking about how much he loved his wife, and how he just -- (she snaps her fingers) fell in love with her and  am crying
Me
tear is actually rolling down my face
It was like what happens when watch those phone company ads
don't have to see the whole ad,  just have to see the part where the daughter gives her mother a refrigerator with a big red bow on it, have you seen that one
Everyone looks at her
Apparently she's finished
You should write something about this
About what
Whatever it is
(waving the  story) What it is is, there are a lot of desperate women out there looking for love
Especially over a certain age
Annie is looking at them
This isn't what she was talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what she was talking about
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist after the age of 40 than it is to get married -- That is not true
That statistic is not true
It's not true, but it feels true
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true -- Calm down
You brought it up -- (sharply) did not, Wyatt
beat, everyone pauses
Things are a little out of hand
So where were we
New Year's Eve
'll do it, okay
Okay
If someone is a widower, why do they say he was widowed
Why don't they say he was widowered
Everyone looks at her strangely
was jus wondering
- Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying to catch up
What was that about up there
What was what
What's with you
Nothing's with me
- Becky and Annie are having lunch
"Sleepless in Seattle"
That's what she called him on the show
Because he can't sleep
And now 2,000 women want his number
The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick
Actually, he sounded nice
Oh
Oh, really
Now we're getting down to it
Not
She reaches down for her purse
/
- hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle newspaper, and : Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old house that's being renovated
Jonah, who is playing Cameboy, is walking along with him
are active everywhere
Dry wall going up, cabinets being installed, tile being set
One of Sam's partners,  , is walking with him, and  , the on-site supervisor, is waiting for them in an unfinished doorframe
Bob is hefty, older, always eating something dietetic
Jay is younger and always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather
Now she wants a circular stairwell off the den
(to Jonah, in b
g
) Punch me, punch in right here
(points to his stomach; Jonah punches) And she wants the Sub-Zero with the side-by-side doors -- Which means -- The cabinets have to be redone -- They all nod at each other
The woman has been a nightmare
So we thought -- Since you're on the make again -- Sam looks at Jonah -- Great
This is great
The whole town knows
Just out of curiosity, how do you two know
Grace heard it
Grace the dispatcher
Great
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets
Why me
What about Jay
Hey, my plate is full
Well, okay
What's the big deal
If she'll forget the new fireplace, 'll marry her
Just point me in the right direction
Dad,  don't know about this one -- Oh, you're changing your mind -- No, 'm not, but -- What's the matter with this one
Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother
Dad -- Sam cuffs him good-naturedly
We better take the measurements for the new cabinets
He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc
and starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in another area of the site
Bob follows after him
Jay tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into the wall
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around
Does that sound great or what
(whistfully) can't think of the last time was at a party when anything actually happened
Thanks, but 'll pass
It's kind of a big night
don't like to leave Jonah alone
: ( ) - - Jonah watching it
Sam visible in the distance in the kitchen
- As Sam is busy installing the spice rack
He marks the wall, hammers in the nails, etc
(as he starts putting new spices into the rack, in alphabetical order) Does red pepper go under  or (beat) Dad
(absently) What
forgot to mention
Jed called -- Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a
feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah
(looking at the spices) What is marjoram
Does anyone know
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me
beat
Fine
Fine
So  can go
Sure
(almost done with the spices) Looking good
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt
think  know how to have a spice rack
He puts in the last spice
They stand back to admire it
beat
The rack falls off the wall
The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the glass jars of spices break
There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc
all over the floor along with shards of glass
God fucking dammit
Shit
Fuck
Piss
Jonah bursts into tears
(still angry) 'm sorry
(softening) 'm sorry
He picks up Jonah and holds him
'm sorry
'm just -- Stressed
Right
'm sorry, Jonah, 'm sorry
And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down
Sam closes his eyes tight
' And pull back to reveal: - Sam, alone, watching the ball drop
He's got a bag of Doritos and a beer
Can  have half your beer
Sure
It's Maggie
She takes his bottle of beer and pours half of it into a glass
What did  used to say
Here's looking at you
Here's mud in your eye
Here's to us
You used to say here's to us
(he looks at her and his eyes well with tears) Oh babe
miss you so much it hurts
He reaches out for her
She's gone
And we hear the television set now counting down to midnight in New York
: '     - The same television show counting down to midnight
Champagne corks popping, etc
And we see Walter and Annie
Happy New Year, darling
Happy New Year
They start to dance
was thinking,  have to go up to Boston for the convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers
Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend
Walter, 'd love to -- We'll stay at the Plaza -- Go for a walk in Central Park -- Go to the Symphony -- beat
We will
(beat) The Symphony
(beat) Okay
(beat) 'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni
What is it
It's delicious, trust me
Does it have wheat in it
don't think so
They go on dancing
It's one of those parties where everyone looks so happy and so in love
Annie, however, looks thoughtful
- Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward his houseboat
He's carrying a bag of groceries
In the parking lot is a
- Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over his face
with a sack of mail is standing outside the front door of the houseboat
Jonah is signing a receipt for the mail
Look at this, Dad
They're all for you -- Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it
It's addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr
Marcia Fieldstone, Radio Station  in Chicago
He's stunned
As he signs the receipt: If you're having trouble sleeping, you might want to try drinking a glass of water from the other side
thought that was for hiccups
Does it work for hiccups
For hiccups, a spoonful of sugar, you hold it in your mouth for a minute
Really
The mailman starts back toward the mail truck
Sam and Jonah start toward the door
- Sam is in the kitchen making dinner
Jonah is sitting at the table, reading the letters from the stack they found by the door
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address
They called and asked for it
(reading) "Dear Sleepless in Seattle
You are the most attractive man 've ever laid ears on
" Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of rejects, opens another
How did they get our phone number
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air
Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense
(continues, reading) "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: am an "-- (to Sam) What is that
Thank God
Something you don't know
It's a single white female
This is no good
She's looking for someone French
Or Greek
(puzzled, he throws the letter into the reject pile, opens another) "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: live in Tulsa
" Where is that
-- Oklahoma
Do you know where that is
Somewhere in the middle
'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school
am not going to think about it
(beat) Generally speaking  think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here -- She's willing to fly anywhere
As Jonah hands Sam the picture
She looks like my third grade teacher
hated my third grade teacher
Hold it
Wait a minute
She is my third grade teacher
Dad, you're not taking this seriously
This is not how you do it
(referring to the hamburger) You want this on an English muffin or a bun
English muffin
How do you do it
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or -- -- a slice of pizza -- But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what mean
(beat) wonder if it still works this way
It doesn't
They ask you
'm starting to notice that
'  - Annie and Walter are making love
(
) If you get a new wife,  guess you'll have sex with her, huh
(
) What do you think
(
) Will she scratch up your back
(
) What
'  - As Sam puts Jonah to sleep
Jonah is holding his teddy bear while this conversation concludes
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff
When they're having sex
Whose show was this on
Jed's got cables
Go to sleep
He kisses him good-night
Kiss Howard
(he holds out the teddy bear) 'night, Howard
'  - Annie and Walter have just finished making love
Walter falling asleep
Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open
She starts to get out of bed
Puts on a robe
- As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe
She opens the door to the street
- As Annie starts to run down the street
: , And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running down
Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles
Past another sign: Your nerves are shot
And another: Your feet are cold
And another: Will you find love
And another: Before you're cold
And another: Burma Shave
And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running across a map of the United States -- it's a little like the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's like the famous map of the United States by Saul Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one is about Seattle
In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy
They start to wave at her, very slowly
Annie's eyes widen
: '  - Annie in bed, eyes open
Walter fast asleep
She gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did in the dream sequence)
- As Annie comes down the stairs
- She turns the light on
Opens the refrigerator
Closes it
Opens it again
Takes out some milk
Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes, banana
She's about to assemble it when: She sees: She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr
Marcia Fieldstone is on
She sits back down with her corn flakes
(
) Up next, "You and Your Emotions" with Dr
Marcia Fieldstone, clinical psychologist and the best friend you never had
(the teaser continues) '  (
) He says he doesn't love me any more
(
) Why do you want to be with someone who doesn't love you
(
) Every time  come close to orgasm he stops and goes to make himself a sandwich -- (
) Why don't you make him a sandwich beforehand
'  (
) When  met my wife, it was so clear
jus knew
Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice
(
) What was it that made you know
'  (
) don't think  could really describe it
(
) Why not
'  (
) And if  could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show
(he laughs to himself) But what the hell
It's not one specific thing
It's more of a feeling
(continuing) You touch her for the first time, and suddenly
you're home
It's almost like
magic
Annie closes her eyes
(
) We'll be back after this commercial with Dr
Marcia Fieldstone
-   - We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the Peabody Library
Annie gets out of the car
- As Annie strides purposefully across the library and enters: '  '  - Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his desk
We barely has time to look up
think 'm going crazy, Tom
really do
Are you happily married
(completely panicked by the question) What
mean, why did you get married
Was it all fireworks and trumpets and -- (regaining composure) got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married
So we get married
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you
That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously
So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match
don't even know him
But 'm having all these fantasies about a man 've never met, who lives in Seattle
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle
know,  know
do not want to move to Seattle
But what really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing could have done something
What do you think
(Tom opens his mouth to say something, but before anything comes out, Annie fills the void) It's just cold feet, isn't it
Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you
Yes,  did
Thank you, Tom
feel so much better just having blown this off
Any time
- As Annie walks through it and pushes the door to exit
- Sam and Jay walk out of the Arctic Building onto the street
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything -- 'm not asking you to set me up, Jay
That's not what need your help for
want to know what it's like over there
And that's what 'm trying to tell you
What women are looking over, okay
Pecs and a cute butt
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"
Where did  hear that recently
Everywhere
You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute
Who the first babe to say this was  don't know, but it caught on
- Sam and Jay at the counter
Out the window, we can see water
When's the latest time you were out there
(trying to remember) Seventy
eight
Well
Things are different
First, you have to be friends
You have to like each other
Then you neck
This can go on for years
Then you have tests
Then you get to do it with a condom
(beat) The good news is, split the check
don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner
Great
They'll have a parade in your honor
You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine
Tira misu
What's tira misu
You'll find out
What is it
You'll see
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and 'm not going to know what it is
You'll like it
(grimly) This is going to be tougher than  thought
- Sam coming home
- As he enters
It's very quiet
Too quiet
Jonah
No answers
Jonah
He starts to look concerned
Jonah
He goes down the hall to Jonah's room
The door is shut
He opens it
Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape
Earphones on
Next to him is a young girl named Jonah
Jonah takes off the earphones
Hi, Dad
Dad, this is Jessica
It's nice to meet you, Jessica
Dad, this is amazing
If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead
" know
How do you know
Sam shrugs, turns to go back down the hall
Dad, could you close the door
and
(Sam looks back) Hi and goodbye
Sam closes the door to Jonah's room
Hold on Sam
(to himself) Get a life
- As Sam comes downstairs, goes into his office
Closes the door
'    - He goes to the phone
Looks up a number in the phone book
Picks up the phone and dials a number
Hi, Victoria
It's Sam Baldwin,  don't know if you remember me
Oh
Well, great
was wondering if you wanted to have a drink
Friday, say
Dinner
Sure, dinner would be fine
Sure
Dinner
' - Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television, tears pouring down her face
Cary Grant is saying: "Are you in love with him
" Deborah Kerr replies: "'m not now
" She's sitting at the dining room table
dozen pieces of paper litter the table
Annie's been unsuccessfully typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter
Now those were the days when people knew how to be in love
She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right
Becky leans in, refilling the glass
Annie begins to type and sob and look at the
You're a basket case
(as she types) They knew it
Time, distance, nothing could separate them
Because they knew
It was right
It was real
It was
movie
(beat) That's your problem
You don't want to be in love
You want to be in love in a movie
(beat) Read it to me
(reading her letter) "Dear Sleepless and Son
" It sounds like the name of a mattress store -- " am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" -- Becky flops on the couch
And this woman is a writer
That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers
know that
You think  don't know that
" know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way  can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when  heard the two of you on the radio
On the other hand, maybe 'm just losing my mind
" You are
You're losing your mind
What about Walter
'm going to marry Walter just have to get this out of my system
Right
should say something in this about magic
What
don't know
mean, what if never meet him
What if this man is my destiny and  never meet him
Your destiny can be your doom
Look at me and Rick
(typing some more) " want to meet you
" Cary Grant says: "How about the top of the Empire State Building
" "On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day
" Good
Perfect
'll be in New York with Walter,  can squeeze it in
She types in Becky's idea
Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter, smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and into Becky's lap
You want to hear about destiny
If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him,  would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- (she shudders in ecstasy, then pulls herself together) You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet
(nods; after a beat) He lost all the weight
there
That's impossible
guy can't -- Can too
No
Yes
And then you left him
He lost weight there and you left him
Plus he fell in love with a temp
Listen to this,  love this part -- Deborah Kerr says: "It's now or never
" And Cary Grant says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by
" Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories
" Becky and Annie with tears rolling down their faces
Men never get this movie
know
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it
always wondered about that too
As Becky reaches for a Kleenex
' Kleenex being pulled from a box
Sam is giving it to Jonah, who's up
His hair is mated with perspiration
It's okay, it's okay
'm here
beat while Jonah calms down
It was sinking
What was
Our house
There was water coming in all the windows
(calm and definite) You're worried we're going to be all right
We're going to be all right
(Sam gives Jonah a squeeze) remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby
Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song
Bye bye blackbird
Is that what she used to sing
miss her
(beat) What do you think happens to someone after they die
don't know
Like do you believe in heaven
never did
Or the whole idea of an afterlife
But  don't know any more
have these dreams about
your mom
and we have long talks about
about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but tell her anyway
So what is that
It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it
'm starting to forget her
know
But she's here, Jonah
Because  have you
And as long as  have you,  have your Mom
Hold on the two of them as music begins
Bye Bye Blackbird
uh
have a date with someone Friday night
Good
beat
Did  ever tell you about the time  ate a dog biscuit
As Jonah cuddles closer : '  - Annie waves as Becky gets into her car and rides away
Annie turns to her doorway and stops
She can't go back in
She needs to walk and think
She crosses the street into a little neighborhood park
We can see the moon

Flops down in his deck chair
The city lights in the background
Same moon
The
: - Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park
: As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled out of
Annie starts toward him
Make my bed and light the lights 'll arrive late tonight, blackbird, bye bye

Laurie, it's Annie
Fine, 'm fine

'm doing a piece on how people handle bereavement and  understand that you had a caller the other night
know you're not supposed to, but Laurie said you might, and 'll plug the show and everything -- (she winces in anticipation of a rejection, but then her face relaxes) : Annie dialing Sam's telephone number

It's got that kind of grainy quality that things have when they've been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good looks
' / - Annie coming from the street toward a storefront in downtown Baltimore across the street from the courthouse
Next door there's a bailbondsman, there are ambulance- chasing lawyers hanging out on the corner
The sign on the door reads: "No job too small
" "All major credit cards accepted
" And then everything on the sign is translated into Spanish

He has some papers
need to know about him because
he's involved with my sister
Okay
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers
Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids-- No,  know that part -- So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a & -- No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, 've got nice -- sense of humor
'll tell you the truth, heard this guy on a call-in radio show and  might not marry the person  should marry because 've become obsessed with him
Oh
Like Glenn Close in that movie
No
Not remotely

You want a tail

Geraldo is talking to a heavily made-up, sexily-dressed So how long have you been a woman
(husky voice) About two weeks
Sam is coming down the stairs
(to Jonah) Pssst
Jonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to the Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed for his date
Clarise, 'll be back by midnight 'm sure -- Whenever
Sam tosses Jonah a letter
This one's for both of us
(reading from the envelope) Sleepless and Son
(reading the postmark) Baltimore
He starts to open the letter
left the number of the restaurant 'll be at if there's any emergency
Fine
(to Jonah) How do  look
(absently) Great
(looks in mirror) look stupid
look stupid, don't
look like 'm trying too hard
was going to get a haircut but then thought 'd look like  just got a haircut
(checks his teeth, peers up his nose) (reading the letters) This is a good letter, Dad
(checks his fly, looks down at his feet) The heels on these shoes are very large
Why have  never noticed this
The heels on these shoes are grotesque
Her name is Annie
Annie Reed
Now 'm late
Bye
He starts toward the door
Listen to this -- Not now, Jonah -- Just this one part, okay
(reading) " have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as or anyone else can remember, and  guarantee you will not get one past me" Jonah, 'm leaving -- (Sam stops, amazed at Jonah's vehemence; Jonah continues reading) -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever
It's important that you agree with me on that because 'm from Baltimore
"  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest
Sam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the letter
- Dad
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest
It's a sign
Oh, right
Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back into the house
Come here
want to show you something
- As Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is hanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah in front of it
Here is Seattle
(moves his finger across the country) And here is Baltimore
Case closed
(he pulls the map and it snaps back up) She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore
She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day
On top of the Empire State Building
Perfect
We'll be there
Sam goes out the door
Jonah just looks down at his letter, his hopes on hold
Clarise switches the  back to Geraldo

He looks up and spots: walking into the place
She's attractive

After a beat
Hi
Hi
An awkward pause
You look good
You look good yourself
Another pause
thought you were never going to call me
You did
really wanted you to call me, and  thought you were never going to -- You could have called me -- No way
No way  was going to be the first woman you went out with after
(she gestures helplessly) There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after
You are the first woman 'm going out with
Oh
So whatdya say
'll get the check, and 'll call you in eight months
Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically
Oh, you are funny -- We hear a  as the image
: sitting at a table across the room, having just taken the picture of Sam we saw frozen, with a miniature camera
In   we see a progression of later photographs: : - Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc
Annie is walking with Det
Wheedle toward a table you stand at near the clam bar
Tell me he's living in squalor
Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home
He's got a houseboat
hate boats
It sounds nice
Boats
You go out in them
You come back in them
hate them
Houseboats don't go anywhere
Boats
All anyone talks about is the wind
Is it up, is it down
can't live with a man who only talks about the wind
It's not a boat boat
It's really a house
But it's on the water
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle
(beat) It rains nine months of the year in Seattle
hope  don't have to pay for that piece of information
No, that's free
He's an architect
Used to do big high-profile projects
He scaled it all back when his wife died
Now he remodels people's homes
He works in a small firm, makes a good living
He shows her a good picture of him
He's real
She goes to the next shot
Sees a picture of Sam and Victoria in the restaurant, although all we see of Victoria is her back and mane of blond hair
Hold on Annie's face
With its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost identical in design to the Baltimore marketplace
Sam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking around, slightly distracted
figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building -- There she is
As Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of groceries
Why is she bringing that bag
She's going to cook something for us
Hi, Sam
And let me guess -- you must be Jonah
Hi
(back to the subject) He should book now because we can get an excursion fare
Jessica's parents are travel agents and -- Not now, Jonah
- Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked
We can't finish the job
She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked -- know her pretty well
Maybe could call her -- 've already solved it
've hired a hit man
Victoria laughs a little too hard
Oh that is so funny, you are so funny
Sam smiles
Jonah is appalled
Every time she wants to change something, she talks in this little baby voice -- (in a little baby voice) "Couldn't you just move the stairway a teeny tiny bit
"-- Victoria almost dies laughing
Jonah's eyes narrow to slits
Do you like baseball
Yes,  do
In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners
Why don't we all go next week
What about camping
What about it
Do you like it
went camping once
(to Sam) love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed
We ought to start camping again, Dad
Okay, tiger
Time for bed
It's only ten o'clock
(a little edgy) Jonah
Okay
Thank Victoria for dinner
Thanks for dinner
never saw anybody cook potatoes that way
(gracious) 'm glad you liked it
Good night, Jonah
They watch as Jonah pads down the hallway
'  -   -   & They're standing at the rail, talking
- Jonah has snuck downstairs and is peeking out the window at them
Victoria runs her finger down Sam's arm
Jonah is horrified
He dashes over to the phone and begins to dial
'  - sleeping Annie and Walter are startled awake by the ringing of her phone

You've got me listening to this garbage
Go on, turn it on
Who is it
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again
(into phone) Hold on, Becky, 'm going downstairs
She puts the phone on hold and gets out of bed
- As Annie comes in and turns on the radio and picks up the phone
(
) This is a complete disaster wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one -- How am  going to explain this to Walter
(
) Shhh, listen to this -- Annie takes the portable radio and the telephone receiver, opens the broom closet and closes herself inside
(
) Shouldn't your father be the judge of whether she's right or wrong
sneaking glances out at Sam and Victoria as he talks
Victoria puts her arms around Sam's waist and clasps them behind him
Please, please don't make me sick
He's not sane enough to judge anything
She's a ho
, (
) (muffled slightly) My dad's been captured by a ho
Suddenly Sam happens to look over to the window
Jonah ducks down behind the desk before Sam sees him
- Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them
Is he there
(turning back) No
(beat) After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry
He had an uncanny sense of timing
We really shouldn't do anything here anyway
Absolutely
Right
And she moves in to kiss him
Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a kiss
Oh God, it's major
He's kissing her on the lips have to stop this
(muffled) Come on, Jonah -- (
) Do something -- (
) Jonah, you can't butt in here
Yes,  can
He hangs up the phone and
: It's Walter
Miss Scarlett
In the broom closet
With the radio
(to Becky) gotta go
'll see you at work
(she hangs up, turns off radio) Walter, you scared me
Don't ever do that again
- As Sam holds Jonah by the shoulders
Don't ever do that again
thought  saw a black widow spider
Sam looks at Victoria, shrugs
Back to Jonah
What are you doing up
was thirsty
There's a bathroom upstairs
The water tastes better in the kitchen
That's true
Why is that
'   - As she and Walter go upstairs to bed
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her
She was completely hysterical
Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth
That doesn't make any sense
know
It makes no sense at all
Thank God my life is in place
'  - Walter asleep
Annie stares up at the ceiling, wide awake
Thinking
'  - Jonah lying on his pillow, staring up at the ceiling, wide awake
Thinking
' '   - Jessica is reading the letter from Annie
She's sitting at a computer in their travel agency, which is on the entrance level to a charming Seattle townhouse
Jonah sitting there
Write her
You think so
It's
(agreeing) Yeah
(a beat) What's that
Your only hope
- Annie, at her computer, talking to Becky
thought  would look into doing a story about those radio shows
(nods; after a beat) You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it
Definitely
'  - Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox
As Jonah opens the mailbox and drops the letter in, we hear a It's Sam's car
(angry) Get in the car right this minute
Jonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica
'll call you later
Jonah gets in
'  - Did you call that radio station again
No
Everyone at work heard you
just called for a second
Long enough to call Victoria a ho
It's a short word
This is not a joke
Thank God Victoria doesn't know
It would really have hurt her feelings
(really getting into it) If she knew, she'd never forgive me
It would be hopeless for the two of you
- As the car drives off
(
) Don't open your mouth again
Ever
- And pull back to reveal: - As Annie and Walter get out of the car, dressed for a dinner
Couldn't you just do a phone interview
Not for the kind of place want to do
won't be in Chicago that long
When you get back, 'll be gone -- And then 'll see you in New York -- Okay, okay
- 747 accelerates down the runway and blasts into the winter sky
-   - Annie is looking out the window, preoccupied
' This is Captain Foster welcoming you aboard Flight 132 to Seattle
Our flying time today
Do you believe that any lie is a betrayal
That's what Harold Pinter says, but it seems to me it's a very harsh way of drawing the line
Annie turns back to the window, leaving the seatmate, who in any case doesn't speak English, completely mystified
/  - Jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate, watching Sam as Victoria checks in for a flight bound for Minneapolis
(turning to Jonah) Can  bring something back for you
souvenir
(to Sam) Does he like those little snow scenes
(to Jonah) You know -- you shake them up and the snow floats down
Sam looks at Jonah, threateningly
Be nice or else
(extremely polite) Sure
'd really like that
Thank you so much
Well
think they're announcing your flight
Sure enough, passengers are starting to board
He's ten
(he's good at it) He's good at it
read an article about this read the same article
It takes time -- Absolutely
When  come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own
What do you think
Sure
Sure
Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway
As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his finger in his mouth and pretends to gag
(impatiently) Jonah, this isn't fair
You don't know Victoria
hardly know her myself
She is, in fact, a mystery to me
She tosses her hair a lot
Why does she do this
have no idea
Is it a twitch
Does she need a haircut
Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face
These are things that 'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why  am dating her
That is all  am doing
am not marrying her
Can you appreciate the difference
That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit
But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment
Was Mom an adjustment
(complete exasperation) 'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes
What do you think
There's a perfect woman walking around out there
At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us
There's no such thing as a perf -- Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by her looks, her fluidity, her poise
Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit
Sam continues to stare at her
(to himself, referring to Annie) God, she's beautiful
(unaware he's talking about Annie) Victoria
She's okay
Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to lose sight of Annie
Dad,  was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life
(completely distracted) Who is Annie
The one who wrote us
Sam is preoccupied with Annie
She takes a turn that he doesn't expect
He's having trouble keeping up, because he has to wait for Jonah
(continuing) But Jessica says you and Annie never got together in that life, and your hearts are like puzzles with parts out of them and when you get together the puzzle's complete
He's lost Annie in the crowd
She's nowhere in sight
God dammit
beat, then Sam heads off to the exit
Jonah follows
As they walk into the distance -- The reason  know this and you don't is that 'm younger and purer so 'm more in touch with cosmic forces
sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica
- As the shuttle bus drops Annie off at a rental car
As she gets in and starts the car
/
/  - Annie driving through the streets of Seattle, referring continually to a map she has spread out on the passenger seat, trying to navigate her way to the Baldwin houseboat
-- Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the Baldwins' marina
She stops, blocking the driveway to the marina
checking the map
Suddenly she hears a   behind her
She looks into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in their van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into their driveway
Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and speeds away, tires squealing
- Annie's car is parked just outside the rest room
- Annie's in the Ladies' Room, splashing some water on her face
She towels it off and looks into the mirror
(practicing) Hello, Mr
Baldwin
No
Hello, Sam
(sweet) 'm Annie Reed
(dignified) 'm Annie Reed
(sultry) 'm Annie Reed
(matter-of-fact) 'm Annie Reed
She settles on the matter-of-fact reading
heard about you calling Dr
Fieldstone, and well,  just happened to be out here on
: (businesslike) business
: (carefree) vacation
: (losing confidence, ready to pack it in) for no good reason at all
(rallying, businesslike again) business
and  thought 'd drop and
(breezy) say hello
: (earnest) invite you to lunch
: (sexy) take a shower with you
: (embarrassed with all this) shoot myself
- watching
She's at a safe distance, across the street and down some from the marina entrance
She watches it for a moment, then gains courage
She starts to cross the street to enter the dock
- Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat
Nervously
Goes up to the door
Adjusts herself quickly and knocks
No response
Let down, she's just about to walk away when she hears a motor
Annie peeks around the side of Sam's houseboat and spots Sam and Jonah heading out in their dingy
- Annie races back to her car, jumps in and follows the boat along the seashore drive
- As we see Annie driving along the water as Sam and Jonah chug along in the water
- They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken clamshells, like stones, across the surface of the water
They're laughing, pointing, counting out the number of skips, arguing over the merits of each throw
checking them out from a phone booth next to the Snak Shak
: '  -     - They're throwing a football
Jonah catches it and starts to pretend to score a touchdown, dodging and feinting
Sam tackles him and they tumble together on the beach
watching
The purity and innocence of this little scene -- a father and son at play -- is affecting her more than she ever could have imagined
Their filters up to her
Right to her heart
(
) watched him play with his son at the beach
'   - Annie's on the phone with Becky
We cut back and forth between them
(
) Did you talk to him
couldn't do it
How did get here
'  - Becky on the phone in bed
And cut back and forth
You told a lie and got on a plane
That's not what  mean
(beat) 'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him am
Okay
Good
Goodbye
Becky
What
Is this crazy
No
That's the weirdest part about it
Thank you
love you
love you, too
Good night
Annie hangs up the phone
She turns off the light
Moonlight coming through the window
Hold on her
- Annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out
Sam's van pulls into a parking space
Jonah in the front with Sam
They're diagonally across a four-lane street
As they start to get groceries out of the car
Annie watching
This is it
No chickening out this time
She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole thing
It's now or never
Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock
Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and rightness with every step
But she     : who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide -- beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose boys have just come back from the front
Sam and Jonah are overjoyed to see her
Jonah breaks into a run, nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped when he started running
She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street
In shock
The scene in front of her is too horrible to bear
'  - Sam catches up
Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam and hugs them both
,
God, it's wonderful to see you
Where's Greg
He's over at the boat show
He'll be by later
(she looks around) It's so beautiful here
There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the middle of the street
car  blares at her
all she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded
She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees -- coming right at her, horn , tires
Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van bearing down from the opposite direction
She steps back to the middle line
The cab goes into a skid
Annie freezes
Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on
The cab comes  right at the
Annie screams
The cab stops inches from her body
The van in the other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well
responding
He runs from the gate toward the near- accident
getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the sidewalk
Lady, what the hell are you doing
Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond
Stunned, she turns to see Sam on the other side of the street
Their eyes meet
Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw in the airport
Hello
Hello
Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything that's happened, bolts for her car
Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is coming past and he can't cross the street
Annie gets into her car, starts and pulls away
Sam stands there, deflated
-
- (
) How could  have been such an idiot
- Becky's car driving toward Annie's house
You were standing in the middle of the street
'  - You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you
love that dream
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing
But he saw you, right
He said hello
-   &  - As Annie leads the way to her door, from Becky's car
And what did you say
Annie takes the mail from the mailbox on her way to the door
All  could think of to say was hello
: "   " : "
" And pull back to reveal: '    - Becky and Annie looking at the television
It's a sign -- It's a sign 've watched this movie too many times
(beat) 'm so stupid
From the minute listen to that stupid program on the radio, 've been a complete jerk
She starts absently going through the mail, throwing almost all of it away without even opening it
You don't know who she was, Annie -- saw her
She looked just like this -- She shows Becky the photo of Victoria and Sam having dinner
This is a photo of hair
Well, it's the same woman
And he was crazy about her
(looking at one letter) What is this
(beat) This is from Seattle
She opens the letter
Reads it
Looks up at Becky
Becky
So  mailed your letter
(reading the letter) "Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter
It was great
We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are
Sleepless in Seattle
" Made for each other
long beat
It's cute
It's like a little clue
Annie looks at her balefully
(continuing) So he can't write
Big deal
mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble
(with resolve) 'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me
What about the letter
It doesn't mean anything
It was written before  went out there
Before the ho
She puts the letter on an ashtray, takes a match and lights it
They both watch it burn
And pull back to reveal: '  - fire is blazing in the wood-burning stove
Suzy is sitting with her husband Greg and Sam
Jonah is in evidence, curled up on the couch under some blankets, asleep
On the table near the couch is red construction paper for valentines, doilies, magic markers, etc
You saw her in the airport and then here
tried to talk to her
(he shrugs) It was like  knew her
Weird
Well, at least you're out there seeing people again
That's terrific
Well, just one really
How's Jonah taking it
It'll take him a while to come around
month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them  needed a wife -- (charmed) You're kidding -- Now that 'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing
he's not asleep after all
He's been listening all along
He's become obsessed with some woman who wrote me -- Are you serious
She wants to meet me at the top of the Empire State Building
It's a little derivative
What do you mean
"An Affair To Remember
" Did you ever see it
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr
Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer
" Women love this movie
On Jonah, listening
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't
Never mind
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio
got hundreds of letters from women all over the country -- Desperate women -- Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate
How about rapacious and love- starved
No
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist -- It is not -- Right, right
Suzy's irritated
Anyway, Victoria's nice
Would you follow her through an airport
Look,  met somebody
She's good, and capable and smart
We hit it off
We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies
Jonah is devastated by the realization that his dad is serious about Victoria
'  -     - The door to his bedroom opens
Annie walks in
She's wearing a white men's shirt
Hi
Hi
(a beat) So far so good
So
What should we talk about
How insecure we were in high school
Shirley Votypka, the first girl  ever felt up
Health
What about health
Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak
Shhhh -- She unbuttons her shirt
And they kiss
on the kiss
It becomes the silhouette of a man and a woman kissing
: The silhouette of a man and a woman kissing on a red box of Valentine's Day chocolates and now we see: - '  - few quick shot of Valentine's Day in Baltimore: shop windows lined with candy displays of red satin hearts, lacy Valentine cards, red roses in elaborate floral arrangements, old ladies selling chocolates, young ladies selling perfume
red Valentine's envelope is being tossed on a desk, and pull back to reveal: - Annie at work
She looks at the card and opens it
It's from Walter
She smiles
Looks up
There's Becky
You're going to miss the train
No, 'm not
(she starts assembling her things) What are your plans in New York
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night
love the symphony
(cheerfully) hate it
(she stands to go, starts toward the elevator) 'm so happy, Becky
Finally feel happy
This is right
This is real
Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts
(as she steps into elevator) Please don't tell anyone about what happened
"Sleepless in Seattle" is history
- Annie through the train window as the train starts to move out of the station
The map we saw at the beginning of the movie, as the light dims in Baltimore and a light goes on in New York
- Annie steps out of a cab
- Walter opens the door to a beautiful suite
bouquet of flowers sits on the desk
bucket of champagne
Annie throws herself into his arms
Walter sneezes
- And pull back to reveal that it's a shot from "An Affair To Remember
" And pull back to reveal: '  - is watching with his little girlfriend , who's crying
(weeping) This is the best movie 've ever seen in my life
don't get it
You have to go to her, Jonah
You have to find her
Jonah nods
But he isn't sure how he's going to do it
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York
Nobody knows
It changes practically every day
How much money do you have
Eighty dollars
have forty-two
So that would definitely cover taxicabs,  think
But how am  going to get there
' Honey, 'm going out for a few minutes
(sticking her head in the door to the living room) Could you keep an eye on things out front till  get back
Jessica looks over at Jonah
Sure
'  -    - Jessica is working on the computer
She punches Jonah's name into it
Do you want an aisle or a window seat
Window
Do you want a fruit plate
don't know
Do
(shrugs) 'd rather die than eat on an airplane
(beat) 'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything
Jonah nods
Now Jessica takes a ticket form out of the desk and starts to fill it out for Jonah
- ' - - formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in pink light and spotlighted in white
Walter and Annie are among a few other people -- couples mostly -- looking in the windows
Each one a variation on the heart motif
They move to a window -- "Broken Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out of the wound in the middle
' in the Broken Heart window
They're both in their own worlds
Then they both start to speak at once
They stop
Annie looks at Walter
You go
Ever since Christmas, you've been different
Kind of distracted, distant
But feel like you're coming back from wherever you were
am
(she smiles at him) was just
just got think  got nervous
It's normal, right
Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know
What
About forever
No
Well,  did
And you know what think
think that it was almost
too perfect
- ' - As Annie and Walter walk through the jewelry department to the elevator
started to wonder whether we were the human equivalent of two rights making a wrong, you know
Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely good-natured about it
' - Annie and Walter are walking around the floor, followed by a  who is carrying a large white card on which she is noting their selections
It was like kismet but not, if you see what  mean
Walter's brow furrows slightly
(continuing) You have to grow up
You can't have all these adolescent dreams about how exciting your life is going to be -- Walter starting to look puzzled
(continuing) Don't hate me but  love this pattern
You couldn't
do
It's just like my grandmother's china
How many place settings should put down
& Ten
Walter beams at her
Exactly
Eight is too few and twelve is too many
The  writes a "10" on the big sheet of paper
- ' - As Annie and Walter come out of the elevator on the ground floor and  stops for a moment at the Jewelry Repair department, reappears with a little blue Tiffany's box he gives to Annie
Annie opens it
Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring
Walter
It was my mother's
It's so beautiful
It's just what  would have picked out if 'd had every ring in the world to choose from
(as she slips the ring onto her finger) You see what  mean
There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but  am not one of them
(as she starts out the door with Walter behind, thinking about what she has just said) Surprises are highly overrated
As they go out the door to: - As they start down the street and go off into the distance
(continuing) Promise me something, Walter
Promise me you will never have a surprise party for me
Ever
You know what happens, you walk in the door in some horrible sweater you put on that morning, and there are hundreds of people in their best clothes shouting "Surprise
" '  - Sam's got a suitcase on the bed, packing
Jonah is standing in the doorway, watching
He goes to his desk looking for something but can't find it
He tries a few drawers
Have you seen my wallet
It might be in the kitchen
Sam doesn't remember leaving it in the kitchen
'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here
You'll have a swell time
You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, 'll never know
Are you going with her
Yes
Jonah walks out of Sam's bedroom and we hear the door to his bedroom slam shut
Starting to boil
He walks into -- - And open the door to Jonah's room
'  - have to have a life
have to do things that  want with people my own age
It's none of your business who  am going out with
don't give a good goddam if you're angry -- (holding up Annie's letter) This is the one  like
Sam starts back to his bedroom
'  - don't care who you like
It's who  like
But the truth is you're never going to like anyone because it isn't your mother
Sam throws a pair of socks into the suitcase
(yelling) Fine
won't say anything
You can marry Count Dracula
Thank you, Jonah
But the point is,  am not asking permission
(yelling) What's wrong with Annie
(emphasizing every word) Shut up
Jonah appears at the doorway
Shut up
Shut up
Mom never did that
Mom never said shut up to me
Mom never yelled at me
This conversation is finished
You said we could go to New York
Did not
Did too
can't know what  said, but we're not going
(crossing his arms across his chest) 'm not leaving this room until you say yes
Get out
No
Goddammit,  am sick of this -- Sam picks Jonah up and carries him kicking and screaming into: - and into: '  - Put me down
hate you, hate you -- He throws Jonah on the bed
Jonah in tears
'm sick of this phony melodramatic bullshit
'm sick of it
He leaves the room and slams the door
- Jonah weeping as Sam goes back to his bedroom
'  - The sound of Jonah weeping
Sam sits down on the bed, wiped out
Hold on him
- As Clarise the babysitter arrives at the houseboat
- Sam and Clarise in the hallway outside Jonah's door
Jonah
Clarise is here, okay
And 'm leaving
No response
Jonah
(to Clarise) He's probably still asleep
He opens the door gently to the room
Jonah's gone
: Sam looks in the bathroom: no Jonah
In the main cabin
The back deck
Out onto the docks
Looking all up and down
Clarise coming down the deck -- she's apparently been looking in the neighborhood
As she shakes her head no, Sam goes to the bicycle shed
Jonah's bike still there
Sam stands on the deck

The sign in front rotates from "Airport" back to "Marina

He just stands there a beat, looking around
Then he goes through the glass doors

Next
Jonah steps forward, with his ticket
'  - Jessica is sitting defiantly in a chair in the middle of the living room
She is being interrogated but she is not going to talk
There's a clock on the mantel
Sam is in the room with Jessica's mother and father
' Jessica, this is not acceptable
' If you don't tell us right now, right this minute, 'm going to kill you
Jessica rolls her eyes
She looks over the clock on the mantel
As it ticks to 8:30: He's on his way to New York
' What
How
(the child of travel agents) United 597
Jessica's mother and father are horrified
' Jessica
When does it leave
' Eight-thirty
Everyone looks over at the clock
It says 8:31
Jessica smiles

/  - As his car takes the airport exit
- stewardess bends affectionately over Jonah, ensconced in the first-class section
He's got his backpack on his lap and he's holding it
Here you go
here's a nice pin for you, for flying with us
(completely unmoved, but polite) Thank you
You're welcome
Can  take that for you
(clutching it even tighter) No
-   - at the reservations desk
Desperation
(frantic) He's about this high, 90 pounds, never combs his hair, Mariner's hat -- (to his colleagues) Anyone check in a unaccompanied minor on the New York flight
did
Sam closes his eyes
'll kill him

We can get you on a flight to Chicago and you can change planes -- Starting to punch information into the computer
How will you be paying for this

- As Jonah comes out of the plane from Seattle and looks up to see which way to go
He looks very small
Big New York passengers in a hurry whiz by with their carryons dangerously flying at their sides

Annie sits down, looks at the view
Walter starts to sit, revealing a spectacular view of the directly behind him

Is something wrong

Beautiful view, isn't it
Walter, there's something have to tell you -- - As Sam rushes out of the terminal

Sam bolts to the head of the line and muscles his way into the cab

And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in: - Jonah is looking through the viewfinder
He turns around, forlorn
He takes off his backpack and is about to sit down next to it when Sam bolts into the observation deck
Jonah leaps into his arms
You're my family
You're all 've got
What if something happened to you
Sam's eyes well up
Jonah starts to cry
What if  couldn't get to you
was scared of what you were gonna do
When  found you
If  didn't go
Listen, have  ever done anything really stupid
No
mean, so far, have  screwed it up for you
No
The two of them hold each other tight
After a beat: can't believe you flew first class
It was all they had
- Annie and Walter
There's champagne in their glasses, but neither of them has drunk a drop
don't know what to say about it, Walter
It was a form of temporary insanity
But  had to tell you about it because -- (matter-of-fact) -- it was a betrayal
Yes
But it wasn't really
It was just
So what happened
told you
Nothing -- At the top of the Empire State Building -- 'm not at the top of the Empire State Building
'm here
Not really
(beat) Look, Annie,  love you
Let's leave that out of it
don't want to be someone you're settling for
don't want to be someone anyone settles for
(beat) have a life insurance policy, 'm fully invested in growth stocks,  have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office,  have no sexual diseases,  have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft,  have expectation in the way of inherited wealth,  dress nicely,  am a member of the private sector, an independent voter,  don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that  am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool
There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring
If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it
Annie is nodding
She wipes a tear from her face
Oh, Walter
don't deserve you
think that's what 'm saying
Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off her finger and hands it to Walter
No bitterness here
Both of them trying to be gentle with each other
You okay
Yes
(beat) Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony
This breaks the tension
Both of them smiles
Oh
What
Look
Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie sees: : huge pink and white heart
Walter turns back to Annie
Go for it
And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt
: 50TH  - As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab
As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave
- The lights are on all over the city
The crowd has thinned out considerably
Jonah and Sam are among the last people left
They gaze out at the twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky
Last call
Closing time
Jonah looks at Sam
This is pretty dumb, wasn't it
Sam shrugs
Big deal
After a beat
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back
Okay
What do you mean, okay
Wouldn't you like a dog
Sure
Sam puts his arm around him, they start toward the elevator
Let's go home
- Annie's cab stuck in traffic
As Annie gets out of the cab
She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State Building
- Annie sprints in and over to Information Booth
Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators are closed
(out of breath) No
Please
really need to get up there
We're closing up
No more runs tonight
Annie takes a deep breath
She's hit the end of the road
She turns to go but then turns back
(out of breath) Listen, can  just take a look
Maybe
maybe
There's someone  was supposed to meet
He's probably not there, but if  don't at least look 'll always wonder about it
The Information Booth Person looks at her
Cary Grant, right
You know that movie
One of my wife's favorites
After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very empty platform
Sorry, ma'am
Empty
Annie slowly walks out
Can  take a minute
Go ahead
She sighs
Heads for the telescopes
Looks out at the twinkling lights below
She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees something on the floor
Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack
She picks it up
She realizes that it might be
could be
and opens it
Inside is a toothbrush and Jonah's teddy bear
As she takes out the bear the other elevator
Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator
left it near the
And they stop
There she is
There they are
Sam can't believe it
It's the mystery woman
It's you
It's me
The one in the street chased after you
Are you Annie
Yes
(confused) You're Annie too
She smiles awkwardly
(indicating the backpack) Is this yours
Jonah walks over to her
He puts his hand out
She shakes it solemnly
'm Jonah
(nodding back to Sam) That's my dad
His name is Sam
Hi, Jonah
Sam
(indicating the teddy bear) And who is this
Howard
Howard
Sam nods
Smiling
Starting to put it all together
Annie smiles
Still nervous
No one knows what to do next
Just then, one of the elevator operators We better go
Annie nods
Sam holds out his hand
Shall we
Annie slips her hand into his
It feels comfortable, natural, right
Sam
He looks at her
It's nice to meet you
On Annie
On Sam
On Jonah
He makes a triumphant little double-fist gesture to himself as the elevator doors close
- from above, all lit up, a romantic confection, the world's largest Valentine
The    and we see the United States spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere
