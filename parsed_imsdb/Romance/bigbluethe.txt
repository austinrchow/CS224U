href <b>// --> </b> by Luc Besson Bob Garland Marylin Golden "God is at the bottom of the sea and dive to find him
" Enzo Maiorca : - : The image is in black and white
The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant shadows on the sea
little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe -- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to another with amazing agility
In one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag
In the other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and sweater
The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit -- obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big
He tugs on them as he goes, holding them up
Until they slide again
as he leaps again
and pulls them up
The little boy is
End credits
- reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove
He spits in his mask
expertly spreads the spit with a finger
locks his feet into the flippers
and dives
He surfaces a long way out
adjusts his mask
and swims away from shore
The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if we've never seen this before
His gaze is glued to the ocean floor
Clear clear water
40 feet deep
And intensely blue
Suddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the blue
touches bottom
Clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down
Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet under
he opens the plastic bag
huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him
The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head
The boy smiles at him
Pulls a piece of raw meat out of his bag and holds it out
The eel takes the morsel delicately -- and slithers back into his hole
Gravely,  takes another morsel out of the bag
- walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost dry now
Two boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch up with him and gesture toward the port
Jacques
Come quick
- The little boys tug  to the end of the pier and point to something in the water
Look
Right there
It's shining
walks over, and sure enough sees something shining a few feet down in the water
(squinting) coin
found it
Liar
Camera pans and we see a middle-aged  loading supplies into a small boat
He stops to watch the children's negotiations
Little  is putting his flippers on
Ok
'll get it, but no fighting, all right
The two boys nod as they point to the coin
We'll split it
You can't split a coin
That's stupid
He's right
You're stupid
The pope smiles
Then we'll buy something and split that
helicopter
It's a small coin
Ferrari
don't want a Ferrari
What is it
(interrupting them) Maybe a little radio
The two boys look at each other
Well
We'll decide later
The light is going
get the radio from after school, until midnight
Since when do you stay up until midnight
All right, all right
Can concentrate
And you can stop pointing
've seen it
(
) 've seen it too
The voice is '
Another young boy wearing little round glasses
(annoyed) Shit, it's the Italian
He is slightly older than  but he is taller is with , his younger brother, the only one allowed to carry his flippers
Five kids are behind him
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman
How is the little Frenchman
(cool) Fine
pats  on the shoulder and leaves his hand there -- a lightly intimidating gesture
You don't mind if  go instead, do you
(intimidated, and pretending not to be) No
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you
pats his shoulder reassuringly
(to his brother) Roberto, mio palmo
who has already started to moisten his big brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping flippers and a glistening mask
The pope watches the scene with obvious pleasure
(to his brother on the edge of the pier) Count
Sure of himself,  takes a deep breath and dives in the water
counts out loud
1
2
3
The kids all walk over to the edge of the pier
few feet away,  takes off his flippers
4
5
6
bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand
The children cheer and clap
rushes to catch the equipment that comes flying at him, piece by piece
walks over to
(showing him the coin) Who's is it now
You saw it but dove for it
doesn't answer
smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket
He pulls it out again and waves it under ' nose
(without turning around) Roberto
How long
Six seconds
looks at  for a while
'll throw it back into the water
You dive and if you do less than six, it's yours
doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his head, negatively
smiles, taps him on the shoulder
Brava
The first boy finally sums up his courage to speak
(timidly) Enzo
saw the coin first
We split
(smiling) You can't split a coin, stupid
laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves the pier with his gang
The pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket
With his flippers dangling from one hand,  sadly stares out at the sea
The pope calls him over
Jacques
Come, look
goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the faint gleam of the coin underwater
Is it a coin shining down there
(overjoyed) It is
It's a coin
'll get it for you, Father
It'll be for the poor
, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on his fins, prepares his mask
He swims in the water like a fish, goes directly to the coin
Scoops it up, brings it to the surface
He breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and sees he is no longer there
Padre
He looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- "Boy on a Dolphin"
: - He's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel
He senses something behind him and turns around
He sees a dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically
It seems to be watching him
The surprise is such that is in a panic, leaps up to the surface
- He bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream
-  '  - , around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows and throws open the shutters with a bang
Sunlight pours in
He walks over to ' bed in the one room house, and runs his hand through his hair
(with a smile) Come on, time to get up, Jacques
rubs his eyes
His father walks over to a pile of blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room
He gives the pile a kick
(screaming at the top of his lungs) Louis, wake up
He uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl of soup for Jacques
fifty year old man pokes his head out from under the pile of blankets
It's  , who is having a very hard time, waking up
- bursts out of the house, running
Diving gear under his arm
piece of buttered bread in his mouth
He catches up with his father and
They're on a path winding down to the port
slows down abruptly
Tries to imitate their stride
The weather is balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue
- Their boat on the water
The chug of its off the cliffs
few gulls -- drawn by the sound -- skim the waves of its wake
- On board
' Father checks the antique air pump
polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's suit
At the foot of an old monastery another boat passes
The Priest is in it
' Father and  take off their caps takes the gold coin out of his pocket
The pope nods to
His father looks over at him without understanding
The child quickly puts the coin back in his pocket
- casts anchor
few feet away, siting on a rock, the kid with little round glasses is fishing
He turns around to the boat
smiles and waves at him
waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing session
Jacques, come help me
helps his father into the diver's suit
The burly man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes
He seems sluggish and tired
watches worriedly
He has a weird feeling
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques
His father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck
(winks at him) Don't worry
When 'm tired down there, the mermaids help me out
Father and son smile at each other
Then his father puts the helmet on
joins  at the pump
The heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater
The gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of sight
and  work the pump
Regular, steady motions to maintain the flow of air
(to Jacques) Hey
Have you ever seen a mermaid
No
They keep on pumping for a while, then
've seen them
goes on
doesn't budge
Don't you want to know where
looks at the bottom to watch his father
He doesn't answer
- ' He moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit
He is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor
He sees a sponge, hooks it; puts it in a bag that's attached to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist
He moves on
- They keep up the rhythm
Sitting on a rock at a distance, watches them
is bored stiff
Why don't you ask me
What
Where  saw the mermaids
Why don't you ever ask any question
'm always the one asking the question
We're sitting here like two stones and 'm taking to myself
Ask me something, Goddamnit
calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping and almost serenely asks him: (in a completely flat tone) Why did my mother leave
seems disturbed by the question
beat
(ill at ease) Come on now, pump
- ' He is walking with difficulty at the bottom
His bag is full of sponges
He seems to be having trouble breathing
- and  are pumping silently
feels obliged to answer ' question
finally breaks the silence and explains: Your mother didn't leave
She went back to America, that's all
It's her home
She's allergic to this Island
She likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor
so one day she left
Woman are like that, unpredictable, like the sea
They haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing at the surface
The air hose is being pulled down in a very worrisome way
(with a slight grin) So where did you see mermaids
smiles
In the bars in Athens
Very pleased with himself,   burst out laughing
shyly shrugs his shoulders
The air hose is suddenly yanked down
immediately sees all the bubbles
He is white as a sheet
rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling down at his father
He grabs the life line and starts pulling at it hysterically
The air hose snaps and starts flying around like some crazy snake
tries to jump overboard
catches hold of his foot at the last second
is slapping the water with his hands, trying to go down but   won't let him
is yelling desperately
is now standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified
The sea now looks as if it were boiling
grabs hold of  and hugs him in his arms
Standing on his rock,  is now crying desperately
(screaming) Jacques
Jacques
The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it looks as if they will never stop
: - The image is now in color
rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which fills the screen
:  1987 runs (skips) up the cobbled street as fast as he can go, surprisingly fast
He runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he enters
We have time to read the sign carrying the restaurant's name:  " "
- skips in
He is panting, covered in sweat
His panic is palpable
The whole room watches him approach a long table where a large family is having a birthday party for a very old lady
He has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can get the words out
Then leans over and whispers in the ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull, wearing little round glasses
The man listens, then stiffens
-   - beat-up , towing an equally beat-up trailer, stops
unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clown emerging from a toy car
The construction , an American, wearing a three piece suit, hurries over to him
has already started undressing
unloads the diving gear from the trailer
(exhausted) Signore Molinari
(shaking his hand) Yes
(calmly undressing, expressionless) How did it happen
(upset) The company asked me to extract everything  could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine
and then the boat turned over
in the current
and
look,  fucked up
Can you help
How many are, down there
goes back to the car
Just one
We're feeding him air, but he's not breathing regularly
You've got to get him out fast
glances at the map, then at the accident site
(a beat) Ten thousand
Lira
Dollars
You're going to hold me up at a time like this
You do understand you're talking to the champion diver of the world
Yes, but ten thousand dollars
opens the trunk of his  and pulls out the jack
He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the American, straight in the eyes
Okay
You tell me
How much would you say the man's life is worth
Extremely uncomfortable, the  doesn't answer
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction
(baffled) What does that mean
That you should get your checkbook
Damn quick
- He's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the muddy water of the port
few feet away a pump sends air through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below
inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow
He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons his flippers, etc
, with his usual flair of suspense
Behind him the  and other construction workers watch expectantly
heaves a stone weight into the bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier
ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack, flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit bottom
He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay
- dives down a chimney of muck
Picks his way over and around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped under a huge piece of debris
He pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the tire jack under a piece of concrete
And, as if he were changing a tire, begins to pump the handle
Slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris rises off the diver's leg
- Everyone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully
The  has his checkbook in hand, but has completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on underwater
taps him on the shoulder
Since we have a little time, what do you say you write that check
- cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso
Then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls him free
The diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as possible toward the surface
- The diver surfaces, gasping for breath
cheer goes up from the crowd
Several men hurry to pull him onto dry land
But there is no sign of
Everyone waits, breathless
(to the Supervisor) Sign here
Suddenly,  appears, burst out of the water, holding his flippers up in the air like a trophy
The onlookers cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the back
tosses the jack and his flippers to
Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize fighter's robe that  holds out for him, walks solemnly back to his car
takes the check and walks over to the car bends down into the car and opens the roof
(through the open roof smiling) Thanks, thanks a lot
mean that too
You extortionist bastard
The car rushes off
In the distance we see a police (carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the direction of the construction site
- ' car drives past them
looks at  out of the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy
Dollars, Roberto
We took him for ten thousand dollars
whoops and whistles
reaches over and leans on the horn
The little car races by and finally stops at the top of the cliff facing the sea
- The two brothers sit back, relax
Stare out to sea
(after a while) Enzo, what are you going to do with the money
Have the car painted
Santini will do that for 25 dollars
Then tell him to wax it too
Enzo, really
What are you going to get
(thinking) rosary for Mama, a dress for Angelica, something with rhine- stones for what's her name, and get yourself a suit that fits
But most important
Yes
Find the Frenchman
Find me Mayol
-  - Mountain peaks, stark and white
winter sky which is strangely and disquietingly dark
landscape swept by snow
:  -   -  1987 yellow light comes out of the storm -- advances toward us
The headlight of a train
narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of snow in front of it
- Sitting in the train, leaning against the misty window, , 27, has clear quick charm and a sort of romantic fragility
She is dressed simply but warmly
She looks through the window; all she sees is white
It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this trip
Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book, she calls upon an old Peruvian
(in Spanish) Is this the Lago del Demonio
(Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio) Huacracocha
The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation
nods without understanding a thing
Gracias
You welcome
- The train pulls in, slowly pushing piles of snow in front of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which serves as the station
man, , bundled in a parka, comes out of a snowmobile parked by the station, and walks up to the train
steps down, carrying her suitcase and drops two feet in the snow as she comes off the last step walks over and leans down towards her
(smiling) Welcome to Peru
- throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile, jumps in and turns the ignition on
takes her hat, scarf and gloves off
glances over at her, he is both amused and charmed
Don't you have a heater
(hitting at the dashboard) Yeah
Sure
Is this your first trip to Peru
Does anybody live to make a second
smiles and kicks the heating system, then leans over to check it, his eyes off the road
(a little worried) Forget about the heater
-  - The storm is at its peak
The frozen snowmobile plows along side the lake  and stops in front of a cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow
gets the bags out of the back
The suitcases are by now frozen stiff
follows in his steps
couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in attempt to protect themselves from the storm
is bewildered
Shacks in the middle of the Andes, the lake of the "Demon", and now llama that have to be pushed aside to enter one's home
As  opens the door, a man is leaving the hut
The man is
and  pass each other in slow motion
Everything seems suddenly suspended: time, sound, cold
instantly makes an impression on her
He is now 34, still dark-haired, with dark eyes
He is wearing a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles
He looks like some legendary creature one would dream about
Everything finally regains its formal speed
The door slams, the man is gone
She and  are in the middle of the entrance hall
hasn't yet gotten over the vision she has just had, but she regains composure and enters the next room
happily takes her gloves off
puts down the bags and walks into the next room
It's a sort of laboratory, filled with ultra modern equipment
big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a long wooden dock
Sitting in a corner, an old Peruvian man is preparing hot drinks
drops into a chair
drink to warm up
Yes, thank you
Intravenous if possible
(pulling out a flask) Tea
or whiskey
both
Did  just see a man in a red suit and goggles
smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup
right
(calling out) Dr
Lawrence
The insurance man
uh
The insurance person is here
It's about time
smiles and pours  some tea
She warms her hands on the cup
She asks blankly
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing
Who
The guy in the Halloween suit
comes in from the other side of the room
He walks straight over to the bay window
Did you have a nice trip
We were getting restless, it's been three weeks since the accident
walks over to the bay window and starts staring at something in the distance
- At the end of the dock,  who is sitting on the edge of a hole which is cut in the ice, is putting a pair of gloves on
He then grabs the handles of a strange machine which emerges from the water and starts taking deep breaths, oblivious to the cold, his mind completely elsewhere
watches
She just can't believe her eyes
is bent over one of his machines, fiddling with different switches
(to Johana) You should get things moving, you know
We're out of equipment and we can't do half of our experiments
Frank, check the program
is finally able to speak
Who
Who is that
Mayol
Jacques Mayol
That's the experiment
Dumping a guy into a frozen lake
turns one last knob
The truck fell into a very deep crevasse
We weren't able to save the equipment
'll have to talk to the driver
In the spring when he melts
walks closer to the window
She isn't hearing a thing he's saying
is putting on his flippers
can't believe it
is standing by a hole cut in the ice
He is holding onto the machine in the water
He is waving a mask
(dumbfounded) You really send him under the ice
He isn't a slave or a convict or anything
My dear, science is a cruel mistress
But
how is he going to breathe
He isn't going to breathe
takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight yanks him straight down into the water
sets his stop watch off and flips a few switches
grabs his arm as if they could do something about it
Listen
He raises the volume:  we hear the man's heartbeat through a small speaker
That's his heartbeat
(excited) Can you hear the speed at which it's slowing down, it's incredible
tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures on it and hands it to
feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't figure it out
- stops his machine by turning one of the handles
He's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake
He swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is hinged open
He closes it around himself
His heart is still slowing down
He pushes a button on the machine, and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night surrounding him
- We see a moving -ray image
He's in the fluoroscope now
Listen to his heart
Impressive, huh
The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore
It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins
until now
How long can he stay down
Without breathing
It depends
He should come up soon
(smiling) Unless he's decided to stay for the night
Why is he doing this
For one thing, it's his job
as for the rest of it,  wish  knew
sighs with relief as  appears at the surface in one big breath
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something
(smiling at Frank) Coffee might be nice
She heads towards the Old Peruvian and pours a cup of coffee
(afterthought) Will he understand Spanish
His mother's an American
He spent half of his life in the states
'd try English if  were you
- He's groggy, half hypnotized
He looks up at the dock, sees  with a cup of coffee
He stares at her
She hands him the coffee
(puzzled) recognize you
We saw each other a little while ago
(serious) In the lake
(wondering whether he is joking or not) No
in the hut
After a long beat
(with a beautiful smile) Then it was somebody that looked a lot like you
Thank you
then turns around and walks toward the huts
still hasn't moved, as if petrified by her emotions and the severe cold
She then walks up to the hole in the ice and peers into the dark water
She shudders
- emerges from a down sleeping bag
She's wearing a big sweater and a wool hat
She is not sleeping
Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and walks over to the frozen window
and  are loading their luggage onto the snowmobile
Outside,  is saying "Goodbye" to
Unseen, also waves from behind her curtain
senses something:  he turns around toward the cabin and smiles, waving his hand at
She hides behind the curtain and shyly waves back
gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the frame
We are left with an endless array of snow-caped mountains
: ' - Fixed image of the Cote d'Azur
The sparkling blue sea fades into the distance
French taxi rides along the winding road overlooking the creeks
- From behind all his bags,  obsessively stares at the sea
The driver smiles
It's beautiful, isn't it
smiles
We had some bad wind this week
The "Mistral"
"Peuchere"
There isn't one olive left on its tree
It suddenly left us this morning
sure won't be the one to call it back
- The taxi comes to a stop in front of Marineland gets out, carrying one of his bags
(to the driver) 'll only be five minutes
He enters Marineland
- The park is closed, the paths are deserted approaches the Dolphin's tank
All three dolphins rise up in the water
Greet him with a click and clatter of tongues
sits down at the edge of the tank
Good morning, everybody
Did you sleep well
slept in a plane, and it wasn't too great
He opens his duffel bag
Hunts around, comes up with two packages wrapped in brownpaper
The dolphins stare at him, intrigued
(calling out) Hey
presents
The dolphins  some more
You think 'd forget you
He laughs
The driver, who seems to be quite familiar with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda machine
Out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the scene, very intrigued
has not noticed him
He starts unwrapping the first package
For Bathsheba
He produces a little ceramic Llama
looking at the llama, bewildered
As bewildered as a dolphin can be
turns the llama upside down
It moos:  ,
It's a Llama
You understand
From Peru
It's fighting
shakes her head
throws the llama into the water
He unwraps the second package
pair of Peruvian gloves and hat
Wide eyed, the driver sits in the stands to watch the show
That's for you, Darjeeling
We wouldn't want you to catch cold
He throws them to  who catches them
And now
(singing out) "Ta, da
" For you Tina
He pulls out a thermos
Something you've never seen either
He opens the thermos
Snow
He sprinkles snow flakes on ' head
She tries to taste it
(smiling like a child) new experience, Tina
(nostalgic) missed you little rascals
Did you get my post card
The three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge splash which soaks
He takes his shirt off
(pretending to be serious) Oh
Is that what you want
Alright, but five minutes, no more
have a taxi waiting
He takes off his pants
The taxi driver gets up, as if to keep him from going in
dives into the pool
- He swims under the dolphin, reaches out and grabs hold of the dolphin's snout
The dolphin pulls  around and around the basin while  pets his chest and belly
We have never seen  so relaxed and happy
: - Overview of a gray and dirty Manhattan morning depressed, stares blankly out of the window of a yellow cab
She watches the muddy brown water flow under the Brooklyn Bridge
The driver keeps yelling obscenities to all the cars around him
- suitcase in each hand,  gets out of the cab and walks up the stairs of her apartment
- puts down her suitcase wearily
Catches her breath and gets out her keys
She tries one in the top lock
It doesn't work
She tries harder
There's a woman's voice yelling angrily from inside the apartment
(
) changed the lock you son of a bitch
Sally
The door opens
You're back
Hello
We were burgled
Again
They got the new
comes in, looks at the ransacked apartment
And the new stereo
hope they remembered to take the microwave this time
Yep
How was your trip
Help me clean up, okay
You called the police
They're going to send detectives
When they get around to it
(shrugging) So what, all they ever want is your phone number anyway
goes over, slumps into an easy chair and sighs
After a beat
Well
What
How was your trip
(flatly) Nice
Very interesting
Great
(doubtfully) guess
(ironically) Okay
Who'd you meet
opens her handbag, takes out the strip of electrocardiogram paper, hands it to her
cardiogram
You met a doctor
Congratulations, you're in the chips
(an afterthought) Unless they have socialized medicine in Peru
Do they
(indicating paper) It's his heartbeat
Oh Jesus
'll make some coffee
(starts toward kitchen) They left the stove
: - The living room is almost completely put back together
is replacing books in the bookcase,  is using a carpet sweeper, and talking away
(nonstop) 6'3", 6'1", maybe 5'9" -- You can't be sure, you know the flippers, they add height or they take it away, or something
Anyway short dark hair
Not punk or anything, just short
And the cutest smile
He wasn't smiling at me,  don't think -- just smiling
And he thought he saw me in the lake
mean that was a figure of speech
They're so romantic, the French
(bored, half asleep) thought you said he was Peruvian
(annoyed) Haven't you been listening
opens the drapes, revealing it's dawn outside
Since eight o'clock last night
You're in love
Don't be a jerk
(emphatically) There's no such thing as love at first sight
: - is swimming alone at the bottom of a gigantic swimming pool
He wears a monofin, his head and chest are wired up to an assistant who runs back and forth alongside the pool
man's feet are seen walking over to the side of the pool
is swimming laps, arching his body like a dolphin
As he approaches one end of the pool, he sees a coin slowly falling in front of him
picks it up and looks at it:  it's an old Greek coin
smiles and swims to the surface
- pokes his head out of the water and pulls off his goggles
stands over him, smiling
Jacques, my friend, how are you
(happy) Enzo
beat
leave you swimming and twenty years later, you're still in the water
What the hell are you doing
Training
Yes
An uneasiness sweeps over ' face and quickly disappears
That's good
(smiling again) You never would have recognized me, huh
Check out the suit
Looking good, no
You know 'm the world champion
Yes,  know
dove 315 feet
Great
They say 'm like Lazarus
You know, the guy who was raised from the dead
He laughs
smiles
goes on
(serious) Doesn't it surprise you that  just show up like this
Listen, the world championship starts in ten days in Taormina
Be my guest
puts down an airplane ticket on the side of the pool
Your ticket
Surprised,  looks over at the ticket
Why
Because 'm sure you're dying to beat me
(shaking his head) don't want to be in any competition
dive because  like to, not to beat a record
don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him
No
All you need is to want to be the best
(smiles) You're the best, Enzo
(with a tense grin on his face) That's too easy
Every time  beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "'you know that French guy, Mayol
He's supposed to be very good
Too bad he doesn't compete
" So, you're going to come with me to Taormina
First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure
(he pushes the airplane ticket to Jacques) 'll see you there
-   - '  -  - She is seated across the desk from him
He's reading through her report
Behind him, outside the large plate glass window, window-washers are seated on a scaffold suspended far above the city
They eat lunch
' eyes wander (bored) around the office as reads
He looks up
(indicating report) This is good work
unfortunately it's incomplete
(he glances at the window) Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street
(absently) What kind
Johana, am  boring you
Sorry
Of course not, definitely not
well, maybe a little
What did you say
said that the file is incomplete
See if you can get through to this Lawrence character and have him send the Peruvian registration for his missing truck
and don't let him tell you it was in the glove compartment
Right Chief
She starts out of the office
(to her back) Did the driver really freeze
Like a popsicle
They're keeping him on a stick until spring
My God
'm glad  didn't go
(under her breath, leaving) So am
-  - Doctor  covers one ear with his hand as he yells into the phone
(screaming) said, all the truck papers are in the glove compartment
'  - sits at her desk, she too is yelling into the telephone
Her colleague looks over at her and smiles
(with a sigh) Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible
We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete
Okay
-  - Okay, okay
You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that
(
) You've made me a happy insurance person
Then, goodbye
He is just about to hang up
'  - jumps up
Wait
Professor
(
) Yes
starts snooping around the papers on her desk, embarrassed by the presence of her colleague
(as softly as possible) You don't know how  could reach that diver of yours
Mayol
We need some additional information
mean, we have a few questions to ask him
-  - The last thing  heard, he was off to Taormina for the world diving championships
That's Taormina, in Sicily
'  - dashes in without knocking
Listen,  just found out we've got real problems in Sicily
(alarmed) What d'you mean
(improvising) The mafia
La Cosa Nostra
Coppola
De Niro
knew it knew we shouldn't have written that policy
(pale) What's happened
The documents are forged
No
Yes
The notary is a phony
He has the same signature as the contractor
(outraged) It can't be true
(fast talking) We have to send somebody over there immediately
If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy
We'll be off the hook
There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily
(reaching for phone) 'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to
(interrupting) tried him, he can't go
His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow
'll go, boss
thought it was Spanish that you spoke
(after a beat) Italian is practically the same thing
- ferry comes into the dock, as a plank is slowly lowered
As it descends, four rail cars lie in wait in its belly
comes off the boat, carrying her suitcase, she wears a light summer dress
She looks around, seeming a little lost
white  taxi screeches to a halt beside her jumps
The driver whose arm loosely dangles from the car window, grins at her
Taxi
- The white  taxi pulls up in front of the hotel, but it is  who gets out of it
The driver helps him with his bags
(checking the books) Mayol
Mayol
No reservation
(uncomfortable) Are you sure
Positive, Sir
looks down at the piece of paper stapled to his ticket
This is the hotel San Domenico
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years
(more and more uncomfortable) Yes, but
So, you haven't got a room left
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship
Ah
The Receptionist starts working on his papers again
, completely lost, stares blankly at the hotel clerk, wondering what to do next
- The tiny  clatters onto the sidewalk in front of the hotel narrowly avoiding the Countess' limo
Parks its frontwheels on the sidewalk, rear end in the road
, followed by , get out of his car, like a king descending from his carriage
On the way, he stops and kisses a distinguished elderly woman's hand
The hotel's tosses his keys to a doorman who stepped up to complain
(to doorman) Be careful with that car, it's a new paint job
enters the hotel and sees
(yelling across the lobby) Giacomino
My friend
My brother
and
The two men kiss each other on both cheeks, pound each others back
They are both moved
(looking at him) So you finally decided to join us
You did the right thing
(to the desk clerk) Hey Paolo
Come stai
Get my key
(to Jacques, gesturing over his shoulder) You remember my little brother Roberto
Roberto (26) nods to  who shakes his hand
remember
Hi Roberto
What room have you got
don't have one
You don't have a room
(at the top of his lungs) Paolo
What did  just hear personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger
(embarrassed) It's okay, Enzo
'll go somewhere else
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world
And you're throwing him out
Are you crazy, or what
Stupido
(really embarrassed now) Enzo drop it, 'll find something
looks at him for a moment and gives him a warm smile
He hands him his own keys
Take mine
'll take the Countess' suite
She told me she was leaving for the cemetery
She'll be more comfortable there
half-heartedly, hands him the key
glances at to make sure he's properly impressed
He throws his arm around ' shoulder, hugs him and gives him a real smile
(sincerely) 'm glad you're here
-  -  - They're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea
They've just arrived and all around them people are lunching away furiously
beckons to a passing  who comes to the table
He's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man
(to waiter) "Spaghetti del mare" (to Jacques) It's delicious here
It's the one thing they really know how to make
Del mare for two
(nodding quickly) Yes, sure, for two
And a bottle of "Frascatti"
Two bottles
Si Signore, grazie mille
The waiter hurries away
watches his departure, then thoughtfully
He moves just like a woman
(then, as if he were speaking to Jacques) It must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh
To breathe in one, swim in the other
nods without really knowing
(suddenly louder) Anyway
Nothing beats a sexy broad
Huh, Jacques
starts laughing
would like to crawl under the table
: -  -  - Their lunch is on the table, half eaten
So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask
Am  right
(quickly) Yes, of course
Lots of questions
is satisfied with his answer
He thinks that the subject is closed
They eat silently for a moment watches him
Then: Well, what are they
(giving up) 'm sorry
don't know how to ask the questions
bursts out laughing
Well, then
'll do the asking for you
"Tell me dear Enzo, how did you become World Champion
"  Oh, that's a long story
(his voice changes) Well, after you left Amorgos,  went back to Italy and joined the Navy
So you now have in front of you -- Captain Molinari, who's been on leave of absence for the past 14 years
That's good
How do you make a living
Your experiments, does it pay well
It's okay
You married
doesn't seem to have ever thought about marriage
No
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother
She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado
Stubborn as a mule
was engaged
for a week
After that, Mamma was so mad,  tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls
smiles
So, not married
Well, good for you
You play the field, like me
girl in every port, huh
(bluffing) Exactly,  mean, after all, we're men
(slapping the table top) Damn right
That's what  tell them when people say you've turned into a fish
(concerned) People say that
(sorry he went too far) Forget it
was joking
- comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the terrace
She looks over the crowd, trying to find someone
is sitting with his back to her
She finally spots him and walks over to the table
Eh
La Madonna
This one is for me
'll bet you my watch that she's in my bed tonight
turns around and recognizes her
smiles and walks up to the table
takes his watch off and puts it on the table
(quickly) tell you she's mine
(to Jacques) Hello
(surprised) You know each other
Yes
Enzo Molinari
kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table in the same movement
This is a great pleasure
(laughing at the protocol) Johana Cross, pleased to meet you
(then to Jacques, faking surprise) Well
Isn't this a coincidence really wasn't expecting this
All the way out here
It's incredible
Please, have a seat
Thank you
wouldn't want to interrupt anything
sits down
No, no
Not at all
You're staying at the hotel

They recommended a pension in town
They say that all of Taormina is full
What's going on here
It's the Free Diving World Championship
am by the way world champion
has turned toward , paying no attention to can't stop looking at
But what brought you to Sicily
was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo
(to Enzo) work for an insurance company
(back to Jacques) So,  decided to take a few days off
(uncomfortable) don't know this island at all
It really is gorgeous
There is no place in the world more beautiful than Sicily
The waiter passes behind them
reaches out, grabs him by the arm, pulls him to the table
(to waiter) spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent
(smiling) think 'll have a coffee
No, no
You'll like it
It's superb
Okay
'll try
pours the wine
shrugs fatalistically
The waiter leaves
, intrigued, stares at
She pretends not to notice
(impatient) Where did you two meet
In a lake
might have known
(to Johana) As  was telling you earlier, 'm the world champion free diver
Congratulations
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world
One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort
(interrupting) Enzo
(annoyed) What
Your mother
Ahi, ahi, cazzo
Ma mamia
Where
God, she'll kill me
(pushing the plate in front of Johana) if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant
He quickly brushes off the crumbs in front of him
' heading toward them
She's a huge woman in widow's black
She shoulders her way through the tables
carrying her suitcases follows at her heels
jumps to his feet
Throws his arms around her
Mamma
(expressionless) You expect me to carry all the luggage myself
Mamma
Roberto and an elevator
Isn't that enough
beat
Signora  inspects the plates on the table
(suspiciously) What have you been eating
Coffee only, 'm diving tomorrow
You remember little Jacques, Jacques Mayol
(timidly) Madame
And his friend, Johana
Signora  nods grudgingly
(arriving proudly) Spaghetti del mare
Dead silence
is the only one with no plate in front of him
Signora ' eyebrows condense into a dark stripe across her forehead
hands ' plate to the  and takes the full one
(to waiter) Thank you
And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement all around her
Americana
nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak
(impressed, to Johana) Benvenuto
has a huge grin on her face
- ,  - They emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a small rooming house
is carrying ' luggage
The old pension is covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry hanging on the other side of the street
Thanks for helping with the bag
(she looks up at the pension with little enthusiasm) It looks great
thought it was a nice place
(suddenly doubting) Isn't it
'm being a pain in the ass
(looking at him) It's beautiful here
They look at each other
is silent
He just stands there, a suitcase in each hand
breaks the silence
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you
don't know
why
Just because
would have liked to visit the town
See the coast
don't know anybody
Expect for you
(feeling she has gone too far) But you are going to be very busy
You must have tons of things to prepare, interviews
And a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration, right
(shakes his head negatively) Yes
Maybe
don't know don't like competitions
It ruins the fun
Don't you think
(with a faint smile) guess
But you know
'm American and 've mostly been taught to be competitive
There's always pleasure of being the best
Maybe on earth there is one
but not when you dive
You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason
just to do it
It's a feeling
don't know how to say this
Voluptuous
He looks up at her as he pronounces the last word
She smiles at him, lovingly
(laughing) You can put down the suitcases, you know
He lets go of the suitcases
Suddenly, behind them, there is a loud screech of tires
The  tears across the street
in his
He pokes his head out of the window
'mon, you two
Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight
We have a new world champion
'm a little tired,  don't know if
Get in the car
'  - , ,  - They're in front of a wardrobe looking  over in the full-length mirrors
He's wearing an evening shirt and a tuxedo of '
The collar is too big, the sleeves hangover his hands
He looks at himself dubiously in the mirror
Roberto
The bow-tie
hands  the bow-tie, he hooks it around ' collar
(taking a few steps back) Very good
looks down at his tennis shoes
What about the shoes
Very chic
(hesitates) Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you
No
Then, it's very chic
Avanti
- big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel
The official divers and technicians are all gathered in front of a podium
The terrace is loaded with photographers
keeps turning round and round the long buffet table
is alone at the bar
Incongruous detail:  a whiskey bottle on the table beside him
enters
She has also had a few drinks
thought you'd be at the dinner
It's too loud for me
He tugs at his over-sized tuxedo
You look adorable
Thank you
(smiling) Especially the sneakers
looks down at his feet, doesn't know what to make of her comment
sits down beside him and pours herself a drink
They touch glasses
- On the podium, , the organizer of the championship, stands in his tuxedo, talking into a microphone
An older man in a worn out suit, stands next to him
Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention, please
Mr
Andre Bonnet, President of the International Diving Championship Committee, is going to present this trophy to the new world champion of free diving
This afternoon, our new champion descended to the remarkable depth of 280 feet
The audience applauds

Tiraero Moameora
hesitates to repeat the name
Let's all give him a big hand
The audience cheers and applauds the new champion sits at a table, watching the ceremony

He gets up and walks out of the room

new world record
That's great
It gives me something to beat tomorrow
(to Johana) You ever been to Tahiti

We'll live in the sun
You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees
smiles and shakes her head
You forgot the Hula
Yes, of course, 'll do the Hula
You'll be lovely, but no thanks
(to Jacques) Jacques, would you do a native dance for me
don't know how
Excuse me
leaves the bar
watches him go notices her way of watching him
He's a little jealous
He looks strange, doesn't he
Like a baby that just learned to walk
Have you known him long
Forever
We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids
What was he like, when he was little
Little
Very little
And skinny, very skinny too
That is compared to me
(amused) get it, Enzo you were a superior child
Exactly
What is it Johana
You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth
She doesn't answer
Forget it, don't think of Jacques as a human being
He's from another world
She smiles
And just where are you from
Italy
- sits at the grand piano in the corner of the terrace
Beethoven was always a favorite of his
, very tipsy by now walks over, a glass in each hand
He hands  a glass, then takes off his tennis shoes and sits them neatly on the piano
There is nothing like music
It speaks from the heart
Can you tell me why we bother diving in the dark, the cold, without ever taking the time to breathe
Huh
Can you tell me why we do it
nods
Why
For the mermaids
smiles, moved
My father used to see them everywhere too
but the only one he ever caught was my mother
Actually she caught him
beat
Today at lunch, you asked me if had any questions
Ah ha
You finally want to know about women
Why
Are they what's most important
No
It depends
Sometimes they are
What, exactly do you want to know
Everything
Everything about what
(thinking) Well
about everything
grins at  and starts playing again
: There are now several empty champagne bottles around
They are both quite drunk
is philosophizing
is looking for them
So, between Mamma, Roberto and the sisters, we yell and scream all day long
Except with Angelica
She just cries
And then finally, we all end up kissing
Can you explain that to me
can't answer
Because that's what love is all about
It's a pain in the ass but keeps us together
(then, in a half dreaming, half desperate tone) large and beautiful family
walks over to them
(suddenly) Enzo
We must quit the competition
hits a wrong note on the piano
(worried) Why
If we don't
'm going to beat you
stands next to
(with a nervous laugh) Huh
Well listen to him
(to Johana) Do you hear that
No
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "'m going to beat you"
(with a smile) That's what he's here for, isn't he
Listen to her
"That's what he's here for"
He's here to loose, that's what he's here for
First of all, 'm unbeatable
Second, how old are you
Two years younger than you
As  said, second of all you're too skinny
You've got tiny lungs still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it
Look at me
These aren't lungs
These are
Tanks
How long can you hold your breath
is getting really angry
The drinks have a lot to do with it
(impatiently) don't know
Longer than you
pulls open his collar and rises
We'll see
-   -  - and  dive into the pool in their Tuxedos
Each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to help them stay at the bottom
takes two goblets out of his pocket, hands them to Takes a bottle of Champagne out of the other pocket and opens it
The cork floats out of the bottle
Above on the surface of the pool there's a splash finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them
Her dress is soaked by now
pours champagne
Courteous and grave, they clink glasses and begin to drink
They have already been underwater longer than a minute
They can't really drink out of the glasses and  offers  the bottle
studies the label like a connoisseur
He drinks, passes the bottle back to
- Paramedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at full speed
on one,  on the other
Both men keep throwing up water
'  - The paramedics roll the stretcher toward the bed
very worried, follows them
Take it easy
Don't worry, he's empty now
He needs sleep, that's all
The two men leave the room
walks over to the chair and rearranges ' shirt and jacket which the paramedic had thrown down
looks like he's just had a very rough night
He sits up and grabs the sides of the bed, as if he were on a moving boat
Who won
turns around, furious
Won what
The Ass Hole Award
Well, let me tell you, it's a tie
She walks over to the bed
Acting like a pair of two year olds
You could have died in that damn pool
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat
(smiling) Lucky  was there to save you
(seeing her wet dress) You jumped in
Only to help the medics,  assure you
My wallet
wet, walks over to the wet clothes on the chair
She pulls out  soaking wallet from one of the jacket pockets
It's still here
She tries to wipe it
No
want to show you
Is it ruined
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures
Not even for pictures of dolphins
Give it to me
hands him the photograph
He stares at it, looking very sad
Worried  sits down next to him
(on the verge of tears) My real family
(he looks at the picture and cries) What kind of man has such a family
She takes the picture out of his hands
He is so upset that  can hardly help from crying with him
She sits next to him and strokes his hair
'm sick of never feeling at home anywhere
takes him in her arms
He breaks down
- The early morning sun slowly lights up the water
yacht has left the hotel dock
It is moving out to sea off the coast of
- This is the Committee Boat for the diving competition
On the boat,  is worried
He checks his watch and finally decides to wake up his brother
is asleep in the fore peak, curled up on a coil of line, snoring away
He wears his tuxedo jacket over a skimpy bathing suit
Enzo, wake up
(pulled from his dream) Eh
Si
Avanti
He gets up on one arm
The medics are looking all over for you
(irritated) 'm meditating, can't you see
Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down
can take a five minute nap, can't
The boat stops
The anchor is thrown over board
The sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready for the competition
Today is ' turn to dive
man is hooking a plaque indicating the depth (324 feet) onto a lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable
- '  - medic is bending over , taking his blood pressure
pulls the tuxedo jacket down
The doctor puts a blood pressure band around ' upper arm, pumps it up
He listens with his stethoscope
Mr
Molinari, 'm terribly sorry but cannot allow you to dive in such an advanced state of exhaustion
jumps to his feet, grabs the doctor by his lapels, lifts him in the air
(outraged) What do you know about the sea
Huh
Nothing
So you just put your tubes and tin cans away
The sea is mine
know when she is ready for me and when she isn't
And today, she is ready
Understand
You dive at your own risk
You're been warned
smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder
Brave
- It's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee Boat
and an assistant help  down the swim ladder to the platform
He's wearing a wet suit and fins
He flip-flops to the end of the platform
hands him his mask
The goggles are filled with polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible
Only two pinholes to see through
The mask fits tightly over his nose
When  puts it on, he looks like an astonished insect
breathes faster and faster
holds the wire controlling the weighted diving apparatus
crosses himself, takes a last long gulp of air
releases the weight
It sinks and drags down, he quickly disappears into the dark water
But this is  as he was a child
He swims along the bottom, finds and picks up a gold coin
We can see its ancient markings, a youth on a dolphin
looks up
In front of him is a dolphin, floating vertically, still, apparently just watching isn't scared anymore
But every time he swims toward the dolphin, it moves further away
It finally disappears
-  - He sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream
He looks around the room, trying to get his bearings
is asleep in a chair across the room
On the wall behind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger
She's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep
finally awake from his dream, sees sleeping
He walks over to her, touches her shoulder
She wakes up, starts out of the chair
She grabs the blanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on the floor
It's one of his
You scared me
picks up the book
smiles
Just checking up on your family
(then embarrassed) guess  was drunker than  thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress
Well
'm glad you stayed
Thank you
(getting up) 'd better get back now
You
You wouldn't want to spend the day with me
She sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask
(self conscious) No
No
Huh
(she says "No" as if she had asked the question) Yes, of course
-  - and  enter the dolphinarium
is wearing an old pair of   along with an oversized -shirt and rolled up sweater
She seems quite pleased with her new attire
and  walk straight through  and head toward the dolphin pool
It's pretty crowded, mostly kids
The dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the pool
The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool and getting absolutely no reaction
What's the matter
don't understand
We've tried for two days
They won't eat
They won't perform
It's since we got the new one
surfacing
It thrusts its head over the edge of the pool, looks to  and
Is she the new one
Surprised, the trainer nods
looks over at  then at the dolphin
She doesn't understand
How can you tell it's a female
The way she moves
Three other dolphins gather around the one that  is patting
is staring at the female dolphin
It looks like the animal is trying to tell him something
Suddenly the dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the pool
- hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle
Let's it pull him along
The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool, and pulls  to the bottom
The other dolphins circle above
- pops up
As he does, three dolphins leap in the air behind him
walks closer to the pool
She is so excited by what  is doing, she finally falls into the pool
After a while,  gets out of the pool and helps out
Did you ever think of trying the public pool
He's a dolphin specialist
In that case what's wrong with the new one
Is she sick or not
(taking his time to answer) Not the way you mean
What am  supposed to do
Do  call the dealer
The investment, you understand
certainly am entitled to complain
It's going to cost you more than you think
turns around and walks off
catches up with him
She's not like the others
She can't stand to be away from the sea
(impressed) How do you know that
(stopping) don't know,  just feel it
-  - and  are walking across the corridor
walks up to them, followed by his tribe
Everybody is congratulating him
is screaming,   is crying smiles as he talks back to them
He sees
(screaming) Ah
Jacques
grabs hold of his shoulders
and  are completely soaked
Don't be sad,  only took back what was mine
He gives  the diving plaque, it reads 280 feet
Here, it's a present
and  smile at each other
has won his bet
(touched) Thank you
slaps him on the shoulder
(to Johana) Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves
8 o'clock in my suite
Okay
walks off then turns back toward them
He whispers in ' ear
Tell me
Can you explain why you are soaking wet
beat
We're in training
walks off
- Three formally dressed officials are waiting in front of one of the hotel rooms
One of them holds a medal in his hand, a glass of champagne in the other
(through the door) Mr
Roberto, tell your brother to be reasonable
Everyone is waiting for him upstairs
The photographers are there, the press
(
) He can't, he's indisposed
(trying to keep his calm) Shall we call a doctor
No, it's okay
Mamma is going to try something
and  walk up from the other side of the hall and stop in front of the same door
Mr
Mayol, help us
He refuses to receive his medal and everybody is waiting for him up there
We already have problems with the press because of the danger, and if we don't even have the divers help
(dubious) 'll do my best
That's very kind of you
knocks on the door
It's Jacques
Mayol
beat
Then  opens the door himself
Jacques
My friend
Come on in
The officials look at each other baffled
Mr
Enzo Molinari, allow me to impress upon you the importance of your attending the Award Ceremony
For the press
(loosing his temper) think my brother told you  was indisposed, that should do it, no
'm allowed to be indisposed, right
So, you just tell the press that the "big" Enzo Molinari, overwhelmed by his inspiring descent to 324 feet, will not be able to receive this trinket because he is
He looks inquisitively at the three men
looses his temper
Because he is
Indisposed
(smiling) Brave
He slams the door in their face
- '  - Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente"
So the trinket will just have to wait a bit
takes  by the shoulder
Inside his room is absolute chaos:  dancing, singing, eating
Wet suits hung out to dry everywhere
is whipping up mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the middle of the room
lot of smoke
steam
color
noise
All of Italy crammed into a few square feet
taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner of the room
walks over and sits down at her side
(to Mamma) Mamma
La pasta
Arrivo
Arrivo
She points at  who is taking forever to grate the cheese
grabs the guitar from his other brother's hands and starts playing
It's easy
You go down
You come up
(to Johana) Right, Johana
(smiling) Congratulations, Enzo
Don't you agree, Jacques
You always were the best
laughs then sees his mother
Ah
La pasta
starts singing in Italian
serves the pasta,  follows her around, sprinkling his cheese on the plates
She serves  a huge plate of pasta, enough for three giants
(with a smile) Buon appetito, Signorina
who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly has walked up to
He doesn't dare ask his question
(smiling) What's the matter
You still have a bunch of things to ask me
You want to know the price of tea in China of how we landed on the moon
Is that it
laughs
is serious
No,  have to ask you a favor
(a beat) You're the only one who'll understand
(seriously) 'm listening
- Tutto va bene
The three officials are eating pasta, plates on their knees
Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod enthusiastically
(mouth full) Gracie mille, chignora
smiles and slams the door
- is driving,  sits beside him
crammed in the back seat, very uncomfortably, because of a stretcher which takes up all the space
They are dressed as they were at ' party
(leaning forward) Hey
Will you slow down
When did you learn how to drive
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road
runs a red light
And the lights
Running lights, stealing stretchers
You'll have us in jail
Enzo, stop bitching, will you
-  - They get out of the car
starts to change into his swimming trunks
shakes his head, can't believe he's really come along
He laughs and starts undressing
/
-   - It's a very narrow street
The car moves down it quickly
drives
The back seat is now occupied by the dolphin
Its nose and tail protruding through the windows
is in the front seat, turned around, spraying the dolphin with a watering can
- They have driven to the public beach
They slowly lower the stretcher into the water
The dolphin, leaving the stretcher, swims around a little but won't go away
He won't leave
(moved) You can't stay here
Come on
Go away
swims off with her for a while
walks back toward the car with the stretcher
, standing by the water looks at  and the dolphin who are swimming off together
keeps splashing the dolphin as they swim
You can stop that now, she has all the water she needs
cannot get rid of the dolphin
All right, we did it
Let's go back to the party
and the dolphin can't seem to part
Just one minute
is worried, she walks up to  who goes back into the water and takes  by the arm
Jacques, the dolphin is home now
And that's where we're going
Come on
Hurry up now
Our girlfriend is freezing over there
The dolphin starts swimming off
follows half-heartedly
'  - stops the  in front of the pension
The three of them get out
hasn't bothered to dress
heads for the gate, she obviously has no desire of leaving
Well, good night, then
You going to sleep here, all by yourself
Yes
She looks over at the pension, having a hard time concealing her lack of enthusiasm
It's a comfortable place
Sinister is what 'd call it
Ours is so much cheerful
Why don't you come and stay with me
There's plenty of room in my suite
(smiles) The Mamma's there too
(face clouds up) Yes, the Mamma is is there
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques
Good night
(to Jacques) You don't need a stretcher to take her with you
You know that, don't you
What
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes
Leave it alone, Enzo, it's okay
She rings the bell for the concierge, then looks back at Can  come watch you dive tomorrow
(lost) Uh
Yes, of course
The concierge comes out and opens the iron gate for her
disappears into the parc
turns to
You really do have a few things to learn about women
- The sun is rising on a rough sea
The Committee Boat is anchored in the open sea, 600 feet above the sea bed
-    - who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just laid a towel down before him
He's suited up, sitting in the lotus position, staring straight ahead, clearly self- hypnotized
, , and other officials are in the stern of the boat watching last minute preparations
The scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and aqualungs, flop out onto the diving platform, plunge into the water, disappear
What are they for
They're paramedics
They wait at 180 feet
(just checking) If there was a problem, they could do something right
Of course, that's what they're for
sees scuba divers with weird air tanks
(pointing) And those
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet
They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture
At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide
What's that little air bottle on the machine
That isn't for the divers actually
It's for the balloon
It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator
Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed
(shocked) But doesn't Jacques dive without anything
(smiling) Yes
It's magic
-  - On the boat,  checks his watch
comes out of his room
He's dressed to dive
He ignores everyone as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform
He seems to be in another world
All sounds coming to him are drowned out
- sits in the diver's slot
Opens his eyes slowly and looks around
He puts his flippers on, an assistant stands at his side
The figures on the platform are vague, the  are and incomprehensible
Moving almost in slow motion he raises three fingers
Tre minuti
Ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive
They disappear one by one into the blue
uses contact lenses instead of a mask
He puts them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as his hearing
bodies deform
sounds fade
Already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his system, he moves into another reality altogether
seems to empty himself out
Due minuti
fills a small tube with water
Pours it into his nostrils
tilts his head
then lets it run out
He puts on his gloves
all his movements are slow, he seems to be operating in a different time zone
He seems unable to take his eyes off the water
- Uno minuto
puts his nose clip on
He puts his hand on the gueuse
Closes his eyes and inhales slowly
Then he takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears
The gueuse slides down the cable
hangs on like a ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down
Above him, the boat disappears from sight
He moves faster and faster
through a sea that looks like a cloudy sky
The light fades rapidly around him
Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night
reaches them in a matter of seconds
Turns the brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down
The medics are waiting for him there
They take his pulse
Check his eyes
15 seconds
normal
the bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around them
closes his eyes
a tap on the shoulder, he releases the brake on the gueuse
Plunges further, this time into pitch black
Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom
He reaches it and the dark diver moves to him brakes his machine
Moving very slowly, turns his body right side up
Like a sleep walker,  starts to take the plaque off the plumbline
pauses in the middle of the gesture
The dark diver flashes the high sign to , thumb and forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear does not respond
The diver repeats the signal does not respond
The diver taps  on the shoulder
a beat
and then  responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay
Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle of the balloon
The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him
The balloon inflates
hangs on
lets it carry him up
At the plague marking 210 feet,  lets go of the the balloon
With a burst of speed, it darts toward the surface
follows slowly, undulating like a fish
He's getting warm now
He closes his eyes
Passes the medical control without stopping
without even seeing it like someone asleep
He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air
opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter
The silhouette of the boat comes back into view
60 feet to go
- In slow motion ' hand holding the plaque breaks out of the water followed by his arm, in one continuous movement, his shoulders and head
He gasps for air
trickle of blood comes from his nose
Flashbulbs flicker, spectators cheer
- The dolphin, the one rescued last night, leaps into the air, in perfect harmony with ' triumph
The dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the exact same moment
The trainer doesn't understand what's going on
- falls back into the water
Two divers run over and pull him up onto the dock
seems completely dazed, almost in a trance
He slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder
It is the scream of his body in need of the surface, reality and the feel of the land
is terrified
She can hardly breathe
Everybody applauds
- and  walk down the gangway
has lead the way and the news has been spread
looks very weak and punchy
holds him up
The spectators applaud as he goes by
Intrigued, looks at them all
(excited) Jacques, listen to the applause
He doesn't respond
(trying to keep up) Jacques, you set a world record
did
Aren't you happy
Don't you feel proud
feel proud and all did was watch
He is staring at her, he's returning to the real world
Slowly he smiles
She grabs hold of his arm and gives him a proud kiss on the mouth
is a little stunned
-   - walks into the hotel, his arms filled with packages
He sees  and
From the look on his face we can tell he knows that  has beaten his record
He deliberately puts on a huge smile as he walks over to them
- Congratulations Jacques
It's wonderful
Wonderful
He drops his packages on the bar and gives Jacques a big hug
'm happy for you
He kisses him and starts handing out his presents
(to Jacques) Here
(to Johana) Here
What is it
Little presents, nothing much knew it,  just knew it
Look here
He holds up his arm:  he is wearing two watches
Roberto's watch
won it
He bet that you couldn't beat me
opens his present
It's a little ceramic dolphin
You still collect them
Yes
You don't have that one, do you
No
Thank you
It's really beautiful
Oh it's nothing
knew it
told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good"
lost my title but  won a watch
has opened her package
It's a big plate with a text engraved on it
Is it a poem
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare"
(to Jacques) You see  was right in getting you out here
You're a world champion, my friend
has opened the last small package
It's a measuring tape
He looks at it without understanding
explains: It's a measuring tape
He grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground
You see this is your record, three feet more than mine
Looking at it from here, it doesn't look like much, does it
looks at him without saying a word
hands him the measuring tape
Keep your little measuring tape, my friend, it will be a nice souvenir when  beat you next
taps his shoulder and smiles
-  - They're locked in a long kiss
He untucks the bottom of her shirt and slides his hands under it
-  -  - They're in bed, making love in their fashion
Moonlight shines in the silver sea
In the background are the lights of the bay of
is in bed with
They are both asleep
Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his recurrent dream
He's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping
She sleeps peacefully like a baby
Quietly, gently, he eases out of bed and walks to the open window
He stands on the balcony, staring at the sea
Then in the distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the water, once, twice, a third time
laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down next to
She is still sound asleep
-  - quickly gets into one of his diving suits
He puts on his flippers
The dolphin is still jumping in and out of the water
jumps off the pier and swims over to her
'   - rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep
' absence wakes her
Jacques
She gets up and walks over to the balcony
She doesn't see anything
- walks down the pier and notices the little pile of clothes  has left behind
She looks around but still can't see anything
She decides to sit next to the pile of clothes, and waits, her eyes riveted to the sea
- The sky has just begun to light up again
is still sitting next to the pile of clothes
She is wearing ' sweater
She looks sad, yet serene
The look of a woman who has been thinking over the situation and who has made up her mind
Tired,  swims back to the pier
It looks as if he has come out of nowhere
He is exhausted
He takes off his flippers and gets up onto the pier in front of
He looks at her, a little surprised to find her there
(warm) What are you doing here
She answers in a far away voice, with the same serene sadness
'm going to leave, Jacques
Dripping with water, he sits down next to her
His face is drawn from fatigue
She continues
'm going back home
Why
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea
'm not from the sea
don't understand what you're talking about
Yes you do
You know exactly what 'm talking about
You're afraid want to hold onto you, and  do, but you're not ready
at least not for me
But it's not true,  feel good with you
It feels right
She looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child
've got to get back to the hotel
and get my suitcase packed
-  -  - The train station faces the sea
and  are standing on the platform, amid others
In the distance we hear the rumble and whistle of a train
gets on the train
The station master blows his whistle
Will
will we see each other again
' eyes are filled with tears
Take good care of yourself, Jacques
The train starts pulling out of the station
Where can  call you
Johana, tell me where can  call you
doesn't answer
stands helplessly in the station, his eyes filled with tears
'  - opens the door of his suite
His hair is messed up, he's got "sheet prints" on his face and is wearing the top of a diving suit
Can  come in
No problem,  enjoy talking in my sleep
walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed
He's lying on his stomach
walks in and lets himself drop in a chair
Wake me up at 11:00
closes his eyes
looks over at the clock, it says 11:25
doesn't say anything and stares blankly out of the window
(opening one eye) Hmmm
Something wrong
doesn't answer
Is it the girl
stares out the window
Did she leave
No answer
gets up and sits on the side of the bed
Hey
'm going to take care of you
've got this job, on an oil rig, no sweat
'm taking you along
Come on
Get your bags packed
You're coming with me,  tell you
He pats him on the back
We'll make a great team, the two of us
You'll see
-   - The platform shines in the morning light
There are several stories of crew housing and offices above the deck
Long steel legs disappear into the swelling slate-gray ocean
We hear -- of a helicopter
- The helicopter is landing
Crewmen rush to secure it to the oil rig's deck
Doors open and two passengers get off:   and
They each carry a duffel bag of personal belongings
They're both wearing fluorescent diving suits
The   comes to meet them
Mayol, Molinari
They nod
We've been waiting for you for three days
Goddamnit
Is that the way you talk to the best diver in the world
And to his friend Jacques Mayol
The  smiles sourly, and gestures to a crewman
Show them their quarters
Five minutes later,  and  are following the crewman
(whispering) He doesn't like us
So what
His job is to hand out the paychecks
And he does that very well, let me tell you
- The diving capsule, suspended by cables, begins its descent through a trap door in the deck
It plunges into the sea
The three men in the capsule are:  ,  and the tough looking   , who is much too professional for ' tastes
watches through a porthole while the concentrates on the control console
He runs through a checklist of systems
responds with a "check" as he verifies each one
is already bored and fed up by the procedures
is lost in thought, they don't look cheerful
(suddenly) You still thinking about her
doesn't answer
goes on
Don't think about her anymore
Let me tell you, you're just making yourself unhappy
There are so many women in the world
He takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and stares at
Plenty of women everywhere right
(coldly) Smoking is absolutely forbidden
It isn't lit yet
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board
(stubborn) The rules are the rules
(checking out this creature) What's your name again
Noireuter
And where did you say you were from
didn't say
(contemptuous) Brussels
smiles sardonically, shaking his head very slowly
The ' answer explains it all
-   - technician is overlooking the capsule descent on a video screen
The  watches over the technician's shoulder
They're at 450 feet
- , a cigarette dangling from his lips, looks through the porthole
was seventeen,  loved her so much  tried to die for her
Two years later  couldn't even remember her name
Let me tell you, time erases everything
don't want to erase anything
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable
(after thinking about it) Yes
(smiles) give you this
You're stubborn
Dumb, but stubborn
(taking it as a compliment) Thank you
- The technician fiddles with a few knobs
Minus 800 feet
End of descent
The diving capsule ends its descent
The  turns to  and  who is still staring out the porthole
(with a Mickey Mouse voice) You have enough air for 15 minutes
bursts out laughing
(with Donald Ducks voice) What's with the voice
It's nothing
It's just the helium, because of the air pressure
(worried) And
does the voice come back
For others, yes
For you, who knows
(still a little worried, to Jacques) Try speaking to me
(with Daffy Ducks voice) don't find this funny
We were having a serious conversation
and  burst out laughing
They keep these same voice till the end of the scene
pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket
(to Jacques) Here, give me your finger
taps a drop onto ' finger, then on his own
Then  blows up
(in a panic) Is that alcohol
Are you out of your mind
Alcohol is strictly forbidden
(loosing his temper) Hey
'you have any other complaints
Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole
Okay
pours a second drop on his own finger
Go on, suck your finger
hesitates
has no qualms about it and sucks his own finger
is petrified
Are you crazy
At this pressure
It's very deep down here
Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere
, convinced sucks his finger too
smiles
The alcohol has an immediate effect on them
(to Jacques) thousand commanders and we get a Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous
gets out of the diving capsule, head first
He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables
, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in them
They are both hilariously drunk
- The  hears them laughing through the control room speakers
He flips a communication switch
Can you hear me
What's going on
(to the technician) Are you sure you're on the right channel
The technician nods back to him
The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed to be working on
They have their arms around each other and are dancing
watches them through the porthole
He shakes his head in complete disbelief
We hear the two friends humming the tune of a Viennese waltz
If those guys are playing a radio down there they'd just better watch out
' is talking away, pointing around the apartment
And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and 'll do the curtains on American Express
for the couch there's Bloomingdales
or are you still over your limit
(flatly) Way past it
Does that have a hidden meaning
No
'm just depressed
You look it too
You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins
You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been
(stopping her) know,  know
'm a terrible person
(after a beat) It's
'm so damn, damn sad
What is it honey
the frenchy
(tentatively) Do you think  should have stayed
Don't you think maybe  should have stayed
've been a jerk, right
(then, emphatically) should have stayed
was supposed to be in love
was in love
am in love, why did  act like a bitch
He went swimming
All the man did was go swimming must be crazy
It was too good to be true
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea
and see a doctor, will ya
'  -  - The doctor enters with a folder, speaks to Well Miss Cross, herbs aren't going to do the trick this time
(worried) It's serious, right
think so
You're pregnant
Congratulations
If that's in order
breaks into a wide grin
It's in order
Thank you
Thank you
don't think it's me you have to thank
'  -  - is at his desk
His lunch is spread out in front of him
Outside the window, the window-washers are eating their lunch too
hurries in
Good afternoon
(agitated) came to make a clean breast of everything
the whole business
(bluffing, with his mouth full of sandwich) Yes
Of course
Very wise
(in a rush) Remember when  went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium
Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me
(she sees the window- washers) Do they come for lunch everyday
really went on my own business, to see a man that  happen to be in love with
and 'm glad  did it, but 'm sorry about the policy and 'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get
of course just now  don't have
(she checks a note she's holding) One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars
But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even
and  think this is where you fire me
(swallowing sandwich) You're right
You're fired
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave
'm pregnant
The Italian,  presume
No
He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition
(smiling) He seems to have won it
Yes, isn't it wonderful
'm so happy
'll bet 'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world
She starts to leave
calls out to the window-washers
Bon appetit and Adieu
'  - stares out of the bay window of her Manhattan apartment
Hesitant, she walks around her telephone
Finally she makes up her mind, picks up her address book and dials the number
(
) Hello
It's me
Johana
' is on the telephone, in front of a little window overlooking the sea
He is very glad to hear her voice
How are you
'  - got fired
(
) That's funny
had this job with Enzo
we got fired too
' face lights up with a huge smile
: is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay window
Day is dawning
(looking out at the skyline) It's getting light out
(
) Here, it's getting dark
smiles
She stretches, lies down on the carpeted floor
seems to have gone through all topics of conversation
've been thinking about you a lot, you know
is by now completely stretched out on the floor
So have
(a beat) Hello
'm still here
Well, then, talk to me some more
It's hard you know
You're so far away and  don't know what else to say
Then, tell me a story
Uh
Ah
story
He turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet dangling in mid air
He looks at the sea, seeking inspiration
Do you know how it is
(starting again) Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid
(with a smile) No
tell me
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory
and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there
and you decide that you will die for them
Only then do they start coming out
They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them
If it's sincere
If it's pure
They will be with you and take you away forever
listens with the abandon of a child being put to sleep
'  - The sun hits the roof tops
The sea is sparkling
The phone rings on the window sill
answers
Hello
(
) It's me again
smiles
(after a silence) 'm being a pain, huh
Not at all
(
) You sure
(smiling) Absolutely positive
(
) Okay
In that case
'm at the airport in Nice
doesn't know what to say
He looks around him, can't figure out what to do
(lost) Okay
huh, 'll be right over
- is standing in front of the airport
sees her
They smile shyly at each other
-  - and  are sitting in the back of a taxi
The driver stops in front of the hotel
(loud) The Carlton
Enjoy your siesta
and  look at each other
-  -  - The room is in semi-darkness, despite the blazing sunlight coming through cracks in the shutters
and are making love
is on top of her, his whole body covered in sweat
The rumpled sheets and the movements of their bodies suggest the movements of the sea are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are underwater
' reluctance has vanished
Both of them act like people who have never felt anything like this before
certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling
An increasing freedom
All the muscles of their bodies stretch to their limits
, progressively, finds himself disappearing
His image dissolves point by point
disintegrates into unbroken blue
The effect creates the impression of someone melting, the screen is now totally blue
thin, -
From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts the
It is , naked, swimming out of the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming out of a dive
He comes  and  to the Until his head almost touches the lens
sudden
and we find  on top of He looks down at her, speechless
(a little frightened) Are you okay
After a long beat
think  love you
-  - and  step out of the elevator of a 19th century building
is carrying her suitcases
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here
You'll understand
rings the door bell and sticks his key in the door
(surprised) Someone in there
nods and pushes the door open with the bags he's carrying
They enter a huge, very old apartment filled with models and paintings of boats
leads  to the other end of the apartment
-    ( ) It's a huge old-fashioned bathroom
The centerpiece is a deep ancient bathtub on faded gild feet
There's a rippling shadow of a body under the bath water
gasps
Don't be afraid
It's my Uncle
Louis
He goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube , underwater, has been breathing through it
' head pops out of the water, furious
Assassin
(loud, as if speaking to a deaf man) Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana
Did you buy the cassettes
The Wagner, the Berlioz
brought Johana to meet you
Are you crazy
have no use for a woman
Since my accident
No, no
Johana is visiting me
(tentatively) Bonjour Monsieur
Louis
(she looks to Jacques) (whispering to Johana) Uncle Louis
He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he
'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis
(to Johana) Did you bring the cassettes, the Wagner, the Berlioz
(pointing to Jacques) This idiot never listens to anything say
Sometimes  wonder if he isn't deaf
climbs out of the bathtub, and pulls on a bathrobe
Behind him he's pulling two insulated wires out of the bathtub
We see that they're connected to small underwater speakers
As they surface, incredibly :  the finale of the "1812 Overture", (trumpets, timpani, cannons, etc
) The sound fills the room, the apartment, and probably all of
-  -  -  - The three of them are at the table
There are a few scraps on their plates on a threadbare lace tablecloth
Incredibly    is
is as deaf as a fence post
Everyone has to scream over the music
Where are you from, Henrietta
(correcting him) Johana
New York
What kind of name is that
To be named after a city
(smiling) He doesn't hear too well
(yelling) said  was from New York
(yelling at Jacques) That explains it
The best lays are from New York
Uncle Louis
No, no
It's true
When  was in New York, oh boy
(to Johana) Before my accident, you understand
(then back to Jacques) stands up and lowers the music
(impatient) Uncle Louis
Johana is my friend
She's come to stay with me for a while
Good
That way 'll see more of you
Where are you going to stay
Well
here
(outraged) In my apartment
(with a sigh) It's my apartment
(jumping up) Liar
Thief
Torturer
When you were an orphan  nursed you at my breast
Uncle Louis, we have a guest
'm going to put a lock on the telephone
(them calming down, to Johana) Did you bring the cassettes

(solicitously) You think it'll be all right
You'll be comfortable here
(catching her breath) It's going to be
interesting

(glancing at his watch) It's not like him to be late
Of course sometimes he doesn't show up at all
Once in Capri, he
(interrupting) We get the picture, Roberto
(looks over her shoulder) Jacques,  think Louis needs help
turns around
is a few yards behind them at a fish stand on the dock
He's holding up an eel and screaming at the fishmonger
(yelling) Two dollars for this
This fish wasn't caught
It died of cancer
shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of interfering
(pointing) Here he comes
speed boat races along the water
It's a beautiful highly-varnished mahogany Riva
It races into the port
Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus his hair brushed back by the wind, is
Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive six foot, dark haired beauty
She has a scarf over her hair
She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long
If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make Raquel Welch hide in shame
Her stage name is kills the , swings the speedboat into a perfect landing at the dock
takes the lines
Jacques
Johana
Enzo
Enzo
During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on who is tugging at her long black hair
They're all awestruck except for
(meaning the speed boat) Where did you get that
(meaning Bonita) "That"
This is not a "that"
This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous Spanish actress
(whispering to Bonita) Who is going to be careful with the varnish
(back to Roberto) And who has come to spend a few days with us
(and very quickly) Where's Mamma
(checking watch) You have eight hours before she gets here
glances at his watch and sighs with relief says hello to , kisses
'  - Loud classical music booms from the stereo
The noise pins ,  and  to their chairs
gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody
He's really going totally deaf
'm not as deaf as you are blind, my boy
You take care of your eyes, 'll take care of my ears
(laughing) 'm sorry Uncle Louis
pours him a whiskey
Come on, drink up, my boy
It might just save us from your bullshit
The bottle is empty
goes to the kitchen
turns down the music, and finally hears the bell which has been ringing
opens the apartment door: it's Professor
Suit and tie and carrying a bottle
'm glad you could come
want you to meet Enzo
and  shake hands
(with a smile) So you're the famous Enzo Molinari
(with an even bigger smile) In the flesh
have that honor
- comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting down the blaring music
The paint is peeling off the ceiling
is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make- up in front of ' cracked shaving mirror
You're going to live here permanently
Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little
walks over to the mirror and watches  put on her make-up like a professional
(wistfully) He's shy, not like Enzo
Yes
Not like Enzo
(putting on eyelashes) think, he's really nice
He's a funny guy
sometimes even very moving
(after a long silence) 'm pregnant, Bonita
stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at Are you going to keep it
Yes
Does he know
No
(thinking) Maybe you should talk to him about it
can't
just don't know how to
looks at her with the same pensive look
goes on
was thinking of something kinda stupid last night
You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods
Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan
Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"
(starts laughing) But your man isn't quite a God
(smiles) Probably not, but  still don't have the nerve to tell him
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime
Unconvinced,  nods
She changes the subject
And you
Do you love Enzo
(earnestly) Very much,  think
(a beat) But, there's going to be a problem
- The "problem":    sits between  and , looking like a malevolent storm cloud, staring across at
(desperately) Mamma, calimari fritti
Zuppa de pesci
Sono buoni
(eyeing Bonita) Nothing
'm not hungry
Mamma, Bonita is an actress like Sophia Loren, Anna Magnani
(icy) Sarah Bernardt
sing too
a hell of a Carmen
Want to hear
(coldly) No thank you
There's an interminable awkward silence
Then at last finds his way to the table
who is too grateful for the interruption springs to his feet
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos
(screaming) The whale
How could  forget
Always was something fishy about that woman
is having trouble breathing
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway
Louis, we were French
That's different
What's the matter with you
(complete panic) Mamma, pesce di spada
All of them are gasping for air, trying so hard not to laugh
(to Mamma) Hey, whale
Can you pass down the squids
They all burst out laughing
- The diving platform is out
The competition has begun
is at the gueuse, getting ready to dive works around him busily
on deck above him is making little gestures of encouragement
isn't amused
Other competitors watch from the Committee Boat
turns the handle on the gueuse, plunges into the water
Professor , taking notes, stands a few feet away
- He dives down, further and further down
He approaches the two medics in aqualungs at the control point (210 feet)
They move toward him
- Surfacing
Assistants help him onto the platform
pulls off his fins
rips off his mask
He looks furious
He tosses the depth plaque (which proves he is qualified) back into the water
shit dive
He looks around angrily for an official
Sees
Those goddamned frogmen doctors waiting around at 200 feet they just kill your concentration
They're required by law
(climbing off platform) There's no law down there
The only law is what your lungs can take
(to the next diver) Have fun
They waiting for you down there, to take the temperature of your ass
He keeps on walking across the boat, runs into , who's just about to begin his yoga preparation
sees ' expression, looks concerned
(defensively) Anybody can have a bad day
've had many
when the sea doesn't want you
(disgusted) It's never the sea
It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress
Oh shit
Jacques, what do you know
Go do your Hindu exercises and don't break my balls
stamps into one of the cabins
'  - is reading a child birth catalog
She throws it away upside down, as soon as she hears approaching
comes in and sits opposite her
He seems bitter
Well, how was it
In an involuntary gesture,  flips through the catalog
(sadly) Enzo had a bad day
wonders if  will understand the presence of the baby magazine
(tense) And you
didn't dive
(she takes the magazine) You'll try again tomorrow
don't know
it didn't feel right
'm going to bed
'm tired
He goes away
You forgot your magazine
He hasn't heard
goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the bed
looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two together
What
Nothing
: - bursts out of the water
He rips off his face mask, throws it on the diving platform, roaring with pleasure
He tosses the depth plague to
Let them try
'  - opens the apartment door
is standing there, a suitcase in one hand
wanted to say goodbye, Johana
They kiss each other goodbye
is very uncomfortable
You're leaving
Yes
(she hands her a note) Could you please give this to Enzo
Of course
grabs the note back and tears it up
It's no use
Just tell him  said goodbye
And give him a kiss for me, Okay
The two women hug again
(sorry) Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily
don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma
Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier
rests her hand on ' stomach
Did you tell him
Not yet
'm waiting for the right moment
You take care of yourself, Johana
smiles at her and disappears down the stairs
-  - Officials, , ,  and of course disembark
There is a lot of excitement on the dock
Everyone has already heard the news
People swarm around
spots  in the crowd, and goes to him
(smiling) Good huh
He really was unbelievable, 328 feet, deeper than the world record
(then eagerly) And, Jacques
He held his breath for four minutes and fifty seconds
(smiles too) Good
guess  have tomorrow's work cut out for me as Enzo would say
(seriously) You must be very careful, Jacques
At these depths, to hold your breath for over five minutes is
You'd really be pushing it
think it's very, very dangerous
sees  being carried past on the shoulders of the crowd
He ignores , runs beside
(yelling) Enzo, Enzo
Congratulations
- (in answer to the crowd's applause) Thank you, thank you very much
and  stand on a little stage facing the crowd
is holding a gold trophy, waving to friends in the audience
Now 'm sure you've heard that some people have suggested it is too dangerous for us to continue
Dangerous, because we don't know how to measure the physiological consequences of this type of dive and also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below 300 feet
While the attentive crowd listens to ,  is gesturing to , explaining what appetizers he wants from the cocktail trays
The crowd laughs
But, we polled the free divers and they insist that the competition continue
There's wild applause
lifts the trophy over his head, smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone
(yelling) Good luck to you all
- and  are on the front deck watching the divers
German diver comes up to the surface, empty handed
smiles
The Tahitian comes out of the water in a semi-coma
The doctors carry him away
Once he's sure that the diver is out of danger,  smiles again
whole team of Japanese walk over to the diving platform
The team consists of one diver and six assistants, three of them playing music to help the diver concentrate
The diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his forehead
He is concentrating very hard, so much that walks over to him to make sure he's okay
The Japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he faints
(smiling to his brother) Fabulous, what a dive, huh
smiles
The diver from the Philippines stands at the end of the diving platform
He concentrates for a moment then gives up and walks away
He's right
What's the point of knocking yourself out
-  -  - They're in bed, side by side, both of them half asleep
The only light in the room comes from the open windows
He rolls over and watches her sleep, looking down at her adoringly
He slips off the chain with the gold coin
Slowly, holding the chain, he runs the coin gently over her body, stops at the level of her stomach and lets it rest there
She opens her eyes and looks at him, wondering if he senses something
(softly) What are you doing
'm putting you on the coin
Your essence
That way you'll always be with me when  dive
She smiles, closes her eyes
He swings the coin over her face gently, some kind of private ceremony
She looks just a little intimidated
The coin is now dangling in front of her mouth
She hesitates then opens her mouth,  lets the coin slide into it
- walks up to the diving platform
has fixed scientific equipment on his chest
wets and slowly puts them on
watches from the deck, his expression has changed
, on the deck also, opposite , watches a little worried
concentrates then releases the gueuse and lets himself disappear under the water
dives down very fast
The control takes place at 200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go
He continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker around him
The gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform, just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of bubbles from his oxygen bottles
He asks  if he is alright,  nods and gives him a huge smile before swimming off, downwards
The diver realizes and starts after him
He grabs by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round platform
lets go of the balloon
The diver panics
slowly motions that everything is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface
- The boat's huge stop watch indicates min:  4:50, then 5:00, then 5:10
has been down there for over 5 minutes
is worried sick
doesn't know what to make of it and  feels completely helpless
The stopwatch indicates 5:20, then 5:25 and , half unconscious, brakes through the surface of the water
screams and cries with joy when she sees him
The crowd applauds
is somber
takes the plaque from ' hands and turns to the crowd
(stunned) 360 feet
He dove 360 feet
The crowd cheers in excitement
is sullen
is very worried
- There's a pile of gear on the dock
is in the boat loading one piece of luggage at a time,  comes up to the boat
Parked in the background, we see a taxi waiting with  sitting in the back seat
pretends not to notice ' arrival
watches him for a moment then finally dares to speak
(pointing at taxi) There's a party at the hotel tonight
keeps loading up the boat
(busy) That's good
(after a beat) Enzo, don't be angry
was lucky
that's all
throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit
(serious) 'll see you in Amorgos
turns around and jumps onto his boat
walks off the dock, past the cab
opens the door to let him in, but he keeps walking
Jacques
You go back, 'll walk
He walks off
-   -  - The park is empty as  approaches the pool
the dolphin, jumps out of the water, swims to meet pats her and kneels to talk to (sadly) won today
dove very deep, Tina
The dolphin giggles
What's so funny
Can you dive deeper
The dolphin nods "yes"
smiles
(smiling) So you understand everything
The dolphin nods
That's good
So tell me why they're all angry at me
Why is Enzo angry
never wanted to compete with him
never wanted to be champion of anything
All want is to escape from them all
For just a few minutes, no people
No noise
Nothing but the sea
The dolphin nods and giggles
Do you really understand me
Huh
Are we actually having a conversation here
Again the dolphin nods "yes"
All right then, tell me:  can  ever dive as deep as you
Stay under as long
beat
Then the dolphin nods "yes"
Are you sure
The two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water
They all nod together
is awed and perplexed at the same time
- The little town of Amorgos is beautiful, mountainous
It's surrounded by a luminous turquoise sea, with white villas clinging to hillsides
There is a small port
(we saw it in the opening sequence) Further along the coast, we see the Diving Federation Committee Boat surrounded by all sorts of activity
-  -  - Through the open windows we can see parts of the village where  grew up
He's staring out the window, lost in his own thoughts
It's beautiful, isn't it
Behind him,  is hiding and throwing up
He walks to her
What's wrong
It's nothing
Just the long trip
'm a little jet-lagged
You want to lie down for a while
No, 'll be fine
Can you just hand me a glass of water
While  gets her the water,  stares at the view
'  - stands on the port, waiting for his brother
Suddenly the sound of a motor boat and twelve note horn echoes in the bay
The boat has just arrived at the town dock
, tears rolling down his cheeks from the wind, throws a duffel bag on the dock and looks up at
Is he here
(uncomfortable) He's training
makes a face
- sits on the little dock in front of the hotel
pulls on his fins, looks out into the water
She clutches a stopwatch, ready to set it off
few yards behind, hidden between two bungalows, watches them
takes a few deep breaths and dives a few feet underwater
starts the stopwatch
, who sees  disappear, walks over to  and sits down beside her
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk
What are you doing here
Checking out the competition
Enzo, why do you guys do this
(teasing) What else is there
(seriously) You know what 'm talking about
Why do you and Jacques risk your lives diving
(avoiding the question) You risk your life when you cross the street
(frustrated) Damn it
Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once
Because you'd laugh
won't,  swear
(seriously) dive in search of God
If  go deep enough 'm going to find him
To me, the sea is a religion
That surprises you, doesn't it
(looking down at Jacques in the water) little
You think it's the same for Jacques
(shaking his head) No
Jacques is a creature of the sea
He isn't meant to live on earth, among us
You should know this, Johana
(reassuring herself) He can learn
He is learning
You really think so
Did you tell him you were pregnant
(surprised) How do you know that
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right
shakes her head negatively
Not yet
Don't
Why
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you
Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake
And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish
How long has that moron been down there
(looking at the stopwatch) Five minutes and fifty seconds
(grabbing away the stopwatch) That idiot
They jump up
dives into the water
As  watches panicky,  pulls  up onto the dock, in his arms
is unconscious
is furious
The fear of loosing his friend has absolutely enraged him
He starts pacing up and down the dock
Is he alright
What happened
(furious) The fool was asleep
If  weren't around, he'd already be dead
Is that who you want to live with
Well, good luck
You better learn to look after him because  won't always be here to do it
Once again he marches off, then comes back
(mumbling) How long was  asleep
(to Jacques) Long enough to die
Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay
few steps away, then coming back
(to Jacques) 'll never let you take away my title
'you hear me
Never
stalks off defiantly
- There's activity
The competition has begun
of different competitors at various points in their dives
The Tahitian comes up unconscious
The German comes up unconscious
So does the diver from the Philippines
doesn't know what to think
-  -  - is in a -shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals
wears a light white cotton dress
They both sit on the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea
Below them, a small boat passes
In it are baskets filled with sponges
stares at them for a long time
Do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be
beat
Sure
wants to say something
When you dive
with that machine
What does it feel like
(after thinking about it) The feeling of slipping without falling
The hardest is once you are at the bottom
Why
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again
And always have a hard time finding one
has never looked so sad and lost
doesn't notice
who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to play, staring at the sea
and  turn around and look at him
(smiling) You should start playing the piano, the piano is really refreshing, it clears the sinuses
Very good the piano
Tomorrow is going to be a big day
- He's alone in the bow
The others are clustered in the saloon, cockpit in the stern
The boat is moving close to the cliffs
The monastery looms above them
He's scanning the apparently abandoned monastery searching for signs of life
red and blue taxi-boat pulls up alongside the Committee Boat
In it,  waits to climb on board
- puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse
He is serious, concentrating hard
' boat slides along the big Committee Boat and the  climbs onto it
-  -  - ' briefcase is open
There's a stack of graph paper on a cabin table
When  analyzed the data from Mayol's last dive, it became apparent
(taps the graph paper) At the depths these men are diving, it is a physiological impossibility that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it back to the surface
It's a function of how long it takes to get to the bottom, orient themselves and to return
To attempt to break Mayol's record is simple suicide
(to Novelli) For the last time
'm telling you cancel the competition
and the  look over at the diving platform where  is concentrating
Molinari's a seventeen time world champion
Do you want to tell him he can't dive
doesn't answer
is thinking
Get Mayol in here
- is preparing
He sits at the edge of the platform hyperventilating, almost in a trance
We see  in the background, talking to , he then walks over to  and climbs down next to him
Enzo
(no response) Enzo
know you're angry at me
(no response) Enzo, it's important
opens one eye
'm concentrating
(quickly) We can't dive anymore
They want to cancel the competition for a while
looks at him coldly
Takes another deep breath
(rushing on) It's not safe, they say
The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live
Free diving is over as a sport
You say that because you have the title
No
would never cheat you
Well that's very nice of you
He takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the gueuse, disappears into the water
, , the , and others are arguing
is furious that  is diving
is balling out his assistants
is on the platform watching the others as if they were a gaggle of geese
He listens to the sound of the gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the stopwatches
He knows something is wrong
He walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little oxygen bottle which is there for security
He takes a few breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives down after
- pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand
80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of  coming toward him carrying ' unconscious body
struggles with them, pushes them away, takes in his arms and climbs toward the surface, frantic, screaming silently at him, desperate to get away from the flow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks, the commotion, the memory of death
has a big serene smile on his face
The  push both divers toward the surface
As if they were on land,  starts shaking  to wake him up
He then slaps his face but  remains unconscious
They finally break the surface in each others arms
They pull  out of the water
The doctors open his jacket
motions to  to come close
He still has that long smile
(faintly) You were right
(moved) was right about what
(after a long silence) It is much better down there
It's a better place
He tries to take a deep breath, the effort is exhausting
smiles, holding back his tears
Push me back in the water
(crying) can't
Jacques, take me back down
Please
His smile freezes, he stops breathing
His eyes close
puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs
The doctors gently try to move him away, but resists
Just give him five minutes
What does it matter now, anyway
Come on, just leave him alone
encourages everybody to leave the platform
quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his belt
Before anybody can stop him,  rolls ' body back into the water and dives after it
- He holds  in his arms
Lets the dead weight of the body pull him down, deeper and deeper
The rope around ' waist runs out, stops his descent with an abrupt jerk
When he feels it,  lets go
watches as ' body continues to drift by itself into the bottomless blue
The doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that is attached to
He is unconscious when they pull him up
They hold him up by his feet
throws up gallons of water
They put an oxygen mask on his face
(listening to his heartbeat) The heart is going to stop
The stimulator, quickly
Suddenly, everything collapses for
Sounds disappear
The image slows down, the light fades
only hears his heartbeat, which slows down
His heart stops
Among the crowd around him, he sees , fresh, gentle, smiling
Her movements are smooth and slowed down
She smiles at him, simply
smiles back
The heart starts again slowly
The image goes back to normal
Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc
) and slowly come back
falls unconscious
The heart started again
It's all right
falls back in his chair, relieved
'  - is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever
sits at his feet
rummages through a medical kit
He takes a pill from a bottle and gives it to him
Take this
Have a good sleep
swallows the pills
walks over from the balcony
Sweet dreams
motions to  that they should let him sleep
He goes out of the room
(tenderly to Johana, who had started to leave the room) Kiss me
bends over and kisses him
holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave
Sleep now
We'll talk later
kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room
-   -  - They're at the little zinc bar
Not talking, not really drinking either, just toying with their glasses
passes, stops
've packed all of
Enzo's clothes
(a beat) 'm going to the radio telephone
(swallowing) to call Mamma
They watch sadly as he leaves
- sitting up in bed finally lies down under the sheets
He turns off the light by the bed
-  - They've moved from the bar to the table
There is uneaten food in front of them
third place is set
looks at the wall clock
'll go see how he's doing
Let him sleep
- is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore
He is breathing loudly, as if tired out
From his  the room becomes very dark and blue
The noise is unbearable
The ceiling turns into water
' eyes are wide open
His face is sweating
The water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he is swallowed by it
As he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue
The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/ underwater
They all break through the surface to gulp air regularly
Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group
He crosses the blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds
We see a sonar picture
It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a few seconds later
The dolphin comes up like a rocket, gulps air and goes back down
The sonar image appears again
Finally, the dolphin, locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly like a war plane
He manages to break the group in two, then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim
He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down
He goes full power
The fish he is after are even more divided
There is only one left, totally lost and in a panic
The exhausted fish is swallowed
The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface in slow motion
Images becomes pale and bright
He screams inhumanly
Image is white, black, silence
- opens the shutters
The room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and glasses, lamps and vases
The windows are blown out
is lying in bed
There is a thin trickle of blood coming from his nose and ears
(in a panic) Jacques
Are you alright
-  -  - jumps into ' boat
(still worried) Jacques
Are you alright
Answer me
Are you alright
She jumps down into ' boat
He starts the engine
The boat is racing out of the port
yells over the sound of the engine
You've got to tell me what happened
saw how it has to be
parks the boat in front of the  ' He turns on the platform lights:  above and underwater
He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90, 120 feet
gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position, concentrating
sits down a few feet away and watches him, wondering just how far he is going to push this whole thing
As the cable unrolls,  starts crying
She understands that  is going to dive to the bottom, into the blue, into himself
Jacques, you know  love you
is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his gueuse
(after a silence) Don't be sad
It's not because of you, it's me
It's all going on inside me
(a beat) 've gotta go and see
starts pacing up and down the diving platform
See what
There is nothing to see
It's pitch black down there
It's cold
You'll be all alone
Look at me, Jacques
am here
exist
Look
(she starts waving her arms) 'm real
am not a dream
Jacques will you look at me
(she breaks down) Please
has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing his gueuse
doesn't know what to do or say
She is totally drained
Jacques
'm pregnant
That's good
that's wonderful
It's wonderful for you
You are the father
Silence
is petrified, without any reaction
He doesn't understand
She realizes it's hopeless and stares at the sea
(after a while) lied
to keep you here
She kisses him
Promise me one thing
Anything
Promise you won't forget me
She pulls the line releasing the gueuse
takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse, disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by the ocean
slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of the gueuse
He has a beautiful smile on his face
He is in his element
Night has closed in around him
He turns on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light around him
- has walked over to the edge of the platform
She is holding the cable, to "hear" ' descent
The counter shows that  is quickly passing the 300 feet mark
keeps going down, as serene as ever
He has gained a lot of speed
- holds her face in her hands
The counter indicates that  is going very fast
The gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable turns his body right side up
- The counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet
has felt the jolt of the cable
She cries her tears and looks down at the water
The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet around , as if he were standing in a circle of light
He stays there, patiently floating around and around his cable
as if he were waiting for something
long form circles the border between the darkness and the light
holds out his hand
dolphin comes and presses its body against it
Two other dolphins come out of the night
watches in amazement
dolphin lays his muzzle in ' hand, ready to lead him off
hesitates
lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away
Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night
