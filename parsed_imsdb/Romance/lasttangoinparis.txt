Tough
Whore-fucker, bar-fighter
Super-masculine
And he was tough
My mother was very
Very poetic
And also a drunk

one of my memories, when  was a kid, was of her being arrested nude
We lived in this small town
Farming community
We lived on a farm
And 'd come home after school and she'd be gone
In jail
or something
And
used to used to have to milk a cow every morning and every night and  liked that

There was a farmer, a very nice guy
Old guy, very poor, and worked real hard
used to work in a ditch, draining land for farming
And he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe
Half the time he wouldn't put tobacco in it
And  hated the work
It was hot and dirty and
it broke my back
And
all day long 'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe
And  used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off
And  always lost
never saw it fall off
'd just look around and it'd be gone and then the new one would be there
And then we had a beautiful
My mother
My mother taught me to love nature
And
guess that was the most she could do
And
we had
In front of our house we had this big field
meadow
It was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named Dutchy
And she used to hunt for rabbits in that field but she couldn't see them
So she'd have to leap up in this mustard field and look around very quickly to see where the rabbits were
And it was
very beautiful
And she never caught the rabbits

Sort of
It's funny
It's like playing grown- ups when you're little
feel like a child again here
Did you have fun as a kid
It's the most beautiful thing
It's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy
wasn't like that
No
was writing poems
was drawing castles,
big castles with tower
lot of tower
Did you ever think about sex
37
No
No sex
Paul
"No
No sex

He gives her a   on the head
You were probably in love with your teacher
My teacher was a woman
And she was a lesbian
How did you know
That's classical
Anyway
My first love was my cousin Paul
Paul explodes
No
'm gonna get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names
No names
don't mind if you tell the truth, but don't give me the names
Sorry
Sorry
Well, go on
Tell the truth
What else

He was dark, very thin can see him
Big nose
big romance
fell in love with him when  heard him playing piano
38
You mean when he first got into your knickers
He was a child prodigy
He was playing with both hands
'll bet he was
Probably getting his kicks
We were dying of heat
Oh, yeah
Good excuse
What else
In the afternoon, when the grown- ups were napping
You started grabbing his joint
You're crazy
Well, he touched you
never let him
Never
Ohhhh
Liar, liar, pants on fire, nose as long as a telephone wire
No, 'm not
Look me straight in the face and say, "He didn't touch me once
" Huh
She
He touched me, but the way he did it
39
Aha
The way he did it
, what did he do
Behind the house, there were two trees
plane tree and a chestnut
sat under the plane tree and he sat under the chestnut
And one, two, three
We each began to masturbate
The first who came
won
Paul is suddenly
He wanders to the wall, leans on it and studies his harmonica
(') Why aren't you listening to me
When did you first come
How old were you
The first time
was really late for school
started running and it was downhill
All of a sudden, felt a strong sensation here
So  ran and ran and  came as ran
The faster  ran, the better it was and the more  came couple of days later,  tried to do it again, but no luck
Paul climbs a  that is leaning against the wall
(') Why aren't you listening to me
He takes the   and it comes apart
He
(') Why do  feel like 'm talking to a brick wall when  talk to you
Your solitude weighs on me
It isn't indulgent
It isn't generous
You are selfish
He finally looks at her
(') can be by myself, too, you know
40
He smiles, twirls a drum stick, puts his harmonica on her head and goes into the
She    on the floor in disgust
As he   around the apartment, Jeanne
Paul is  with his
He puts it over his face and  into it
Jeanne has

She hugs the wall
Paul is   , crying harder

It's soothing and nice
Nevertheless, Rosa's mother roams the room, sleepless, a   wrapped around her
Paul sleeps on the couch
She covers him with a the blanket, He   on the floor
' can't sleep with this music

And stayed for five years
' When Papa and  had the hotel, people came here to sleep
Now, there's all sorts
They can hide, take drugs, play music
41
Rosa's mother reaches out and strokes Paul's arm
(') Take your hand away
She continues stroking
' You're not alone, Paul
'm here
He sits up calmly, taking her hand in his own, then She     in obvious pain
'  (') You're crazy
'm starting to understand
Do you want me to make them shut up
'll make them shut up
Paul gets up and
Rosa's mother ,
' What are you doing, Paul

Paul   her in the
What's the matter, Mother

There's nothing to be upset about
It takes so little to make them afraid

He leads her by the  to the stairs
(') They're afraid of the dark
Imagine that
Come on, Mother
Meet my friends
' Put the light on
They look up the stairs to all the  that are out of their rooms
42
You should meet a few clients of the hotel
Hey, folks

Mom, this is Mr Juicehead Junky here
And
Mr Saxophone, he's
He's our connection, Mom
He gives us some hard stuff once in a while

She's afraid of the dark
Oh, poor thing
All right, sweetheart
'll take care of you
'll give you a little light
'll give you a little light
Don't you worry about a thing
Paul turns the lights back on
The  who are gathered on the stairs, scurry back to their rooms
Rosa's Mother stares on as the comes in the front door carrying
This is , (60's) Rosa's
He takes off his hat for her
Good evening, madame
' Good evening
Paul saunters into the room
He surveys the
Good evening, Marcel
Marcel picks up on the awkward energy
He heads up the stairs to his room
Paul hands him a key on the way up
Goodnight, Paul

When the Train leaves, we see her sitting on a bench on the adjacent track
She notices him first
Tom
Jeanne
What are you doing there

He starts
Wait

Why didn't you speak on the phone
What's up
You must find someone else

He takes notice of '
(') Identical
Rosa wanted them identical
Our bathrobes
You can't tell me anything  don't already know
Same colour, same pattern
Yes, yes, yes
Paul takes a look at one of the newspapers from Marcel's desk
50
(') Your meticulous
've always wondered why you save newspaper clippings
Is it work
Or a hobby
Hobby
don't like that word
Let's say it's some extra cash
do it for an agency
Oh, so it's serious
It's a job that makes you read
Very educational
Be honest
You didn't know we had the same bathrobes
Paul finds this
Marcello
He sits on
We've got a lot of things in common
Marcello,  know everything
He flicks the light on and off as he talks
No, Rosa often talked to me about you
don't think there are many marriages like that
It's strange
'm thirsty
He heads to the door
(') Would you like a shot of bourbon
Marcel stops him
Hold on
Here's the bourbon
He takes a    from a hiding place
Paul joins him
He pours a glass for Paul
51
Was that a present from Rosa, too
He    for himself
don't really like bourbon, but Rosa wanted me to keep a bottle here in my room
He  back down
(') was asking myself this question
If, with these little things, unimportant things, we could go back over things, and understand together
Together
It's almost a year that Rosa and Not passionately, but regularly
thought  knew her as much as you can know
Your mistress
For example, a while ago, something happened that  still don't understand
Do you see there, on the wall
He points to a spot on the wall above them
(') She had climbed onto the bed and she was trying to tear at the walls with her hands
stopped her because she was breaking her nails
She had a strange
violence about her
'd never seen her like that
Our room is painted white
Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel
Marcel takes some   from his bathrobe pocket
52
(') To make it look like
a more normal home
But
it had to be changed here, too
think she started with the wall
Paul takes notice of the   operation
cold sore

Shit
Paul regards him for a second
You're lucky huh
You were
You must have been very handsome 20 years ago
Not as much as you
You've still got all your hair
My hair

And wash it
wash it nearly every day
Don't you have massages
He massages his own temples
Yes,  do
You're in good shape
He paws at Marcel's stomach

your stomach
That's my problem
For that
He gazes across the room

He gets up and heads across the room
Tell me
He takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on the top of a
(') Ah

Ah

Why was she unfaithful to you
You can't believe that Rosa
killed herself
It's hard for me to
believe, too
While Paul has a moment of , Marcel shows him his -   combo on his - bar
This is my secret
Thirty times every morning
Paul leaves,
() Really, Marcello,  wonder what she ever saw in you

Paul continues eating
She comes out and    on the floor in front of him
It makes me crazy
She sits on the floor and opens a  door on a cabinet
We see '
(') That you're so damned sure that 'm coming back here
He laughs at her
She sits on her , then her ass

He

She looks up just in time to see that Jeanne has found her fathers gun and is pointing it in her direction

We get another look at Jeanne's   as it slips out of the dress being fitted
Tom fires off  for film purposes
(') So,
how do you see marriage
Marriage
Yes
Jeanne gives her upbeat   as her fitting continues
see it everywhere
All the time
66
What do you mean, everywhere
On walls
On buildings
Walls and buildings
Yes, on advertising hoardings
What are they selling
Cars
Tinned meat
Cigarettes
No
They're all about young couples
Before marriage, no children
Then the same couple, married with children
In short, marriage
The perfect, ideal, successful marriage
It's no longer the preserve of the Church
The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged
Now, weddings in advertising smile
They smile
On posters
On posters, of course
But why t take poster marriage seriously
Marriage
Pop marriage
Tom comes out from under a
Pop
That's the formula
For pop youth, pop marriage
But
what if the pop marriage doesn't work
Then you have to fix it like you would a car
The spouses are two workers in overalls bending over an engine to fix it
And in case of adultery what happens to the pop marriage
67
In that case, there are three or four workers
What about love
Is love pop
No
That's not
Love isn't pop
Love isn't pop
So what is it
The workers retire to a secret flat, take off their overalls and become men and women again and make love
The fussing on the dress is finished
Jeanne slowly, , relishing them
She  slowly for all to stare and  her in her dress
Tom is
