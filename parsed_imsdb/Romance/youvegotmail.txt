You've Got Mail You've Got Mail by Nora Ephron & Delia Ephron Based on: The Shop Around The corner by Nikolaus Laszlo 2nd Final White revised February 2, 1998 : We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a sky that's just beginning to get light
There are a few stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big computer sun starts to rise
We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading over a computer version of the New York City skyline
We move over Central Park
It's fall and the leaves are glorious reds and yellows
We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and turn onto a street in the West 80s
Hold in front of a New York brownstone
At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the words: As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage increase from 0% to 100%
When it hits 100% the image pops and we are in real life
- Early morning in New York
couple of runners pass on their way to Riverside Drive Park
We go through the brownstone window into: '  - is asleep
Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and fresh as a spring day
Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized bed and a desk with a computer on it
Bookshelves line every inch of wall space and overflow with books
Framed on the children's classic
Madeleine
As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend   walks into the room
He wears blue jeans and a workshirt
He's carrying the New York Times
Good morning
(as he reads) Listen to this -- the entire work force of the state of Virginia had to have solitaire removed from their computers -- Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the bathroom, and we stay with Frank
(continuing) -- because they hadn't done any work in six weeks
Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe
Aren't you late
(continuing) You know what this is, you know what we're seeing here
We're seeing the end of Western civilization as we know it
This is so sad
She tosses him his jacket
(points at her computer) You think that machine is your friend, but it's not
(checks his watch) 'm late
- '  - As Frank walks to the apartment door
We see a charming room with a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a typewriter with a cover on it
(
) 'll see you tonight
Sushi
(
) Great
Bye
Frank goes out the door
It closes
Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing from sight
She walks into: '  - And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the street and turns toward Broadway
He's gone
Good
She sits down at her computer
An expression of anticipation and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse
- As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's code name: Shopgirl
She logs on and the computer makes all its little modem noises as the computer dials the access number and connects and we hear the machine: Welcome
And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to hear: (cont'd) You've got mail
And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up: - We see a list of letters: Big Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time
: You can turn $20 into $20,000       : Maximize your selling ability nowwwww
NY152 Brinkley Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters -- all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen
Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for " 152 Brinkley"
And the letter comes up: To: Shopgirl From: NY152 Re: Brinkley Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud: Brinkley is my dog
He loves the streets of New York as much as  do -- And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of 152, a man named   -- (
) -- although he likes to eat bits of pizza and bagel off the sidewalk, and  prefer to buy them
Brinkley is a great catcher and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm team -- (continued) '  - dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor
This is
The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it
Brinkley's master,  , a great-looking guy, full of charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself some orange juice
He's half-dressed
(cont'd) -- but he chose to stay with me so that he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on a large green pillow the size of an inner tube
Don't you love New York in the fall
It makes me want to buy school supplies
would send you a bouquet of newly-sharpened pencils if  knew your name and address
On the other hand, this not knowing has its charms
Darling -- Mmmmmhmmm -- Joe's girlfriend  , in Armani head to toe, comes into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine, which starts grinding beans
She's carrying the morning papers
'm late
(indicating the newspaper) Random House fired Dick Atkins
Good riddance
Murray Chilton died
Which makes one less person 'm not speaking to -- (she drains a cup of espresso as a second starts to come out of the machine) Vince got a great review
He'll be insufferable
Tonight,   dinner -- Am  going
You promised
Can't  just give them money
That's the cause
Free Albanian writers
'm for that
Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him
All right, 'll go
You're late
know  know  know
She tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her
Hold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and close on the landing outside
'  - As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs on
&   () Welcome
You've got mail
And as he starts to read his letter, we hear: (
) like to start my notes to you as if we're already in the middle of a conversation
pretend that we're the oldest and dearest friends -- as opposed to what we actually are, people who don't know each other's names and met in a Chat Room where we both claimed we'd never been before
'  - As Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his elevator man
There's a certain amount of Good morning, etc
, as the elevator goes down and the voice-over continues: (
, ) What will he say today,  wonder
turn on my computer,  wait impatiently as it boots up
- As Joe comes out of his building
(
, ) go on line, and my breath catches in my chest until  hear three little words: You've got mail
And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to: - (
, ) hear nothing, not even a sound on the streets of New York, just the beat of my own heart
have mail
From you
- As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street and starts downtown
Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind her
As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the West Side of Manhattan in the morning
Mothers and fathers taking their kids to school, people on their way to work, dogs being walked
School buses picking up kids, bakery trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of unopened restaurants
Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the newsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times
Metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons, the pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant, Zabar's
Joe stops at the same newsstand
He buys all the papers -- the Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News
- As Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out
- As Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind her
She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to the Ease side of Columbus Avenue
- building under construction, with plywood board covering the front and wrapping around the corner
Joe goes to a side entrance and enters
& 73RD  -  - As Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in front of her store, a children's bookstore called "The Shop Around the Corner
"  It is an irresistibly inviting store
There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large stuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good Night Moon, Where the Wild Things Are
teddy bear in a pinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out
Waiting for Kathleen in front is one of her employees,
Hello, Christina
It's a beautiful day
Isn't it the most beautiful day
Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first time
guess
Yeah, sure
Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which rises, making a horrible noise
Two cabs almost collide in front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts yelling obscenities at the other
Kathleen unlocks the door to the store
Don't you love New York in the fall
Christina looks at her puzzled
- Kathleen turns the  sign on the door over to read "" and she activates the computer system
She looks around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore, with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read, some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc
There's a playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best Witch List"  and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of Oz
" On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops
Kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and suddenly stops to daydream
smile creeps onto her face
Christina looks at her
What's going on with you
Nothing
You're in love
In love
No
Yes
Of course  am
'm in love with Frank
'm practically living with Frank
Do you think you could get our Christmas mailers out this week
By Monday  promise
have a paper due Friday
Now what's going on
(she looks at Kathleen) 'm just going to stand here till you tell me
beat
Is it infidelity if you're involved with someone on -mail
Have you had sex
Of course not
don't even know him
mean cybersex
No
Well, don't do it
The minute you do, they lose all respect for you
It's not like that
We just -mail
It's really nothing, on top of which 'm definitely thinking of stopping because it's getting -- Out of hand
Confusing
But not really
Because it's nothing
Where did you meet him
can't even remember
(off Christina's look) The day  turned thirty  wandered into the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of and he was there, and we started chatting
About what
Books
Music
How much we both love New York
Harmless
Harmless
Meaningless
(starts smiling) Bouquets of sharpened pencils
Excuse me
Forget it
We don't talk about anything personal
We made a rule about that
don't know his name, what he does or exactly where he lives, so it will be really easy to stop seeing him, because 'm not
God, he could be the next person to talk into the store
He could be
(as George walks in) George
, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed to look in the mirror when he gets dressed
Morning
Are you On Line
As far as 'm concerned, the Internet is just another way to be rejected by a woman
walks in
She is in her seventies, has white hair, and is tiny, like a little sparrow
She is the store's oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years, and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson
Good morning, Birdie
What are you all talking about
Cybersex
tried to have cybersex once but  kept getting a busy signal
know,  know
One Saturday night  was really depressed about not having a date, so  thought, no problemo, 'll go on line and  won't be lonely, but couldn't get on, there were hundreds of thousands of people who didn't have dates trying to get on
() You have to wonder which is harder, getting a date or getting On Line when you don't have a date
Getting a date is harder
We hear the bell jingle as     come in with two
(to the kids) Jessica and Maia, how are you today
We hear the sound of the garbage truck
Kathleen goes out the front door to: - As the commercial garbage truck pulls up and start to load her trash
Hey, you forgot to pick up the garbage last week and  got a ticket
And you're late today --  could have gotten another
#1 We were here, there was no garbage
#2 Yeah
Of course there was -- #1 What do you think,  don't want to pick up garbage
You think  go up and down the street picking up garbage, 'm not going to pick up yours
What's the matter with you
#2 Yeah
Kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied
#1 You don't even bundle it right, you're supposed to bundle it and leave it near the curb, you leave it near the store and you use cheap garbage bags, they smear all over the place, and then  got to pick it up with my shovel -- - As Christina, who's helping one of the customers, looks out the window as the harangue continues
- #1 And now you're busting my chops
You're just another garbage pick-up to us, okay
#2 Yeah
As Kathleen continues to stand there, speechless
- As Kathleen comes back into the store
Christina is ringing up a sale
That guy went ballistic on me
hope you told him off
Not exactly
Another customer enters the store
The bell jingles
- little truck carrying a knife sharpener, its bells ringing, passes the building under construction
- , , , , etc
in the process of building what looks like a large store
Wires hanging everywhere
The electrical contractor called
His truck hit a deer last night, he won't be in 'til tomorrow
The shelves are late because the shipment of pine had beetles
And there's some question about whether we're installing the stairs in the right spot -- That sounds great
Testing one two three four
Is the electrician here
just told you -- he hit a deer
hear nothing
Not a sound on the city streets, just the beat of my own heart
think that's the way it goes
Something like that
(beginning to glean something) Did you and Patricia get engaged
Engaged
Are you crazy
thought you liked Patricia -- love Patricia
Patricia's amazing
Patricia makes coffee nervous
(suddenly all business) Are we still on schedule
We open two weeks before Thanksgiving
guess we should announce ourselves soon
Tell people we're coming
This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan
The minute they hear they'll be lining up -- -- to picket -- -- the big bad -- --chain store -- -- that destroys -- -- everything we hold dear
But we'll seduce them with our square footage and our deep armchairs and our amazingly swift checkout lines and our discounts and our
& (the trump card) -- cappuccino
They hate us in the beginning, but we get them in the end
Meanwhile we should just put up a sign -- Coming soon, a Foxbooks Superstore and The End of Western Civilization As We Know It
-   - Joe is in the office with his father,  , and his grandfather,
The office has been recently redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone
On the wall we see the Foxbooks logo
Kevin and  are both a little concerned about the neighborhood response -- (suddenly notices the garish couch) What is this fabric
Does it have a name
Money
Its name is money
Gillian selected it
Of course
Your father is getting married again
Oh, great, congratulations, Dad
Why
Who knows
Why does anyone get married
Love
Yes, that is one reason
think you're a damn fool
Dad, Matthew is four
It would be nice for him if his parents were married
Annabel is eight and 'm not married to her mother
can't even remember her mother's name
(he laughs merrily) have a very sad announcement to make
City Books on 23rd Street is going under Nelson, Shuyler, and Joe high-five each other
Another independent bookstore bites the dust -- On to the next
And 'm buying their entire stock -- architecture, New York history -- for the new store
How much are your paying
Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as this exquisite mohair episode
(indicates the couch) We're also going to have a section on West Side Writers -- -- as a sop to the neighborhood
Perfect
It'll keep those West Side liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding hearts -- Readers
They're called readers
Don't romanticize them
It'll keep them from jumping down your throat -- What's the competition
One mystery store
Sleuth, on 86th and Amsterdam
And a children's bookstore
The Shop Around the Corner
Been there forever
Cecilia's store
Who's that
Cecilia Kelly, lovely woman
think we might have had a date once
Or maybe we just exchange letters
You wrote her letters
Mail
It was called mail
(fondly nostalgic and kidding it slightly) Stamps
Envelopes
Wait
've heard of it
It was a means of communication before  was born
Exactly
Cecilia had beautiful penmanship
She was too young for me, but she was
enchanting
Her daughter owns it now
Too bad for her
As a  walks into the office carrying a pile of upholstered pillows, and Joe turns to look at them
() Welcome
You've got mail
(
) My father is getting married again
For five years he's been living with a woman who studied decorating at Caesar's Palace
() You've got mail
- Kathleen looks up from her book as a butterfly flies through the subway car
(
) Once  read a story about a butterfly in the subway, and today  saw one couldn't believe it
It got on at 42nd -- (continued) The train comes to a stop
The butterfly flies out
(
) -- and got off at 59th, where  assume it was going to Bloomindale's to buy a hat that will turn out to be a mistake
As almost all hats are
&   - flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground
(
) Did you know that every night a truck pulls up to & Bagels and pumps about a ton of flour into the ground
The air is absolutely amazing
As Joe comes around the corner and sees the dust filling the air
It is amazing
(
) guess 've read Pride & Prejudice about 100 times -- '  - As Joe reads a copy of Pride and Prejudice
He can't stand it
(
) -- and every time  read it  worry that Elizabeth and Mr
Darcy are not going to get together -- but the truth is whenever think about my favorite book  always think about the books  read as a child -- - As Kathleen takes a copy of Homer Price off the shelf
(
) Did you ever read Homer Price
My all- time favorite children's book
(continued) She opens it to the illustration of the doughnut machine that won't stop making doughnuts
(
, cont'd) There's a doughnut machine in it that won't stop making doughnuts, they just keep coming down the chute just as regular as a clock can tick
- (
) Have you been to Krispy Kreme
(continued) Joe, eating a doughnut, looks through the window at the huge doughnut machine as the doughnuts roll down the chute just as regular as a clock can tick
(
, cont'd) There's a doughnut machine right in the window that makes 110 dozen doughnuts an hour
- As Joe leaves with his morning coffee
-   - Joe goes to his painter at work:   is as far as he's gotten
- She enters Starbucks
- As Kathleen buys her morning coffee and listens to everyone ordering
We can hear the sounds of Starbucks: "Short decaf cap,"  "Tall mocha latte
"  "Grande lowfat regular
"  Etc
- The painter is further along on the sign
It now reads: ,    -- Kathleen walks past the construction site
She doesn't really pay attention to the sign painter
We see two police cars barreling up 75th Street, followed by a television news truck
- The police cars and  truck barrel uptown
101st  - They turn left onto West 101st and stop in front of an apartment building on the block
There are more police cars and a horde of television reporters with microphones, etc
George emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts
The body of a woman was found this morning on the roof of a New York building
As George comes out of his building into a horde of with microphones, cameras, etc
and listens to the reporter, who, seeing George, sticks the microphone into his face
Here is a resident of the building
Your name, please
George Pappas
Did you see or hear anything unusual last night
No
didn't go out
At that moment, George sees a young woman
This is He is struck dumb
The victim was red-haired, about thirty- five, wearing a jogging suit
Did you encounter anyone by that description in the building
Sir
George hasn't heard a word
Have there been any wild parties lately
George doesn't answer
Could it perhaps be one of your neighbors
George continues to stare at the beautiful woman
As he does, she notices him
She stares back
The reporter, ignored, finally turns away
(to camera) As you can see, no one here knows anything
He continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment
Meredith Carter starts to walk away
- As George walks along Broadway, past the sign, which now says: " :   "
He sees it
Kathleen and several  in the store
George walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat
Christina is unpacking boxes
Birdie is at the desk
George looks at Christina meaningfully
(totally mystified) What
The coup de foudre had one never believed in them, but  just had one
Is that the thing where you get cold suddenly, bang
No, that's the coup de vieux had that
The coup de foudre is where you get love suddenly, bang
thunderbolt
had that too
Only  had it in Seville, where it was called , el estruendo de amor don't know her name, or anything about her
may never see her again
And if you ever do meet her, you'll find out all the horrible details, and that will be that
She'll turn out to have pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the walls
won't care
Kathleen sticks her head into the back
Can someone help me out here
George had a coup de foudre And Christina's making fun of me
Don't let her
believe in this, completely believe in this
It happened to Madame Bovary, at least six times
And she was wrong every time
Yes
(beat) Who was she
don't know
She was standing outside my building with the police and the reporters
What police and reporters
Someone died
Who
have no idea about that either
They found her on the roof
dead body
That's so sad
But you fell in love
That's so great
Oh
One other thing
- The sign is now complete and it says: "Coming soon, just around the corner
Foxbooks Superstore
" Kathleen and George and Christina stand there looking at it
Quel nightmare
It has nothing to do with us
It's big, impersonal, overstocked and full of ignorant salespeople
But they discount
But they don't provide any service
We do
George and Christina nod
- Kathleen is having lunch with Birdie
So really it's a good development
You know how in the flower district, there are all these flower shops in a row so you can find whatever you want
Well, this is going to be the book district
If you don't have it, we do
And vice versa
'  - Kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries
Frank is standing there, plugging in an Olympia Report deluxe Electric typewriter
When you are finished with Foxbooks, the Shop Around the Corner is going to be responsible for reversing the entire course of the Industrial Revolution
That is so sweet, Frank
Thank you
That is so sweet
Hey -- He holds his arms out
They hug
Although
What
(over his shoulder, she notices the typewriter, breaks from the hug) What is that doing there
Listen to it
Just listen-- He strikes a key
Practically swoons
The Olympia Report deluxe Electric Report
As in gunshot
That sound is familiar
Now listen to this
He puts his ear to the typewriter
Kathleen listens too
That whirring
The gentle and soothing lullaby of a piece of machinery so perfect -- know where 've heard it before know
She whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table
It's the same machine exactly
needed a backup
Don't you have another one at your apartment
might,  might
So what
You're turning my apartment into a typewriter museum
'll stop
'll try
probably can't
see one and my knees go weak
Anyway, what were you starting to say
When
Before
Nothing
Come on
don't know
was just wondering about my work and all
mean, what is it  do exactly
All  really do is run a bookstore -- All you really do is this incredibly noble thing -- Kathleen nods
But  don't know if  -- (stopping her) Kathleen -- But  just -- You are a lone reed
Kathleen looks puzzled
He sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing
You are a lone reed waving in the breeze standing strong and tall in the corrupt sands of commerce
He whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands it to her
(reading from it) am a lone reed
(tries it on again) am a lone reed
Clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom
- We hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the next room
Kathleen walks past her computer, looks at it
Then she goes over to the window, looks out at her street at dusk
'  - group of schoolgirls in uniform, in two straight lines, walk past with a tall woman
'  - She goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines marching through the streets of Paris
She looks at it, then looks up, lost in thought
We hear the sound of the computer keys
(
) Sometimes  wonder about my life
lead a small life
Well, not small, but circumscribed
And sometimes  wonder, do  do it because  like it, or because haven't been brave
So much of what see reminds me of something  read in a book, when shouldn't it be the other way around
(continued) And hold on her as she thinks about this
In the other room, we hear Frank typing
Kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on
'  - As we see Kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure barely lit by her computer
(
, cont'd) don't really want an answer
just want to send this cosmic question out into the void
So goodnight, dear void
- Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches and chairs in cozy seating arrangements
Kathleen is standing at the front counter with Christina, getting drinks
went to the Foxbooks Website and you can buy anything
They ship it to you in a day
Maybe we should get a website
My mother would never have wanted us to have a website
"Every book you sell is a gift from your heart
"  She always said that
As they walk toward the back of the cafe, Kathleen notices a stack of loose-leaf binders on the table
What if they put us out of business
It's out of the question
We're a fixture in the neighborhood
We're practically a landmark
(indicating the binders) Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for Women -- what is this
You fill out one of these forms and they file it in the book and if someone wants to meet you, they arrange it
What a stupid way to meet someone
Compared to the Internet
My little thing on the Internet is just a lark
So it's still going on
And  do not plan to meet him
(indicating the book) Why do  get the feeling that you are in here somewhere
Christina flips the book open to her application
came in here one night and drank too much coffee and filled one out
(off Kathleen's look) Well how am  supposed to meet someone
You are a runner
Some day you will make eye contact with another runner and -- No one ever even looks at me
They don't
On top of which, who are they
They could like the symphony
could never fall in love with someone who likes to go to the symphony -- know
What are you supposed to do there
don't know
Sit
You're supposed to sit
could never fall in love with anyone who smokes cigars either
'll tell you what  hate
Big fat legs like stumps
Yeah
hate that too
The worst, the worst --  could never, under any circumstances, love anybody who had a sailboat
Neither could
If  had to get up on Saturday morning knowing that  was about to go down to the pier and unravel all those ropes and put on all that sunblock -- All that talk about the wind
And then you have to go out on the boat, and you sail and sail and sail until you are bored witless, and then, only then, do they say, let's turn around and you realize the trip is only half over, only it's not, because the wind has changed -- It hasn't changed
It's died
So then there's more talk about the wind
While you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous
And when you finally get back, you have to clean up the boat
Why don't people have boat maids
know
There're all these people who wouldn't be caught dead polishing a doorknob in their house but put them on a boat and they want to rub down everything in sight
19TH    - Joe is on his sailboat
He is polishing his brass and whistling
Joe -- Joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his grandfather's daughter , 8, who is coming toward the dock with , his father's overdecorated 32-year-old fiance, her son, , 4, and the Nanny,
Hello
(picks up Annabel) Annabel, how are you today
Great
(picks up Matt) Hey, big guy -- Don't  get a hello
Hello, Gillian
Kiss me
'm going to be your wicked stepmother
Joe gives her a peck on the cheek
Who is this
Nanny Maureen
brought her in case you couldn't handle the kids
Maureen's getting a divorce
'm sorry to hear that
It's my own fault
Never marry a man who lies
That is so wise
Remember that, Annabel
She taught Matt to spell his name
Fox
--
Excellent, Matt
(to Maureen) Good work
You can have the day off
'll take over from here
(to Gillian) You must be late for something
Volunteer work at the Henry Street Settlement
Packing bandages for Bosnian refugees
course in Chinese literature at Columbia
am
'm having my eggs harvested
- There's a block street fair with little booths, sausage sandwich concessions, etc
Annabel and Matt have been to the makeup booth
Annabel is a cat and Matt is a pirate
Annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward Broadway
'  - As Joe, Annabel and Matt walk past
There's some sort of toy miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store and a sign lit with twinkle lights: Storybook Lady today 3:30
'  - Kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of , including Annabel and Matt, who are crammed into her store
Joe is watching, along with some  as Kathleen reads from a Roald Dahl book
'  - Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book
Kathleen is showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy
This is her best friend Tacy, whose real name is Anastasia, and then in the next book Betsy and Tacy become friends with Tib, whose real name,  am sorry to tell you, is Thelma
In another section of the store: George is showing Joe a first edition of Swiss Family Robinson from the glass case
The illustrations are hand-tipped, which is why -- It costs so much
It's why it's worth so much
Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole shelf of Betsy-Tacy books
want all of them
That might be an awful lot for your dad to buy at one time
My dad gets me all the books  want
(looking over at Joe) Well, that's very nice of him
That's not my dad
That's my nephew -- Oh,  don't really think that's your nephew -- As Joe approaches
It's true
Annabel is my aunt
Aren't you, Aunt Annabel
Annabel nods solemnly
And Matt is -- Let me guess
(to Matt) Are you his uncle
No
His grandfather
Annabel and Matt start giggling
(cont'd) His great-grandfather
(shouting with glee) 'm his brother
Annabel is my grandfather's daughter
And Matt is my father's son
We are an American family
He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back
Annabel suddenly sneezes
Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve
It's an old fashioned hankie that's embroidered
She offers it to Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled
What is that
handkerchief
Oh my, do children not even know what handkerchiefs are handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw away
My mother embroidered it for me -- you see
My initials and a daisy, because daisies are my favorite flower
Orchids are my favorite flower
(to Joe) You know what else children don't know
They don't know what a telephone booth is
Joe is looking at Kathleen
Who are you
Kathleen Kelly
own this store
Are you are
Joe
Just call me Joe
(quickly) We'll take these books
He gets the one Matt is reading
And the two other Kathleen has gotten for Annabel
These are wonderful books
As Annabel gets older the characters in the books do, too
(to Annabel) You can grow up with Betsy
You're going to come back again, aren't you
Of course
This is why we're never going to go under
Our customers are loyal
(by way of explanation) They're opening a Foxbooks around the corner
Foxbooks
My Daddy -- (gently putting his hand over her mouth) -- likes to buy at discount
Don't tell anyone that, Annabel, it's nothing to be proud of -- (spelling) --
That's amazing
You can spell fox
Can you spell dog
--
Matt, look at this dinosaur book
Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book
Annabel, maybe you could read this to Matt while  wrap things up here
(moves them to a corner, to them quickly) Sit down, read, and don't listen to anything  say
Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash
And the dinosaur book too
The world is not driven by discounts, believe me
've been in business forever
started helping my mother here after school when  was six years old
used to watch her, and it wasn't that she was selling books, it was that she was helping people become whoever they were going to turn out to be
When you read a book as a child it becomes part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your life does
(stops herself) guess 've gotten carried away
You have, and you've made me feel
He can't finish the sentence
He looks at her and sees, behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen
(cont'd) Enchanting, your mother was enchanting
She was
How did you know that
Lucky guess
Anyway
She left the store to me, and 'm going to leave it to my daughter
How old is your daughter now
Oh, 'm not married
But eventually
She smiles at Joe
So Foxbooks can
Go to hell
(handing him his books) Here you go
We ready
Annabel and Matt join him at the counter
Kathleen gives them each a lollipop
Bye, Kathleen
Goodbye, Annabel
Bye, Matt
What about cat
Can you spell cat
--
- Someplace like the auditorium at the Museum of Broadcasting
, Joe's girlfriend, who is the editor-in-chief of a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing at a podium at a sales conference
In the audience are sales reps, wholesalers, etc
There's a screen behind her with pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks
(cont'd) And now, the book you've all been waiting for, the book it's been my dreams to publish
The legendary Veronica Grant has written her memoirs -- There's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant flashes on screen
(cont'd) -- and 'm happy to report it is just crammed with tragedy
(she laughs gaily) Just kidding, but seriously, it's all here: poverty, addiction, divorce, tracheotomies -- We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc
(cont'd) -- her third husband beat her up, hip replacement, and an amazing face lift where all the injected fat fell to her chin
Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of Veronica on it and the title: "Am  Rising from Ashes, or Did Just Forget to Dust
" (cont'd) This book is fabulous
And even if it weren't, it would sell like crazy, because Veronica is going to plug it to death on every talk show in America
This book
Patricia bursts into tears
(cont'd) 'm sorry
can't talk about it without crying
Veronica and  have so much in common -- well, not all the sad parts -- but we were both famous by the time we were 29 and, believe me, that's rough
(wipes her nose with a Kleenex, pulling herself together) Anyway,  just want to say that 'm especially thrilled to be publishing it
Veronica lives in my building and we met in the elevator
By the time we had traveled from the eighth floor to the first, we had a deal
First printing: one million copies
Everyone applauds enthusiastically
- Patricia is leaving, still surrounded by colleagues and sales reps congratulating her
She is the soul of graciousness
Her assistant, Sarah, comes up
(quickly) You have a dentist appointment in twenty minutes
So you should leave soon
What's my car number
Car
You didn't say anything about a car -- Are you an idiot
Of course  need a car
God
She walks toward the exit
57TH  - Patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab
She spots one across the street
Taxi
Taxi
Taxi
She whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle
The cab makes a -turn, but instead of stopping for Patricia it stops about twenty feet ahead for a  in an overcoat who gets into it
Excuse me -- what are you doing
This is my taxicab
(to the driver) Don't take him
am telling you right now, and  am memorizing your number, don't take him
(to the man) Who the fuck do you think you are
Are you going uptown
Yes
Get in
'll drop you
- As the cab turns onto Eighth Avenue, starts uptown
Patricia is dialing her cell phone
She's elaborately ignoring the man who stole her cab
Veronica, it's Patricia, you should have been there, it was unbelievable, we're going to sell truckloads of your book
Call me
She hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse as the cab moves on
Are you an editor
Yes
am a rabbi
Oh, my God,  said fuck to a rabbi
'm sorry
hope you don't mind my asking, but are you Jewish
Yes
You should come to our temple
'm not really religious
Oh,  am surprised, you seem like a very religious person
You're kidding, right
We are at West End Avenue and 83rd Street
Every Friday night, we have a joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone singing
Also some wisdom
Perhaps you have heard of us, we are known as The Singles Temple
He smiles at her
It's a very good place to calm down
The cab stops
Oh, look,  am already here
Very nice to meet you
(gives the cabbie money) Take this woman to her destination
He gets out
Closes the door
beat too late: Goodbye
'  - Frank comes up the stoop
'  - Kathleen is dressed up for a party
Frank walks in, looks meaningfully at her
saw him
actually saw him
Who
can't believe it
saw William Spungeon
thought he was in Mexico
Maybe he's in Mexico, but today he was in New York
The most brilliant and reclusive novelist in the history of the world is here, in this neighborhood
He may be living on this very block
Where did you see him
was on the subway -- - (
) -- and this musician got onto the train -- Frank is sitting on the subway, reading the Village Voice
The door between the cars opens and a man playing the clarinet enters the car
No one looks up except Frank
(
) -- and  suddenly saw him, sitting directly across from me doing the crossword puzzle
(
) How'd you know it was him
(
) He looked exactly the same as his high school yearbook picture, which happens to be the last photograph ever taken of him
Frank takes out his billfold on the subway, pulls out a piece of paper
- As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture of William Spungeon at 17
Frank compares the photo of Spungeon with the person sitting across the way
They don't look remotely alike except that the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both wearing the same style glasses
The subway stops at 79th Street, and William Spungeon gets off
Frank follows
- As Frank comes out of the subway station and looks around
So  followed him
Frank sees Spungeon cross 79th
He follows
&  - Frank follows Spungeon, who hurries into & Bagels passing a holding a paper cup at the door
(
) He went into & and bought a bagel with everything
&  - As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding
Spungeon drops his newspaper in a garbage container
(
) He dropped his crossword into the garbage and  rescued it
Frank plucks the puzzle from the trashcan, follows Spungeon
- Spungeon at the counter in the shoe store
(
) Then he went into a sporting good store and bought tube socks, 6 pair for $7
99
We see Frank, peeking out at him from behind a stack of running pants
Suddenly he's distracted by a couple of joggers
(
) William Spungeon and tube socks
(
) know
don't want to dwell on it
Frank looks back at the counter
Spungeon's gone
(
) And then  lost him
'  - Frank waves the crossword puzzle in front of Kathleen
Do you know what this is worth
He takes an empty instant-frame from the closet, puts the puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters
- As the two of them eat dinner
What  was thinking as  was trailing him was that eventually  would have the courage to say hello to him, you know, not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more like, "Hi
"  "How ya doing
"  "Have you ever thought about trading up in the sock area
"  "Who knows, maybe he's read my work -- and then we'd become friends, and eventually 'd introduce him to you -- you know how much he loves children's books, there's a whole long section in Relativity's Smile about The Wizard of Oz -- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding so he could help save the store
What are you talking about
From Foxbooks
mean, if things got tough, he could help rally support -- It's never going to get to that
The store is fine
- As they walk along after dinner
don't even know why you would say that
Neither do
It just flew out of my mouth
There's enough business for us all
- As they go up in an elevator
mean, we're fine
You're more than fine, you're absolutely fine
We're fine
The elevator opens onto: '  - publication party for an author named
mix of book people, journalists and various other media folk
Hey, Vince
Congratulations
You know Kathleen Kelly
How are you
Guess who  saw today on the subway
William Spungeon
thought he was in Mexico
They start chatting
Across the room, Joe is with Patricia, who is telling two other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab
Joe looks over and sees Kathleen
He suddenly looks stricken
Shifts his position so Kathleen can't see his face, but sneaks a look
Would you get me another drink, sweetie
'm all out
(continues chattering) So then the rabbi says, "It's a very good place to calm down
"  Isn't that hysterical
They all laugh
Joe moves over to the bar
Absolut on the rocks
As he is waiting, Kathleen comes up next to him
white wine, please
(very friendly) Oh, hello
Hi
Remember me, from the bookstore
Of course  remember you
How's your aunt
Good
She's good
(gets his drink) have to deliver this
have a very thirsty date
She's part camel
Kathleen laughs
Joe
It's Joe, isn't it
And you're Kathleen
Joe vanishes into the party
'  -  - can't believe you were talking to Joe Fox
Joe Fox
As in -- She can't even finish the sentence
'  - Joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room
Fox
Your last name is Fox
Joe spins around, looks at her
--
God,  didn't realize
didn't know who you -- (she trails off) -- were with
(quoting) " didn't know who you were with
" Excuse me
It's from the Godfather
When the movie producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the emissary of Vito Corleone -- (continued) Kathleen is staring at him
(cont'd) -- just before the horse's head ends up in his bed never mind -- You were spying on me, weren't you
You probably rented those children
Why would  spy on you
am your competition
Which you know perfectly well or you would not have put up that sign saying "Just around the Corner
" The entrance to our store is around the corner
There is no other way to say it
It's not the name of our store, it's where it is
You don't own "around the corner
" Next thing you'll be using twinkle lights
Twinkle lights
Little white Christmas lights that twinkle
use them in my window and on all my displays, as if you didn't notice
Look, the reason  came into your store is that  was spending the day with Annabel and Matt
like to buy them a present when  see them because 'm one of those guys who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relatives
There was only one place to buy children's books in the neighborhood -- although that will not always be the case, and it was yours, and it is a charming little bookstore
You probably sell $250,000 worth of book a year -- How do you know that
'm in the book business
'm in the book business -- Oh,  see, and we're the Price Club
Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive oil for $3
99 that won't even fit into your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap books
Me a spy
(beat) Absolutely
And  managed to get my hands on a secret printout of the sales figures of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet full of its own virtue that  was instantly compelled to rush over and check it out for fear it would drive me out of business -- Kathleen stares at him
She's speechless
(cont'd) What
(off her look) What
Kathleen shakes her head
Frank turns up
Hi
'm Frank Navasky -- -- Joe Fox
Joe Fox
Inventor of the Superstore, enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of City Books -- tell me something: How do you sleep at night
Patricia joins them
use a wonderful over-the-counter drug, Ultrasom
Don't take the whole thing, just half, and you will wake up without even that tiniest hangover
You're Frank Navasky, aren't you
Yes
Your last piece in the Independent, the one about Anthony Powell, was brilliant
'm Patricia Eden, Eden Books
Joe, this man is the greatest living expert on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg -- And this is Kathleen Kelly -- Kathleen glares at him
You liked my piece
God, 'm flattered
You know you write these things and you think someone's going to mention them and then the whole week goes by and the phone doesn't ring, and you think Oh, God, 'm a fraud, a failure -- You know what's always fascinated me about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how old they looked when they were really just our age
Everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at Patricia, who smiles at them all
(to Frank) 'm so happy to have finally met you
We will talk
Have you ever thought about doing a book
Oh sure, it's passed through my head
Something really relevant for today like the Luddite movement in 19th century England
At the same time: Patricia -- Frank -- '  - As Kathleen and Frank get into bed
really like Patricia Eden
She's a very nice person
Kathleen doesn't respond
Frank turns out the light
She needs educating, that's all
beat
She's hopelessly driven by money and power, but there's a hope for anyone who's that familiar with my work -- On Kathleen, as she turns away from Frank and lies there, eyes open
'  - As Joe and Patricia get into bed
Brinkley is already on the bed
had no idea that Frank Navasky was so down-to-earth
Joe doesn't respond
Patricia turns out the light
You read his stuff, you think he's going to be so obscure and abstruse
beat
(cont'd) He's always talking about Heidigger and Foucault and  have no idea what any of it's about, really
Joe gets up
Brinkley follows
(cont'd) Where are you going
'm not really tired
'  - Joe writes on his computer
Brinkley on the floor next to him
And cut between Joe and his computer screen
(
) Do you ever feel you become the worst version of yourself
That a Pandora's Box of all the secret hateful parts -- your arrogance, your spite, your condescension -- has sprung open
Someone provokes you, and instead of just smiling and moving on, you zing them
Hello, it's Mr
Nasty
'm sure you have no idea what 'm talking about
'   - And cut between screen and '  - As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter
Kathleen hits the Reply key and starts to type: (
) know what you mean and 'm completely jealous
What happens to me when 'm provoked is that  get tongue-tied
My mind goes blank
Then  spend all night tossing and turning trying to think of what  should have said
'    '  - As he replies: (
) Wouldn't it be wonderful if  could pass all my zingers to you and then  would never behave badly and you could behave badly all the time and we'd both be happy
On the other hand,  must warn you that when you finally have the pleasure of saying the thing you mean to say at the moment you mean to say it, remorse inevitably follows
Do you think we should meet
'     - Kathleen stares at Joe's letter in her computer
She's frozen
Meet
Omigod
She sits staring at the letter
She has no idea what to do
75TH  &  - As the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie
The pharmacy
The optician
The cosmetics supply store
The video store
And now, finally, we see the new grate on the new Foxbooks Superstore start to open upwards
This is the finest grate on Broadway, no question of it
It's electric and almost soundless
We see a sign saying,
35% -
People on the street notice the store
One walks in
follows him
- The inside is beautiful
Gleaning staircase, a cafe, comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven cash registers with seven cashiers
Of course, books, books, books, as far as the eye can see
: - The store is jam-packed
Joe with his father Nelson, his grandfather Schuyler, and Kevin, the store manager
No pickets, no demonstrations
The neighborhood loves us
They're wondering where we've been all these years
They're wondering how they ever did without it
It's a hit
They admire their own store, walk through the downstairs and start up the staircase to the second floor
How's the children's book department
It's early yet
School isn't out
And there's that children's bookstore nearby -- Cecilia's store -- Her daughter's -- We'll crush it -- She was enchanting
And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children come up the stairs behind them
- little group of children dressed as Pilgrims walk down the street as Kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning paper
Joe is at the newsstand
She turns and pretends to be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and walks on
(
) don't think it's a good idea for us to meet
- Joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as Kathleen comes in
He pretends he didn't see her
(
, cont'd) love our relationship
There's a lot going on in the day-to-dayness of my life and there's something magical
- We see Kathleen and George at the end of the day, counting the receipts
Birdie is using a calculator to total them
Christina is shelving books
There are Thanksgiving decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on colonists like Myles Standish
(
, cont'd) and thrilling about this island in cyberspace  have with you '
About $1200 less than the same week last year
That could be a fluke, right
They look at each other
Or not
Their store is new
It's a novelty
But it will all shake out
Do you think should put up more twinkle lights
That's a lovely idea
What if we have to fold
'll never find another part time job and  won't be able to pay the rent and 'll have to move to Brooklyn
The joy of rent control
Six room for $450 a month
We know
You've told us a million times
can't believe you're bringing it up at a time like this
It's like bragging because you're tall
Birdie never brags about her rent and she pays even less than you
Ten rooms
just rattle around from one to the other
Hey, guys
We are not going to fold
The door opens, and Meredith Carter, the woman George had swooned over in front of his building, walks in
George stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him
George Pappas
( have died and gone to heaven) Yes
(flashing her badge) Detective Carter, 23rd precinct
'd like to ask you a few questions
Kathleen suddenly sees George, following Meredith out of the store
He's in a complete daze
George
Where are you going
He goes out the door
, a well-known children's book author, enters as George leaves
Kathleen, are you surviving
Laura
We're so excited about your new book
When should we schedule your signing
Oh, it's being published in January
Are you going to be in business in January
'm so worried
We're doing great, aren't we
Great
No difference whatsoever
Thank God
Well, you know you can count on me
For anything, support, rallies
Picket lines
We can get the Times to write something
Or that nut in the Independent -- What nut in the Independent
Frank Navasky
This is just the sort of thing that would outrage him
She smiles brightly
- George and Meredith are sitting in a booth
Mr
Pappas, 'm investigating the murder of the woman found on the roof of your building
Do you live alone there
Do  live alone
Yes  do
Do you live alone
Yes
George takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were the eighth wonder of the world
He starts stroking it, caressing it
Meredith pulls it away
beat
Then she gives it right back to him
He continues stroking
They stare at each other
He puts her fingers into his mouth
(overwhelmed) What are you doing
don't know
have no idea
You have to stop
can't
She utters a little moan
'  - They come into the apartment
She throws herself into his arms
- As Christina runs, desperately trying to make eye contact with men running in the opposite direction
No one will look at her
'   - The place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before Thanksgiving
Kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way through the crowd in the cheese department
As she reaches across three people to grab some Brie, she sees Joe walk into the store
Quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her
She stands there frozen
beat
Peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere
Cranes her neck this way and that
No Joe
'   - Kathleen, now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all disguised, looks around and spots a short line and makes a beeline for it
At that moment, Joe comes from the Appetizing Department and gets on the line she was heading for
Panicked, Kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with her back to him
- The  totals up Kathleen's purchases and Kathleen hands over her credit card
This is a Cash Only line
What
Cash Only
Omigod,  only have a credit card
Is that okay
Of course it's not okay, there's a sign
There's a sign
(to the person behind her) She doesn't have cash
"She doesn't have cash" is repeated all the way down the line
Joe turns to see what's going on
Get on another line, lady
Oh, hello
Hello
Do you need some money
No,  don't need any money
Thank you very much
Get on another line
Hi
(off her nametag, big smile) Rose
Great name
Rose, this is Kathleen, 'm Joe, and this is a credit card machine
Happy Thanksgiving
Rose just stares at him
(cont'd) Now it's your turn to say happy Thanksgiving back
Happy Thanksgiving back
Joe looks at her, winks
Mississippi is a hard word to spell
How do you spell it
-
(big smile) Now take this credit card and put it through the machine, zip zip
The cashier, completely charmed, takes Kathleen's credit card
Kathleen is appalled
Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly
So you're fine
Fine
Happy Thanksgiving
As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly starts to put her groceries into a bag
' '  - An elegant East Side apartment
Schuyler, his youngish French wife, , Nelson, Gillian and their child Matt, and Joe are sitting and listening as Annabel sings Tomorrow
The sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be sun -- Joe is on a loveseat with Matt
Gillian lifts Matt up, sits down in his place next to Joe and plunks Matt into her lap
Nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat and can't see her without turning around
As she continues singing, Gillian moves her hand next to Joe's leg
Joe edges away
He looks around the room, sees Nanny Maureen standing behind the couch
He stands, offers her his seat
She sits
'   - much more informal Thanksgiving dinner
We see the leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in Kathleen's living room
Kathleen, Frank, Birdie, Christina, George and George's new girlfriend, Meredith and    are standing around the upright piano
Birdie is playing a Christmas song, and everyone is singing
As the singing continues, over, we cut to: - As the Christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the window
Birdie walks by the store
She stops to look at the customers inside, and then notices a sign in the window: "Book Signing January 10 - Best Selling Children's Author Laura Margulies
"  There's a picture of Laura Margulies
- Kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with lovely decorations from a box
Two people are carrying a tree home, there's the sound of church bells
Kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store, carrying Foxbooks shopping bags
Then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the computer
(
) This is such an odd Christmas
find myself missing my mother, who's been dead for ten years
New York at Christmas is so loaded with all the things we used to do -- - 1972 - As Young Kathleen, dressed in a little velvet dress, sits in the audience next to her mother watching the ballet
(
cont'd) -- going to the Nutcracker -- - 1972 - (
cont'd) -- ice skating at Rockefeller Center, where  was knocked into a 6-year-old maniac -- --  knocks into her
Hey, watch out -- -- Me watch out, why don't you watch out
'm not sliding around like a baby
You think  come here to skate with babies
Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied
(
) My first experience as a speechless person
Her mother skates up and takes her hand
The boy skates off
(
) always miss my mother at Christmas, but somehow it's worse this year since  need some advice from her
And we hear the sound of another computer
' As he replies to Kathleen
(
) My mother took me ice skating too -- - We see a little boy,  , 8, skate past holding someone's hand -- (
, cont'd) -- although my mother did not skate
The nanny skated -- And we now see ' , a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as ' absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section
- 1972 - (
) And  was in the Nutcracker
We see the stage now
There's Young Joe, among the children at the Christmas party
(
, cont'd) So was my nanny
As '  #2 pirouettes past
(
, cont'd) Different nanny
By the way, 'm surprised you aren't a writer
Although you probably are a writer and don't know it
Are you a writer and don't know it
'  - 1972 - Young Joe, at the dinner table with his father
wide shot of a big room with a huge table and servants
Joe looks very small at the table as he eats his soup
(
, cont'd) My mother died when  was ten
was staying with my father, who is not famous for intimacy, and whose way of breaking the news of her death was to tell me she would not be coming to pick me up as usual
It was a car accident, and don't know where she was going or who she was with, and  assume what  owe her is my tendency to cover almost any emotion with a joke
useful gift, unless you want to know what you're feeling
She was very beautiful
People toss that word around a lot, but my mother was
The camera moves closer to the dining table
We see that tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks
'  - Joe stops typing
He is surprised to find his eyes watering
moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved himself to tears
Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off
Starts typing again
(
, cont'd) Ancient history
So what kind of advice do you need
Can  help
'  - Kathleen in bed with her laptop reading Joe's letter
She starts to type a response
Suddenly there's harp arpeggio and an Instant Message flashes on screen
From  152 - (
) had a gut feeling you would be on line now
'  - Joe is in bed with his laptop
And cut back and forth between them and their computer screens as they type Instant Messages to one another
Possible split screens
(
, cont'd) can give you advice
'm great at advice
(
) don't think you can help
(
) Is it about love
(
) My business is in trouble
My mother would have something wise to say
(
) 'm a brilliant businessman
It's what do best
What's your business
(
) No specifics, remember
(
) Minus specifics, it's hard to help
Except to say, go to the mattresses
(
) What
(
) It's from The Godfather
It means you have to go to war
- (to herself) The Godfather
She starts to type
(
) What is it with men and The Godfather
(
) The Godfather is the  Ching
The Godfather is the sum of all wisdom
The Godfather is the answer to any question
What should  pack for my summer vacation
"Leave the gun, take the cannoli
"  What day of the week is it
"Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday
" And the answer to your question is "Go to the mattresses
" (continued) - (cont'd) You're at war
"It's not personal, it's business
It's not personal it's business
"  Recite that to yourself every time you feel you're losing your nerve
know you worry about being brave, this is your chance
Fight
Fight to the death
'  - Patricia comes in as Joe is waiting for Kathleen's response
Look what  bought
Joe types "Ciao" and signs off
Looks up to see Patricia showing him a Plexiglas menorah
was just passing this store on Columbus Avenue and it caught my eye
What is it
Menorah
It doesn't look like a Menorah
know
don't know what came over me
don't even celebrate Hanukkah
'  - As Kathleen logs off, Frank comes in
Frank, 've decided to go to the mattresses
Do you think it would be a gigantic conflict of interest if you wrote something about us
- It's January
The store is more crowded than we've seen it
Frank is there with several copies of the Independent
The phone is ringing off the hook
Christina and George are fielding calls
Birdie is reading Frank's article
(reading) "Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia Kelly have raised your children
If this precious resource is killed by the cold cash cow of Foxbooks, it will not only be the end of Western civilization as we know it, but the end of something even dearer: our neighborhood as we know it
Save the Shop Around the Corner and you will save your own soul
"  Frank, that's charming
You think it's a little over the top
Just say thank you
Thank you
(calling to Kathleen) Channel 2's outside
-      - Kathleen is primping in a tiny wall mirror
She takes a deep breath
In a second
(from the other room) The Village Voice is coming
Omigod
Frank sticks his head in
(in shock) It's him
Who
God
It is God
- Kathleen comes out of the storage room
William Spungeon is standing there
'm William Spungeon
'm very pleased to meet you
'm Kathleen Kelly
Frank is practically levitating
knew your mother
Although she knew me only as
That enormous bookstore is obscene
'm Frank Navasky
carry your picture in my wallet
He pulls it out
Spungeon looks at him like he's crazy
We've organized pickets
Channel 13 is doing a special
'd be glad to talk to the press if it's all right with you
They've been trying to interview me for years
The press
'm the press
You'd allow that
For me
For the store
That's incredible
Although you wouldn't have to be photographed respect that
If it's television, they could just put one of those blurry dots in front of your face
No television
(referring to the  crew) They're waiting for you -- know all your books
Phaelox the gnome, the little man who comes from nowhere
and is going nowhere
(quoting) "Where did you come from
"  "Nowhere
" "Where are you going
"  "Nowhere
" Cool it
'm starting to break out in hives
(to Kathleen) Here's my phone number
had no idea William Spugeon had a phone
Adios
He gives a little wave and leaves
This is historic
(beat) Do you realize what 've done
By writing that piece, do you realize
've brought William Spungeon in from the cold
Holy shit
am completely amazing
At that moment a   sticks her head into the store
Kathleen Kelly
Kathleen takes a deep breath, walks out the door
- 2 Are you ready, Miss Kelly
Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes
2 What
Never mind
'm ready
Shoot
- 2 We're here in front of the Shop Around the Corner, the famous West Side children's bookstore now on the verge of having to close its doors because the big bad wolf, Foxbooks, has opened only a few hundred feet away, wooing customers with its sharp discounts and designer coffee
They have to have discounts and lattes, because most of the people who work there have never read a book
And pull back now to reveal that we're in: - Five  sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching
She's not as nice as she seems on television
You've met her
She's kind of a pill
She's probably not as attractive as she seems on television either
No, she's beautiful
But a pill
So you don't feel bad about basically destroying her livelihood not to mention her legacy not to mention her raison d'etre
It's not personal -- It's business
Right
Exactly
They look up at the television
- Joe onscreen, with a super: Joe Fox, Vice-President Foxbooks
sell cheap books
Sue me
sell cheap books, and as a result -- listen to this, because it's really bad -- more people can buy books
The show immediately cuts back to the newscaster
On Joe and Kevin
That's what you said
(outraged) That's not all  said
said --  can't believe those bastards --  said we were great,  said people can come and sit and read for hours and no one bothers them, said we stock 150,000 titles,  showed them the New York City section
said we were a goddamn piazza where people could mingle and mix and be
piazza
was eloquent
Shit
It's just inevitable, isn't it
People are going to want to turn her into Joan of Arc -- -- and you into Attila the Hun
Well it's not me personally, it's more like it's the company -- (on the television) And  have to say,  have met Joe Fox, who owns Foxbooks, and  have heard him compared his store to a Price Club and the books in it to cans of olive oil
On Joe, reacting
small rally is taking place, with picket signs
Kathleen is standing on a small speaker's platform, along with the Borough President
My mother used to say to me that every book you sell is a gift from the heart
- As 20  march in front of the store, holding little makeshift picket signs and singing songs
"One, two, three, four, we don't want this Superstore
" Customers go right through the line and into the store
- We can hear the pickets marching and singing outside -- although the store is full of customers anyway
The Fox men -- Joe, Nelson and Schuyler -- are sitting in the cafe
Nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper, which has the old high-school yearbook picture of William Spungeon on the front page and a headline: William Spungeon Emerges from Hiding to Support Bookstore
Who is this Spungeon anyway
He's a writer
Well, 've never heard of him
And neither has anyone else in this place
- As we see - , a young and attractive talk show hostess for a show called Inside Media
- The New York Literary world was shocked this week when William Spungeon, the most famously reclusive author since
Salinger, announced that he was coming out of hiding because of his loyalty to a small children's bookstore on the West Side of Manhattan
Discussing this tonight is a man  happen to think of as one of this city's most underappreciated assets, Frank Navasky
Thank you
- This all happened because of you, didn't it -- Well,  knew William Spungeon loved children's books so  wrote a provocative column -- - Your specialty
Frank laughs
Sidney-Ann laughs
And it kind of smoked him out
'  - As she and Frank watch the television show
Technologically speaking, the world's out of hand
Take the
The whole idea of a  is that it makes it possible for you to tape what's on television while you're out of the house
But the whole point of being out of the house is so you can miss what's on television
Radio
Now there's a medium  can get behind
- Well, we're on television
and you're good at it
Thank you
Another little moment between them
- The bookstore
Tell us about it
Are you planning to collect radios
- Do you think  should
The Shop Around the Corner is a true New York treasure
- As are you
'd love to have you back
Any time
Are we done
- Not at all
Because  just want to say that the only show  do watch is yours
(appalled) Omigod
Hey,  was just being polite
Okay, admit,  slobbered all over her
The show continues
- As we see Kathleen flip the open sign to closed
- George is talking to Kathleen and Birdie, who is toting up the week's receipts
And  can't decide whether to put sausages into the meat sauce or just chopped meat
Last time  made it, Detective Carter and  never even sat down to dinner because -- (he makes some sort of hand gesture indicating that sex prevented them from dining) and last night,  made margaritas in the blender, and  took the ice cube and -- Spare us
George goes out the door
Birdie looks at Kathleen
Don't tell me
Not the slightest difference
Birdie can't bring herself to answer
(cont'd) How could that be
All this publicity and not one bit of difference
Oh Birdie, what am  going to do
What would Mom have done
Let's ask her
She opens the locket hanging around her neck
There's a picture of Kathleen's mother inside it
Birdie holds the locket up to her face
Cecilia, what should we do
Birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens
pause
Birdie
Shhhh
(after a beat, shrugs) She has no idea, but she thinks the window display is lovely
Good night dearie
Birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the door
- It's starting to rain
Kathleen lowers the grate over the store
As she turns to walk away, William Spungeon steps in her path out of the shadows
Oh my goodness, hello
What are you doing here
Loitering
Lurking
Skulking
Stalking
He laughs
So does she
Dramatically, he whips out an umbrella and opens it over the two of them
(cont'd) You look very beautiful
Thank you
But 'm a wreck
He touches her cheek suddenly
Kathleen starts
Then he blows on his hand
An eyelash
It's gone
Kathleen relaxes
They start walking
Are you writing another book
'm in the home stretch
'll be done in approximately six more years
Should  discount
It's about a man on a quest for knowledge who meets a woman he cannot resist
If  discount  have to fire someone because  can't discount with this overhead but whom could  fire couldn't fire anyone
Spungeon suddenly puts his hand through Kathleen's hair
She stops, frozen in place
You have your mother's hair
Thick, wild, the color of Nebraska wheat
He grabs her and tries to kiss her
What are you doing
Let me go
He backs her into a wall
Stop it
Are you crazy
She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away
(calling after her) If you change your mind, you can -mail me
Hermit@
com
- The mail form says "To:" and Kathleen types in " 152"
The form says "Re:" and Kathleen types in:  "Advice" '  - Rain is falling
(
) need help
Do you still want to meet me
'  - Rain is falling
We hear the sound of the computer
(
) "Where
When
" - George, Kathleen and Christina in the shop
Kathleen is buying more lollipops
We're meeting in a public place
Well don't go anywhere with him
Don't even go out to the street with him afterwards
Get a dial cab to just sit there and wait for you
Did you tell Frank
There's nothing to tell
But did you tell him
He's away
At the 32nd anniversary of the Chicago Seven trial
And he's gone to a place where there are no phones
Do you even know this guy's name
Kathleen shakes her head no
And you're going to meet him in a bar
Not a bar
That place on 83rd with the cheesecake
And he will wear a flower in his lapel, and you will be carrying a copy of Anna Karenina with a rose in it
No answer
Oh God, no
Not Anna Karenina
Pride and Prejudice
- As Joe and Kevin walk out of the store and start downtown
suppose she's carrying a copy of a book with a flower in it
Joe doesn't say anything
Not really
Really
Which Jane Austen is it
Pride and Prejudice
She could be a real dog
know
Look, 'll just stay ten minutes
'll say hello
Drink a cup of coffee and split
'm outta here
He looks at Kevin
(cont'd) Walk me there, okay
83RD  - As the two men walk toward Cafe Lalo, the European cafe on West 83rd Street
What if she has a really high, squeaky voice
hate that
It reminds me of those mice in Cinderella
What mice in Cinderella
Gus-gus and oh shit,  can't remember the other one
Why am  compelled to meet her
'm just ruining a good thing
You're taking it to the next level always do that
always take a relationship to the next level, and if it works okay  take it to the next level after that, until  can finally get to the level where it becomes absolutely necessary for me to leave
'm not going to stay long anyway already said that, didn't
Christ
'm a total wreck
As they reach: - Joe stops and looks at Kevin
Kevin, this woman is the most adorable creature  have ever come in contact with
If she turns out to be even as good-looking as a mailbox,  will be crazy not to turn my life upside down and marry her
She could be a real dog
(a total panic) You go look
Me
Just go to the window and check her out
You're pathetic
Kevin goes to the window and looks inside
- Joe and Kevin in front
Kevin looks in the window
See her
There's a beautiful, whoa, a very beautiful girl
Yes
But no book
Let me see, let me see
Wait a minute
There's a book with a flower, so it must be her
What does he look like
There's a waiter blocking,  can't see her face
He's serving her a cup of tea and she's putting in three spoonfuls of sugar -- Well, why shouldn't she
No reason
Unless she has hypoglycemia
Oh, he's moving
Can you see her
Yes
And
-- (clearly frustrated) She's very pretty
She is
knew she would be
She had to be
She looks
would say she has a little of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly person
Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore
Why not
You said you thought she was attractive
So what
Who cares about Kathleen Kelly
Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly, can tell you right now you ain't gonna like this girl
Why not
Because it is Kathleen Kelly
Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks
Oh, God
long beat
What are you going to do
Nothing
You're going to let her just wait there
Yes
Yes  am
That's exactly what 'm going to do
Why not
But she wrote the letters
Good night, Kevin
'll see you tomorrow
He walks away, leaving Kevin
Kevin stares after him
Then he walks away in the other direction
- Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her tea
She's starting to feel a little foolish
She checks her watch
loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next to hers
They're laughing
man from the group grabs the empty chair at Kathleen's table
Do you mind
Kathleen jumps up
Oh, yes
'm expecting someone
Please
She takes the chair back
Sits down again
She watches the group as they playfully fight over the menus
She checks her watch again
Then she opens her copy of Pride and Prejudice and looks at it
She can't focus
man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at him
But he's going to meet another group of people
As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower onto the floor
Oh
She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were precious china
In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears
He watches, as she rearranges the book and the flower
He disappears from sight
beat
He walks in the door
Kathleen Kelly
Hello
What a coincidence
Mind if  sit down
Yes  do
'm expecting someone
Joe picks up her book, looks at it
Pride and Prejudice
Kathleen grabs it back
Do you mind
She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it
didn't know you were a Jane Austen fan
Not that it's a surprise
bet you read it every year
bet you just love Mr
Darcy, and that your sentimental heart beats wildly at the thought that he and whatever her name is are really, honestly and truly going to end up together
Would you please leave
Joe sits down
Please
'll get up as soon as your friend comes
Is he late
The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the greatest, most complex characters ever written, not that you would know
As a matter of fact 've read it
Well, good for you
think you'd discover a lot of things if you really knew me
If  really knew you,  know what  would find -- instead of a brain, a cash register, instead of a heart, a bottom line
Kathleen is shocked at herself
What is it
just had a breakthrough, and  have to thank you for it
For the first time in my life, when confronted with a horrible, insensitive person  actually knew what wanted to say and  said it
think you have a gift for it
It was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness
Meanness
Let me tell you -- Don't misunderstand me, 'm just paying you a compliment
He lifts the book off the table
Kathleen grabs for it
Why are you doing this
She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose
What have we have
red, no, crimson rose, tucked into the pages
Something you read about in a book, no doubt
One of those books with a lady in a nightgown on the cover about to throw herself off a cliff
She holds her hand out for it
(cont'd) Give it to me
Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache
It's a joke to you, isn't it
Everything's a joke to you
She grabs the rose
Puts it back in the book
(cont'd) Please leave
beg you
He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very next table, with his back to her
The door to the restaurant opens
Kathleen looks at it hopefully
pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined by a pleasant looking woman
For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the wind has just gone out of her sails
She takes out her compact, looks into her mirror
She slides it over to look behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her
He turns away suddenly
Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief
You know what the handkerchief reminds me of
The first day  met you -- The first day you lied to me -- didn't lie to you -- You did too -- did not -- thought all that Fox stuff was so charming
--
never lied about it -- "Joe
Just call me Joe
"  As if you were one of those stupid 22-year-old girls with no last name
"Hi, 'm Kimberley
" "Hi, 'm Janice
"  What's wrong with them
Don't they know you're supposed to have last names
It's like they're a whole generation of cocktail waitresses
She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off on
But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her table
am not a stupid 22-year-old girl -- That's not what  meant -- And when  said the thing about the Price Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't what  meant either -- Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire feel so sorry for you
The door opens and a large and very attractive in a boa comes in the door
am going to take a wild guess that this isn't him, either
Who is he,  wonder
Not,  gather, the world's greatest living expert on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, but someone else entirely
Will you be you be mean to him too
Will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt from the blue, find that sharp little tongue of yours
No,  won't
Because the man who's coming here tonight is completely unlike you
The man who is coming here is kind and funny -- he has the most wonderful sense of humor -- But he's not here
If he's not here, he has a reason, because there is not a cruel or careless bone in his body
can't expect you to know anything about a person like that
You've nothing but a suit
beat
Joe gets up
That is my cue
Good night
Joe leaves
'   -- Kathleen comes down the street
She drops the rose in the trash can
'  - Kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her coat and goes immediately to the computer
She clicks on American Online
Waits impatiently to connect
Looks with anticipation at the mail box
- Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face
She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her face and blows her nose
Then looks at her handkerchief and tosses it over her shoulder
She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of her shoes
Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed
She reaches up to turn out the light
'  - As Joe turns on his closet light and hangs up his jacket
The computer is on the desk, and the light on it illuminates the room
Patricia is in the next room, eating matzos
(
) So  said to her, "If you think  will even talk to you about paying that kind of advance for an author whose last book is being used as trivets all over the world, you are completely crazy
" On Joe's face, barely bearing
- As Kevin and Joe walk through the store
But underneath that disagreeable exterior she could turn out to be -- real bitch
Let's not talk about it
'm going back to the office
You must have work to do
Not really
This place is humming like a top
- As Kathleen comes around the corner
Christina is waiting
What happened
He never came
He stood you up
As Kathleen puts her purse into the drawer
think something happened, something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him -- George walks in
What happened
He wasn't able to make it
He stood you up
What could have happened
(continued) George looks suddenly stricken
(cont'd) Why didn't he come
Maybe he showed up, took one look at me and left
Not possible
Maybe there was a subway accident
Absolutely
train was trapped underground with him inside
And no phone
George continues to look stricken
He's starting to shake his head
Or an automobile accident
Those cab drivers are maniacs
They hit something and you slam right into that plastic partition
His elbows could be in splints -- so he can't really dial -- Or he could be in the hospital in one of those semi-private room with like -- & (together) -- no phone
They look at George
Still shaking his head
(to George) What
George hands them a New York Post
They look at the cover: What are you saying
It could be
Dead silence
(cont'd) He was arrested two blocks from the cheesecake place
Is there a picture
There it is
It's of a man with his jacket pulled over his head
They all look at it
So that explains it
He was in jail
And there was a phone -- -- but he got only one call and he had to use it to call his lawyer
You are so lucky
You could be dead
Are you crazy
This man couldn't possibly be the rooftop killer
Remember when you thought Frank might be the Unabomber
That was different
How long did you sit there all alone
Not that long
Joe Fox came in -- Joe Fox
don't want to talk about it
(closes her eyes) Let's get to work
They look around
There's no one in the store and nothing to do
pause
There must be something to do
There's always something to do
They hear the jingle of the front door
They look hopefully toward it
It's only Birdie
He stood her up
Hold on Kathleen as the computer sound begins
(
) have been thinking about you
Last night  went to meet you and you weren't there
wish  knew why
felt so foolish
(continued) '  - As she types
And we cut from her face to the screen as we hear a voice-over: (
) And as  waited, someone else showed up, a man who has made my professional life a misery, and an amazing thing happened -- was able, for the first time in my life, to say the exact thing  wanted to say it
And of course, afterwards,  felt terrible
Just as you said  would
'  - The -mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads
(
) was cruel, and 'm never cruel
And even though  can hardly believe what said mattered to this man -- to him, 'm just a bug to be crushed -- but what if it did
No matter what he's done to me, there's no excuse for my behavior
Anyway, you are my dear friend, and  so wanted to talk to you
hope you have a good reason for not being there last night, but if you don't, and if we never really connect again,  just want to tell you how much it has meant to me to know you were there
Joe sits there a second
moment of intense ambivalence
Then he hits the Menu key and signs off
Goodbye
Joe stands and leaves the room
The computer sits there
Hold on the computer
We hear him open the refrigerator door
We hear him close the refrigerator door
He passes the den without even looking into it
moment later he comes back into the room, stares at the computer
He starts for the bedroom, changes his mind
Circles the computer
He's going to go cold turkey if it kills him
Fuck it
He sits down
Sign on
Starts to type
(
) am in Vancouver
He stops
Hits the delete button and erases the message
He starts typing again: (
) was stuck in a meeting, which couldn't get out of it, and there was no phone
He backspaces to erase "there was no phone
" Screen now reads:  was stuck in a meeting, which  couldn't get out of it
Joe sits there thinking for a moment
Then he starts typing
(
, cont'd) The electricity went out in the building and we were trapped on the 18th floor and the telephone system blew too
He stops and looks at it
Then he types: (
, cont'd) Amazingly enough
He sits looking at it
Then he deletes the whole thing
Sits looking at the blank screen
Fuck you
He clicks the Yes box
Then he starts to type again
(
) Dear friend:  cannot tell you what happened to me last night, but  beg you from the bottom of my heart to forgive me for not being there
He deletes "for not being there
" Then types again, after "to forgive me"
(
) -- for what happened
feel terrible that you found yourself in a situation that caused you additional pain
But 'm absolutely sure that whatever you said last night was provoked, even deserved
And everyone says things they regret when they're worried or stressed
You were expecting to see someone you trusted and met the enemy instead
The fault is mine
(continued) - As Kathleen and Christina walk down the street together
(
, cont'd) Someday 'll explain everything
Meanwhile, 'm still here
Talk to me
Did he say anything about meeting again
Not really
It doesn't matter
We'll just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs
Patrick Campbell and write letters our whole lives -- They go into an apartment building
'  - large rent-controlled West Side apartment
Birdie is pouring tea
There's a plate of cookies
Christina is looking at the picture of Birdie as a young woman, dressed in a sort of Carmen Miranda getup
Where was this taken, Birdie
Seville
When you had the thunderbolt
Yes
What did you decide, dearie
Close
We're going to close
Close
Although it feels like such a failure
It feels like 'm quitting
It feels like
Mom
She closes her eyes
Birdie sits down on the loveseat next to Kathleen, puts her arms around her
Hold on them
Keeping the store open doesn't keep your mother alive, although sometimes  think we all think it does
Christina looks over at the picture of Birdie
Who was it, Birdie
That you had the thunderbolt over
Birdie shakes her head
She's not going to tell them
(cont'd) It's so romantic
But it wasn't meant to be
Why not
He ran Spain
Spain
The country
He ran it
That was his job
And then he died
Just as well
- As Frank and Kathleen go up the escalator, on their way to a movie
She fell in love with Generalissimo Franco
Don't say that
We don't know that for sure
Who else could it have been
It was probably around 1960 -- mean, it's not like he was something normal, like a socialist or an anarchist or something -- It happened in Spain
People do really stupid things in foreign countries
Absolutely
They buy leather jackets, they go see Flamenco, they ride in gondolas, they eat in restaurants where guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa, but they don't fall in love with fascist dictators
They enters one of the theatres
- As they find seats and sit down
trailer is playing
Birdie is a very kind person, she's practically my surrogate mother
Well she's out of her mind
She is not
could never ever be with anyone who doesn't take politics as seriously as do
The person in front of them turns around
Do you mind
hot dog is singing
You need quiet while a hot dog is singing
The two of them sit there
have something to tell you
didn't vote
What
In the last mayoral election, when Rudy Giuliani was running against Ruth Messinger,  went to get a manicure and forgot to vote
Since when do you get manicures
Oh,  suppose you could never be with a woman who gets manicures
Forget it
It's okay
forgive you
Shhhhhh
You forgive me
Hold on them a beat
Kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre
- Kathleen on the down escalator
Frank scrambling to catch up with her
What's going on
Kathleen's upset
(cont'd) Hey
What is it
- As they walk uptown
Look, this has been a big week, you're closing the store -- It's not that, Frank, really it's not
It's just
Frank
know, that was terrible of me
What was
To jump all over you when 'm the one who's really
Oh, God,  don't know how to say this -- What is it
- As we see Kathleen and Frank being served drinks in a glassed- in extension of a restaurant
- As Kathleen looks at Frank, waiting for him to begin
You're a wonderful person, Kathleen
So are you
And 'm honored that you want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn't truly worthy -- feel exactly the same way about you
Oh, God, don't say that, please, that just makes it worse
What
(he shakes his head) You don't love me
Frank shakes his head no
Me either
You don't love me
Kathleen shakes her head no
But we're so right for each other
know
long beat
That woman on television, right
Sidney-Ann
Frank nods
mean, nothing's happened or anything
think she's a Republican
can't help myself
Kathleen pats him
(cont'd) What about you
Is there someone else
Oh, somewhere out there, 'm sure
Somewhere -- (she throws up her hands) In cyberspace
'  - As Frank, carrying a typewriter, walks out off Kathleen's building and puts it into the back of a taxicab
- As a sign goes up in the window: "Closing This Week: All Stock 40% off
" - The store is crowded
People are buying stacks of books
We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were the last place on the earth
There is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere
Kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures
We hear the sound of the computer and hear her voice-over: (
) My store is closing this week
own a store
Did  ever tell you that
Probably not
It's a lovely store -- As a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table
This is a tragedy
(yelling across the shop to her husband) Honey, grab a copy of The Trumpet of the Swan
(
,cont'd) -- and in a week, it will be something really depressing, like a Baby Gap am being amazingly brave -- What are you going to do with yourself
don't know
'm going to take some time
have a little money saved
'm almost looking forward to it -- (
,cont'd) am so cheerful  would make Pollyanna throw up
came here every Saturday when  was a little girl
remember when your mother gave me Anne of Green Gables
"Read it with a box of Kleenex," that's what she told me
She's looking down on you right now
'm sure she is
(
,cont'd) have promised myself 'm not going to cry
approaches the counter with a stack of books up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the counter
We should bomb Foxbooks
It's not their fault
The truth is, the world is just
different
She starts ringing up the sale
- As Kathleen walks home
(
,cont'd) Soon we'll just be a memory
In fact, someone, some foolish person will probably think it's a tribute to this city, the way it keeps changing on you, the way you can never count on it, or something
know, because that's the sort of thing 'm always saying
But the truth is, 'm heartbroken
feel as if part of me has died,  and my mother has died all over again, and no one can ever make it right
She stops in front of the window, watching the customers lined up to buy books
- As Kathleen enters and looks around
She goes up the stairs
- ' As Kathleen walks into it
It's huge, of course
With its reading area, and stage, and room for displays, and child-size furniture, and so many books and so many customers
Kathleen sits down on a little child-size chair, completely wilted
And now we see Joe watching her, from a distance
She doesn't see him
woman browsing, stops a sales person
Do you have the "Shoe" books
The "Shoe" books
Who's the author
don't know
My friend told me my daughter has to read the "Shoe" books, so here  am
Noel Streatfeild
Noel Streatfeild wrote Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes
(she starts crying as she tells her) 'd start with Skating Shoes, it's my favorite, although Ballet Shoes is completely wonderful
Streatfeild
How do you spell that
----------
Thank you
As she walks away
(to herself) They know nothing, they know absolutely nothing
as he watches her
We hear the sound of the computer
She starts out of the store
And hold on him
(
) 'm sorry
' screen which says Reply and which now reads "'m sorry
" '  - On Joe at his computer, staring at the screen
Asshole
He backspaces, deleting
Starts typing again
(
) 'm sorry
don't know what to say
Truly  don't
And anything  do say will sound trite
hope you feel better
He sits there, appalled at his own triteness
'  - As a taxi comes down the street and stops in front of Joe's building
(
) What  was thinking was she'd probably make a great children's book either
(
) Why would you think that
They get out of the cab
She knows everything
She has flawless taste
She's famous for it
The salesmen swear by her
If she likes it, it sells
Period
'  - As they enter the lobby and walk toward the elevator
So you're going to offer her a job
Why not
What else has she got to do
Now that she's destitute -- Thanks to you
Well,  can't imagine her working for you
Why not
She has a horrible personality, she's
nice to everyone all the time
It's exhausting
And her staff turnover is non-existent
They've been there forever
Until
recently, when they all found out they were going to lose their jobs
Thanks to you
The elevator door is closing
(cont'd) Hold the elevator
They get in
- Hello, Charlie, Veronica
Last time, we rode in an elevator, we made the deal of the century
What is going to happen this time
Miss Grant's going to get me a part in one of her movies, that's what's going to happen
In your dream, Charlie
(back to the conversation with Joe) love how you've totally forgotten you had any role in her current situation
It's so obtuse
It reminds me of someone Who
Who does it remind me of
(thinks for a moment) Me
The elevator suddenly stops
Shit
Shit
It is stuck
Could be
He pushes the open button
Nothing
Turns the key, hits the open button, flicks the emergency switch
The he starts hitting the buttons in every possible combination
Charlie, what are you doing
Bang the door
Really
Joe bangs the door
Nothing
hope this thing doesn't plummet to the basement
Can it do that
No
He picks up the phone
This is Joe Fox
Who is this
Hi, Juan
We're stuck on the sixth floor
There are four of us -- (grabs the phone) -- and if you don't get your ass up here in two shakes and get us out -- He hangs up
(to Veronica) Are you all right
It's hot
Joe hands her his handkerchief
Everyone should jump in the air
What
We jump
The elevator thinks that no one is here and it opens
Everyone stares at each other
One -- two -- three -- They all jump into the air
They all land
Nothing happens
- Patricia is sitting on the elevator floor, polishing her nails
We hear the fire department banging outside
If  ever get out of here, 'm going to start speaking to my mother
She slept with Oscar, and maybe it was Oscar's fault,  don't know, and then she sold the story to Inside Edition
That could have been Oscar's idea, too
Who knows
But  divorced him
wonder what she's doing right this minute think of her
whenever  hear about a new pill
Ecstasy, Zoloft, Fenphen, just think,  hope Mama knows about that
She takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes
Maybe you can make up on Rosie
That would be so great for the book
(trying to figure it out) If  ever get out of here
If  ever get out of here, 'm having my eyes lasered
'm marrying Oreet
love her should marry her
don't know what's been stopping me
He takes out his wallet and looks at a picture of Oreet, shows it to Joe
If  ever get out of here, 'm going to -- He stops, he looks at Patricia who is fishing through her purse
Where is my TicTacs
(looks at Joe) What
The firemen crowbar open the elevator door
79TH    - Joe and Brinkley walk out on the dock toward Joe's boat
Joe is carrying Brinkley's pillow, his laptop and a suitcase
He boards his boat and goes below
light goes on
We hear the sound of the computer
(
) came home tonight and got into the elevator to go to my apartment
An hour later,  got out of the elevator and Brinkley and  moved out
Suddenly everything had become clear
(continued) - small sleeping area with a berth and a little table, where Joe's laptop has been hooked up to the phone
Joe is on the narrow berth, as is Brinkley
(
, cont'd) It's a long story
Full of the personal details we avoid so carefully
Joe puts Brinkley on the floor, on his pillow
Brinkley jumps back onto the berth with Joe
'  - Kathleen is making tea
She starts toward the bedroom
We see her computer, now hooked up in the living room, where all of Frank's typewriters used to be
(
) wonder whether change isn't a kind of infection
You start with one thing -- something you never ever thought would change and it does -- (continued) '  - (
, cont'd) and the next thing you know even your bed is in a different place
(continued) Kathleen enters the bedroom and we see the entire room has been rearranged
She gets into bed and turns on the television set
- The bookshelves are empty
(
, cont'd) Six months ago, when you and  first met, knew everything about myself -- what would be doing for the rest of my life and even the person  would be doing it with
Now  know nothing
On the door is a small sign
"After 42 years, we are closing our doors
We have loved being part of your lives
" Kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door
The little bell over the door jingles
Kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches it
Then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell
Kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate for the last time
The grate starts to lower
Kathleen looks at her store, one last time
Then she walks off, carrying the bell
We hear it jingle in the night
And hold on The Shop Around the Corner, and it slowly turns into a computer-enhanced version of itself
And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty screen
, : The trees sprout leaves and birdies start to tweet
And the scene turns into a real version of: -  - - George is now the head of the children department at the store and he is sitting in the children's section on an itty- bitty chair
His staff is sitting on little itty-bitty chairs too
Then, in the 19th century, Caldecott revolutionized the publishing of children's books by the introduction of color illustrations -- We see: Several are dozing
& 72ND - Joe walks past the Eleanor Roosevelt statue
He's with Annabel and Matt: What about going to the Children's Zoo
don't want to go to the Children's Zoo
Okay
The Staten Island Ferry
want to go to the Storybook Lady
want to go to the Storybook Lady
Well we can't go to the Storybook Lady
- Annabel is sitting in her chair, staring glumly at a bowl of Japanese soup and noodles
'll read you a story
Where did she go
She had to close her store
Why
She didn't have enough business
Why
Well
Her store was very close to our store, and you know our store sells books at a slightly lower cost -- Why
Why do we sell at a lower cost
So more people can buy books
Why couldn't she sell that way too
Because she's small and we're big
How about we go get some candy
So now she's gone and it's all your fault
It's business, Annabel
It's not personal
How about we go get so much candy you'll be bouncing off the walls for days
What's personal
Personal means that she's gone forever, and now we'll never get another book from her as long as we ever live
She burst into tears
Matt bursts into tears too
Remember the man who worked with her
(a wail) No
Well  hired him
You killed the Storybook Lady
Matt throws himself on the ground, crying
Annabel sobs hysterically
- George is wearing the same pointed hat Kathleen wore as the Storybook Lady
There's a sign that says: Storybook Person
Several children are listening
We see: She's glowering
'  - Kathleen is in bed with a huge box of Kleenex
She has a terrible cold
Her nose is red, her eyes are watery
On the bedside table are a huge assortment of atomizers, pills, etc
We hear the sound of computer keys clicking
(
) Why haven't you written
(
) have a cold
'  - We see Joe on his computer
(
) How's your cold
(
) My ears are blocked, my nose is clogged
'  - She's drinking cranberry juice
Joni Mitchell on the stereo
The sound of computer keys clicking again
(
) Are you feeling any better
(
) 'm lying in bed listening to Joni Mitchell and drinking cranberry juice which  am sorry to say is the exact same color as my nose
keep thinking about my future
What future
What am going to do
79TH    - As Joe is walking Brinkley back to the boat
limousine has pulled up near the pier and the driver is unloading bags
Joe stops to see the passenger: his father, Nelson Fox
What are you doing here
79TH    - Next to Joe's boat is a larger yacht
- In the main cabin Joe and Nelson are having drinks
Nelson lifts his glass in a toast
To us
Father and son, together at last
That happened with Gillian
Nelson ignores the question
've stayed here after, let's see, your mother, Laurette that ballet dancer -- -- the nanny -- Was she the nanny
forgot that
How ironic
Then there was the ice skater -- -- also the nanny -- Really
How amazingly ironic
Sybil the astrologer
Whose moon turned out to be in somebody else's house, as  recall
Just like Gillian
Gillian ran off with someone
The nanny
Nanny Maureen
Gillian ran off with Nanny Maureen
That's incredibly ironic
True true
There's no other word for it
Who did you break up with
Patricia
You met her
Would  like her
(cracks himself up) Just kidding
Isn't this great
Have some peanuts
Of course  have to live out of a suitcase for a least three weeks, and then there's the inevitable legal hassle, more of your inheritance down the drain
Don't worry about it
won't
But then  get to meet someone new
That's the easy part
Oh, right, a snap to find the one single person in the world who fills your heart with joy
Don't be ridiculous
Have  ever been with anyone who fits that description
Have you
On to the next
Isn't it a beautiful night
Hold on Joe
'  - Joe, on his way to Kathleen's apartment building, carrying a bunch of daisies, wrapped in cellophane
Joe goes up the stoop to her building and looks at buzzer
Sees Kelly, 3A
He presses
Nothing
Presses again
(voice clogged, through intercom) Who is it
Joe Fox
'  - Kathleen, in her pajamas, at the intercom, horrified
What are you doing here
May  please come up
It's really not a good idea
Someone else walks up to the door, unlocks it and walks in
Joe follows
'  - (into the intercom) have a terrible cold, can you hear it
'm sniffling and not really awake -- '  - As Kathleen continues to talk through the Intercom to an empty stoop
' and 'm sleeping practically twenty-four hours a day, and taking echinacea -- '  - (into intercom) -- and vitamin , so  would really appreciate it if you would come some other time -- There's a knock on the door right next to her
Kathleen practically jumps out of her skin
She looks through the peephole
There he is
Kathleen
Just a second
She puts on a robe, runs frantically about picking up various scattered wadded-up Kleenexs, opens the front door
Joe is holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper
Hello
What are you doing here
heard you were sick and  was worried and  wanted to -- (he hears voices) Is someone here
Just the Home Shopping Network
Bought any porcelain dolls
was thinking about it
(beat) You put me out of business -- know that -- And now you turn up with flowers
Did you come to gloat
No
To offer me a job -- No,  wouldn't think of -- Because  have plans,  have lots of offers
've been offered a job by -- well, actually by -- My former
Former
We broke up
That's too bad
You seemed so perfect for each other
(she claps her hand over her mouth) don't mean to say things like that
No matter what you have done to me, there is no excuse for my saying anything like that
But every time  see you -- Things like that just seem to fly out of your mouth
Yes
'm sorry
'm starting over
(sharply) Thank you for coming
Goodbye
(she says it again, a little more nicely) Thank you for coming
Goodbye
She starts to the door
bought you flowers
Oh
(trying as hard as she can) Thank you
She takes them
He takes them back
Why don't  put them in water
He heads for the kitchen
beat, while she stares after him
Then follows
- When Kathleen gets to the kitchen, Joe is checking the kettle for water
Turns on the stove
You're sick
Sit down, please
He pulls out a kitchen chair
Kathleen sits
She's a little woozy
Vase
Upper left
He gets out a vase
Fills it with water
George says hello
He told me you weren't feeling well
How is George
Great
He's revolutionizing the place
No one is allowed to work in his department who doesn't have a Ph
in children's literature
He unwraps the paper around the flowers
Daisies
Puts them in a vase
love daisies
You told me
He puts the vase on the kitchen table
Kathleen plays with the petals
They're so friendly
Don't you think they are the friendliest flower
do
When did you break up
Oh, a couple of weeks ago
Everyone is breaking up
You
Me
This other person  know broke up with someone in an elevator
think it was in an elevator
Or just outside it
Or after it
It got stuck
think
And suddenly everything became clear
When  saw you, at the coffee place,  was waiting for him and  was -- -- charming
was not charming
Well, you looked charming
The teakettle whistles
Joe turns off the burner
Tea
Upper right
He gets out mugs and teabags and pours the water
was upset
And  was horrible
Honey
Kathleen nods
He puts in two spoonfuls, gives it to her
was horrible
True
But have no excuse
She picks up the daisies and carries them into: '   - Joe follows her
They both sit
Whereas  am a horrible person and have no choice but to be horrible, is that what you're saying
No  am not saying that because  am done saying horrible things, even to you
You did it again
She claps her hand over her mouth
put you out of business
You're entitled to hate me
don't hate you -- But you'll never forgive me
Like Elizabeth
Who
Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice
She was too proud -- thought you hated Pride and Prejudice
-- or was she too prejudiced and Mr
Darcy too proud
can never remember
(beat) It wasn't personal -- -- It was business
What is that supposed to mean
am so sick of that
All it means is it's not personal to you, but it's personal to me, it's personal to a lot of people
(she shrugs helplessly) What's wrong with personal anyway
Nothing
mean, whatever else anything is, it ought to begin by being personal
Kathleen stands up, picks up the daisies
My head's starting to get funny
have to go back to bed
They walk to
'  - Kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it
She fluffs up the pillows, pulls up the blankets, surrounds herself with Kleenex and Evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze
Why did you stop by
forget
wanted to be your friend
Oh
knew it wasn't possible
What can say
Sometimes a person just wants the impossible
Could  ask you something
What
What happened with that guy at the cafe
Nothing
But you're crazy about him -- Yes
am
Then why don't you run off with him
What are you waiting for
long beat
don't actually know him
Really
We only know each other -- oh God, you're not going to believe this -- Let me guess
From the Internet
Yes
You've Got Mail
Yes
Very powerful words
Yes
Joe sits on the edge of the bed
'm happy for him
Although -- could make a little suggestion
think you should meet him
No
take it back
Why meet him
(starting to get sharp again) hardly think  need advice from someone who -- He reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth
And holds it there
It's unexpectedly tender and sexy
concede  bring out the worst in you, but let me help you not to say something you'll just torture yourself about for years to come
She starts to smile and he removes his hand
They look at each other
hope you're better soon
It would be a shame to miss New York in the spring
Joe stands
Thank you for the daisies
He starts for the door
Take care
will
Goodbye
Goodbye
We hear the door close
Hold on Kathleen
- Christina is running
She sees a good-looking coming toward her
She has no hope that he will notice her, and starts to look away as they get close to one another
Hi
Hi
He passes her
Christina can't believe it
She does a little dance of joy
Camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin
Then she resumes her morning exercise, running on
- Patricia comes in
The place is packed
There are hundreds of young Jewish New Yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora
The Rabbi is dancing among them
Patricia sees the rabbi, leading the dance
The rabbi whirls madly toward her, like a human dreidel
Shabbat shalom
He grabs Patricia's hand, and to her surprise, they go whirling off together
'  - Kathleen at the computer, typing
(
) have been thinking about this and think we should meet
She clicks the send button and then exits from American On Line
On her computer screen we now see the standard screen with several icons: American On-Line, Word, Recycle Bin, etc
She clicks Word
She goes to File: New
There are several choices of format
She stares at the choices
Then she clicks Book format
blank page appears in the computer
She starts to type:  "Once upon a time there was a little girl named
" She pauses for a moment and looks around the room
She sees the flowers that Joe brought her
And then she types: "Daisy
" As she goes on typing
'  - On Joe typing
(
) We should meet
And we will meet
But 'm in the middle of a project that needs
(he pauses to think of the right word) tweaking
look of calculation on his face
- We can see Kathleen through the window, drinking a cup of coffee
And now we see Joe walk into Starbucks
He waves at her, pretending surprise at seeing her
Has he been watching the store and waiting for her to come in
We'll never know
- He's sitting next to her at the counter in the window
Tweaking
That's what he said
He's probably married
That's a terrible thing to say
It's not possible
Have you asked him if he's married
Have you said, "Are you married
" No
Joe looks at her, shrugs
'  - As she types: (
) know this is probably a little late to be asking, but are you married
'  - As he answers: (
) Am  married
What kind of a question is that
How can you ask me that
Don't you know me at all
Oh wait,  get it
Your friends are telling you the reason we haven't met is that 'm married
Am right
- Kathleen and Joe having nachos
So he didn't exactly answer
He did too
He nailed me
He knew exactly what  was up to
Which is just like him
But he didn't exactly answer, did he
Did he
No
Maybe he's fat
don't care about that
You don't care that he might be one of those guys who's so fat he has to be removed from his house with a crane
That's very unlikely
Why else do you think he's putting off meeting you
Although
maybe that's not it
Maybe
What
Never mind
What
He could be waiting til he's paroled
Oh, you won't believe this, there was a moment when George thought he might be the rooftop killer, which was completely ridiculous -- Her voice trails off, as she considers whether it could be true
What's his handle
She shakes her head
Come on, 'm not going to write him
Is that what you think
152
One five two
One hundred fifty two
Very interesting
He's 152 years old
He has 152 hairs remaining on his head
He's had 152 moles removed and now he has 152 pockmarks
'    - As they walk past tables of bread and flowers, etc
His combined college board scores
His
The number of women he's slept with
The number of times he's seen The Godfather
That's the first good thing 've heard about him
His address
No, no, no
He would never do anything that prosaic
On Joe, looking a little wounded
(cont'd) The only thing  really care about besides the married thing
and the jail thing
is the boat thing
The boat thing
could never be with anyone who has a boat
Oh
So that clinches it
We'll never be together
'll take care of these
He picks up a mango, squeezes it
(cont'd) could never be with anyone who likes Joni Mitchell
(singing, imitating Joni) "It's cloud's illusions  recall, really don't know clouds at all
" What does that mean
Joe waits for Kathleen to say she likes Joni Mitchell
But Kathleen doesn't say anything
She starts intently picking over apples, trying to find some she wants
How's your book coming
- As they walk away from the market, going uptown
There's a children's book editor  know, from the store, and she's excited to read it
When  finish it
Who would ever have thought 'd write
mean, if  didn't have all this free time, would never have discovered -- She stops, realizing what she's saying
(cont'd) The truth is, he was the one who made me start thinking about writing -- Mister 152 Felony Indictments -- Mister 152
insights into my soul
Yes
Well
Can't compete with that
Well
keep bumping into you
Hope your mango's ripe
think it is
Want to bump into me Saturday
Around lunchtime
- As Joe types
(
) How about meeting Saturday
The first day of spring
4
There's a place in Riverside Park at 88th Street where the path curves and when you come around the curve, you'll find me waiting
/
- '  - Kathleen and Joe are putting mustard on their hot dogs
Today
Today
Whoa
know
In Riverside Park
Isn't that amazing
Maybe 've seen him, and  don't even know it
- As they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking papaya drinks
He could be the Zipper Man
Who's that
This guy on Amsterdam who repairs zippers
You'll never have to buy new luggage
Stop teasing
Timing is everything
He waited until you were primed
Until you knew there was no other man you could ever love
(almost believe it) Yes
Sometimes  wonder
What
They stop walking, they look at each other
If  hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd just met -- Don't
would have asked for your phone number and  wouldn't have been able to wait 24 hours before calling and asking, "How about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie, for as long as we both shall live
" (almost a swoon) Joe
And then we would never have been at war
No
The only fight we'd ever have is what video to rent on Saturday night
Who fights about that
Some people
Not us
We would never
long beat
If only
Please
have to go
She doesn't move
Let me ask you something
How come you'll forgive him for standing you up and you won't forgive me for a little tiny thing like putting you out of business
Kathleen looks at him
Shakes her head
They look at each other
Oh how  wish you would
It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him
It's all Joe can do not to kiss her
really do have to go
You don't want to be late
She's in agony
He turns and walks away
After a moment, she does too
'  - As we see Kathleen come down the street and walk into her house
'  - As she comes out of the apartment house, having changed her clothes
- As she comes toward the entrance to the park
- As Kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th Street
She comes to a stop
Looks around
young woman in running clothes passes by
young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers runners use to push babies in
Kathleen looks at her watch
Suddenly she hears a noise
dog barking
And Brinkley comes around the corner
Brinkley
Brinkley
And hold on Kathleen as she sees
And she starts to cry
And he comes to her
And puts his arms around her
Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry
wanted it to be you
wanted it to be you so badly
And as they kiss, we hold on them
And crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the park on a beautiful spring day
dog is leaping around them
And as we get further and further away from them, the screen turns into And the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops
