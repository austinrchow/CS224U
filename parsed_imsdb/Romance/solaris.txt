href <b>// --> </b> Solaris - by Steven Soderbergh -  October 4, 2001 draft by Steven Soderbergh October 4, 2001 First, over , we hear the sound of a light rain
Then: ' 'm not a poet
've never moved anyone with my words
(beat) Maybe that's why they chose me
- mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky
Rain continues to fall
Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light (or is it the sky
)
Something vaguely unsettling
: - Still, the sound of rain is heard
40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us
He has not been sleeping
In fact, judging from his distant expression, he has not slept in ages
: - Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through
The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle
He is accompanied by a medium-sized , and seems in no particular hurry
The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity
The Man, without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal
The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road
The vehicle hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened -- spraying muddy debris in its wake
Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop
Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously still
The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the Man, who remains motionless
When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns transparent and we see a -  in the rear seat
His demeanor is pleasant and professional
- Dr
Kelvin
The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is , stares back at him
: - The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as jarring as you might imagine
Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen
Behind him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two others:   in her 50s and a  in his 30s
They are also well-groomed
Each of their suits are embroidered with a small but distinctive  of some sort that composes the acronym
Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a digitized   appears on his screen:  , unshaven, looking into the camera
The man, , looks very tired and somewhat apologetic
The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date display that reads: 0221  11/14/31
We take off into the cosmos, ready for anything: solitude, hardship, exhaustion, death
We're proud of ourselves, in a way
But our enthusiasm is a sham
We don't want to conquer the cosmos -- we want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the cosmos
We are only seeking Man
We don't want Other Worlds
We want mirrors
(beat) Maybe we don't need to know what it is, or why
Maybe just knowing that it is should be enough
Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before switching it off and ending the transmission
Kelvin sits back
The visitors exchange glances
: Close on Kelvin
We hold on him a long time, as a myriad of readouts scroll and flash across his face
slit of sunlight glides slowly through frame
: in the same capsule, a month later
He is asleep
: in the same capsule, two months later
He is dictating some coordinates to Earth
He absently scratches his heavy growth of beard
: two months later still
He is looking out his small, rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to see the approaching planet:
Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized
It has a translucent quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating, ocean-like surface slowly changes colors
Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the , edges into frame
Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on approach, do you read me
(beat) Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on approach, do you read me
No response
He exhales and types on a keyboard
The Athena 7, sporting a  logo, advances toward the Prometheus
: Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the   of the Prometheus
Several exploratory  fill the remainder of the area
Kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign of life
: Empty
(: Except for some , - : the These are small, bug-like repair units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things
Their tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on the Prometheus
They can adhere to any surface at any angle
) Kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on
: ' Ransacked
Kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room where the computer terminal rests
Within moments he has discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to replay
Gibarian addressing the camera
He appears to be lucid, but extremely fatigued
Hi, Chris
(a light smile) 'm so glad you came
(beat, the smile fades) still have a little time, and want to tell you something
To warn you
By now you know about me, or if you don't, get Snow or Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't matter
(beat) didn't lose my mind
You should be able to tell from this video
'm not mad
(beat) If it happens to you, remember that it isn't madness
(beat) You should know, 'm in favor of destroying Solaris
know that's
illegal
And unethical
And irresponsible
But it's the only way to make it stop
long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video, which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen
(addressing whoever made the noise) Cut that out
Do you hear me
Gibarian switches off the video
The computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and overlays a readout indicating the file has ended
: Empty
But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open
Kelvin moves toward it
, seated with its back to the door, turns to see Kelvin enter
This is
He looks Kelvin up and down, his expression wary and alert
Snow
Didn't you hear me radio
'm Kelvin
long beat
Snow just watches him
Yes
We heard
Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils
What's wrong
What happened to Gibarian
He's dead
How
beat
Suicide
Snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered something
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you
What
(musing) love chocolate
realized just yesterday how much  love it
(beat, then he recovers) thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because
well, 've been thinking about it
long beat as Kelvin stares at Snow
What happened here
Snow lies back in his bunk
can't talk just now
'm too tired
Where's Sartorius
In his lab
He won't let you in
(leaving) He'll let me in
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual
Kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around
try to stay calm
: Kelvin stands outside a door
Let me in
beat
(inside, muffled) You have to give me your word you won't come in
Then 'll come out
All right
Sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit and into the hallway
He is of obvious intelligence and not to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to be, and probably brilliant
Kelvin eyes him suspiciously
What happened to Gibarian
Didn't you talk to Snow
want to hear your version
(incredulous) Who, here, could possibly care what you want
At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction
They have no idea what's going on up here
They've never even been in space
And 'm supposed to listen to you
am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation
Now: What happened to him
The same thing that could happen to any of us
Where's his body
In the lab
With her, probably
Her
Who are you talking about
Sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his door
He struggles to keep his composure
His last wish was to be buried on Earth
In dirt, he said
" want to buried in dirt
"  What a clown
Sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is on the other side of his door
They shouldn't let people like you into space
Just so you know: 'm not going back until  understand what it is
am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then  will go home
Listen -- We're done
Oh,  should tell you, don't trust Snow
There's something wrong with him
Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room
As the door closes Kelvin sees a flash of   in Sartorius' room
The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the other figure could have been
: - Kelvin walks, exploring the ship
He sees something that stops him: Black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead
Kelvin gives chase
He sees her turn a corner, but by the time he gets there, she is gone
: ' Snow is lying on his bunk
Is there anybody else here
(sits up a little) Why, who did you see
Gibarian warned me
He left me a message
Who was it
She was real
Where did she come from
Snow looks at him but doesn't respond
Tell me
won't think you're insane
Oh, that's a relief
Snow lies back down
Where did she come from
beat
How much sleep do you need
How much sleep
How long can you go without sleep
That depends
Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door
Snow rolls over, away from Kelvin
: Solaris
Quiet, but still active somehow
(
) The Prometheus, as far as  can tell, is functionally intact
Crew status: One dead, Gibarian
Cause of death appears to be suicide
: ' Kelvin speaks into a video communication device
As he does, we see images of the things and people he describes
Interviews with the surviving members and a perusal of the deceased's personal effects indicate he was suffering from severe depression with psychotic features, along with bouts of hypomania, dementia, delirium, and primary insomnia
All of these symptoms, combined with a profound sense of isolation, are commonly found in studies of low stimulation environments, particularly long range space travel
Snow and Sartorius show indications of depression, including dysthymic and bipolar ; a variety of stress disorders, including acute and posttraumatic; and suggestions of agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive disorder, and hypersomnia emphasize these are preliminary opinions on my part
will attempt to convince Snow and Sartorius to return to Earth, but as they currently view me as an intruder of sorts, this may take some time
: ' Later
Kelvin is lying down
The lights are out, and he is trying to sleep
After a moment, he gets up, checks the lock on his door, and lies back down
Then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door, and lies back down
Then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair, and lies back down
Laughing to himself, he drifts off to sleep
Silence
On Kelvin, asleep
On Kelvin, still asleep
Then: -: ' , slightly parted
Asleep
Then: - Continued silence, : , 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look away
Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her parted lips we were looking at a moment ago
Her expression indicates she's in a very raw emotional state
Kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the
He is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit
The contrast with his older self is striking
Asleep on the ship
After a beat: -: Rheya's
Except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car
Reveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now
She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her stillness
Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her
If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has obviously dreamed of Rheya before
He looks at her, simply
Stands and makes her way to Kelvin
Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore each other and we see all of it happen and two things are obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they haven't done it in some time
: ' Kelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms
He wakes up and looks at her, perplexed
After a beat he rises to sit on the edge of the bed
wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to his forehead
Rheya opens her eyes
Oh, God
'm awake
Yes
He looks at her
Where did you come from
She moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to do, forever
Between kisses
How are you here
She stops
How do you mean
(beat) Chris, what's wrong
Hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words, perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream
He stands and moves to the chair
Rheya watches him
love you
He looks up at her for as long as he can
Then he looks down
Do you love me
He doesn't look up
Yes
beat
need to see Snow
'll go with you
(rising) 'll just be a minute
She bolts out of bed
Don't
Why
don't know
can't be alone
'll be right back
She is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left alone is palpable, even excessive
He sees this and puts his arms on her shoulders to comfort her
All right
All right
Here
He hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water
What are they
To calm your anxiety
To calm my anxiety
She takes the pills and smiles
: Kelvin leads Rheya to one of the exploratory pods
They are in space suits
We're taking a flight
Yes
He opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter
She is unsure
Go ahead
'll close the door behind me
She stares up and into the pod
Kelvin watches her go with difficulty and then    behind Rheya
He walks across the docking bay to the control room and begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned
In agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off into space
Her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a brutal finality
collapses to the ground, shattered
: woman's , resting on the floor of an apartment
The fingers are being licked by a
: pot of coffee, on the boil
Except that it has been left unattended for too long
: rain-streaked window
: ' Kelvin, on the edge of his bed
He wants to tear himself inside out
voice calls over the intercom: Snow's
Was her breakfast conversation that bad
Shut up
told you, try to stay calm
You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch
What was it
Kelvin rises and goes to wash his face
Personally,  think it's God
At least, it fits my definition
And professionally
'm not sure
(beat) It started with Gibarian
He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door
He covered the video lens
Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown
don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there
By this time, we were getting visitors, too
He was desperately trying to figure it out
Day and night
(beat) Who was she
My wife
Dead
Kelvin nods
She has materialized from your memory of her
What was her name
Rheya
It started about three months ago
Right after the government sold the expedition
We were ready to go home
Will she come back
Probably
wish you'd told me
Told you what
beat
What will you say
To who
What are you going to report back to Earth
don't know
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project
We are in little danger of being left alone for long
(beat) You'll need to do something
Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed
That's ludicrous
This is contact
We have found God
The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth
So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all
: Before Kelvin's arrival
Gibarian is talking to Snow and Sartorius
pre-biological colloidal envelope, possibly exceeding terrestrial structures in complexity; a plasmic mechanism
Probably without life as we conceive it, but capable of performing functional activities on an astronomic scale
My view is that Solaris has reached, in a single bound, the "homeostatic ocean" stage without passing through stages of terrestrial evolution
think it bypassed cellular development altogether
It hasn't taken endless eons to adapt itself to its environment, but in fact dominated its environment immediately
From the moment it existed, it was the most superior element in the Universe
And now it passes the time doing extravagant theoretical thinking about the Universe, with us as the cast
We now show this scene being played out on a video monitor, watched by Kelvin
It's engaged in a never-ending process of transformation; an ontological autometamorphosis, begging the question: Can thought exist separately from consciousness
It's God
don't care what it is, we need to figure out how to make it stop
Nelson, we have the opportunity -- What if this thing follows us back to Earth
What if what's happening here started happening on Earth, on a mass scale
Don't you see that as a problem
think it's a serious mistake to assume it's benign
For all we know it's driving us crazy so it can watch us kill each other
Gibarian considers this
We're not even sure it will let us leave
: This time, Gibarian alone
Near the end
Maybe it's stuck
Maybe its power isn't that God-like
mean, we have God-like power relative to an insect, but that doesn't mean we can move the Earth around at will
Maybe it's like a spider web, waiting for something to show up
(beat) We intercepted some brief fragments of what must be an everlasting monologue with itself
Of course it was beyond our understanding
(beat) 've come to hate it here
There's only one way out of its reach, for us
Humans
: Kelvin stares at Gibarian's body, which is lying under a sheet in the ship's operating room
Also under the sheet, next to Gibarian: The Young Girl
(from a video) thought 'd been behaving normally, rationally
But a sign of insanity is the inability to think about more than one thing
So if  am consumed by the idea that  am insane and can't think of anything else, then  am insane
(beat, smiles) You ask questions at the end of your life, the sort of questions people who are content don't ask
(beat) Maybe life just can't be solved
: shot hovering over the surface of Solaris
' Kelvin is lying down, looking at the door
After a beat, he turns out the lights and rolls over
: ' Time has passed
Kelvin is asleep
leans into frame and kisses him
Without even waking, he kisses her back, hungrily
Rheya
want you inside me right now
They make love
It's even better than before
: ' Kelvin and Rheya are asleep
: - Kelvin, staring intently
What he is staring at is Rheya, who is seated across from him
She doesn't see him, yet
When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away
This continues until she gets off the train
Kelvin watches her go, and she looks back at him through the window as the train pulls away
- Rheya enters, looks around
She spots Kelvin, who has already spotted her
Their expressions indicate they are pleased to see each other again
He approaches her, and they stare at each other a long time, until: "And Death Shall Have No Dominion"
Book
Poem
Dylan Thomas
thought of it when  saw you on the train
My Thomas is a little rusty
He leans over and whispers into her ear
She listens, and when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued
Genuinely intrigued
He smiles
Not a very happy poem
You didn't look very happy
wasn't
And tonight
Better
He nods, and they smile
They seem to be rooting for each other
After an extended pleasurable moment, Rheya leans over and whispers in his ear
He listens, then leans back and looks at her
That's good to know
: '  - Another night
Rheya is wound up
Not drunk, something else
She has an odd look in her eyes
We are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but failing -- not to watch
You want to fuck her
Stop it
You behave as though you want to fuck her
Rheya
Not here
And  just want to know if 'm crazy or not -- if what  think is happening is actually happening
Or am  one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on
Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman
Let's go home
You go home
am
Please come with me don't want to do this here
You talk like an actor
He is stung
: - The immediate aftermath of the preceding scene, but at home now
Rheya crying as she embraces Kelvin
'm so sorry
'm so sorry
He is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind
: - Rheya, in a chair, remorseful, Kelvin is dressing
You're better when you take them
know,  know
But still, somehow don't feel better
All right
How about  feel better when you take them
beat
Right
They look at each other and understand; she will take the pills
: - Rheya, on the floor, dead
Her hand outstretched, a repeat of an image we saw earlier
Rain streaks the kitchen window
The bottle of pills nearby
: Rheya is taking her pills
Kelvin watches
What do you remember
What do you mean
Do you remember Beethoven
The Beatles
Movies, books, restaurants, friends
(thinking) Yes
But not until you mentioned them
As soon as you said those things,  remembered them
And they have associations that make me think of other things  remember
It's like filling up
She looks out the portal at Solaris
Is it a planet
Not exactly
It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe
An infinite number of them, in fact
It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time
It was completely counter-intuitive
We had to unlearn everything
Is it intelligent
Intelligent beyond our comprehension
Then it's God, right
It's something
You still don't believe in God
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man
Even the limits we put on it are human limits
It can do this, it can do that
It designs, it creates
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched
You're talking about a man in a white beard again
You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human
Human beings look for causes and patterns
How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything
beat
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang
As  said, it is beyond our comprehension
As  said, then it's God, right
She looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually
Why are we talking about this shit when we could be fucking
Kelvin smiles
The intercom comes to life
Kelvin, you awake
What is it
Can you meet me and Sartorius on deck in an hour
Why
Just a little strategy session
But in person this time
: ' Kelvin is getting ready to leave
Rheya sits on the edge of the bed, nervous
All right
She nods and Kelvin exits, locking the door behind him
We sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm
Kelvin listens
long time
Satisfied, he begins to walk away but is stopped by the sounding of a   from within
He hears footsteps approach the door, and then a fierce
He takes a step back
An     begins emanating from the other side of the door, which is now threatening to break apart
It sounds like a plane is crashing in Kelvin's room -- no human could create this kind of cacophony
Finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the door
Is revealed, covered in blood
She has completely torn the inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself in the process
Rheya
Confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and carries her to the bed
What happened
You were trying to break down the door
Do you know why
When  saw you were gone  got scared
He puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where he gathers all the first aid materials he can find
Returning, he blanches
Rheya's wounds have ; in fact, they are  in front of us
She looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face
Chris, what's wrong with me
: Kelvin runs Rheya through a battery of tests and studies the results
Am  all right
beat
Yes
: Snow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin
He won't do it
Why do you say that
He won't
Kelvin enters, with Rheya
Snow and Sartorius exchange glances
This is my wife, Rheya
She looks at Snow and nods
Sartorius she hates instantly, and the feeling seems to be mutual
We thought you'd be alone
We want to talk about
We want to talk freely
Go ahead
Sartorius begins
suggest we pool our knowledge regarding the
visitors
We can express whatever questions or conclusions we might have
share information about our various
experiments
Agreed
Kelvin and Snow nod
would like to start with motivation
Why are they here
Sartorius looks at Rheya
She looks away
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons
They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual
It's an experiment
No
There's no behavior modification
She reappeared exactly as she had before
Kelvin looks at Rheya and nods
She is struck by the word "before"
The same vulnerabilities
He nods again
recoil, with no compensating mechanism
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the
original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness
Followed by non-human manifestations
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean
don't think so
'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances
(to Rheya) When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt
Yes
(looks around) Of course
If they're not learning anything and they're not modifying their behavior, why do they come back
It's like they're plugged into a game, which goes around and around, endlessly repeating itself
: - This is ten years ago
Rheya enters, alone
She crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink
Almost immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and stands beside her, tail wagging
She ignores it and continues mixing her drink
Halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on moment later, Kelvin is in the doorway
Eventually, but not angrily, because he's still not really awake: Where've you been
been thinking about how much hate you
She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the door
Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and returns to bed
The light goes out
(
) Yes,  remember that
went back to Lois' house and spent the night
Those were dark days
: - Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for the first time
They are absolutely infatuated with each other; they know something is happening between them, will happen between them
would have these --  don't know how to describe them -- visions, when  was younger
Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states
Time would just collapse,  would be inside time
would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped
Freaky stuff
How old were you
Seven, eight
So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what 'm doing, and  start trying to explain to her, about this state that  can put myself in, and this look comes over her face
What kind of look
' Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus
Rheya continues her story without a beat
Scared
No, not scared
Wary
Like  was something to be
her guard went up
was a threat
Now  know why
She was afraid she'd be seen
That  would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was
think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal
But that's the cycle, right
knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on
(beat) guess that's part of the reason why -- know
know
We don't have to talk about that
Another beat
remember days of just thinking about you
- Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going through a normal day
There is no sound
As we see these images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not present in their respective encounters with other people; they are distracted by the idea of each other
And they like it
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you
loved it so much, that feeling
did too
- Rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away
used to watch you undress
As she does: never tired of watching you undress
Every time, it was exciting
Right until
to the end
beat
Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him leaving their apartment, angry
beat
What happened to us, exactly
You don't know
Rheya shakes her head
Kelvin just watches her
remember
something burning
Coffee burning
- The rain-streaked window
An automated coffee maker has been left on, and the solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking
Rheya's body is on the floor of the kitchen
( ) She is looking at Kelvin
He is dreading this
You found me
He nods
It's coming back to her
- Kelvin is yelling at Rheya
We don't hear what he's saying, but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant
She is crying
( ) Experiencing this all over again
Kelvin comes and sits in front of her
- Kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a suitcase
Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him
( ) Her eyes fill with tears
Kelvin embraces her
'm sorry
'm sorry
Rheya is devastated, inconsolable
Why did you say those things
don't know
couldn't understand why you didn't tell me
- Rheya lies on the kitchen floor, dead
There is a  in her hand
Kelvin kneels next to her
( ) With Rheya still in his arms
When you said you wouldn't make it
didn't believe you
Or didn't take you seriously, which is worse
- Kelvin holds the dead Rheya
( ) Squeezing her
should have believed you
: ' Kelvin lies in bed, his eyes open
Rheya is in his arms
: - Rheya, talking to Chris
Obviously during a period when they were getting along
Or at least: not fighting
can't help feeling that 'm cheating when  take them
It's genetics
You know this
You know where it comes from
There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires
She knows, intellectually, that he is right
But it doesn't matter
: ' Kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow
Rheya is asleep in the background
The room is dark except for the glow of the screen
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book
We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own
That proves that -- -- we are not sure of that
We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she -- (meaning Rheya) -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here
Not necessarily
Stop equivocating
Unbelievable, how you equivocate
You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person 've ever seen
This is happening, Kevin
Wake up
Consciousness is enough, that's all 've saying
Consciousness should be enough for anybody
Who are you trying to convince
Kelvin just looks back at Rheya
It will end badly
As inevitably as the rising of a bubble
Kelvin doesn't respond
Let's all meet tomorrow
Sartorius has some new ideas, about making it stop
Kelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep
: ' Kelvin is eating with Rheya
Looking at her
Desiring her
Do you have any idea how much like fucking you
think so
Good
Because  want you to know
really like fucking you
He leans over and whispers in her ear
She smiles and leans back
like that too
(
) How could she not be real
can smell her, taste her
She does exactly what she did
it's not possible
(smiles, teasing) You know, 've decided: 'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband
You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day
He just stares at her -- he really likes this
It's familiar, this type of teasing, and it reminds him of when things were good
(
) Like  said, it's not possible
beat
So, Chris, seriously, aren't you afraid you're going to get fired
They laugh
: ' Kelvin and Rheya, post-coital
Relaxed
On the verge of sleep
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it
know
'm putting that in my next report
She smiles
Right
The report
Report and recommend
They consider that
What does Snow think you should do
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth
This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home
They smile at this
Rheya's smile fades before Kelvin's
Sartorius wants to destroy it
Well
He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me
He's thinking: If  can figure out how to make it stop, than  am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God
He has a point
He does have a point
That's just not the way 'd like to see it proven
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out
Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless
Unblinking in his prejudice
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me
beat
He holds her
Do  really feel like
am
Yes
Yes
'm glad
beat
: Turning, slowly
: - Then years ago
Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the dark
Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed
Everything you pursue, you end up becoming disinterested in
The fact that you're good at everything you try makes it worse
You have a degree in animal science, you could be a terrific vet
You drifted into writing and turned out to be a perceptive journalist
Then it was politics, which seemed best of all, you had an actual gift for understanding the best pattern for a group of people to be arranged for you to achieve your goal
And they didn't even know they were being arranged
But you got bored with it, like you do with everything
She just smokes, not really looking at him
Maybe it's a common observation and she's past being defensive about it
don't know what it's really like, to not know what you want to do
To not have anything that you love to do more than anything else
beat
He looks at her
She seems more interested in her cigarette at the moment
(sarcastic) Imagine my frustration
: ' On the Prometheus
Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep
She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious, something we haven't seen before
Kelvin wakes up, looks at her
Noting her expression: What's wrong
You don't love me
Stop
beat
She looks down
have to talk to you don't know where  came from
(up at him) Do you know
He doesn't respond
If you know but can't tell me now
will you ever be able to
Calmly: What are you talking about
That  am not Rheya
That Rheya died
Killed herself
'm different
He's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory
Who have you been talking to
(no reason to lie) Sartorius
When
When 'm asleep
She nods
He can only imagine what form Sartorius' anecdotes must have taken
'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but  don't know who they are
'm just trying to understand what's going on
beat
How have you lived the last ten years
Did you love anyone
long beat
Kelvin shakes his head
Did you think about me
Another beat
He nods
Then: But we fought
Yes
Especially toward the end
Why did she do it
You
she said  didn't love her
Was she right
No
love you
(reflexive, but genuine) love you, too
If she seems satisfied for the moment, Kelvin knows the feeling won't last
Can you sleep
don't think do
It's not sleep; it's something else
It's all around me
Those are dreams
She falls asleep
: Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow
They are in the middle of a heated discussion
Gibarian was under enormous -- Gibarian was helpless
It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants
Yes
That's fantastic
Why did you agree to come here
beat
Too tired to answer
Looks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin
'll bet
Is this what they sent you here to do
You've lost it, you've gone native
Kelvin moves toward him
Sartorius just lets him come
(to Sartorius) You're the coward
Don't debate him; he'll say anything
(still, to Sartorius) 'm just as human as you
see, hear,  touch, and  feel just like you do
Prove it
These "guests" are a part of you, of your subconscious
Chris loves me
Try to understand that if you can understand anything
Kelvin is within an inch of his face
Get out of here
Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders
Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear: Rheya is dead
She's a copy facsimile
And she's seducing you all over again
You're sick
You think of fucking her as research for humanity
It's just fucking
Kelvin backs away
There's nothing grandiose about it
You've jumped out of a plane and you're trying to sew a parachute together while you fall
Sartorius turns
It'd be hilarious if it weren't so damn sad
And leaves
beat
We didn't even get to hear his new ideas
Snow wanders toward the door
'm not feeling well
He passes Kelvin and leaves
Kelvin watches him, then looks at Rheya
She seems dazed
: The fog-shrouded surface, shifting and turning like an ocean
: ' Rheya is asleep
Kelvin is talking to Snow on the videophone
We can liquidate the station
Take the Athena back
No
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth
(shrugs) We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement
've never heard you express any desire to leave before now
Why now
Well,  think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right
Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it
But why is it doing what it's doing
Given it's resources, it could have done anything
Presented me with your double, and you with mine
Perhaps it did
Human beings can die
But they are human
They certainly become human with incredible speed
First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own
doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough
They build up with experience
'  - Quick glimpses of Rheya
In several of them she is in repose, thinking, as if to illustrate Snow's point
' Back to Kelvin, thinking
They come when you sleep
That's right
And we all have to sleep, eventually
: ' Kelvin on the bed with Rheya
Their eyes are closed
We think they are asleep until: You don't want me
Rheya
That's what you were saying heard what you were saying
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me
That's all  know right now
She realizes she doesn't want to argue
Not right now, anyway
have these strange thoughts, don't know where they come from
(beat) can't explain it
Neither can
Not any of it
There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before
It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap
There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us
But that's what happened before
Not this time
He kisses her
She wants to believe him, so she says nothing
Then: Do you want to stay here
Do you
If you're here
They kiss again
: ' Kelvin is asleep
Rheya is next to him
Offscreen, we hear the door open
Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through the frame and sits
After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling to clear
When it does: Gibarian
Leave the light off
beat
Kelvin tries to get his bearings
wish you'd come a little sooner
might not have had to kill myself
He smiles, looking at Kelvin
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her
Understand something:  am the real Gibarian
Just a new incarnation
What do you want
You're being tricked
Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors
He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field
Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth
Can it work
It can
Ordinary matter, like ours
Not affected
Everything else, disintegrates
Kelvin registers this
What 'm saying is: Don't trust anyone
Find yourself a weapon of some sort
can trust Rheya
You'll end up like me
You're not Gibarian
No
Who am , then
puppet
And you're not
Maybe you're my puppet
But like all puppets, you think you're actually human
It's The Puppet's Dream
Wondering if they're human
Gibarian smiles
wakes up, gulping air
Rheya, startled: What's wrong
Gibarian
He was here
You said he was dead
He is
But he was here
He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian, some proof
Finding none: He spoke to me
Kelvin leaves the room
After a few beats, Rheya follows
Rheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's body
It is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not with him
: ' Kelvin, thinking
He gives Rheya some pills to take
She just looks at them
Are you going to take them
She nods and takes them
What's happening to us
It's all right
Please don't lie
told you before,  don't know how  came to be here
Whatever you think you can't say to me,  need to hear you say it
love you
Don't
'm the one at risk here
If we're playing out what happened before,  won't survive
He goes to her
That won't happen again
We're different
How can  tell
You've seen both of me
only know what you're like here
You're all  know
There is no "You" from before
She sits, frustrated
Sad
How could it be so cruel
How could it torture us like this
don't think it knows it's torturing us
It's just watching
: ' Kelvin and Rheya, in bed
She looks despondent
: ' Kelvin is asleep
Alone
After a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an instrument of some sort hitting the ground
After another beat, Kelvin awakens
He notices that he is alone, and something tells him that's not a good sign
: Rheya is on the ground, convulsing
Beside her is a , which is spilling a strange-looking  that solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss
Kelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire, but merely eaten cleanly away
He picks her up
Kelvin is carrying Rheya
Snow sticks his head out of a passing room
What happened
She drank liquid oxygen
' Kelvin puts Rheya on the bed
Her face and throat have returned to normal, but she is not breathing
Kelvin goes and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he hoped to hear
He stands, still looking at her
Snow seems very detached
An uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually not going to wake up
She's dead
Snow says nothing
Then: Her finger twitches
Barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity
Kelvin sees it, and goes to her
She is starting to shake a little, as though cold
She'll come back, don't worry
But then what
My theory is she can only live here, that she will die if she leaves this ship
Kelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little harder; it's feeling like a seizure now
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that
It's the most obvious solution: Escape
She knows she can't leave here -- Get out -- Oh, this one you love
What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space
You didn't love her
Rheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her still, but she's too strong
He stands, reluctantly, and watches her
What happens if she comes back
Is that polygamy
And even if you could take her home, how would you get her through
You think they're not going to notice her
Rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic force were coursing through her
Snow, as he looks dispassionately on the two of them: never get used to them, these
"Resurrections"
He leaves
Rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent, even sexual
She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then slowly returns to normal
Kelvin puts his hand on her forehead
She gradually begins to open her eyes
She looks at Kelvin
It takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him; she shouldn't be seeing anything
She should be dead
She begins to cry
What am
Why can't  die
She turns away
'm not Rheya
You're always known that
Rheya -- Don't call me that
He turns her over
Listen:  don't care about anything but the fact that you are here
You are her, you are Rheya
'm disgusting
No
You're lying
'm not human
Rheya,  am not going back
'm staying here with you
Then you'll die
want every second  can get with you
beat
What will  do, if you die
He doesn't know
: Turning slowly
: ' Kelvin and Rheya, in bed
Do you think  can get pregnant here
long beat
We'll know soon enough
: The first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years ago
Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time we hear what she is saying: can't be a mother
She pulls back
That's good to know
: - Kelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya
Don't do this
am literally begging you not to do this
Chris
You should have told me
It wouldn't have made any difference
Thank you
Chris,  had to
had to didn't think you'd react like this
Neither did
You never said you wanted one
never said  didn't
Chris -- can't stay here
Chris, please
Chris, 'm serious
won't make it
Then you won't make it
He leaves, brushing past her
: - Rheya, unconscious, on the kitchen floor
: ' long, held shot of Rheya, crying
She is curled up, retreating into herself
Kelvin is trying to console her
came back
You have to know that
came back that night
: - Rheya on the kitchen floor, the note in her hand
Kelvin is kneeling over her
: ' Kelvin and Rheya
She is sobbing, but somewhat calmer
couldn't make it, either
(beat) 'm so sorry
: ' Kelvin, asleep
: As we saw him before, sitting in the chair
But we didn't hear him say this before: If they succeed, you'll never see her again
: ' In the immediate aftermath of her suicide attempt with the liquid oxygen: You're afraid of me
can't do this anymore
still don't understand
It's not possible
He tries to console her, but she recoils
Don't -- - Rheya, as Kelvin brushes past her on his way out
She looks desperate
' Rheya and Kelvin
What do  have to do to stop it
want you here
You're lying
You exist here
keep telling you
That's impossible
'm not Rheya
Who are you, then
am Rheya
But  am not the woman you loved ten years ago
Yes, you are -- Did you hear what Gibarian said
'm not a human being
'm an instrument
came from your memory and your imagination and will torture you no matter what
Even if  remain passive
That's when  drank the
(beat) was going mad
It felt like there was no body underneath my skin
There was something else
An illusion
But  could feel my heart beating, and  remembered you tested my blood
Is it like yours
Yes
told you
It was exactly like mine
But then  would be dead now
beat
Is that really what you want
want to stop taking those pills
wish you wouldn't
They do something to me
It's hard to think straight
think they help
have consciousness, but  am not mortal
Don't you see why 'm going crazy
You have to remember that  love you, that's all that matters -- can't -- It put you here
'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness
was asleep, and it put you into my dream
saw your mouth
And there you were
(beat) Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter
The decision we make now is all that matters
Stay with me
Am  really her
don't know anymore
All  see is you
They kiss
Stay with me
(beat) Stay with me
: ' Kelvin is asleep
Rheya is next to him
: ' Kelvin is on the videophone to Snow
She knows everything
She knows who she is
She knows everything
Does she know she came once before and you put her in -- No
beat
What do you want
want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan
(feigning innocence) What plan
Just get him to stop
What do you want to do, leave the station with her
Yes
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate
You don't believe me
Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it
've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours
Her oxygen would have run out
Maybe she doesn't need any
Should we check
Kelvin just stares at him
Who are you trying to please
Yourself
Her
Which her, this one or that one
Can you face both
We are in a situation that is beyond morality
So: Leave with her
You'll see the transformation
Into what
You'll see her die, that's all
They're mortal, despite what she told you
She will die
Then what will you do
love her
You do, you don't
She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it
Don't you see
No, you don't
: ' He is playing back a message sent by Sartorius
'm sending you a message because feel sorry for you
really do, Kelvin
(beat) It is a mistake to become emotionally engaged with one of them
You are being manipulated
You are going around in circles to satisfy the curiosity of a power we don't understand and can't control, and she is the living proof that power exists
If she were ugly, you wouldn't want her around; that's why she's not ugly
She is a mirror that reflects part of your mind
You provide the formula
You can only finish where you started, remember that
(beat) They sold us out to the highest bidder
They had no right to do that
We should have been consulted
We're not fucking hardware
: ' Kelvin wakes up
Rheya is beside him
He rises and heads for the bathroom
He swallows two pills and a small cup of water
When he returns to the bed, Rheya is looking at him
What are you taking
sleeping pill
Do you want yours
- Rheya, on the kitchen floor
The bottle of sleeping pills just beyond her hand
Kelvin looks at Rheya
She shakes her head; she doesn't want the pills
Kelvin comes and sits beside her
What does it want
don't know
Something
Anything
She goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris
It created me and yet  can't communicate with it
It must hear me, though
It must know what's happening to me
Don't you think
: ' Snow on the videophone to Kelvin
Rheya is asleep in the background
don't think it dislikes us think it just noticed us
It lives, thinks, and acts
We are dealing with a living creature here, no question
And it's done something we've never been able to do: create a perfect human body
Perfect except for the subatomic alterations, but
: On his suicide tape: If Solaris is inside our brain, and it knows everything, and we're only consciously aware of what 2% of our brain is up to at any given moment, it knows us better than we know ourselves
It's not even close
: ' Rheya and Kelvin
've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God
Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it
(beat) It's created a situation without a goal, and  hate that
God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose
(beat) And us
We would have to have "an arrangement"
An unspoken understanding that  am not human
How can  not hate something that does that
Please
Don't
: ' Kelvin is asleep
Rheya is crying beside him
: ' Kelvin asleep, alone
Rheya is in the corridor, talking to someone
wakes up
Rheya is beside him, asleep
: Turning, slowly
: ' Kelvin, in a fever, eyes open but glazed
Rheya is putting a compress on his forehead
' Of the room
His      is sitting by the chair
: '  () Kelvin sits in a chair, looking at: Sitting in the same position as it was on the Prometheus
Breathes a sigh of relief at being home
Everything seems slowed down, somehow
(
) though  was home
: ' On the Prometheus
Kelvin is in bed, feverish
(
) thought it was over
He sees Rheya, in the hallway again, talking to someone we can't see
Wakes up again
Rheya is asleep beside him
: Rheya, the first day she and Kelvin saw each other
: - Ten years ago
Kelvin and Rheya standing on a street corner
They seem to be pausing in the midst of a very serious conversation
It is raining
: ' Kelvin in bed, on the Prometheus
Still feverish
Rheya is mopping his brow
'  () Kelvin in bed, feverish
Rheya is there, wiping his forehead
' On the Prometheus
Kelvin looks over to Rheya
Where did you go before
When
Last night
You were talking to someone in the corridor
You must have been dreaming
She begins to cry
What's the matter
She just shakes her head
Rheya
From Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying
Then he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to someone we cannot see
Then he looks further to the right, and there she is again, staring at him from the bathroom doorway
She moves to the edge of the bed in order to be near
Sweating
Struggling
Beyond fear
(
) 'm losing my mind
(beat) 'm breaking apart
- Kelvin sits in his chair, as he did at the beginning, with the three officials from  behind him
Only now the three officials are Snow, Sartorius, and Gibarian
'  () Kelvin, transfixed
(
) Is this what it means to die
(beat) Am  in the moment of my own death
(beat) Is this the last thought  will ever have
This idea forces him to rise, and he does, slowly
Behind Kelvin as he somehow keeps moving
We hold a long time, and then: : Count to ten
Then: : Kelvin moving down a crowded sidewalk, in slow motion
(
) am home now
(beat) try to find the rhythm of the world where  used to live
but feel completely and continually out of-sync
am separate
Why did return to Earth and lie about what happened
Lie about having contact with something like Solaris knew something else was out there, and didn't tell a soul
left them in the dark
We all did
: - Kelvin, traveling home from the city
: '  - Kelvin returns
He stops and looks around before entering his front door
(
) So why come back at all
To see if she comes here
' Of the woods
But there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of the Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the are crawling along the ground
Looking from the doorway, notes this
He doesn't seem surprised, though
(
) don't believe it will happen
'  - Kelvin, in his bed, awake
(
) But  will wait, anyway
: Count to five
Then: : '  () Kelvin is in his bed, still feverish
(
) thought it was over
He looks around the room
He is alone
flashing light on his computer demands attention
video message from Rheya
Don't blame them
begged them to do it
It's better this way
(beat) 'm sorry
(beat) 'm sorry  tried to make you think was human
(beat) read my own suicide note found it in your things realized  was not her
She looks away
know that you loved me, Chris know that
(beat) love you
Kelvin breaks down
: - Kelvin, with the dead Rheya in his arms, crying
Beyond him is the rain-streaked window
On the floor, by her hand, is the note
On it is scrawled the end of a Dylan Thomas poem, the one Kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke
- The first night
Again, Kelvin leans into Rheya's ear and whispers
This time we hear what he says: "Though they go mad they shall be sane
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again
" - Kevin holding Rheya
The note on the floor
The rain-streaked window
(
) "Though lovers be lost love shall not
And death shall have no dominion
" Kelvin wipes the hair from her face
(
) You killed her
(
) Not her
It
: Kelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in Sartorius' door
You murdered her
Kelvin, she begged me
had a short-range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters
She walked into it and disappeared
She was gone
Kelvin looks around
She'll come back
No, she won't
Why would you let her to do that
It's not human, Kelvin
Whatever it is, it's not human, and  am threatened by that
Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened
And  want to win
want humans to win
So  am killing it before it kills me
You fucking bastard
Whose side are you on
Kelvin moves away
: Still turning, slowly
But something about its appearance is different
Complete chaos
Kelvin is chasing Sartorius to the flight deck
(yelling as he runs) It's changing characteristics
It's solidifying taking on weight
How quickly
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it
Kelvin and Sartorius get the ship ready for take off
Where's Snow
Did you call him
Yes
Kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that Snow is sitting in his room
(via intercom) Snow
We need you up here
Snow doesn't reply
Snow
Snow looks up
There's a strange look on his face
What's wrong with you
We need your help
won't be making the trip
Snow, get up here, now
'm not Snow
This stops Kelvin and Sartorius
They look at each other and then at the monitor
got rid of him
wanted to see if
wanted to be the only one
wanted to be Snow
Fuck me
knew it
When did this happen
Oh, right away
That's why you never saw me with anyone
You should've noticed that
miss him, though
think  made a mistake
Jesus
But  can't leave with you won't make it
Maybe you can
You want it coming back with us
You go ahead
Of what  remember about Earth
it's all one thing now
Everything's a blur
like distinctions
Snow lies down on his bed
Kelvin looks at Sartorius
We do not have time to deal with this
Get the diode sail into position and let me know when the bias drive and the induction ring are at zero point
Kelvin nods and obeys
He then takes one last look at the monitor to see Snow lying in bed
Kelvin reaches over and shuts the monitor off
: Silence
The Prometheus moves away from Solaris
After the ship has gone
soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet
Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand
Within a minute Solaris has disappeared
: - Kelvin, back on Earth
Silent and still
And the rain continues
He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving to and fro
(
) Earth
(beat) What did that word mean to me
(beat) have returned
Finally
Kelvin begins to walk
(
) work in the city now
After work wander and lose myself
am silent and attentive
follow the current
make a conscious effort to smile, nod, stand, and perform the millions of gestures that constitute life on Earth
- Kelvin taking the train to the suburbs
(
) will study these gestures until they become reflexes again
will find new interests and occupations, but -- - Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin
As he nears, his recognizes him and approaches
Kelvin pats the dog's coat
(
) will not
give myself
will not give myself to anything or anyone, because  am haunted by the idea that  remembered her wrong
That  shaded my memory of her to suit myself
That  was unfair to her and caused her destruction
What if  was wrong about everything
(beat) 've come to believe that memory is a curse
- Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel
He looks in as he brings his key to the lock and his face
Is in the living room, waiting for him
She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of the room
Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her face melts into a smile
Opens the door
He cannot speak
Rises and moves toward him
They embrace
He breathes her in
She squeezes him
After a long beat: How can you be here
(whispering) Shhhh
Just stay with me
(beat) Stay with me
Everything is forgiven
Everything
She sways with him, gently
His body relaxes
love you
- tableau of the cabin
The dog is on the front step, seemingly content despite the light rain
As fog drifts in, we , and soon the mist has nearly obscured the house
The fog turns into clouds and we get fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and farther away
We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the corners of the frame
Still there is a light rain sound
These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are forming the shape of a circle
The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body
And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris
