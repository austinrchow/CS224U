500 Written by Scott Neustadter & Michael
Weber First Draft ' "' " When all is said and done, up comes a single number in parenthesis, like so: (478) - For a few seconds we watch   (20s) and a  (20s) on a park bench
Their names are  and
Neither one says a word
her , covering his
Notice the wedding ring
No words are spoken
Tom looks at her the way every woman wants to be looked at
begins to speak to us
This is a story of boy meets girl
: (1) - The boy is
He sits at a very long rectangular conference table
The walls are lined with framed blow-up sized greeting cards
Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t- shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to balance out the corporate dress code
He looks pretty bored
The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met his
"soulmate
" : - 1989 -  sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie
His walls are covered in posters of obscure bands
From the , we hear: "Elaine
Elaine
" 4
This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, "The Graduate
" : - The girl is
She files folders and answers phones in a plain white office
She has cropped blonde hair almost like a boy's but her face is feminine and pretty enough to get away with it
The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief
: - 1994 Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror
Her hair extends down to her lower back
Since the disintegration of her parents' marriage, she'd only loved two things
The first was her long blonde hair
She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice
The second was how easily she could cut it off
And feel nothing
: /   - On the right side of the screen, Tom continues to listen to some boring presentation
On the left, Summer answers a call, takes a message, and walks out of her cubicle down a long narrow hallway
5
Tom meets Summer on January 8th in a San Francisco office building
In an instant, he will know she's the one he's been looking for
Summer opening the door to the boardroom, about to come face to face with Tom for the first time
This is a story of boy meets girl
But before they do, : You should know up front, this is not a love story
(240) - 12 year old  rides her bicycle down the block
She arrives at an apartment complex, jumps off the bike and races up the front stairs
She rings the doorbell
'  - and  open the door
These are Tom's best friends since birth
Paul is a doctor and wears hospital scrubs
McKenzie works in the cubicle next to Tom
didn't know who else to call
The Girl removes her bike helmet
You did the right thing
Where is he
Tom is in the kitchen breaking things and basically going insane
About to smash a plate on the floor, he's interrupted : 6
Thomas
Tom freezes
Rachel
What are you doing here
() 'm here to help you
Help me how
First, put down the plate
Tom slowly obliges
Now come here and sit down
Tom sits next to the young girl
Paul and Mckenzie sit on either side of them
The key is not to panic
think 'm gonna be sick
Drink this
She hands him a glass of water
Tom drinks it down
What is that
Vodka
(grimacing at the taste) More
He gulps another down
Does Mom know you're here
It's gotta be past 10
7
Don't worry about it
Start from the beginning
Tell us what happened
Tom takes a deep breath
- Tom and Summer eat sandwiches in the park
(
) We spent the whole day together
- Tom and Summer walk through the stalls
(
) We went shopping
- Tom and Summer seated outside drinking coffee
He reads the newspaper, she reads a novel
(
) We had coffee
- Tom and Summer walk out of a movie theatre
(
) We saw a film
- Tom and Summer shop for music
Tom excitedly shows Summer a Ringo Starr solo album
(
) We bought music
8
' thought it was a great day
And then what happened
- Tom and Summer in a booth ordering dinner
(to ) Um
you know what
let's go crazy, 'll have
(to Summer) God,  love eating pancakes at night
It's like the greatest thing ever
How great is this
think we should stop seeing each other
'  - Just like that
Just like that
Did she say why
- This thing
This whatever it is
You and me
Do you think this is normal
don't know
Who cares about normal
'm happy
Aren't you happy
9
You're happy
You're not
All we do is argue
That is such a lie
'  - Maybe she was just in a bad mood
hormonal thing
(to Rachel) What do you know about
More than you
Oh my god
Please continue
- This can't be a total surprise mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy for months
Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife
We've had some disagreements but  hardly think 'm Sid Vicious
No
'm Sid
10
() So 'm Nancy
The Waitress comes out with the food
Tom and Summer stop their discussion until the meal is served and the Waitress leaves
Summer starts to eat
Let's just eat and we'll talk about it after
'm starving
Without another word she goes back to her pancakes
Tom watches her eat like this is the worst travesty in the history of mankind
(mouth full) Mmm, you're so right
These are great
Tom looks at his food in disgust
He may never eat again
() What
Tom stands up to go
Tom, don't
Come back
You're still my best fr--- '
'  - Silence for a few beats
Jesus
That's harsh
don't know what 'm gonna do
You're gonna be fine
11
() 'm gonna throw up
Or that
Here
Tom drinks more vodka
Come on Hansen
You'll be ok
You're the best guy  know
You'll find someone
You know what they say
there's plenty other fish in the sea
No
Sure they do
They say that
Well they're wrong
It's not true
've fished in that sea
've jumped in and swam in that sea
'm fucking Aquaman
(to Rachel) Sorry
What  mean is
there are no other fish
This was my fish
Paul and McKenzie share a very concerned look
: (86) - Tom walks alongside his friend
Out of nowhere, he says: 'm in love with Summer
12
() For real
: - ' (
) love her smile
- ' (
) love her hair
- ' (
) love her knees
- ' (
) love how one eye is higher up on her face than the other eye
- ' (
) love the scar on her neck from this operation she had as a kid
- '  (   -) (
) love how she looks in my Clash - shirt
- (
) love how she looks when she's sleeping
- ' (
) love the sound of her laugh
, play the middle 8 of "Every Little Thing She Does is Magic" by The Police
13
(
) love how  hear this song every time  think of her
- ,
(
) love how she makes me feel
Like anything's possible
Like,  don't know
like life is worth it
: - Paul and Tom
For real, Paul
'm madly in love with that girl
Paul is silent for a beat
Oh shit
(1) - Tom as we saw him earlier
Bored
In the boardroom
Mckenzie is in mid-presentation
Now  know this may be a little risque
but if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach
The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that
Mckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait of Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, and the kid from "Jerry Maguire"
14
May 21st
Other Mother's Day
The co-workers nod and digest this idea
is the head of the department
Hmmm
That's an intriguing idea McKenzie
Along with Grossman's "Magellan Day" 'd say we've got some potential here
What do you think Hansen
Could you write up some prototypes for these
Tom is about to answer when
the door opens
Excuse me, Mr
Vance
There's a call for you on line 3
And in walks this girl
Summer
We've met her by now but Tom hasn't
This is the first time
His eyes go wide and from that moment on, he can't take them off her
(to the table) Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant
Summer just moved here from
Michigan
Right
Michigan
Well, Summer, everyone
Everyone, Summer
Excuse me,  have to take this
Nice to meet you all
Summer gives a little wave before following Vance out
She doesn't notice Tom whose face looks like he's just seen God
15
(3, 4, 5) - Tom trying to work
And failing
He turns to McKenzie
What do we know about this new girl
Who
The new girl
Summer
In Vance's office
Dude
hear she's a bitch from hell
() Really
Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room
She was totally not having it
Maybe she was just in a hurry
And maybe she's some uppity, better than everyone, superskank
Damn
know
She's pretty hot
That makes me so mad
Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it
16
Dunno
Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin
and really good teeth
And maybe the world's most perfect breasts
Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe
(as explanation) Women
Ugh
You know what
Screw her
We haven't even met and  can't stand her already
- Tom is listening to headphones
Summer enters the elevator and Tom actively puts on a show to ignore her
Summer hears the music
The Smiths
Tom, pretending not to hear or care, gives her an unenthusiastic wave
love The Smiths
Tom, still pretending, takes off his headphones
Sorry
said
love The Smiths
You have good taste in music
beat as Tom processes this information
17
() You like the Smiths
() "To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
" Love it
The elevator doors open and she gets off
(accidentally out loud) Oh my god
(8) - The office sings "Happy Birthday" to a  -
When they get to the part about her name, Tom is the only one who knows it, everyone else just there for the cake
Song over, everyone digs in
Tom finds himself standing next to Summer
Hi
Hello
So, uh, Summer
Tom
Yeah
How's it going so far
The city or the firm
Both
Either
'm happy
Still getting situated
How long have you worked here
18
Oh, you know, 4, 5
years
Really
Jesus
Did you always want to write greeting cards
Are you nuts
don't even want to do it now
What is it you want to do
studied to be an architect actually
That's so cool
What happened
Eh, you know
Same old story
Moved to the city to work for a company
Company went under
Needed a job
My friend worked here
Got me this
And are you any good
(points to a framed card) Well  wrote that one
() "Today You're a Man
Mazel Tov on your Bar Mitzvah
" It's a big seller
meant, are you any good as an architect
Oh
No
doubt it
Well, 'd say you're a perfectly adequate
greeting card writer
19
Why thank you
That's what they called me in college
"Perfectly adequate" Hansen
They used to call me "Anal Girl
" Tom does a spit-take and almost chokes
() was very neat and organized
There's an awkward silence
Anyway,  should get back
Ok, well, 'll see you around
She walks back to her cubicle at the other end of the hall
Tom watches her walk away, completely enamored
He sits down at his desk and sets out to work
But before he does, his eyes fall on a sketch he drew of a house
It's dated 2001 and it's the only architecture sketch on his wall
(11) '  - Tom is playing Playstation with Rachel
And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published
Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper
Your favorites
We're so compatible it's insane
Seriously
It doesn't make sense
She's not like  thought at all
She's
amazing
20
Oh boy
What
You know
just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her "the one
" () Of course it does
(
) Dinner
, 50s, Tom and Rachel's mother, stands in the doorway
Pause and come eat
They do
Tom enters the living room area and sits down next to his stepdad , 60s, a quiet, professorial Southern gentleman type
Hey Martin
and Sarah
He met a girl
() Yeah
() Yeah
Sarah grows serious too
Oh shit
: 21
The Wright Brothers, Galileo, Heaven's Gate, Neil Armstrong
When one strongly believes in something, it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds
: , age 6, mesmerized by a vinyl album cover of Olivia Newton-John in "Xanadu
" Tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of "true love
" () The evidence did not support him
: (-8914) - Little Tom stares at a  , 6, who has the same hairstyle and dress as Newton-John on that cover
Tom draws a picture
It's a boy and a girl with a giant heart over them
He stands up and walks over to the girl, putting the picture on her desk
Not a word is spoken
Satisfied, he returns to his seat and waits to see what happens
Exhibit : Lisa Rayner
The Little Girl stands up and walks the picture over to Tom is mortified
The   eats the drawing
(-5313) 22
- leads the crowd in a cheer to find  , 15, finishing making out with a homely He says goodbye and walks off, looking back longingly
Exhibit : Wendy Wilson
Once Tom is out of frame, a   approaches Wendy
Then they start making out
(-2825) - sits next to his girlfriend
His smile gleams
'm so glad we decided to go away together Bec
know we've only been dating a few months but it's been
awesome
Exhibit : Rebecca Myles
And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico
best spring break ever
Across the aisle Rebecca makes eye contact with three think we should see other people
(-734) 23
- Younger Tom sits in the passenger seat
Raven-haired drives
And, finally
Exhibit : Amanda Heller
It's just
it's complicated
What's complicated
Last week you said you loved me
know it's sudden but
No, this can't be
Everything was going so great
don't understand
() Here
What's this
She puts a disc into the cd player
Because you're, like, the biggest music nerd 've ever met,  think this should really help explain where 'm coming from
pop song begins to play on the stereo
They listen for a few beats
Tom is confused
You remember how much  loved this song when you first played it for me
Sure
It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks
24
Right
And  still like it, don't get me wrong
It's just
When hear it now,  don't feel the same
rush
(still confused) Ok
press the skip button
Still Tom doesn't understand
What does this have to do with--
'd rather listen to something else
And with that, it slowly sinks in for him
But Amanda
this is a great fucking song
(22) - Tom removes his headphones and sits defeated with McKenzie and Paul in a booth
It's off
What
Me and Summer
Was it ever on
25
No
But it could have been
In a world where good things happen to me
Yeah well, that's not really where we live
No
So what happened
You ready for this
- Tom is alone
The door opens
In walks Summer
(
) So there we are
All alone
Nine more floors to ride
Plenty of time
figure
this is my chance
If not now when, right
They ride in silence for a few beats
Summer
Yeah
() So how was your weekend
It was good
- The friends wait for more
You believe that shit
26
What shit
think  missed something
"It was good
" She didn't say "It was good
" She said "It was good
" Emphasis on the good
She basically said " spent the weekend having sex with this guy  met at the gym
" Fucking whore
Screw her
It's over
Everyone's silent
What the hell is wrong with you
Dude, you got problems
She's not interested in me
There's nothing  can do
Based on
"it was good
" And some other things
Like what, she said "hey" instead of "hi" cause that totally means she's a lesbian
gave her all sorts of chances
- Tom types at his desk
Summer approaches the cubicle Tom shares with McKenzie
'm going to the supply room
Anyone need anything
No thanks
27
think you know what  need
There's a beat
Toner
Oh ok, sure, no prob
- The office is emptying out
Only a few people remain but Tom and Summer are two of them
Tom takes this opportunity to put a  in his computer and play the song really loud
It's " Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner
No reaction from Summer
Tom turns it up
Still nothing
Tom turns it down, defeated
' Tom is there
Do you want to go out with me
beat
Summer says nothing
And the Priest says, "But we're already out
" They both laugh
That is hilarious
know
And when she walks away, he smacks his head a few times with his palm
- Not once did she take the bait
Not once
Screw it
'm done with her
It's over
28
Tom's friends all look at him like he's crazy
(27 & 28) - '  - Tom sits at his desk with headphones on trying to work
But with Summer down at the end of the hall, he's having a hard time concentrating
McKenzie shares a cubicle with Tom
This Friday
10 bucks all you can karaoke at The Well
No way McKenzie
Absolutely not
Come on
() "Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and they got big titties
" They won't let you back in there after last time
wasn't that bad
Not at all
You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk
Quiet night for you
() You saved my life that day
We are not going back there
29
This is a work thing, Tommy
It won't be like that
The whole office is going
really can't
Even if  wanted to
There's a lot of stuff  gotta take care of
You're not listening to me
What
The whole office is going
Tom looks over to where Summer sits
And realization dawns on him
- Summer is in a back booth with some co-workers when Tom walks in to the crowded place
McKenzie has the microphone and he's singing "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" by Poison
He's real into it and, well, it's kinda sad
Tom waves to McKenzie and walks over to the booth
Hi
Hey
They said you weren't coming
You asked if  was coming
() mean
my plans got cancelled
Tom is at a loss
There's yet another awkward silent beat between them
Thankfully, it's interrupted by
(already drunk) Goddamn that song is brilliant
What's up Hansen
Summer sees the next song come up on the screen
30
Ooh that's me
She downs a shot and jumps up on stage
(into mic) Ok
'm the new girl so no making fun of me
Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on
She takes a deep breath as the opening bars of "Born to Run" begin to play and Summer starts to sing
Tom sees Summer as the actress in whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a midget in a tuxedo
) Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as Summer chats with co-workers at another table
Tom can't help but stare at Summer
She notices and waves
He smiles, hopeful that she'll come over
She doesn't
He hides his disappointment
Tom walks back to his table with drinks
Summer is there in mid-conversation with McKenzie
You were great up there, by the way
Well you can't go wrong with The Boss
(sitting down) hear that
Hey, did you know Tom here's from Jersey
Yeah
Lived there til  was 12
named my cat after Springsteen
No kidding
What's his name
31
Bruce
() That makes sense
She laughs
She's really cute when she laughs
So you got a boyfriend
Me
No
Tom shoots daggers at McKenzie for that comment
McKenzie mouths "what
" Summer sees nothing
Why not
Don't really want one
Come on
don't believe that
You don't believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent
() Are you a lesbian
No, 'm not a lesbian
'm just not comfortable being somebody's "girlfriend
"  don't want to be anybody's anything, you know
have no idea what you're talking about
It sounds selfish,  know, but just like being on my own
Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt
Who needs all that
We're young
We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world
() 32
(cont'd) say, let's have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later
But
what if you meet someone and fall in love
() Love
You seriously believe in that stuff
Of course  do
Interesting
real romantic
Oh you have no idea
This one
embarrassing
There was this one girl, (to Tom) gotta tell this story -- Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up
Summer, hold on
you don't believe in love
don't even know what that word means
know 've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs
And  know that today most marriages end in divorce
Like my parents
Well mine too but -- Oh yeah, And  read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in "love" with a rock
Is that the love you're talking about
Well
33
Why, what's your take on it
: , real quick , : On Tom: think it's
kind of a huge thing
() Ok
Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one
McKenzie senses some discontent
So, uh, who's singing next
(re: singing) 'd say it's your turn loverboy
Nooo
don't sing in public
Sure you do
see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in
don't
You really do
It's ok
like it
Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous
34
(can't help himself) Self-confidence
Ha
Tom elbows him in the ribs again
Anyway, 'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people
Ok then
Let's drink
It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing
Bartender
Tom is up there singing The Clash's "Magnificent Seven
" You wouldn't think so but Tom is a up there
He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts
It's a sight to behold
Summer is all smiles watching
Tom and Summer back at the table
Summer is humming something
That's not it
What is that then
have no idea
They're both having a good time
used to watch it every week
Me too
Why can't we think of the stupid -Team theme song
Pathetic
This is gonna bother me for weeks
35
Totally
They share another laugh and then it gets quiet
In that good way
McKenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of "Proud to Be an American
" He really means it
At any minute he might start to cry
"And 'd proudly stand
" (aggressive drunk) said stand
and
Oh here we go
- Tom helps a nearly comatose McKenzie exit the place
Summer is with them
(to Summer) This guy
() He's the best
Ok, let's get you in a cab
No
'm gonna walk
live right down that street
Or that one
() Is he gonna be ok
He'll be fine
cab arrives
Tom and Summer help McKenzie inside
Hey
What's up
36
Not you
You
(beat, to Summer) He likes you
() Ok, goodnight McKenzie
mean
likes you, likes you
For real
Tell her Tom
Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can
Now it's just Tom and Summer
Tom talks a mile a minute to try and erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind
Sorry you had to see that
Happens every time we come here
It's unbelievable
Something about that guy and singing for people
don't know
But at least he didn't -- Is that true
What
You know what
Do you
like me
Yeah
like you
Of course  do
As a friend
Right
As a friend
Just as a friend
The wheels are spinning in Tom's head
What's the right answer here
Yes
mean
haven't really thought about
Yes
Why
37
Nothing
just
You're interesting
'd like us to be friends
Is that ok
Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else
He hides his disappointment the best he can
Oh yeah totally
Friends
You and me
That's
perfect
Cool
Cool
Silence
Well, 'm that way
Good night Tom
'night Summer
Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go the other way
(under his breath) Friends
Awesome
That's just great
Well done Hansen, you idiot
Tom walks a few more steps
And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even noticing, It's unbelievable
There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure if he's dreaming or not
But then he realizes, suddenly, out of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually happening
(29) : "     " by Hall and Oates
38
- It's the greatest morning of all time
Tom walks down the street
Or, more accurately, Tom struts down the street
He's pointing at people as he passes, winking, doing a little shuffle
He is the man
He checks out his reflection in a window
stares back
People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up
parade forms behind him
The , a  , the ,   and  , everybody loves Tom today
and  themselves walk with Tom singing the song
Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by
The  also pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last night
He walks on, the man
We notice the sidewalk lights up every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean"
fly onto Tom's shoulder
He smiles and winks at them
- Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates
She sees him and immediately lights up
Hey
Hey
Vance pokes out of his corner office
Summer,  need -- Oh hello Hansen
Hey Mr
Vance
Yes, Mr
Vance
And they're all business
As Tom turns to go, however, Summer gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make anyone's day complete
Tom gives her the international signal for `'ll call you later' in return
Vance sees none of it
Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world
39
'  - Tom answers the door
It's Paul (in hospital scrubs)
You son of a bitch
He walks inside without waiting for an invite
Last night, karaoke night
() Shhh
The same girl you'd been whining and crying and bitching about for weeks now
have not been
The same girl you said was way out of your league and you'd have no chance with no matter what
That girl
Paul, seriously
Did you bang her
No
Blow job
No
Hand job
No, Paul, no jobs
'm still unemployed
We just kissed
40
Come on, level with me
As your best friend, who tolerated a whole month of talk talk talk about this girl, nothing but Summer this, Summer that, Summer Summer Summer, mean you were practically stalking her
Shhh
Suddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard
From the bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out
Oh crap
Hi, 'm Summer
Summer, wow what an unusual name
'm sure 'd remember that if  had heard it before
Tom, how come you've never mentioned you knew such a lovely little lady
(off Tom's nasty look) Or perhaps you have and 've just forgot
(to Summer) mean, with all the women in Tom's life it's hard to keep track
(not helping) Ok, well,  was just
'm Paul
Hi Paul
(not sure what else to ) 'm a doctor
Nice to meet you
Anyway, 'm leaving now
Pretend was never here
Tom, talk to you later
Hey, If any jobs open up
41
Tom quickly shuts the door on Paul
If you heard
Heard what
Excellent
You ready to go
'm stalking,
Tom realizes she's heard it all
() He exaggerates
(198) - Tom and Summer eating, not really talking much
At another table, Tom sees a    feeding each other food
Check them out
Summer sees
She has no reaction
() That is hot
Summer keeps eating
am very turned on right now
Sometimes you can be so judgmental
Huh
42
mean, who are you
They're happy
Just mind your own business
Summer goes back to eating
Tom can't believe she snapped
(31) - An equally   go at it in a booth to find Tom and Summer early in their relationship, in a booth across the room, watching in hysterics
9, 9
5
Too soon to say
It's all in the dismount
If we're lucky, there won't be a dismount
Summer, her cheeks flushed already from laughing, loses it again
They are having a great night
can't believe them
have like zero patience for
hear ya
If  want to watch people make out,  have big windows and binoculars at home
Yeah
() No
That would be wrong
They laugh some more
She is in hysterics
This is fun
You're fun

Thanks
mean,  just want to say, up front, 'm not looking for anything serious
Tom is a little surprised
Are you cool with that
() Sure
It freaks some guys out when  say that
(still confused) Not me
Let's just have fun
Let's just
hang out, no pressure, no labels, no obligations
() Ok
Tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it
Sure
() Wanna hold my hand under the table
beat
Yeah
'  - Summer and Tom come bounding in, lip-locked and all over each other
They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other
Suddenly, Tom stops
44
'll be
back in a sec
He walks into the hallway, out of her sight
He looks into the hallway mirror
Settle
Don't get too excited
She's just a girl
There's lots of them
Who look like that
And like what you like
They're everywhere
Calm yourself
He takes a few deep breaths
Are you calm
() Ok
Then it's time to go back in
We watch from behind as he re-enters his bedroom
Where Summer waits
Under the covers
Naked
Hi
Oh sweet Jesus
Tom can't help but do a little celebration dance
: Sex has been had
Summer is asleep
Tom lies next to her
He still can't help but be ecstatic
He is pumping his fists in the air and silently shouting "Woo Hoo
" (388) -
,  , , '
(into ) fucking hate Summer
- '  (as before) (
) hate her crooked teeth
45
- '  (as before) (
) hate her 1950s haircut
- '  (as before) (
) hate her knobby knees
- '  (as before) (
) hate her lopsided, asymmetrical, cock-eyed head
- '  (as before) (
) hate that centipede-shaped scar
- '  (as before) (
) hate her
stupid
big boobs
-   (as before) (
) hate the way she sleeps
- ' (
) hate the way she laughs
, play the middle 8 of "Every Little Thing She Does is Magic
" (
) -
on     , terrified of this raving lunatic
Son, you're gonna have to exit the vehicle
: 46
- Tom passes Summer's desk
new  sits there
He notices, in the trash, a reprint of an avant garde surrealist painting of two dogs humping
He stops and retrieves it from the bin like it's some family heirloom
He gives the secretary a dirty look for tossing it
(35) - : the same painting
Summer and Tom looking at it curiously
It's very
complex
Complex
Yes
: a second painting which is nothing but red
Summer and Tom looking at it with the same expressions
In a way, it speaks so much by saying
so little
feel the same way
: a third painting which could only be, well, poop
Summer and Tom, still perplexed but trying
They say nothing, until: You wanna go to the movies
() God yes
47
- The marquee reads "Part Vampire
Part Giant
`
'" -
The theater is packed
Everyone is laughing and screaming and throwing popcorn
Tom and Summer are having a great time
(51) - Summer and Tom stand on San Francisco's most interesting street corner, where the ultra-modern Transamerica Building stands next to the ancient Columbus Tower
lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that
- Summer and Tom in front of the famed Roman-style structure
The guy who made this, Maybeck, he is a God
- Summer and Tom sit on the steps which offers a stunning view of the city's architectural marvels
It just makes you feel
peaceful
They really do seem at peace
- Tom and Summer in front of the gargantuan mirrored building
48
No
See now, this is torture
Why
Over there, that's St
Patrick's church
The beauty of St
Patrick's is its humility
With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away, it's too humble
No one even knows it's there
How would you change it
There's a million things
First, there's no need for this much glass
You could easily
Show me
What
Don't talk about it
Do it
Summer gives him a pen from her purse and the underside of her arm
Tom thinks about this
Then he starts to draw a sketch on her skin
We catch her watching his face as he draws
She's attracted to his enthusiasm
See this beam, it steps on the landscape
But if we moved it
just so
(55) - Tom and Summer, who have ridden together to work, stand outside the building
49
You wanna -- No you go first
It doesn't matter to me
Whatever you want
- passes
- Hey Summer
Tom
(like nothing's up) Hey
/ Hi
Summer joins the co-worker and walks in
(to Co-Worker) So how's it going
She turns back to look at Tom on the way
She sticks out her tongue to be cute
Co-Worker doesn't see
Tom is crazy about her
- Tom at his cubicle with the one architecture sketch
The phone rings and he picks it up
Hello
(
) remember
- Summer is on her cell phone in the office copy room
She begins to sing the theme song to "The -Team
" (
) That's it
50
McKenzie enters and sees her singing into the phone
Turns without a word and leaves
'  - Tom listening to her sing
McKenzie comes over
Your girl is losing it
Tom is too wrapped up in the phone call to acknowledge him
The smile on his face is the biggest we've seen yet
(68) - We just see the curtain, but we can see their silhouettes behind it
Summer and Tom are trying to have sex in the shower
They're trying to stable themselves, grip something so as not to fall, elbows are flying, it's a mess
This is not at all as easy as it looks
Ow
The curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down
They fall on top of each other laughing
(77) - Tom and Summer wander through the aisles
There's no way
Why not
51
"Octopus's Garden
" You may as well just say "Piggies
" told you
love Ringo
You're insane
Why
Cause nobody loves Ringo
That's what  love about him
() Ooh
Summer drags Tom into the curtained-off "Porn" section
She picks up a box
() This got great reviews
'  - Tom and Summer get comfortable
Both are excited and looking forward to this
The movie starts, the credits roll
Tom and Summer start to make out a bit, both keeping an eye on the : '  - 20 Tom and Summer, watching the movie
Intently
They've even got popcorn
Is that
possible
(79) 52
- Tom, Mckenzie and Paul are having a drink
So what's going on with you and Summer
don't know
Is she your girlfriend
wouldn't say that
What would you say
Like, are we "going steady
" Come on, guys
We're adults
It's not an unreasonable question
Watch
McKenzie, do you have a girlfriend
No  do not
In fact girls are repulsed by me
Paul, how about you
Why yes, in fact  do
Her name is Robyn
See Tom, it's easy
It is when you've been with the same girl since high school
You've been "seeing" this girl, what, two months now
Something like that
And you haven't discussed it
53
No
She's not
We're not like that
Like what
Normal
We've just been
hanging out
Hanging out
Yeah
Guys, look, Summer and
we know how we feel
We don't need to label it
"Boyfriend, girlfriend
" That stuff is very
juvenile
Beat
You're so gay
Well let me ask you this then
Do you want her to be your girlfriend
Tom takes a second to think about this
don't know
Maybe
heard her Hansen
She's not the girlfriend type
You're gonna need to discuss it
No
We're adults
It'll be fine
Have you made her a  yet
() Maybe
Oh dude
54
You really need to have that talk
(80) - Rachel is playing field hockey on the 7th grade team
Tom is watching from behind the players' bench
whistle blows and Rachel comes back and sits down
You were saying
My thinking is
why rock the boat
Things are going well
If we start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death
Like saying to a girl " love you
" know what you mean
That's what happened with me and Sean
Who the hell's Sean
My boyfriend before Mark
Who the f--
Never mind
Help me need solid female advice
'm 12
Yeah but, you know me
This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble
55
Hmm
So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend
' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months
Is that about right
() Something like that
Thomas, tell me this
Is it worse to get the wrong answer now
or find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway
Who's Lars
He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs
That son of a bitch
You see what  mean
The whistle blows again and Rachel gets up to go back on the field
Later dude
Coach, no, wait
need her
(shouting to Rachel) Rachel, what do you think  should do
(calling back) Just don't be a pussy
On Tom, we: : 56
'  - Tom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate
Tom is very conflicted and we can see it in his face
They're silent a few beats, before: Hi
Hi
Are you ok
Yeah
You sure
He's not
He clenches his teeth
And begins
Summer, 've gotta ask you something
Ok
He takes a deep breath
He's about to go on when: Wait
Summer finds on the radio a particular song
("Waiting in Vain" by Bob Marley, if you must know
) Whoa
Oh my god
We can't talk during this song
It's too beautiful
And it is
Tom's hand is on the gear shift
She puts hers there and locks it with his
Tom listens and Tom watches Summer listening
There's something about this moment, the way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply overwhelmed
Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this girl
57
Marley sings: "In life  know there's lots of grief/ but your love is my relief
" We know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight
(172) - Tom and Summer are in a     at a party
reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with, drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them
Tom notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention they're getting from her
It's been a while
He misses that attention
: (272-286) - Tom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders through the self-help section
He leafs through some of the titles
He grabs just about every one of them
- Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his bed
He reads from one called "Six Steps to Getting Over Him
" (
) "So he broke your heart
You've been sad and depressed for weeks
Perhaps you've turned to drinking or even drugs
And nothing's helped
Now what
Should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day
" Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream
He continues to read
58
(
) "No you should not
" He slowly puts the ice cream down
(
) "Through extensive research, we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill
Those steps are:" - Tom jogs
(
) "One
Exercise
The body's release of endorphins will assuage the brain and provide a genuine sense of accomplishment and success
" Cars pass him at top speed
Bicycles breeze by him
child on a big wheel soars past
He may as well be jogging in place
- Tom is taking a yoga class
(
) "Two
Physical and Mental relaxation
Channel all of your energies to the core of your being for a new understanding of the self and others
" This shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as Tom
Everyone else in the class seems at peace
Tom can't even get the breathing right
- Tom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the homeless
(
) "Three
Charity
Reach out
You are not alone in your pain
" 59
Next in line is a   holding hands
Tom spirits immediately fall
Even these two somehow found each other
- Tom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store
(
) "Four
Shoe Shopping
Ladies
you know you want to
Indulge
" , just sorta standing there
Confused
He doesn't really want new shoes
- Tom backpacks alone in the forest
(
) "Five
Travel
Take some time to see another environment
Get perspective
It's a beautiful world
It will be for you again someday
" This is it, he's finally found some peace
Tom looks up to the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and takes a deep breath
pop up on the screen to point out that Tom is standing in
There's a    a step ahead of him
giant   creeping up behind him
on his leg
And in the distance a has Tom sized up in his rifle sight
Tom starts to itch
- Tom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment
(
) "Six
Redecorate
Start anew
" He's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it
60
(
) "By taking these few steps, you will have discovered your inner strength and should be ready to move on
bet you can hardly remember his face at all
" We pull back to  Tom has painted a giant mural of Summer on his wall
He looks at the self-help book and dropkicks it
(145) - Summer and Tom stand by the bar
just don't get women's fashion nowadays
Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats
Explain this to me
People think it looks good
Do you
On some
like how you dress
Yeah
What if  started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg
() Please don't
tall, well-built, -   has suddenly appeared next to them
61
(to Summer) Hey
Tom and Summer stop talking
Hey
How's it going
Ok
Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down
Not sure what else to do
At this point he's more amused than concerned
You live around here
Yeah not too far
've never seen you here before
You're not too perceptive
Ha
That's funny
Tom smiles to himself
This guy's a tool
Nothing to worry about
So, uh, let me buy you a drink
No thank you
As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom
The Guy notices
Up to this point he had not connected the two of them together
Are you with this guy
Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now
62
() Hi
'm Tom
Whatever
(to Summer) Come on, one drink
What are you drinking
Sorry, no thank you
Tom is pleased
You're serious
This guy
And now he's pissed
Hey buddy -- (to the Douche) Don't be rude
'm flattered, 'm just not interested
Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok
It's a free country
Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now what
" After a beat: So you and him, huh
can't believe that
Is this guy really your boyfriend
And that question hangs in the air
Tom, panicked, decides to cut the silence
All the pent up uncertainty and confusion, coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost automatic       '
Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling
Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's fist)
63
There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised
And then the Douche spins around and starts
: - Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place
Tom is a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it
Did you see that punch
don't know where it came from
haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade
Guess 'm gonna have to throw out this shirt
Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first time she's furious
Hey
What is it
can't believe you
What
You were so completely uncool in there
You're mad at me
just got my ass kicked for you
Oh that was for me
You were, what, protecting me
Next time Tommy, don't
fight my own battles
Come on, that guy was an asshole
You didn't have to hit him
Why didn't you just let me handle it
don't know
He was -- 64
See
This is why  don't want a serious relationship
Whoa
What was that
Nothing
Look,  like you Tom like this
What we've been doing
But maybe it's gone too
What
told you all along what  don't want and it's
Tom waits for more
It doesn't come
'm tired
Can we talk about this tomorrow
It's silent
He doesn't know what to do or say or think
Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways
(calling to her) just got my ass kicked
Only the  outside the bar hear this
(to Onlookers) got one good shot in
(146 & 147) - Tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose
Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there
She stops short
() Hi
65
() Hi
What's up
Nothing
Ok
Nothing else is said
Wait, are you still mad at me
(rolling her eyes) Tom
Holy shit you are
can't believe you
(re: copies) Are you almost done
Yeah
'm all done
He starts to walk out
You know what
Sometimes you really don't make any sense
Tom walks out
He looks back but she isn't looking
When she looks back at him, he's gone
Tom about to leave the office
Passes Summer's desk
She's on the phone
He wants to stop and say something but she's busy
He walks on
She never knew he was there
Summer, packed up to go, walks over to Tom's cubicle but he's already gone
-
- Left: Tom tosses and turns in his sleep
66
Right: Summer lies awake, staring at the ceiling
Left: Tom picks up the phone
Is about to dial when he stops himself and hangs up
Right: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring
It doesn't
'  - Tom is awakened by a buzzer
He hits the "sleep" button but the buzzing isn't coming from his alarm
It's his door
He gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it
It's Summer
Say you're sorry
Huh
Say you're sorry for acting like a jerk
am
'm sorry for acting like a jerk
Ok
Me too
Summer
we don't have to label what we're doing
just
need - know - Consistency
need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way
can't promise you that
Nobody can
Anyone who does is a liar
beat
can only tell you how  feel right now
or  can show you
67
She comes in and kisses him
He thinks about it for a second
Is this enough to assuage his doubts
Damn it, she wins again
He shuts the door in our faces
'  - Tom and Summer in the wee hours
Have you ever had a real "boyfriend
" What
boyfriend
"Going steady
" Whatever
You know what  mean
Well
yeah
More than one
few
Tell me about them
Oh no way
Why
Cause there's nothing to tell
Come on, 'm interested
You wanna have the relationship history conversation
Yes
You sure about that
68
No
Yeah
don't know
Why not can take it
Ok
Well, in high school, there was Markus
: Still photograph of
Or at least how he appears in Tom's mind
Arm cocked, about to throw the winning touchdown pass
Quarterback slash homecoming king
He was a rower
Very hot
What happened to Markus
He works for the Republican party
Very successful
Just not for me
Ok
And then
Well, for a short time in college, there was Kurt
: Still photograph of
As Tom envisions him
Playing the guitar on stage in Motley Crue
That didn't really go anywhere
() And
my semester in Rome
Daniele Belardelli
"The Puma
" : Still photograph of
swarthy Italian posing in front of a Vespa moped in tight Gucci pants, his boner clearly trying to escape
The Puma
Yeah, cause, you know
Tom has no idea
And he doesn't want to know
69
And that's it
The ones that lasted
What happened
Why didn't they work out
Nothing happened really
It's what always happens
Life
On
Silent for a few beats
Did he want to hear that
: (290S) - Tom, unshaven, un-showered, walks by himself
He turns a corner and sees Summer walking towards him
As she gets closer he sees it's not her after all and breathes a sigh of relief
- Tom watches
An advertisement for toothpaste comes on
Tom could swear the actress was Summer
- trolley going the other direction passes by Tom is a fucking mess
(302) - Tom and an attractive girl we haven't seen before walk towards an outdoor cafe
Her name is
It's clear right away that Tom can't wait for this night to end already
70
So how long have you known Paul and Robyn
Since grade school
No way, really
That's crazy
Yeah
Well 'm glad you called
They spoke very highly of you
Great
- Tom and Alison eat
In silence
So
uh
how's it going
Ok
Beat
You've been pretty quiet
Sorry
'm pretty quiet too
Usually
It's nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything, you know
Uh-huh
More silence
Do you want to try some -- 71
No thanks
Alison looks at her food
Tom realizes he's been difficult, starts to feel kinda bad
'm sorry
It's just
there's this girl
Oh
'm not usually like this
wasn't before
Long story short, she wrecked me
don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and 'm still kinda thinking about her
() Well maybe you should think about
someone else
who could cheer you up
can't get her out of my head, you know
see her everywhere
She's all  think about
And it's horrible
Cause  totally didn't see it coming
thought things were fine
So now  keep going through every day in my mind, every second really
Wondering
What went wrong
Is it my fault
Could  have prevented it somehow
- (   51) Summer and Tom stand on the street corner looking at the buildings
lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that
Tom keeps talking
Summer turns and looks directly at the 72
While you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you, 'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways  can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire  am
- Tom and Alison
Maybe there were things  could have said or done, you know
'  -  - (  39) From the scene in which Tom and Summer first slept together
He's sleeping like a baby, probably the best sleep he's had in a long while
Summer lies next to him
Wide awake
Bored and unfulfilled
- Tom and Alison
Alison is desperately trying to get a drink
Waiter
Or
Christ,  don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with
-  - (  22) Tom and Summer ride in silence for a few beats
() How was your weekend
(winks at him) It was good
73
- Anyway
sorry
If 'm acting strange, that's why
It's ok
'm sure it's tough getting over an ex-girlfriend
Actually she was never my girlfriend
Now Alison is really confused
And it's right around the part where Tom starts totally cracking up
just
thought 'd have figured it out by now, you know
My life
Where 'm going, where  want to end up, who with
All that stuff
still don't know anything
And the thing is
When  was with Summer, none of that mattered never even noticed how much of my life was missing
Isn't that weird
You were in love, that's what it does
But, now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill them
Sure
() Hey, 've been talking non-stop
You talk
Me
Well  grew up -- So what do you think
Did  do something
Did  not do something
What can  do now
() () 74
(cont'd) You wanna get out of here
know this great
(suddenly excited) Oh
You know what we should do
- Tom is, yes, on stage singing another song by The Clash, "Train in Vain
" Not so much singing as having a nervous breakdown to music
"You said you'd stand by your man
/So tell me something  don't understand
You said you loved me
/And that's a fact
And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Alison sits by herself in a booth trying to hide her face
"You didn't stand by me
Not at all
You didn't stand by me," 'm talking about you Summer
On Alison, having the worst date ever
: (219) '  - Tom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out
punkish pop song plays in the b
g
that he occasionally boogies down to
He's excited
He tucks his shirt into his pants
He ties his tie
He brushes his teeth with aplomb
He looks for, finds, and plucks a grey hair from his head
He makes some faces into the mirror
Satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street
75
- Tom walking in the Spring air, feeling good
The phone rings
: '  - Summer on the cell as she enters her apartment
She looks like she's coming back from the gym
Hey it's me
Hello me
You having a good day
am thank you
Listen, about tonight
think  might just stay in and go to bed early
What
Why
'm just really tired and 've gotta go in early tomorrow
Would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead
Well
You don't want to just, maybe, go to dinner
mean, you've gotta eat right
'm not really that hungry
And this place is fancy right
(touching his tie) Sorta
'd rather not
Seriously, do you mind
Tom is standing still now, no longer moving
He's trying to keep his frustration from being audible
76
Hey, no, that's cool
Whatever you want to do
Thank you
So we'll talk tomorrow, alright
Sure
Great
Good night Tom
Good night
() Hey, Happy
birthday
But the line is dead
Tom's head sinks into his chest
Yet another frustrating night
: , just got lucky  guess
We met in elementary school
We had the same class schedule in the 7th grade and we just
clicked
: Love
Shit,  don't know
As long as she's cute and she's willing, right
Actually, cute is a strong word
Not atrocious
That's a pretty complex question
Philosophers, poets, scientists, everybody has a theory, don't they
() 77
(cont'd) kinda like what Nietzsche said: "There is always some madness in love, but there is also
always some reason in madness
" Think about it
Pretty smart
Although, Nietzsche also said "Kill the Jews
" So there's that
've been happily married for 30 years
She's the light that guides me home
() Yes it is from one of our cards
() No someone else wrote it
Doesn't make it less true
Ok 'm sick of this love shit
Come on
We've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it's now genetically encoded in our very beings
And what does it mean
Absolutely nothing
Give me a break
'm just saying
really need some ass
'm desperate
() You got nothing
wouldn't say "the girl of my dreams," no
The girl of my dreams would have a better rack
Probably different hair, could like sports a little more
But
truth is
Robyn's better than the girl of my dreams
() You know why
Cause she's real
78
He says nothing
Just stands there
So confused
We go right : 5 second recap of the earlier color sequence
(101) - Tom is wandering through the office whistling
Hansen, don't you have like twenty bar mitzvah cards to write
Nope
All done
What are you working on
Congratulations
But 've run out of ways to say it
"Good job," "well done," "way to go"
got nothing
Why don't you try
"Everyday you make me proud
But today, you get a card
" () Shit
That's not bad
No worries
Tom walks by the room marked "Weddings and Anniversaries
" He's about to keep going when he pauses
- All of the people who work in here are
Currently, they are standing around one desk where Tom sits writing everyone's cards
79
This is good Millie
"To my wife, the love of my life
love you
" That's very nice
was thinking though, why not try something like
"Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete
" You know, spice it up a little
The Women clutch their heart like they might faint
- Workers are again all gathered around Tom
Did you try
"Merry
" Whoa/Perfect/Yes
What else you got
#1 Passover
Tom says something totally in Yiddish
No one knows what the hell he just said except for one Employee who bursts out in tears of joy
- Tom passes Summer at her desk
She waves
He waves back
He's so in love with her
- writing furiously at a computer terminal
"
aint no woman got what you got, sista girl
Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen
" () How's that
The -   are impressed
80
#1 Something's gotten into you son
Yeah
It's pretty cool
(222) - Tom and Summer in line to buy tickets
You really want to see this
It sounds amazing
It's, like, all stabbing and shit
Exactly
Ok
All you take me to are sappy little romances
want to see some open wounds, damn it
want carnage
Fantastic
Suddenly, Tom sees something at the front of the line
Oh shit
What
And here they come, Tom's mom and step-dad, Sarah and Martin
Tom's face registers a noticeable panic
Hey
81
Sarah and Martin are delighted at this coincidence
Sarah hugs and kisses her son
(looking at Summer) Hi Mom
Summer smiles
Maybe this will be ok
Mom, Martin, this is Summer
Summer
Well hello
We've heard so much about you
It's so good to finally meet you
Sarah hugs Summer
You too
And now Martin weighs in with his own hug
Tom notices Summer's face growing increasingly concerned
Why is he hugging me
(to Tom) Is this the girlfriend
Tom is caught like a deer in headlights
What can he do
Well this is the girl friend 've told you about
don't know if "girlfriend" is the right word
You going to see the serial killer one
Yes we are
Great
Should we save you seats
Again, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for Summer
Absolutely
82
Ok
We'll see you inside
When they're out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is distraught
Sorry about that
It's fine
You wanna go do something else
We can totally bolt
Did you tell them  was your girlfriend
What
No way
never used that word
They seemed to think
mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug
He's very
loving
Does he hug all your friends
There's that word again
Summer looks at Tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at him for something
Then she walks ahead of him into the theatre
He's forced to follow
Answer-less, as conflicted as ever
Why is none of this easy
: - Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row
Summer's face is cold, emotionless
Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact, something
She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her head turn his way
Tom gives up and watches the movie
We see a
83
It's a  racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen assassin
When he turns around we see the man is
Bullets fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away like Belmondo in
He dies an elaborate, violent, horrible on-screen death
(228) - Rave music blares
Tom stands off to the side looking miserable
Summer is on the dance floor
Though she's not really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with everyone
Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another
You're not having any fun
You're having enough for both of us
'm dancing
haven't danced in ages
God
Come on
No
Come on
wanna dance with you
Where were you an hour ago
might have danced then
've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once
So you're pissed
'm not pissed
Summer
you know hate this shit
Then why are you here
84
This is what you wanted to do so
we're doing it
Yeah well,  didn't need a chaperone
Go home
You're a buzzkill standing there pouting
() That's real nice
He walks off
She feels some guilt for a second
Tom
But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again
Tom is outside in the rain
We can still hear the music blaring from the club
Summer is in there
Tom is alone
He can't believe it's come to this
(251) : "     " by Hall and Oates
- The worst morning ever
Tom walks down the street
Or, more accurately, Tom sulks down the street
Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad, broken man and the world is an awful place
There's still Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up
He checks out his reflection in a window
Ron Howard's brother Clint looks back
Tom walks by a  making out on a bench
He grimaces
He walks by a sign that says " :
" He doesn't even stop
Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away
The '    stops to ask him for directions
He doesn't even look up
85
Tom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks
The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder
Tom tries to kill the bird
Can't even manage that
- He passes Summer desk on the way in
She's no longer there
He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends up just staring into space
'  - Tom has been called into the Principal's office
You wanted to see me, Mr
Vance
Yes Hansen
Sit down
Ok
Has something happened to you recently
What do you mean
death in the family, someone taken ill
anything like that
No
Look,  don't mean to pry
Does this have something to do with Summer leaving
Who
My assistant
86
(faking badly) Your
Tom
everyone knows
Nevermind
The reason 'm asking
lately your work performance has been
a little off
'm not following
For example, here's something you wrote last week
(reads from a card on his ) "Roses are Red, Violets are Blue
Fuck You Whore
" Now
most shoppers on Valentine's Day --- Mr
Vance
are you firing me
No, no, no
Relax Hansen
You're one of our most
adequate writers
Ok
Well, 'm sorry
Things for me have been a little difficult
That's ok
understand that
was just thinking
perhaps you could channel your energy into
this
He hands him some sympathy cards
Funerals and sympathy
Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no reasons to live
it's perfect for you
Whaddaya say
Good
Good
Now back to work you go
He quickly ushers him out of the office
87
(383) '  - Tom wakes up
He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls onto the floor and begins a brief push-up routine
(
) Most days of the year are entirely unremarkable
They begin and they end without creating a single lasting memory
Most days have no real impact on the course of a life
The phone rings
Tom stops his push-ups to answer it
(
) May 8th was a Saturday
- Tom walks in to find Paul and McKenzie at a table
They look extremely nervous
What's going on
Neither one answers him
They look at each other
Finally
We have news
Ok
It's about her
Do  want to hear it
Thats what we wanted to ask you
It's just
lately you've been
better
88
You've been much much better
So maybe it's best we don't ever bring her up again
Just let sleeping dogs lie
Leave those dogs alone Tom
You guys, look, 'm
appreciate what you're saying and, thank you, really, for putting up with me these past few months
've been crazy
But 've accepted the fact that she and  were just two very different people who wanted very different things
wanted to get serious
Shit,  loved her
And know now, she just isn't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy
The way wanted
And she probably never will
There was nothing  could do
Mckenzie and Paul just sit there
Now more uncomfortable than ever
On Tom, we: : - Tom comes charging out of the place with his friends following behind
There's no fucking way
Tom
It can't be
It's impossible
It is
89
How do you know
On Tom's pained face we
: ' Tom is going apeshit in his room
He's ripping down posters, taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart
He punches the wall
He drinks an entire bottle of red wine
He tries to find something to kick and can't
He throws his cell phone off his balcony
Finally he collapses on the bed
(384) ' The half-destroyed alarm clock goes off
Tom hits the off button
(385) ' Same exact thing
(386) - Tom, in a robe and boxer shorts, buys milk, , cigarettes, Jack Daniels, and twinkies
The  eyes him suspiciously
- Tom sees a  kissing on the sidewalk
He winces
He sees entwined on a bench
It's killing him
He sees a   walking towards him holding hands
He snaps
90
Jesus Christ people
Get a room
They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away
(387) ' Alarm clock
We   to see Tom is wide awake
He probably hasn't slept in a day or so
He has no reaction to the alarm
- Tom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the clothes he slept in
People pass and say hello
He can't muster responses
At his desk, Tom
Nothing
've been calling every five minutes
Are you ok
What
Oh yeah
Great
Do you need anything
Twinkies
Sorry
'm out of twinkies
Well let's go
Go
where
91
It's Thursday
- Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance
He's in his usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose
female -, 50s, stands at the front of the room in mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do with a cat in various poses
First we see, "Cat Reaching Up for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl
" - This one says "Go for it
" She clicks to the next slide
"Cat Hanging From Tree Branch
" - This one says "Don't give up
" Click
We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap
" - And this one says "You can do it
" We have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring Pickles, my cat
think people will really enjoy them
Thank you
She takes her seat
Good job Rhoda,  agree
Really inspirational stuff
Now, who's next
We haven't heard from "Sympathy" in a while
Hansen
(reacting to his name) Hmm
The Winter collection
You have anything to contribute
Uh
no
really don't
You have nothing
92
Well  wouldn't say nothing
Actually, that's about right
() Oh
k
We'll come back to you
McKenzie -- You know what
Yes Tom
Can  say something about the cat
Well sure
Go ahead
This here is, and Rhoda, you know mean no disrespect
but this
this is total shit
Tom
"Don't give up
" "You can do it
" He points to the screen, still showing the "Cat About to Leap" image
This isn't inspirational
It's suicidal
He tries that jump, 'm writing a sympathy card for that cat
That's the last thing  want to be doing with my life
It's bad enough writing these things for people
Hansen, this is a place of business
We don't cut down our co- workers -- That's cause we're liars
It's what we do here
Why don't we level with people
Stop feeding them nonsense
93
- () We're a greeting card company
Yes but think about it
Why do people buy these things
Not to say how they feel
There's paper and pens for that
People give these cards when they can't say how they feel
Or they're afraid to
And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that
Tom is getting excited
The rest of the room is growing uncomfortable
say to hell with it
Let's level with America
Or at least make them speak for themselves
mean, seriously, what's this
(picks a card off the ) "'m sorry to hear your grandmother has passed
" What the hell
Let's give em some truth
Something like, "Sorry to hear about your grandmother
Here's a card so  get some credit in your time of need
'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma's dead
" Vance and the card-writing team are appalled
Think about it
(picks up another card) "Congratulations on your new baby
" Eh
How bout
"Congratulations on your new baby
Guess that's it for hanging out
Nice knowing ya, buddy
" Hansen, sit down
(picks up a card) Wait, what's this
Ooh
fancy
Look at this one with all the hearts
Let's open it up
"Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart
love you
" Oh that's nice
94
Tom
If someone gave me this card, Mr
Vance
would eat it
Tom
Tom recognizes he's losing his shit
He takes a seat on the boardroom table
() It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs
They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything
We're responsible
Everyone shifts in their seats
think we do a bad thing here
People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths
The truth card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you
You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words
Maybe it's not love at all
Maybe there's no such thing as love
Maybe it's
"galoogoo
" () Yeah  made it up, so what
Tom gets up and walks to the door
It's all crap
We make and peddle crap
And sometimes people believe in this crap
just can't do it anymore, Mr
Vance
There's enough bullshit in the world without my help
quit
95
And with that he gets up and walks off
The room is pretty stunned
Someone coughs
McKenzie tries to start a clap
It doesn't really take
: - Tom comes outside with some boxes
He stands out in front of the building
His face says one thing
"Holy shit
Did  just do that
" And then we, : (383) - Tom and his friends on the sidewalk outside the deli
There's no fucking way
Tom
It can't be
It's impossible
It is
How do you know
We know
But
It's May
We broke up last August
know
And you said she was single at Christmas
96
She was
And now she's
Yeah
Now she's getting married
'm so sorry Tom
Married
It's insane
It's impossible
It doesn't make sense
Where did they meet
Is it someone we know
No
So everything she said
All that stuff about
it can't be
Not her
know her too well
She wouldn't do that
His friends say nothing
() Fuck
And with that he storms off
Tom
Let him go
Tom walking away from them
Literally, his entire universe falls apart
97
:  come crumbling down
The whole city turns to rubble
He's the only constant as the world around him is , brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen force and reduced to nothing
: And we fade up those famous    "
" (399) on a     , some young, some old, Tom right in the mix trying hard to smile
Has he joined a cult
We are: - Tom's sister Rachel's Bat Mitzvah
Tom and his family have formed a traditional Hora
They dance in a big circle and clap their hands
chair is brought to the center and Rachel is lifted high above the circle by Tom, his step-dad, and some others
: Rachel is standing by a cake with a microphone
Your apple pies are really great
So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come light candle number eight
sitting with his mom Sarah at the table
They clap
Mom looks at her son knowing something is wrong
Tom catches her looking
: Tom being accosted by two more Aunts
can't believe that
No girlfriend
98
can't believe it either
What are you 30
You should be married now
With a family
What are you waiting for
The right girl  guess
There's girls everywhere
bet you have to beat em off with a stick
Oh you'd be surprised
(actually squeezing his ) Look at this punum
Are all those girls blind
My friend Mimi has a granddaughter
Yay high
Great figure
Bosom out to here -- Hey  appreciate that Aunt Betsy
Lord knows  like bosoms
It's just
recently got out of a
well,  don't know what it was
Oh 'm sorry
When was that
July
You mean
seven months ago
Was it a man
What
She's means `are you a homosexual
' 99
No
Where's that coming from
We just always wondered
Awkward
So how's work
: Tom at the bar
He downs his drink in one gulp
: Tom alone at the table
The band plays "Lady in Red" and everyone's dancing
When we're back on Tom, he's sitting with Summer
Well
glad you came
Of course
Where am  exactly
When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult
, dancing with a
Wow
So this is a big day in your sister's life
Pretty big, yeah
() So why aren't you smiling
Alone
Still not smiling
Rachel arrives in the nick of time
Hey brother
Wanna dance
She drags him to the dance floor
100
Hi
You having fun
You were great this morning
Yeah yeah yeah
Talk to me
How are you
Me
'm good
'm great
(re: Summer's engagement) heard
Yeah
Sucks
Yup
It's silent a few beats
Anyway, who cares about me
This is your day
She hugs him
Tight
He doesn't cry but he could
You know, my friends
they're all in love with you
Is that right
Look
He sees a coven of 13-year olds swooning across the dance floor at him
That's nice
101
What  tell ya
There are plenty other fish in the sea
Those are guppies
Who knows, someday one might turn out to be your "true love
" Are you making fun of me now
No 'm serious
got news for you Rach
That true love stuff
it's make-believe
Well that's not very romantic
It's the new me
The song ends
Alright
go play with your friends
You'll be ok
() Sure
Tom
Hmm
know you think she was the perfect girl for you
() don't
think you're just remembering the good stuff
But what do  know, right
'm 13
102
She blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls
Tom watches her go
: (240) - ' / '  - Tom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting his shoes on
He holds the phone up to his ear
Hey
Summer is half-asleep under the covers
The phone lays at her side and she angles towards it
Hello
Are you still sleeping
() 'm getting up
What time is it
10:30
Are we still hanging out today
Ok
Sure
'll meet you at Liberty in
20 minutes
might need 45
- Tom and Summer are having a picnic
If it looks familiar, it's cause we saw them here on page 7
This is that fateful day Tom described to his sister and his friends
The day it all, finally, fell apart
103
So how was last night
It was fine
Just a work thing
Where did you guys go
Some restaurant
Fun
Uneventful
Didn't get home until after 12 though which is way too late for a stupid work function
How was your night
Pretty standard
Not much more to say
Stay with them for a few extra beats of silence
- Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market
Unless we were looking for trouble we wouldn't see any
But since we are, we might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the aisles
His hands are in his pockets
He's bored
She's distant
But only if we're really looking
(406) - Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment again
We see him rearranging the furniture in the room
He hangs some new pictures
He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf
Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even
He draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail something
104
(240) - That day again
As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper
Summer reads a novel
It's playing at 5
You want to go
don't know
You wanna maybe go back to your place or --- want to see it
Let's go
Ok cool
Unless you don't want to
No,  will
That's fine
Ok
few more silent beats
Something's in the air
- Tom and Summer watching the film
Tears begin to well in Summer's eyes
They soon turn to audible sobs
Tom turns to look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to be a response to the movie
She doesn't look back
(409) '  - Tom drawing a straight line on his wall
Redecorating
105
And then he stops
He looks at the line he's drawn
He extends it a little bit
He draws another
He begins to furiously draw on the wall
From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit
An image starts to form
pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper, almost shaped like a tear drop
(240) - Same day from the past
They walk out, at first everything's alright
It's exactly as we saw on page 7
But soon after that she begins to cry again
Serious, real sobbing
Hey
He goes to hug her
He hugs her
It's unclear if she hugs back
Hey Sum, it's just a movie
know
'm sorry Tom
Is everything alright with you
She smiles, tries to pull herself together
Yeah
'm just
'm sorry
'm being ridiculous
It's ok
This happens to me every time  watch "Hoosiers
" Let's go for a walk, ok
Let's get some air
Or go to Sister Ray's
Ok
They walk
106
- Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles
He grabs one
It pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of Spearmint
've never heard of them
And it's painful
Oh look
He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as we've seen on Page 7
She smiles and they continue on down the aisles
In , Tom goes to hold Summer's hand
But something happens
It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand approaches hers (in -), she moves it away and keeps it at her side
Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if there's something to read in that
(411) - Tom sketches intensely
The landscape, the skyline, the works
He's in the zone
(240) - Again, that fateful day continues
Tom and Summer outside
So
So
Now what
107
Now
think 'm gonna call it a day
Yeah
You wanna maybe
get some dinner or something
've got pasta at home
Are you hungry
'm pretty hungry, but -- Ooh
What
've got a great idea
What
Let's get breakfast
Now
Pancakes
Summer's resistance is futile
And the rest as they say is history
: "Number Two" by the Pernice Brothers
Which plays : (417-464) 1
'  - Tom shaves
Makes himself look presentable
108
Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other
2
- Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the city's skyline
2
- Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building design
3
- Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high-rise
4
- Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing soccer
It's a nice temporary distraction for him
6
'  - Tom getting bad news on the phone
He has a list written on his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures)
He crosses "Abrams and Abrams" off the list
We notice several others are also crossed off
5
- Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge
8
- Tom jogs
little faster this time
9
'  - Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine, crossing off yet another firm from the list
Few remain
He sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped
For a beat, lost in thought
109
Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were, he turns on the  and joylessly watches the nothingness
9
- On the , Tom, alone, on a bus
Looking out the window
Thinking
On the , Summer
In her wedding dress
The veil is lifted
And she's a bride
(478) - Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal interview
We can see he is frustrated but not deterred
In the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took Summer ages ago
- Tom walks over and sits down on a bench
He stares off, lost in thought
And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice
(
) Hey
Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench
She may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours
Tom isn't sure if she's real
He doesn't quite know what to do
(re: suit) Where you coming from
What
Oh
Nowhere
How long have you been sitting there
Awhile
Tom finds it hard to look at her
110
come here a lot
always loved this place, ever since you brought me here
The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty
So
should probably say congratulations
Probably
But only if you mean it
don't know if  do honestly
understand
Yeah well
anyway
hope you're happy
You really do
() God no
They both laugh a little
The tension begins to dissipate
How are you, Tom
'm good
Ish
That's good
Yeah  quit the office
Really
That's great
What are you doing now
Mostly
sleeping
Breaking things
Awkward silence
111
So who's the guy
Who, my guy
Yeah
Wait
Don't tell me don't want to know
Tom
No really,  don't
Ok
More awkward silence
This one goes on a beat longer
And : It's amazing to me
You're married
know
You're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife
Pretty crazy, huh
() 'll never understand that
Tom -- What's different now
How could things change so quickly
don't know
It just happened
What happened
That's what  don't get
112
Tom
What, tell me
woke up one day and  knew
Tom says nothing
knew  could promise him 'd feel the same way every morning
In a way that
never could with you
And there's not much else to say after that
Tom gets up to leave
You know what sucks
Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit
What is
Destiny, soulmates, true love
All that stuff
It's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it
God
Tom, don't go
should have listened to you, Summer
You were right all along
Summer takes a beat to let this hang there
was right
And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh
What
This is funny
113
Tries to stop but it only makes it worse
Now's she's completely cracking up
What are you laughing at
And she can't stop
She's totally lost control
(trying himself not to ) You're a crazy person
Tom
You're the crazy person
What are you talking about
One day 'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it
Now he's my husband
This is funny to you
What would have happened if  went to the movies instead
If  went somewhere else for lunch
If showed up to eat ten minutes later
Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said
And as it was happening, knew it
could feel it, sure as the sun
And  kept thinking to myself "Holy shit
Tom was right
" You were right about all of it
() It just wasn't me you were right about
Tom is speechless
Summer takes his hand
We may notice her wedding ring
We may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay
We hold it for a few seconds more
And then, the hands separate
Anyway,  should probably be getting back
It was good to see you
'm glad you're well
114
Summer gets up and starts walking away from him
After a : Summer
She stops and turns back
He takes in her face, most likely for the last time ever
really do hope you're happy
know
() See you later
And she walks away
The    with her, leaving Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every second
: ,
: (500) - Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers Architecture
From the room we can tell this firm is big time
Tom waits
We notice, before he does, a    sitting in a another chair, also waiting
She smiles
He smiles back
Are you here to interview
Sorry
115
Are you interviewing
For the position
Oh
Yeah
Why, are you
Yup
Ah
My competition
It would appear
Gee, this is a little awkward
Yes it is
Well,  hope you don't get it
hope you don't get it
They both laugh
There's a silence for a few beats
And it's during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we can visibly see it in his face
He likes the look of this girl
This girl is cute
He'd like to talk more with her
And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it
So, uh
Hmm
Are you from
California
Grew up not too far from here
Atherton, near Stanford
know Atherton
Nice area
Have  seen you before
116
, uh, don't know
don't think so
Do you go to St
Patrick's
Not to pray or anything but to stand outside
do
love that church
It's like my favorite structure in the city
If only it wasn't near that horrible mirrored thing
Yes
Exactly
totally agree
Yeah
() think 've seen you there
You have
Really
Hmm
didn't see you
