huge clock marks 7:55 p
m
(The clock belongs to some landmark building, to be determined)
Immediately following, the building goes dark
Establishing shot of the Eiffel Tower, lit
Suddenly, all the lights go out
The same thing happens with the Granada's Alhambra, Seville's Giralda Tower, the Guggenheim at Bilbao, the Gate of Alcala
All these well- known architectonic wonders turn dark, abruptly
(Beauty that disappears suddenly, beauty that's extinguished and envelops us in darkness
) 1
'
Harry (fifty years old) sits, as if he were waiting, without hurry, immobile and patient in his study next to his desk, as if it were the thing keeping him company
He isn't doing anything
He lets time take its course
His silence is broken by the sound of footsteps that come and go
At first we can't see who the footsteps belong to, until they stop
In the living room, a few meters from Harry, Judit stops
She, too, is shrouded in darkness
She looks at her wristwatch, the second hand moves from left to right on the watch face
Judit (forty-eight, looks younger) breathes, impatient
(She is dressed soberly, in a dignified and practical manner)
She approaches a window that looks out onto the street
Everything outside is also in darkness
The building in front is just a dark mass
She looks to the end of the street
Almost all the buildings visible from the window are dark, the Gate of Alcala in the background is also not lit
Without turning, she says to Harry: The Door of Alcala has also darkened
Harry is still sitting, inert, absorbed by his thoughts
The whole house is in darkness, only the ambient clarity of the night comes through the windows, curtains drawn back
Judit heads slowly toward the kitchen
On the wall there is a Vitra clock, to which she gives a cursory glance
She turns on the faucet and fills a glass of water
From her pocket, she removes a tiny heart made of black nacar shell and rimmed in silver
She opens it
She grabs a small pink pill
She takes it
She glances once more at the stylized design of the Vitra clock
The minute hand nears 8 p
m
On a windowsill (or on the kitchen table) there is an open newspaper
The exposed page displays an article about the dangers of global warming
An international date has been convened for a five minute blackout at 8 p
m
Standing in the kitchen, Judit, poised and tense, looks up at the spot where the clock is
The stillness of all the elements comprising the frame make it seem like a painting
She waits until the seconds hand completes its cycle and it's 8 o'clock sharp
Swiftly, Judit powers the central electrical switchboard, which is in the kitchen
The kitchen lights up, the refrigerator emits its characteristic sound
The lamps in the living room also light up
(Low-hanging lamps that make the light bounce
The house is awash in a special luminous atmosphere  dense, translucent, with darkened zones)
All the furniture is flush with the walls
There are some paintings hanging and a rug on the ground, everything is of the kind of quality that denotes good personal taste
Upon the light's return, Judit exhales a profound sigh of relief
She moves toward the window where she was standing earlier and contemplates how, in the building across the way, the windows begin to blink, in square patterns of light
2
1994
The light's return is contagious, a true spectacle, which ends with a blinding light that floods the screen
It will probably be a close-up of the sun
That very sun enters through another window, which is not that of Harry's house, nor that of the building across the way
It is the window of a hospital room (perhaps a sign should specify that the following scene occurs "Fourteen years earlier") The hospital is on Lanzarote Island, in the Canary Islands
The scene occurs fourteen years earlier
The characters are the same
Harry and Judit
Harry lies in bed, his head completely bandaged
Sunlight enters through the window
Judit is seated on the bed
She holds his hand and pleads, worried and loving: Mateo, say something
- Mateo is dead
(Sweet and devastated) Don't say that
The character to whom Judit refers as Mateo, (the same one that in the previous scene we have called Harry), has a recent wound, either on his arm or on his hands, along with his head, which is completely covered by bandages
Mateo and Harry are the same person, the difference is the fourteen years that separate them
Harry, in the present (2008), is fifty years old
In `94, the time period when the flashback takes place, he was thirty-six
Let's say that when he was thirty-six, Harry was called Mateo
The character has two names, which his own voice-off explains, while we observe what his day-to-day consists of in 2008
always wanted to be another person, to be someone beside myself
To dispose of a single identity didn't seem enough
Living a single life wasn't enough for me
And half-joking,  came up with a pseudonym for myself, Harry Caine, an adventurer who, as fate would have it, became a writer
At that time,  had him author all the scripts and stories that  wrote came up with a standard biography to fill the back flap of his books
He had been a sailor, an industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a boxer, a waiter and an advertisement hand-double self-made man, active and attractive like an English spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic
For many years, Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person, me, but a time came when, all of a sudden,  couldn't be anyone other than Harry Caine
became my pseudonym
(He applies lotion in front of the mirror, we first see him in front of it, and then, doubled, reflected in it
Then, suddenly, the mirror does not reflect him
Of his two identities he only has one left)
Just as  had planned, a heterodox writer and, never better stated, a self-made man, one might even say, "self-written man"
There was only one detail had not foreseen, Harry would be a blind writer

' Despite his fifty years and his blindness, Harry is a man that keeps himself in great physical shape
Harry's Home
Interior
Day
In the morning: he places a  in a player
By himself, he selects and starts the program on a treadmill
He steps on and begins exercising
He takes a shower ("Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person, me, but a time came when, all of a sudden
"), the camera pans over various parts of his body under the running water, dense waves of white foam slide down his skin, as if it was a landscape
The hangers have Braille-stickers that indicate the characteristic of the clothing they hold
(All the closets have sliding doors) In his bedroom, he opens the closet and looks for the clothes he will wear
Despite the fact that he cannot see himself, he stands in front of a mirror
He smiles, pleased with his appearance
Everything in the house is rigorously ordered
All that Harry needs to ascertain the identity of the things around him is his touch
He exits onto the street
4
'
Harry traverses (aided by an umbrella
) the pedestrian crossing
When he reaches the opposite sidewalk, the credits appear on the black and white stripes that mark the crossing
The crossway is clear of pedestrians so that only cars pass through (not many) and as they do, they run over the letters of the credits, making them disappear, in pieces
On a different stripe, a new title appears and as it does, it is run over and destroyed by another car
Like this, successively
5
'
Just on the sidewalk across from where Harry lives, there is a news- stand, and next to it, perhaps on the nearest corner, a bar
Harry buys the newspaper at the news-stand
This is part of his daily routine
He greets the attendant familiarly
He has the kind of face that provokes pity
He grabs the newspaper, folds it, and places it under his arm
Cut to
6
He enters the bar
He leans down somewhere on the bar table
Just as soon as he sees him, he is approached by his Waiter Friend, an approachable guy, somewhere in his forties, who is helped by a South American waitress, wearing her makeup since the early part of the morning, whom he is obviously screwing
He brings him a coffee
All of these actions are part of a daily ritual
Do you want me to read you something from the newspaper
No, thanks
am off on a stroll
5 Harry exits the bar and becomes immersed in the different noises of the street, the passersby, their different sounds and corporeal odors
Auditory life
The camera swirls around his head
At first he hears all the noises, indistinctly mixed, and then he begins to separate them
He selects one he likes, the rest of the sounds of the street disappear or their volume is lowered
Girls, cars, high heels, the smells of different ethnicities
multi-racial street
Harry selects an odor (the body of a woman, whose aroma appears and disappears), Harry follows it, having also singled out the sound of her heels
He loses them
He finds them again
He walks self-assuredly, without tripping either on the urban furniture or the people
He leans, lightly, on his umbrella, which he uses as a cane
At first glance he doesn't appear blind
He reaches a pedestrian crossing
Nearby, he recognizes the odor which had attracted him, he follows its trace until he reaches the sidewalk
The odor emanates from a young Girl, just next to him, waiting before the crosswalk
Harry searches with the tip of the umbrella, until he brushes her shoe
He excuses himself, as if the contact had been inadvertent
The girl regards him
Harry then takes one step forward, intent on crossing the street, the cars come very close to him, almost running him over
( real sense of danger)
The light is red for pedestrians
The Girl takes him by the arm, pulling him toward her, frightened
(Alarmed) Watch out
You can't cross
Sorry
'll tell you when
Thank you very much
7
-'
They make it through the crosswalk
She is not holding his arm (but almost), Harry doesn't need it
He knows the surroundings well
They reach the other sidewalk
Harry thanks her for her help, the Girl observes him the entire time, intrigued and curious
live nearby, two blocks up, would you mind coming along with me
The Girl accepts, delighted
Tall, thin, attractive, modern, and inexpressive like a model, this is what the Girl is like
8
'
Once at the entrance, Harry invites her to come up so that she can read aloud the newspaper to him
The Girl checks her watch, and ends up accepting
10 But  warn you, 've never read out-loud, you may not like it
You will only have to browse
9
, '
The same living room we've seen in Sequence 1
There is very little light
Do you mind if  turn on the light
So that  can read
It's too dark in here
Oh, yes
Turn the light on
The Girl turns on a table lamp
Cut to
Harry is sitting on a sofa and she is in front of him, on an armchair
She opens the newspaper down the middle, before she reads anything she directs a brief but intense glance at Harry
She reads about the percentage of those in Madrid who abided by the blackout that was organized in the name of global change
She turns a few pages and stops
Reads as if for herself: Ernesto Martel is dead
Who
11 Ernesto Martel
know one of his granddaughters
So he's dead
You knew him
No
Turns more pages
What are you interested in, politics, economy
culture
am interested in you
What are you like
Do you mind describing yourself
The girl begins to describe herself, at first a little tentative
(Her measurements
She smiles
She knows them by heart
) She describes herself
The color of her eyes
Her hair
Her skin
How she's dressed, while she traces over him with her glance (When she speaks of her eyes, we see his eyes; when she speaks of her mouth, we see his, etc)
Her gaze stops at Harry's crotch
Harry can feel her watching him
The situation seems perfectly natural
Harry approaches her (he knows she's right in front of him)
With his hands, he places a brief caress on each of the parts the Girl has just described
The eyes, the hair, the mouth
He lowers his hands until they fall, spread, on her breasts
It is as though the blind man could gaze at her with his fingers and palms
He rests his head on the Girl's breast, pulls down her bra straps and he begins to savor 12 her breasts, delicately
Harry's cell phone rings, but he ignores it, doesn't pick up

'
They make love on the sofa
Cut to
The Girl asks for the bathroom, Harry gestures with his hand in its direction
Half-naked, with some of her clothes in her hand, the Girl heads for the bathroom
Harry, still sitting on the same sofa, begins to dress and to smooth down his clothes, without hurry
11
'
The doorbell rings
Twice in a row
Immediately following, the key is inserted into the keyhole, from the outside
Someone is opening it
Harry rises
Before he arrives to the foyer, the door is already open
In the middle of the doorway, a woman, Judit (the same one who had been with him during the blackout of the opening sequence)
Harry finishes tucking his shirt, barefoot
Judit closes the door slowly and surveys him up and down with inquisitive eyes, which he cannot see but one could say that he can guess
He smiles
What are you laughing at
13 am only smiling, because of the way you're looking at me
The sound of a running faucet emerging from the bathroom distracts Judit; first the sound, then the immediate appearance of the Girl
Both women look at each other and are surprised, despite their attempt to hide it
Judit appears more annoyed than surprised
After a very brief silence: (To Harry)  must go
Thanks for helping me cross
Judit (forty-eight years old, seems younger, is dressed in an informal and sober manner, little color, etc
, her hair is pulled back, parted in the middle, her attitude is that of a guardian), she puts away the key to the door while she gazes sternly at the young woman
The Girl, very uncomfortable, quickly vanishes
12
'
Once alone: (Annoyed and without apologizing, even if it seems she's trying) 'm sorry,  thought you were alone
She helped me cross the street and  invited her in to read me the newspaper
14 Harry, you can't bring into your house the first person who helps you across the street
One of these days something awful will happen to you
(Sullen and ironic) Everything awful that's had to happen to me has
Now, all that's left is for me to enjoy life
Judit changes the topic so that Harry may also change his tone
She turns off the table lamp and she opens the window drapes that lead to the terrace
Diego told me yesterday that you finished the script
would like to add a final epilogue
It may not be necessary, but 'd like to write it
agreed to deliver the definitive version to the producer and director today
You will have it by tomorrow, don't worry
As he speaks, Harry has made his way back to the sofa, without the use of a cane, he knows by heart the landscape of the house, which he walks through as if he could see
If anything, he touches any given piece of furniture with the tip of his fingers, as if to ascertain whether it's still there
He walks both with ease, and with the characteristic rigidity of blind people
15 He picks up the socks from the floor and slips them on (the newspaper is open on the floor)
He puts his shoes on
Judit watches him for a moment, and then turns toward the window
13
'
' She observes how, on the sidewalk across the way, the Girl enters the main door of the building just next to the news-stand where Harry buys his newspaper
From the window she can make out that it's an important Modeling Agency
12 Judit is still looking out the window, her back to Harry, when she hears him say: Ernesto Martel has died
Judit turns to Harry, surprised but masking it with her voice
think he was very ill
It's been so long since we've spoken of him
Judit nods plainly with her head
Silence
Ernesto Martel's death doesn't bring good memories to either of them
16 14
'
The doorbell rings
It's Diego, Judit's son, who doubles as Harry's typist and co-scriptwriter
He is a special kid, twenty-five years old
Baggy-eyed, a weary aspect, but he overflows with charm
Dresses as a modern kid, but not obnoxiously so
He speaks delicately, an attitude uncommon for someone his age
He greets his mother
You look awful
ran here
And it's Monday
Diego, you don't have to run for me
We are not in a hurry
am, 've committed
You'll have it by tonight, don't worry
Start thinking of the next script
Some kind of horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers
It's what sells best
don't know if 'll know how to
was thinking of developing a story inspired by Arthur Miller's son
(Perplexed) The writer who married Marilyn
17 Yes
After Marilyn he married the photographer Inge Morat and they had a son
He was born mentally handicapped and Arthur Miller hid him; he doesn't even mention him in his memoirs
He never recognized him publicly
From the moment he was born, he had him placed in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of him
Despite his condition, the boy was able to learn and to make an almost normal life for himself
He lived in an apartment with other friends and he found a job as a clerk in a supermarket
Judit looks at him perplexed
For some reason, Harry has his back turned
This happens many times
And Miller never saw him
(Continues, his back turned) One day, Miller was giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded man, who had been condemned to death, after what was believed to be a forced confession
Among those present was his mentally handicapped son, who was integrally involved with organizations that aided all sorts of disabled people
The son was very proud to finally be sharing something with his father
At the end of the conference, he approached the stage and held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless to Arthur Miller, who did not know how to extract himself from this mentally handicapped man; imagine, it would not have been politically correct, least of all given the situation in which Miller found himself
Then the stranger let go of him and told him: " am 18 your son, Daniel, and  am very proud of you, Father
" This was the only time father and son saw each other
Judith listens, affected and disoriented
She looks at her son as if she were looking for help
Diego stops thumbing through a magazine in order to listen to Harry and to witness his mother's reaction
She wasn't ready for Harry to counter with such a shocking narrative
(Somewhat tense) It's very moving, but  don't think we can write a script about Arthur Miller without procuring rights from the family
We change the names, the story is not about the writer's miserliness, but about the strength of the son who survives without the least bit of rancor toward the father who has ignored him his entire life
It is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent goodness
There aren't those many good men that one can write about
Judit would like to say that when she spoke of a commercial script this is not what she had in mind, but she doesn't want to come off rude
Diego keeps watching them
Her mother appears oddly cornered, until she remembers a past comment of Harry's, that suits her just : It's a beautiful story
But years ago, when you began writing again and  began selling your scripts, you told me you'd never write remakes, sequels, nor biopics
Nor stories whose protagonists were film 19 directors, handicapped or blind
remember clearly because the part of the biopics surprised me
() can't bear them
(As if he had at that very moment remembered) It's true, it's true  said all that, but this wouldn't exactly be a biopic
They hear the doorbell ring, two or three times
For Judit, it's the best way to escape the conversation
'll get it
Diego settles on the armchair, in front of his laptop
On the other side of the table sits the computer that is specially programmed for Harry
Diego powers his laptop
Harry heads for the work table
And he sits in front of Diego
Diego, go to the end of the document
Diego obeys while we hear Judit approaching the door and, before she opens it, someone opens it from the other side
We see the document's text (a script) scrolling, fleetingly, over Diego's computer screen
At the door, Judit finds Mariacruz, the Latin American maid, who also has her own key to the house
She is carrying two shopping bags
Judit gives her some directive (about the windows, the curtains, the kitchen furniture, the food, the floors, things to be dry cleaned , etc
) and she leaves, saying goodbye to Harry and Diego with a simple "Boys, 'm leaving
Goodbye
" 20 15
Diego chooses a track that functions as background music to the three night sequences that follow, although it's not absolutely necessary
He works at a modern bar (not very large), as a
He spends most of the time inside a small booth, which only a few friends access
Alex, his same age, enters
Did you bring me the session
Alex takes three CDs out of his jacket
It's still warm
Just downloaded from the eMule
Dude
'll throw it in now
You want something to drink
Yes
And you, would you like a tip of "crystal"

do need to sleep once in a while

- At that moment, Harry is in front the computer (a special computer, sonorous, set up for Harry, with Braille signs jutting from the keyboard)
He attempts to "read" some digital newspaper, its contents 21 can be heard spoken by a very unpleasant synthetic voice
His search produces annoying and strange sounds
Harry continously makes mistakes, but that's the way to do it
He manages to get into El Pais, the obituary section
He listens to a list
He finally finds the news of Ernesto Martel's death
He listens to the headline
The sound of a mobile phone ringing interrupts him
17
'
It's Judit, from her office
In front of Judit, on the other side of the table, full of papers, is the head of production and someone from the American production
They are trying to decide on the budget
From the ashtrays full of cigarettes, the bottles of water and the cups of coffee, one assumes that they must have been at this task for many hours
(One should be able to see the layout of the shooting schedule, something visual)
The American production can be heard in the background
(Seq
16 and 17 run in parallel) She greets Harry
You need anything
No, thanks
What are you up to
22 Harry touches the small MP3, much easier than to listen to the digital newspaper
He doesn't want to tell her that he is attempting to listen to Ernesto Martel's obituary, so he tells her what he will be doing next
was going to read an Alice Munro story on the MP3
Then 'll leave you
'll stop by tomorrow, when can
have to finish the budget for the Americans as soon as possible, so that  can decide what to do
(Hangs up) (To the Americans, in English)
Ok, we can continue tommorow
Once he hangs up his mobile, Harry returns to his computer, this is when we actually hear the biographical sketch of the deceased financier
Fade to black
During the fade to black, we continue to hear the biography
In voice-off
Ernesto Martel has passed away at his residence in the countryside, "La Berzosa
" Financier, of Chilean origin, who achieved great success and notoriety due to his involvement in the financing of crucial public infrastructures in different Latin American countries

The end of the voice-off is heard over the image of Ernesto Martel himself, alive, attending to a phone call, while we hear the last words of his obituary, in off
Recently he had been involved in various financial scandals
He was implicated for fraud in the infamous "case of Bank Banelco"
He was married three times, and had two children
The interior of Ernesto Martel's office: elegant, ostentatious, and decorated without concern for cost
Through the windows one can witness a cosmopolitan Madrid, from whose soil skyscrapers begin to bud
Ernesto Martel, almost sixty, impeccable suit, settles a conversation with the Transportation Minister
Framed photographs sit on a piece of accessory furniture, one of him with his two children, a boy and a girl, who do not resemble one another
They have different mothers

1990
On the same floor
Fairly close to the boss' office, divided by modern and ample cubicles, we find some of the company's employees
His secretary, Magdalena (her diminutive is Lena), is speaking on the phone with a look of contained alarm
Personal problems
In her early thirties, Lena is dressed soberly, almost excessively so (as if she were attempting to project a maturity, effectiveness and responsibility that she not yet possesses)
She is a very beautiful woman, on whose countenance the passing of time has begun to leave its mark
She has a small mole, slightly raised, next to the seam of the lips, and another one on the top edge of the nose
She could do more with her physique, modernize it, but this is not what she aims for
Her face reminds us of one of the heroines of the American film noir, brought up to date
She possesses the turbulent and at once translucent beauty of Gene Tierney and the bored disdain of Linda Darnell (in "Fallen Angels")
Lena is a splendid fallen angel
We can't hear what she says, but judging from her reaction, the content of her conversation is dramatic
Her eyes flash with indignation and anger
19
25 Ernesto Martel calls Lena, his personal secretary, by way of an internal line
20
Magdalena interrupts her conversation with "'ll call you later", as the indicator lights up, announcing another call on the line
She pushes on the button corresponding to that phone call and she hears her boss' voice summoning her
"Yes, sir", she responds, promptly
She gets up from the table
She dries her eyes and nose with a Kleenex, grabs a pen and a rectangular writing block and heads to Ernesto Martel's office
21
'
1990 Despite the fact that he's dealing in grand-scale business, there are few documents for him to consult on his desk
It gives the sense that for the most important part of his job (grand scale speculation), Ernesto deals directly
He is the great intermediary without intermediaries
Magdalena enters
He invites her to take a seat
She complies without altogether controlling her nervousness; professionally detached, she attempts to hide the tension that the recent, and truncated, telephone conversation has caused her
will dictate a letter for the Minister of Industry
26 Magdalena opens her writing pad, ready to write, looking serious
Her pen drops to the floor
Ernesto
observes her
Are you alright
(As she picks it up) Yes, thank you
But it's not true
Lena looks agitated, despite her efforts to hide it
Why don't you tell me what's wrong
'm sure  could help you
Lena looks at him, serious and hurt: My father is very ill
This afternoon they are releasing him and  wanted to ask you if  could leave an hour early to go pick him and my mother up
Of course
What's wrong with him
Stomach cancer, metastasized
am really sorry

1990 27 It's a hot and sunny afternoon at the end of July
Lena arrives inside a taxi to the entrance of Puerta de Hierro Hospital
On the sidewalk, next to the entryway, her mother awaits, (chubby, tired, defenseless and impatient, she's around sixty) next to her, a suitcase and a huge plastic bag full of clothes
The mother is a small-town woman, dignified and beaten
The shock provoked by the situation has liberated her, if only momentarily, from falling into desperation
Through the car's window, Lena can see her mother on the sidewalk, and her ailing Father (a man in his sixties, very debilitated and aged), sitting on a sofa in the foyer
Lena tells the cab-driver to wait, and runs toward her mother
They kiss
can't believe they have thrown you out of the hospital, like dogs
(Humiliated, hurt) Yes, honey, yes
(Indignant) Does Dr
Alvaro de la Torre know this
The mother gestures for them to get away from the door, that way the Father cannot see them
He's been the one
But how
If he was going to operate him this week, and last week, and the other week
28 couldn't explain on the phone
(She recounts) Dr
De la Torre called us for an appointment
though it would be to tells us that they were finally going to operate on your father
but instead he tells us they are releasing him
(In disbelief)  asked him what he meant and he replied: "quite simple, it's July and am leaving for my vacation" (as her story moves forward the mother relives the same states of mind that she went through in her conversation with the doctor) And  told him, "you are throwing us out onto the street
" and he insisted, without the least bit of compassion, " am releasing him so that you can go home", but "what can  do with him at home in his condition
"
"That's your problem" he told me (she cries), "do whatever you like,  am leaving on vacation"
"He is dying
"  begged
"Well, let him die in peace, at home", he said to me
(Powerless, furious) It cannot be
They can't keep him for twenty days, torturing him with tests in preparation for an operation and now leave him like this, just because the doctor is leaving on vacation
The Mother looks at her without knowing what to say
She takes a small handkerchief to her nose
Have you protested
To who
Dr
De la Torre is the head surgeon
There is no one over him
29 Lena refuses to accept the situation
The father appears through the doors of the hospital entrance, exhausted
He leans down to catch his breath
With a weak voice, almost inaudible, he says to them: Did you forget about me
Lena and the mother approach him, almost jubilant, hiding their sense of helplessness and frustration
(Her eyes welled up with tears, she gathers her last bit of strength) How could you think that Dad
Between the two women they help the father to the taxi that is waiting for them nearby
They put him in the car
The man can hardly walk
He is very thin, his bones jut out from under his ashen skin
He walks crouched over
The taxi pulls off
23
,
You know what Dr
De la Torre told me before he broke the news
He falters
He is too exhausted to speak
30 (To the Mother) You tell her, Paca
He said:  am glad you are not still in the service, Emilio
(Not understanding)Why
"Because if you were still in the service, after what am going to tell you, you'd shoot me
" Lena stares, completely wide-eyed with amazement
He really said that
Yes
and he was smiling, he thought it was funny

1990
The taxi parks in front of a humble building, in one of those outlying neighborhoods in the periphery of Madrid, a commuter town
Children, women, street ambience
It's like a provincial town, transported to a huge city that is in the midst of merciless development
At that hour there are few people on the street
The passage between this sequence and the next happens through the doors of the car and the apartment, respectively
The Father exits, aided by Lena and the Mother, when the door to the taxi closes it's the door to the apartment that shuts, with all three characters inside the entry hall

1990
Lena locks the door from inside
It's a humble and small apartment, Magdalena and her mother situate the man on the bed in the master bedroom, in the most comfortable way possible
The decor reflects the bad taste of the era, especially of that social class, here and there a certain rural detail stands out
Antique photographs of the grandparents
Photographs of the Father in his policeman uniform, next to the Mother
Over the headboard, there is a crucifix on the wall and perhaps a thick, wooden rosary
Religious images on the nighstands
Attention placed on the bedspread, the curtains, the dresser, the closet and the walls
Everything is new, ugly period furniture
The effect generated is of a somber kitsch
Lena opens a dresser drawer, on top of it sits the picture of the father in his policeman uniform, with the Mother
She finds a Star 9mm pistol
She grabs it and tries its weight, the mother sees her and tells her to leave the weapon in its place
(Perhaps at that very moment the mother is injecting the Father with morphine)

In the dinning hall, Lena hands her mother money so that she can buy food and her father's medications
Call me any time, no matter what it is
32 The light that shines through the windows, covered with curtains of an indefinite but slightly brilliant pattern, begins to fade
Mother and daughter kiss

While Lena was at her parent's apartment, night fell
Lena departs lost in her thoughts, she can't shake off her parents' situation
She shifts her eyes
She must find a solution, urgently
She lights a cigarette
She looks at her wristwatch
She seems to have made a decision
She looks out the window
She finds the inter- urban landscape desolating

Lena enters her apartment
tiny studio, but charming
No sooner has she dropped all that she is carrying, than she heads to the phone and makes a call
The decor is agreeable
Little money, but well spent
poster of Hitchcock's "Vertigo" dominates one of the walls, or a framed photochrom of Kim Novak in the film
There may be another 33 film reference (Jean Seberg and Romy Schneider)
Lena, secretly, is a cinephile

(Alternating between both spaces) Madame Mylene is a blonde woman, very dressed up, older (between fifty and seventy), has had plastic surgery, and has not renounced her womanhood
Despite the quality of her attire, her makeup and her jewels, there is something about her appearance that is unequivocally sinister and heartless
While she speaks she has a drink and smokes a cigar
man of "professional" appearance keeps her company
It's the den of a high-class Madame
The den seems more practical than feminine
Madame Mylene
Hello, it's Severine
Severine
It's been so long
'm so happy to hear from you

How soon
Now
My weekend's free
am busy during the week

The telephone rings
Lena has her hair down, she has put makeup on (in excess)

She seems like a different woman, worldly and nocturnal
Yes

We see Ernesto Martel, speaking on the phone, in one of the living rooms of his mansion
He is dressed to go out, a drink in his hand
He is alone, his tone is that of a man courting a woman
35 am calling on Madame Mylene's behalf
Lena recognizes the voice, there is no doubt it's his
Despite the shock she manages to bluff, categorical and quick: (Slightly altering her voice) You've made a mistake, sir
No Severine lives here
Ernesto Martel doesn't believe her, but he plays along
must have dialed wrong
Excuse me
Lena hangs up, confused and irritated
Calls again

Has he already called
Who
The client
You will not complain about my speediness
36 (Furious) But
how have you given him my number
couldn't say no
Things aren't done like that
Have you gone mad
He knows everything
And  haven't been the one to tell him, he found out on his own account, he knows about your foray into acting, and that you sometimes "acted" for me
Lena listens, furious and impotent
Months ago he made me promise him that if you got back in contact with me  would call him
couldn't say no, he is one of my best clients
You bitch
(Unmoved) Look on the bright side
He must really like you to go to the lengths he has
Perhaps you've found your Sugar Daddy
Lena remains in silence, humiliated, cornered
What have you agreed on
Remember  am part of the business
Lena doesn't respond
She hangs up the telephone

Magdalena is sleeping in her bed
The phone wakes her
It's her mother, in the middle of a crying fit and panic attack
(Wakes up, suddenly, frightened) How is Dad
(Crying) Not well at all, my dear
We've been through a hellish night
He has not eaten anything
But he won't stop bleeding
and everything is coming up
it's as if he has burst inside
The mother speech falters, she is very scared
will be there with an ambulance immediately
Be ready to leave
Before she calls an ambulance, Lena calls Ernesto Martel
They greet each other
Ernesto does not pretend to be surprised, he comes across cordially
He thinks this may be the continuation of their phone call from the previous night
Mr
Martel
It's Lena
(Delighted) Good morning, Lena
38 am sorry to bother you
(Gallantly) You are never a bother
My father is dying
We must admit him urgently, but don't know where
As  told you, they released him from Puerta de Hierro yesterday
Ernesto changes his tone
Now he is an all-powerful man, generous and with every recourse at his fingertips
Don't worry
We will take him to the Emergency Room at a private clinic
(Wanting to confirm) You told me that he has stomach cancer
Yes
(Thinking) The best digestive surgeon in Europe is at the Clinica de la Luz
will take care of the admittance issue
Call an ambulance and tell them to pick up your parents
'll meet you at the Clinica de la Luz in an hour
(Plainly, but grateful) Thank you very much
Even though neither one of them mentions the phone conversation of the night before, it is present on both of their minds

1990 One of the hospital's hallways
The Mother, Lena and Ernesto are waiting together on a row of chairs next to a door
Dr
Blasco emerges, an eminent Surgeon Specialist
An impenetrable man, he doesn't mince words
Getting information from him is like pulling teeth
He is polite, but not accommodating in the slightest
How's the patient
You have brought him in terrible conditions
Which suppose you know
The mother affirms with a gesture
(With good manners, but authoritarian) Will you be able to save him
40 We will do everything possible
at this very moment it is impossible to operate
Lena and the Mother look at both men, anxiously
Perhaps tomorrow
We are providing parenteral nutrition
He will need a blood transfusion
(Looks at both women) Do you have any relatives who can donate
Well, here
don't know
The Mother also doesn't know what to say
Give him the best blood you've got
will keep you updated on his condition in the next hours
(He says goodbye to them) May  stay
Yes, of course
You can stay in his room as long as you wish
The Mother is not accustomed to so many privileges
The doctor says goodbye to Ernesto Martel and the women, mechanically
36
1990 41 When the three are alone the Mother thanks Ernesto Martel for what he has done for them
She looks at her daughter, in a knowing way, as if she understands (and accepts, what else can she do
) the situation
'll stay here, Mom
You have to rest
(With strength, but beaten) No, you rest
You've already done enough
Thank you very much, Mr
Ernesto
If my husband survives, it will be thanks to you
He will survive, ma'am
Really, you don't want me to stay
Or that  bring you something
No, go
You both must have things to do
Lena complies
In effect, there is something urgent she must do: pay the price for all those privileges
To pay the cost of her father's life
Ernesto and Lena walk to the other end of the hallway
Before she enters the room, the Mother bids farewell to them with a look that's sad, tired, but of fortitude
The two figures slowly recede down the hallway, until they disappear in a Fade to black

The door to Harry's apartment
The doorbell rings
The house is completely dark
Harry moves with his characteristic naturalness
He is coming from the bathroom, his hair wet and wearing a robe
He feels around until he finds the peephole
He opens it and reaches his eye toward it, as if he could really see the person on the other side
He is not waiting for anyone, so he hopes the visitor will think he is watching, even if he can't see a thing
(From inside) Who is it
voice on the other side of the door responds: 'm Ray
Ray
There's no such a name
It's a nickname, at one time  took a lot of ecstasy
What do you want
To write a script with you, so that  can direct it
It's your first film
made a documentary (naive)
a very good one, eighteen years ago, this would be my first fiction film
43 Call Judit Garcia, my agent, and explain everything
If she finds it suitable, she will set up a date for us
And now, 'd like to go dry myself, you pulled me out of the shower and  am dripping wet
(The words escape) You are naked
It's none of your business
Ray does not move
Neither does Harry
They both remain still and mute on their respective sides of the door, waiting for the other to do something
Ray is mortified about having asked the last question
Will you stand there all day
You haven't given me Judit Garcia's phone number
Find it out
She is a well-known Production Director
This time Ray steps away from the door and walks toward the elevator

2008 At another point in the day
Harry plays music (a  with songs that Diego has selected for him, expressly), he looks after the bonsai, or he waters the plants while 44 he listens to the radio
Harry touches the plants as well as the bonsai delicately, with the tip of his fingers
The phone rings
Hi Harry
It's me
Tell me
young director has been in contact with me
His name is Ray  and he wants to write a script with you
Does this ring a bell
Yes
(He is about to tell her he showed up without notice, but Judit doesn't give him time to)
(Since she is always busy and in a hurry) Well, he wants to see you this afternoon, or tomorrow, if you can
have asked him for an advance and he has accepted, but  cannot accompany you either today or tomorrow
will speak to him
and let you know
Good,  hope you like him, he seems to be loaded

2008 (The next morning, Harry wears different clothes than in the previous sequence and Ray  as well
) The doorbell rings
It's Ray
Mariacruz opens the door
Harry waits for him while seated at his desk, one can hear the noises his computer generates
Ray  heads toward the den and introduces himself
Harry stretches his hand and waits for the other man to find it and shake it
Hi, 'm Ray
They shake hands
Hello Mr
Please, have a seat
Please, don't address me formally
(Perhaps the kitchen is lit and only the light from the window enters the area where the conversation is taking place)
Ray watches Harry inquisitively
He observes everything, the furniture, the wall-hangings and Harry's own body, shamelessly, taking advantage of the fact that Harry cannot see him
Mateo senses the heat of his visitor's gaze over his body
46 Ray is thirty-five years old and his physique is somewhere between freakish and bohemian but expensively dressed, hard to classify, thin, with a beard
Only when he speaks he reveals his well-bred origin (not excessively, nor parodically, just sufficiently evocative)
He is excited by the very fact of being there, it seems it is something he has been desiring for some time
He takes advantage of the fact that Harry cannot see him in order to observe him without reserve
During the conversation, Harry is not always sitting
At some point he moves (to look for cigarettes, perhaps) and remains standing
love your work,  know it from the start
Thank you
have seen all of Mateo Blanco's films, including the last one, "Girls and Suitcases"
Is that so
You must be the only one
40
'
2008
At this exact moment, Diego enters
Mariacruz opens the door for him
Just in time to hear Ray's question
What happened to Mateo Blanco
47 Why do you ask
40
Diego goes to the kitchen
Harry has heard him, he knows he's there, if he hasn't called him it's because he doesn't need him
Because he vanished from public life
It would seem that way
Almost as if he'd died
Yes
(Ironically)  lost track of him some time ago
've always been intrigued by the case of his last film
Whose
Mateo Blanco's
The first five are stupendous
You were the screenwriter for all of them, how do you explain that the last one was a disaster
(Made uncomfortable by the topic) Films turn out well or badly
The reason is always a mystery
(Mateo switched genres, perhaps he wasn't skilled for comedy)
But tell me about the story you want to write
48 Ray  measures his words, it's very important to him and he doesn't want to do so hastily
would like to write a story about a son's revenge, one against the memory of his father
Why does the son desire revenge
(Speaking personally) Because the father ruined his life, practically nullifying him while he lived
The father is a successful financier, violent, homophobic, very powerful and unscrupulous
He thinks everyone has a price and that's how he behaves with people don't know if you've had the misfortune of meeting someone like this
Harry does not allay his doubt
When you say he is powerful, what kind of power are you referring to
Economic, with everything that entails
He is a broker, of the generation of speculators that made quick, high-profit gains in the 80s; he amassed a great fortune during the oil crisis
The son is sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations, and lives under his shadow, trying to please the father in everything
Despite being a bit
homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the father, and, just like him, he separates
He has a 49 son that hates him just as much as he hates his own father
When the father dies, the son is finally able to rebuild his life
That is his salvation and his revenge
get it
am afraid  am not the writer you are looking for
You are, you don't know how much
Harry registers what he has just heard
will pay whatever you ask
It's too personal
Make it yours
am not aiming for a biopic, rather, think of it as a base from which to develop a fiction
Thanks, but no
(He rises) And now, if you don't mind
41
He calls Diego
The boy responds in that instant, he was in the kitchen, waiting for Harry to call him
Ray  will not give up, so he writes his telephone number on a piece of paper and places it in his hand
50 There you have my phone number, if you change your mind
Harry is still standing, with the piece of paper in his hand
Diego observes both men
Ray gets up
am sure we will see each other again
In my case, that would be a miracle
Diego accompanies him to the door
And closes it behind him
Harry opens his desk's drawer and places the piece of paper with Ray's telephone number inside
He rummages through the drawer's interior until he finds a key
He grabs it
42
Harry and Diego are now alone, in the den
Ruminating over Ray 's visit and the story he was proposing Harry
Did you overhear that
Yes
'm flipping out
Why did he ask you if Mateo had died
51 To provoke me
don't know
Help me find something
(he points toward the drawers at the bottom of the bookcase and he hands him the key to open one of them) Look inside that drawer
Diego opens the drawer with the key Harry has given him
The drawer is full of different groups of photographs and various objects mixed in a certain order
There is a black notebook
box with Mexican handicrafts
Some 1980s postcards as well some from other decades, some movie postcards, some others of exotic landscapes
Some of the groups of photographs are sorted into envelopes, boxes or transparent binders
For Diego it's like looking into a treasure chest
It has been many years since that drawer has been opened
This was out of respect, not from lack of curiosity, Diego would never do so behind Harry's back
Look through the pictures of the `94 shoot
Some of the photographs must have the date on it
After tossing aside various envelopes, Diego finds a lot of photographs of the shooting, dated `94
He takes them out of their envelope
He shuffles through them, until he pauses at one
think this is him
Who
The man who just left
52 (Rising) Describe the picture to me
It's from the shoot
(He looks at the box from where he's taken it)
He is carrying a small camera, like a Super 8
It's a 16mm
Are you sure it's him
He is now thinner and wears a beard, but it's him
He is talking to you
What am  saying
don't know
He is handing you something, it looks like a pack of cigarettes
It's a radio microphone
He is asking me to wear it and  am refusing it
Who is he
Ernesto Martel's son
Harry is perturbed by the confirmation of his doubts
He would have preferred to be mistaken
(Serious and pensive) You can put them away now
Diego returns the different sets of photographs to their place, inside the drawer a photo appears of Lena's face, in close-up
It's the same woman who appears in sequences 20 through 36
53 The drawer closes, darkness engulfs its interior, drowning Lena's image, soon reborn in the next sequence
43
,
(1992) Out of the darkness, Lena's image emerges, the year is `92:  close- up of the woman, looking at herself in the mirror, touching up her makeup
She grabs a dress by a famous designer of the time and puts it on
few meters away, in the bedroom, Ernesto buttons up his fly, after tucking in his shirt tail
The scene is that of a wealthy couple, who get along
They are preparing to attend a concert
Ernesto is a big fan of classical music
Lena looks rejuvenated and more refined
Her life and her facial skin have both improved since the first time we see her in Martel's office
The moles have disappeared from her face
Her demeanor is still adult, that of a young woman who has experienced life
Ernesto Martel frequently rests his gaze on her, fascinated, it's hard for him to believe that "such beauty" belongs to him
44
The phone rings
Ernesto Senior picks up the handset
His relaxed countenance changes the second he hears the voice on the other end
54 It's his second wife, whom he divorced years ago
He treats her with disregard
can't talk now, Rosanna
It's about your son
have caught him trying on my dresses
And it's not the first time
It's your fault, you made him effeminate to humiliate me
That's not the problem, the boy is very depressed, 've had to take him to a psychiatrist
Don't call him "boy"
He is already seventeen
The doctor has told me he is in need of a father figure
think  am going to send him your way so that he can spend some time with you, after all you are his father
If  haven't been a good father in eighteen years, don't think  can learn to be one precisely now
How can you speak like that
Have you no feelings
(Looks at Lena, intently)  have them
Very deep feelings, they just don't include either of you
While he speaks, Lena consults him about the jewelry she is about to put on, she tries on different pairs of earrings for his approval, something he gives without pausing his phone conversation
55 Lena makes a gesture of reproach
Ernesto should not speak to his ex- wife in that tone
If anything happens to him, you'll know who's at fault
Stop blackmailing me, Rosanna
Tell Ernesto that if he wants to talk to me he should call me himself
Ernesto Martel Senior hangs up, bewildered
45
1992
(In reprimand) Don't be so harsh with them, Ernesto
He sips from his drink, or he serves himself another one if he has already finished the first
Blackmailers
Why don't you invite your son to spend a few days here
It'd be better if you didn't get involved with them, Lena
Ernesto takes a sip from his drink
56 He can keep me company
Does he like movies or theater
Ernesto Senior casts her a sideways glance
don't know
But the mother has told me he is a bit faggot
If  ask him to come  would like for you to tell me if that's true
and whether you think there's any remedy
And how would  know
What an idea
am not asking you to fuck him, but you good-looking girls can tell these things
Call him, but you can't count on me for the rest
Ernesto approaches the telephone and dials a number

(2008)
Fourteen years later  in the same room, decorated differently, (more modern, more colorful), although it still retains some noble and timeless furniture pieces and the same layout  Ernesto Junior (we in effect confirm that this is Ray ) speaks on the telephone while getting dressed to leave for a party
In that very room, another man (young, handsome and ambitious) is getting dressed in front of a piece of furniture equipped with a mirror, at the very spot Lena had been 57 earlier
(This piece of furniture is not the same one as the one fourteen years earlier, this is a more masculine piece, the other one was a type of boudoir)
- am not reproaching you for our separation but that you live with a man
What will your children think
(On the phone) That their father is a homosexual (he gazes at his handsome boyfriend) and that he has very good taste
If they love me and you don't set them against me, they will accept it
- You should have told me before we married
If you hadn't been so exclusively concerned with my father's fortune you might have noticed it yourself
The ex-wife grumbles furiously
The beautiful boyfriend continues to dress and smiles at Ernesto
Another telephone rings
have to go,  have another call

's Will it be your other ex-wife
58 hope not
(Into the headset) Yes
(Dryly) It's Judit Garcia
Oh, hello, Judit
(In an amiable tone) Did you get the money
don't want it
just sent it back, Ernesto
She emphasizes his name
You won't call me Ray
It's my artistic name
Artistic
What are you up to
Hoping to erase my father's name
And what does that have to do with Harry
've been wanting to see him for a long time
And it's true that  want to shoot a movie and that  want him to write the script
(Looks at the boyfriend) 've got the protagonist
The boyfriend catches the allusion
You are not a director
You should take a look at my documentary, you'd change your mind
59 Ernesto, forget about us
Don't be afraid of me
am not my father
Do not come near Harry again
If you ever stop by his house again  will report you for harassment
And she hangs up the phone
At that very moment Judit is in her office with the American production team
She apologizes and attempts to recover her calm before undertaking the subject of the meeting at hand

2008 The house is not very big, but it is large enough for two people
It's discretely feminine and very practical
The details indicate that an independent woman lives there, as well as a young-man, twenty- five years old
There is some detail of the decor (the curtains, for example) that is replicated in Harry's home
It is clear that Judit has had a hand in setting up the writer's home
Judit is packing her bags, she paces back and forth
She is a bit overwhelmed, with multiple thoughts crossing her mind
At times, she asks for Diego's help
am not at all pleased with having to scout outside Madrid, but the Americans pay a bundle and we need money
60 You can leave without concerns
Don't worry about me
am also worried for Harry
(Sounds more like an order than a request) Please, look after him during my absence
(Protests)  have things to do, mom
can't look after him all day
It's only two weeks
Harry manages perfectly on his own and right now we are not writing anything
Acknowledges the reason for her worry
am worried about Ernesto Junior's visit
would like for you to be on guard in case he appears or calls and then let me know immediately
Why are you so worried
Judit stops what she's doing, and takes a moment to take a deep breath
He's crazy
don't trust him
Why
61 (Evasive) It's a long story
(Persistent) Summarize it
Diego, please, this is not the moment
It never is for you
(Exasperated) Hey, if it bothers you so much to look after Harry, 'll quit the job and stay in Madrid
Or 'll hire someone
It doesn't bother me to look after Harry
But  am tired of so much secrecy
(It's a civilized encounter, no screaming
There is tension, but it is kept under control by both of them) 49
2008 public park
Diego and Harry are walking along a straight pathway
Kids, dogs, people jogging
It is a tranquil and pleasant place
Diego is in front, Harry is behind him, holding on to his elbow, (as reference), but it's Harry who is moving faster, pushing Diego from his elbow
The boy shows signs of exhaustion, he is wearing black sunglasses
Don't go so fast
62 We are exercising
'm not
'm just keeping you company
How can you walk so fast
am training and  don't work at night, nor do  drug myself
(On guard) What do you mean by that
That  take care of myself, with the fanaticism of an older, handicapped person
You are no fanatic
Yes,  am
All of us who survive a critical physical injury are
There is no other way

They exit the park
While they wait at a stop sign, a billboard catches Diego's attention
Half of the billboard is taken up by the motto:
The names of participating ambulatory hospitals and their hours appear below
Harry can tell his company is distracted, so he asks him: 63 What are you looking at
billboard
Why so
In huge letters it says "Donate Blood", it includes where one has to go
You want to donate blood
No, no
was thinking that "Donate Blood" is a good title for a movie
Yes
It has a good ring
For a vampire flick
Harry finds it amusing
They walk toward home
It's true
(Ironizing, kidding, improvising) Imagine that behind the billboard a whole group of vampires that work in ambulatory care are hiding
and they actually keep the blood they get from donors for their own consumption, of course
Your mother would like that story

2008 Mariacruz, the Latin American maid, is preparing something in the kitchen
Meanwhile, Diego and Mateo gather around the table
Diego sits in front of his laptop
Both of the characters are improvising, rapidly, and become increasingly excited, completing each other's sentences
They are having fun, as if playing a game
The sequence becomes a demonstration of the process of creating fiction, based on an trivial, real anecdote
(They will begin the sequence by opening a document
Diego writes the title in caps:
) The vampires would be like a type of ethnic group, completely assimilated into Spanish society, they don't stand out
There are vampires who occupy important positions, keeping it a secret (like the Opus Dei)
But even though they live in the shadows, they have amassed great social and economic power
They control various industries
For example, the one responsible for dark sunglasses
(Smiles) And those that provide nightly entertainment: bars, discos, after-hours
Since they don't need drugs to stay awake, they are the most apt for working at night
They don't burn out
65 And for the sunscreen business
The poor things are very sensitive to climate change and to the holes in the ozone layer
Their sunscreens are some of the best on the market
(Laughs) And those which sell best
This is all great
Diego talks and takes notes on his laptop
Harry paces back and forth, in front of the table, like a caged animal
Protected by the sunscreen, they can function all day
The lotion must be as dense as armour
(More inspired) This is how the story could begin: (describes)  gorgeous woman, totally naked, rubbing her body with a super-dense lotion, before heading to work at an ambulatory hospital
Her body is a velvety pale, beautiful
(Continues) What a great opening
We also need a love story
hybrid love story, between the female vampire and a normal guy
Like in "Cat People", a love story between beings of different species
She works at one of those labs where blood is donated and where they snatch it for themselves
The guy has gone to donate his, or to get some tests
They like 66 each other immediately
After the first needle prick into his vein, she gets completely excited
So, they start to date
But she doesn't want to turn him into a vampire
these aren't proselytizing vampires, they are above biting people
unless they truly need it to survive
But they must like sex, right
Of course
That's one of the problems, the couple desire each other desperately
But when it comes to fucking, she becomes prudish
Why
Because she is afraid of losing control in her excitement and taking a bite into his jugular
Aha
When they're horny, she lets him do everything, front, back, whatever he wants, except ravaging her mouth
And her breasts
Also
But that gets into high-risk territory
When he sucks on her breasts, she has to cover her mouth with a pillow, which she ends up shredding with her fangs
And when she sucks his dick
67 No, no sucking
She would tear it on the first bite
And how does he react
man may do without kissing, but it's very rough not to have your cock sucked
Since he is deeply in love, he accepts the situation (or gives up to it)
Once they are more comfortable with each other, she wears a muzzle, as security for both
Because when she's turned on, she has a type of dental erection, her face grows into something like that of a she-wolf
Diego writes furiously, while cracking up
like your story very much, Diego
Our story
No
This one was your idea, and you'll author it
'll be your sparring partner, for all the times you've done the same for me
Harry is welcoming him as a writer
This fact doesn't escape the boy, he feels an unexpected pride
52
2008 At nights, Diego
's inside a small booth
Two of his friends, or just acquaintances of the club scene, one of them we've already seen 68 earlier, keep him company
The one we don't know, Friend , looks pretty loaded
He is very "friendly" with the other two
(Without acrimony) Stop fondling me
damn it
It's the
It kicks your ass
Diego takes a sip of Coke and whisky and sets it down somewhere inside the booth
Do you want a little bit of ""
(referring to "", aka Ecstasy) Just a tip
(He licks his finger and sticks its moist tip into the bag that Alex offers him, he takes his finger to his mouth) Tomorrow  have to work, we are writing a vampire script that's going to be the shit
The Friend, high on , grabs a glass of Coca-cola from the bartender's hands, at the bar
He takes out a small container and adds a few drops of liquid ecstasy into the drink
He takes a sip and enters the booth where the other two are
He sets the glass down and begins to jump, euphorically
Stop already, you are going to go through the roof
69 In between songs, (he is changing the tune) Diego grabs Friend 's drink
They are both drinking Coca-Cola, Diego's has whisky and Friend 's has liquid ecstasy
Distracted by changing tunes, Diego does not realize that he has grabbed the drink with
He takes a long sip
And he falls flat to the floor
The two friends, bewildered and scared, attempt to revive him, but to no avail
Perhaps Alex will exclaim: Holy shit, he's taken a drink from your glass
Why in the world did you get Coca-cola
Didn't you notice he was drinking a jack and coke
didn't realize
(Very alarmed) He's unconscious
53
2008 () An ambulance arrives
They carry Diego out, unconscious, from the bar on a stretcher
Alex goes with him, very scared
Before they go into the vehicle, Diego's mobile phone rings
Alex takes it from Diego's pocket, he doesn't know why he is doing so, it is a hysterical reaction
On the other side of the line, he hears Harry's voice
No
'm a friend
Diego just
he's not well
We are taking him into the emergency room
70 Emergency
Can  talk to him
No
because
What hospital are you taking him to
The friend asks one of the ambulance employees who tells him the name of the hospital
Alex repeats it for Harry
Who are you
(Improvising)
His uncle
am on my way
54
2008 Harry gets out of a taxi
He aids himself with the typical blind man's cane
He can't find the entryway
He bumps into something
We have not yet seen him this clumsy
Someone helps him enter
The same person accompanies him to the reception desk in the waiting-room area
He is no longer the blind man who was walking euphorically along his street's sidewalk, umbrella in hand
(Anxious)  am here to see Diego Garcia
He's just been admitted
The "receptionist" looks through the admittances
Taking into account that Harry is blind, she decides to call the Doctor who has attended Diego
71 54
Shortly thereafter, the Doctor appears
He heads directly for Harry
am here to see Diego Garcia
Are you immediate family
(Improvises) Yes
'm his uncle, and his godfather
Your nephew is at the , he arrived in a coma
Harry reacts to the news
In a coma
Yes
But, what has happened
He ingested liquid ecstasy and alcohol
it is a lethal combination
His friend informed us it was a mistake
(It happens sometimes, kids grab the wrong glass
) My God
But Diego is a very healthy boy
The doctor makes a neutral gesture of acknowledgement
72 Barring any complications, he will recover in six to twelve hours
If that's the case, 'll wait
Go home, we will call you
'd rather wait
Are you certain
Yes
Guide me to a place where  can sit, please
The Doctor directs him toward an area with sofas
Would you mind providing us with his parents' phone number
He only has a mother and, at the moment, she is working outside Madrid
would prefer to call her myself
don't want to alarm her, unless he is truly in a grave condition
Normally, he should recuperate in a few hours
but, in any case, you should have a talk with him, once he's better
Yes, of course
73 They arrive at a couch set, ugly and lacking style, Harry collapses on one of the armchairs, demolished
The Doctor returns to work
The girl at the reception desk stares at Harry, who is immobile, readied for a long wait
slow fade to black

2008 From black
Harry is still waiting, this time at home, sitting on a wingback chair close to the bed where Diego sleeps
On the nightstand, there are some medications and a glass of water, next to a plastic bottle, an alarm-clock
And perhaps a book
Through the window you can see the day beginning to break, Diego awakens
At first he doesn't know where he is
In the darkness of the room he discovers Harry's figure, sitting on the wingback chair
He can't tell if he's awake or asleep, but it soothes him to know he's not alone
Diego stares at him, he doesn't say anything
Just stares
To his surprise, Harry asks him: How are you
Diego makes a listless gesture
don't know
dazed
Did you speak with my mother
74 Yes,  told her it was something you ate
And she believed it
don't know
She wanted to hurry back, but convinced her to continue with the location scouting
At some point you'll have to call her
Silence
Diego thinks about everything's that's happened
After a few seconds: Are you asleep
'm not sleepy anymore
Do you want to talk
No
Would you like me to speak
don't know
If you'd like
say so in order to distract you
When  was young, before  got into making movies,  was very good at telling stories
(Not sure) Well, then
would you mind telling me why my mother is so afraid of Ernesto Junior
She's afraid of him
75 Before she left, she made me promise that  would remain alert, in case he reappeared
She didn't explain why
She never explains anything
Harry remains pensive for a moment, Diego's request has taken him by surprise
It's a long story
Judit says the same thing
How did you meet him
It is not easy to talk about
In some way it must be obvious that Harry has spent many years (fourteen) avoiding this topic, but he is determined to do anything necessary to entertain Diego
Diego serves himself some water and prepares to listen
We met him
In an office we had rented in preparation for my new film, about fourteen years ago
56
'
1994 The images that correspond to the past are edited more freely than the rest of the narrative
Summarized and sped-up by Harry's voice-off, mixing media from diverse sources
76 After having written five dramas,  had finally managed to write a script for a comedy, or that's what thought
wanted to change genres
to take a risk (ironic-destructive) And  swear  accomplished that, the part about taking a risk
In 1994, everyone calls Harry "Mateo"
He is sitting behind a table filled with papers, photographs, books, magazines, an ashtray, pencil and pen holders, etc
At its center, a script lies open, with tons of notes scribbled on the margins of its pages
He is finishing the definitive version of "Girls and Suitcases"
The casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic
The only decorations on the walls, here and there, not following any particular symmetrical rule, are postcards of painters, actors or landscapes, held in place by tacks
There is also a newspaper page that has caught Mateo's attention
Or some astonishing photograph, taken from a magazine
The cover of some magazine
Everything without framing, tacked directly onto the wall
The furniture is pastel, medium-shade green or red, with velvet tapestry, worn and outmoded
The pieces don't match, but they look good together
Judit enters (also fourteen years younger, but this is less obvious
She is a woman unmarked by the march of time
) Mateo is focused on the script's pages
Judit is Mateo's right-hand man, they are accomplices in everything, both professionally and emotionally
77 girl has stopped by
She doesn't have an appointment, so there is no reason for you to see her
(Without much interest) What's she like
Too beautiful to be funny
(Smiles) Really
She is Ernesto Martel's lover, the tycoon
She is here with his son
And she's an actress
(Ironic) Her
If she's been with him for three years, she must be
In any case, go out and say hello, to be polite
One must get along well with important men
You never know
57
1994
Mateo exits his office
In the improvised waiting area (it is not a proper waiting room but a transient-space turned waiting area by a couch left over from the furnishings of some previous film)
He finds Ernesto Junior (in other words, the character who had introduced himself as Ray  fourteen years ago; in his case, the age-difference is noticeable, he's just a kid)
He is a little heavier, his hair longer, he reminds us of the love-struck big-kid that Phyllip Seymour Hoffman played in "Boogie Nights"
78 Mateo's gaze rests only for an instant on the young man, even though the boy does not take his stupefied eyes away from Mateo throughout the entire sequence
Ernesto Junior has accompanied Lena
When he sees her, Mateo freezes, at the door to his office
Lena's back is turned, or her head is tilted as she reads a magazine
Ernesto elbows her, Lena raises her head and discovers Mateo, watching her from the door to his office
Mateo's heart churns, it's a cinematographic churn, he feels like James Stewart in "Vertigo", when he first sees Kim Novak at the restaurant, with her famous green dress
Time stops for an instant so that Mateo may contemplate this woman's apparition
After this brief hypnotic moment, they introduce themselves, forgetting Ernesto's presence, who then, since no one pays attention to him, introduces himself
Even though she's a bit nervous, one can tell that Lena is a strong and decisive woman
Brunette
Mysterious
Made-up in dark tones that stand out on her pale skin
Refined
She doesn't have the aspect of a comedienne, her presence is too intense, she seems better suited to be the heroine of a film noir (as we've said)
Genres and their iconographies pose no limit on Mateo's capacity to be attracted to her, from the first instant
am sorry we showed up like this, but 've heard you are running auditions
and  would like for you to give me a try out
Mateo observes her intently
She does not resemble any of the characters in the script, but he no longer cares about that
At some 79 point, Judit makes her appearance and gets to contemplate this scene herself, displeased
can come whatever day is convenient
You're already here
Let's read something
It doesn't sound like "let's read something" but more like "let's have a drink
" They disappear through Mateo's office door

1994
From black
(Over an establishing shot of the mansion, one hears Harry's voice-off as he speaks to Diego) The reading didn't work out
We were both too nervous
The first meeting and the reading we did only served to make me realize that woman's very presence perturbed me
Great mansion, with a huge green parcel of land with various trees, bushes, flowers
Two or three dogs are running across the lawn
The 80 plot of land must span about 6,000 square meters or more
(The dogs approach the camera, as if it were a trespasser)
Alarm system, etc
The main building has two levels, joined by a grand staircase
All decorated by wives with the wish to be decorators, aided by hired decorators
Brand-name furniture, two or three paintings worth millions
piano and a certain desolateness
One can tell that his previous wives have left along with a part of the furnishings
59 1994 The Father already knows he is missing information about something unexpected that has gone on that morning
They are at dessert
Where have you been this morning
Ernesto hasn't told you
haven't asked him
(She hates having to account for herself
)  went to see a film director
What for
(Dryly) For an audition
Ernesto looks at her with surprise, he doesn't approve of it
81 An audition
How so
(With less determination than she would like, but enough to alarm Ernesto Senior)  want to work
Weren't you going to study interior design
Weren't you going to redecorate the house
thought we agreed that you would transform what's left of my two shipwrecked marriages into something more our own
Call a decorator
want to be an actress
've always wanted to
(Brief pause) You've already attempted it once
and look how you've ended up
Lena shoots him a fulminating glance
(Affected) That's a cheap shot
(First, he attacks
Then, he is sorry
Loike any violent lover)  am sorry, forgive me
Lena is frustrated and restless
She rises
82 Excuse me,  am retiring to my room
Ernesto grabs her and then embraces her
Lena remains still within his arms, imprisoned and elusive, the two locked in a strange posture
In any case, don't worry
It didn't turn out well was too nervous
60
Someone calls at the door
"There's a call"
It's the voice of one of the hired help, behind the door
"it's Mr
Mateo Blanco, and he says it's important"
(Yells) Come in
She breaks free from Ernesto's embrace and runs toward the door where the maid is holding the supplementary handset
Avidly, she grabs it from her
She listens, excited
She responds only in monosyllables, affirmatively
She hangs up the phone
Her eyes glitter with intense happiness, a feeling from which Ernesto feels excluded
(Enthusiastically) That's the film director
He says the reading was not sufficient and he wants to see me once more
Lena looks imploringly at Ernesto Senior
83 What are you going to do
Go see him, no
Ernesto makes a gesture that betrays his anger and displeasure
Please, Ernesto
need to do something
And 've always wanted to be an actress
And what will become of me
They have not given me the role yet
They will
Well, if  were to get it, we would still see each other every day, as it has been, in the mornings and evenings
Nothing will change, except that during the day  would work, just like you
Why don't we get married
(Taken by surprise) What
am asking you to marry me
Don't you think you've married and divorced enough times already
84 With you it'd be the first
We've been living together for three years, aren't we fine like this
(Somber) It doesn't seem you are

2008 Diego is better, but Harry prefers to keep caring for him
Harry makes him breakfast
Diego is sitting at the table
Ernesto Martel offered to produce the movie
Your mother didn't want him to
She was waiting for a subsidy from the Ministry and an advance sale to television, but that would take months and  was suddenly in a great hurry to begin shooting

-, ,
1994 Part of the voice-off is edited over these images
Lena is in the process of being made-up, coifed and dressed
This, under the control of Mateo Blanco, who does not stop speaking, offering references, making ironic remarks, etc
All of this is seen through the lens of a 16mm camera
(Images of contrasting colors)
The editing is vertiginous and doesn't at all respect continuity 85 rules
The young Ernesto Junior is carrying the camera
We also see this scene from the other side of the 16mm frame, from the point of view of the main narration, which includes images of Ernesto Junior filming with the 16mm camera
On the inside frame of the dressing room mirror, there are photographs of a young Shirley MacLaine, Kate Hepburn (young), Judy Holliday, Audrey Hepburn, Goldie Hawn (in "Butterflies Are Free" or any other film where she wears her hair long with a fringe)
Icons of the romantic comedy of today and yesteryear
Over the voices of the characters that appear on frame, one hears Harry's voice-off
enjoyed making her up, styling her and dressing her
Lena could be the Shirley McLaine of "The Apartment" and the Audrey Hepburn of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", or even Goldie Hawn
Through the 16mm camera we can see the details of Lena's mutating image, how it gets constructed
It is true that she reminds us of the three actresses that Harry mentions in his voice-off
The members of the team assisting her (hair-stylist, makeup artist, costume designer, etc
and Lena herself) laugh heartily when they finish setting her up with Goldie's blonde long-hair wig with a fringe
And they stare, dumbfounded, when she is made-up as Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" or "Sabrina"
It's a style that fits Lena like a glove
They are all fascinated by the change, except Judit, estranged and angered by their playfulness
(For Judit, Mateo is constructing his ideal woman
She finds all that playing around obscene and dangerous)
86 Your mother didn't like Lena
Judit watches Lena-Audrey with a fatalistic stare
, on the other hand, liked her a lot, and she liked me
Mateo manifests his enthusiasm over the changes and Lena looks at him with excitement
She also feels transformed on the inside and that's thanks to Mateo
Ernesto Junior also liked me
Ernesto Junior directs his camera lens toward Harry's face, not hiding his admiration
was hoping to use him for my own ends
His father had asked him to make a documentary about the shooting
63
,   ' 1994 Ernesto Senior is watching the make-up test, the hair-styling test, etc
, part of what we have already seen through the 16mm lens
The sound is chaotic, many people are always speaking at once
87 As far as Ernesto Senior was concerned, (we observe him watching the projection uncomfortably) 've never known a man more obsessed with a woman, except myself
He was producing the film out of a desperate attempt to not lose Lena
In the middle of this emotional quagmire, we began shooting
Your mother was present at every instant, her face like a sergeant's
(End with a shot in 16mm of Judit
) 64
"  " 1994 Images from "the making of" shot by Ernesto Junior on 16mm, with high grain and contrast, mixed with direct images from the establishing shot of what is occurring
The look of Lena's character is openly inspired by the Audrey Hepburn of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", with Sabrina's hair style and loop earrings (fringe and ponytail)
She has also adopted the style of Holy Golithly, her kind heart and that urbane sophistication that characterizes modern girls from rural origins
The only difference is a more visceral quality, Pina (Lena's character) is exalted and Mediterranean, nothing like Hepburn
Her wardrobe is that of a modern girl in `94, she is a professional model for cosmetic products
One of her advertising photographs is framed and hangs on one of the walls of the loft where she lives
88 - ,    "' "
Pina, Lena's character, is cutting tomatoes for a gazpacho, inside a beautiful and shiny kitchen
Pina is sad, probably thinking about "all the times she has had gazpacho with Ivan, the absent lover"
tear drops from her face onto the knife with which she's cutting the tomatoes
(In slow motion, one sees the collision of the tear with the knife, in a cut-in)
Hers is a subtly comic sadness
When she is done grinding up the tomatoes she takes a box of sedatives, which she is carrying in her apron's pocket
She throws all the pills into the gazpacho
She keeps two or three for herself
(She may even say out loud, "These are for me"
) With a wooden spoon, she mixes the orange liquid, even though it only contains red tomatoes
The cut-ins are to be alternated with the "making of" of the cut-ins
As well as Mateo's comments over the action, which instruct Lena how to react
The clap-board marks the end
It's the fifth take
Mateo says "Great"
Lena almost screams with joy
Cut to

) Seen through the 16mm camera: In the foreground, the team that's preparing the next shot for the next sequence; in the background, without being able to hear what they are saying, Mateo speaking to Lena
They are both holding a script in their hands
Mateo is giving her directions
Everything is very professional, but their demeanor radiates understanding, complicity and
a latent desire
They are not talking about anything personal
"Now we will do the part where you return home, frustrated, after having left Ivan a note on his door
When you bump into Julieta
You just open this door, you look at the answering machine from afar
The machine has become some kind of monster to you
You are terrified of it
" " Monster
" "Yes
Your sanity depends on it
If the light blinks, it means there may have been a call
And if it doesn't blink
you can't do anything but wait
and you lost your patience some time ago

'
1994 What Lena and Mateo are saying on the terrace, as captured by the "making of" by Ernesto Junior, is being seen and listened to by Ernesto Senior, in the screening room that he's had installed in his own home
Next to him, a young female lip-reader ( girl of neutral aspect, but interesting, dressed as a glamour-less Russian
) is translating for Ernesto Senior what Lena and Mateo are saying, as if she were dubbing them
(The tone of her voice does not betray anything suspicious
Everything sounds strictly professional, a director and an actress who speak, in complicity, about their work
) They both appear 90 contained, their attraction made more evident by what they hide than by what they show
Judit is present in all the shots of the setting up, including the ones where Mateo and Lena are in the background, as Mateo makes suggestions on how to add nuance to Lena's performance
Judit appears solemn and always with an annoyed expression
Ernesto Senior feels sympathy for this woman

Mateo yells "cut"
And the Assistant sends the team away, until the next day
The Production team hands out the order for the next day, as if handing out the last edition of a newspaper with breaking news
Dispersal
The different teams disband and head toward the exit doors
Mateo crosses paths with Ernesto Junior
Are you going to work on something
No
You may go
don't mind staying
It's best if you leave
am going to try out some wigs
91 Wigs
love wigs
(Categorically) No
You don't love them
You already have many hours shot of wigs
This is more of the same
Disappointed, Ernesto Junior says goodbye
And Lena
After she tries on the new wigs, she's asked for a massage therapist, she has a spasm
Spasms
don't have footage of spasms
Couldn't shoot that
Ernesto, stop being a pest and leave already
See you tomorrow
Mateo speaks to him in a friendly tone, as if there were a warm rapport between them
He does so strategically, given that he thinks the boy is the plague
Ernesto Junior finally understands that there is nothing for him to do and disappears

She is there with one or two actors who are still hanging around

No

There's only Edurne, on watch
Mateo approaches Lena and, without the slightest preamble, launches himself at her mouth, kissing her fervently
The impression is that they are about to devour each other
They separate as if to catch their breath, looking intensely into each other's eyes
They tear each other's clothes off (she's in a robe)
93 This is madness, Mateo
am no good for you
You should have warned me sooner
There are no overtures
They devour each other, hungry
They make love on a small bed, as if they were on the edge of a precipice

This is supposed to be another day, not the same day of the "scene" in the dressing room
Ernesto Senior awaits for her in the living room, in front of a muted television, with a drink in hand
(Perhaps the train will still be present, on the television screen
) Lena approaches him and kisses him
(Ironic)  didn't know one worked so hard in the movies
(Smiles) Well, yes, especially if you're a girl
94 Why if you're a girl
Lena sits and takes a sip from his drink
Because you must put on makeup (and then remove it), dress up, do your hair
Get dressed again, do your hair again
And that takes hours
And you're not tired
At the end of the week, sure, but 'm happy
was thinking we should take a break, a weekend
Just the two of us, alone
At the house in Ibiza, or in Paris

can't travel until the shoot is over
am talking about just a weekend
We rehearse on weekends
Don't you also rehearse during the shooting
Yes
What's going on, you spend all day rehearsing

Distractedly, Judit waters the plants, real ones, of Pina's fake terrace, some of them somewhat shriveled from being away from the sun for so long
Mateo is going to go complain to her about the set, but he notices that she is so worried and tired that he doesn't say anything
You look awful
Little Diego
he could hardly breathe all night
neither of us has slept a wink
(Worried) You still don't know what it is
96 Some doctors say it's asthma, others that it's allergies, but we don't know to what
They are still running tests, but it's driving me to the brink
Take all the time you need
Even if we're shooting, your son is more important
Thanks
(Changing subjects) One more thing, 've talked to the producer
And
He complains that the shooting is monopolizing Lena
(Exasperated and condescending) And how does he think one makes movies
Ernesto is a businessman, not an artist
Then he shouldn't have signed up as a producer, no one asked him
warned you
Ernesto Martel doesn't give a crap about this movie and those of us making it, except for one person
This weekend he is taking her to Ibiza with him, so you won't be able to rehearse

1994 Lena and Ernesto spend the weekend together, at an Ibizan house minutely decorated with ethnic details
The decoration, super- luxurious hippie, does not ring untrue to the Island's aesthetic
Consider that Ernesto Senior and Lena are in the bedroom, on the bed, making love luxuriously
There's no hurry, they pay careful attention to all the details
After the final sprint, they both come, satisfied
Or so it seems
Ernesto remains spent on the bed, motionless
Lena gets up and goes to the bathroom
She opens the faucet and lets the water run
Immediately, she is overtaken by vicious retching
On her knees, she vomits into the toilet
After she's done vomiting she gets up and looks at herself in the mirror
She wipes off her mouth and closes the faucet
She looks very pale, the exertion from the vomiting is written on her face
Quickly, she puts some makeup on
Enough to bring some color back to her cheeks and to get rid of the bags under her eyes
Her eyes still glimmer from the tears she's shed
More than in any other sequence, it is here that Lena reveals her talent as an actress
She exits the bathroom, wrapped in an elegant robe, a bit divine- hippie

1994 Ernesto Senior is still lying in bed, recuperating
He gazes at her, love-struck
98 Have you put on makeup
(Animated, without exaggeration
well-faked serenity)  want you to find me pretty
To me, you always are
It's impossible that you wouldn't be pretty
Lena sits on the bed, her back to Ernesto
He wraps his arm around her waist while she makes some typical girl-gesture: looks at her nails thinking of how she'll fix them, looks into her pocket mirror and ponders the color of her hair, grabs a magazine on the nightstand and thumbs through it, calls her mother to see how she's doing
Or, simplest of all, takes a cigarette out of its box, looks for the lighter, finds it and lights it
Everything is done sluggishly, she's trying to take up as much time as possible
Would you like a cigarette
No
thanks
Do you know how many fucks we've had since we arrived yesterday
(Smiles, like a champ) Six
(Also smiles) Ten
With honours, yes

Yes,  suppose so

1994 Only the indispensable members of the team and the actors are clustered around the entrance hall and the elevator: scene is being shot where Pina exits the elevator and walks through the entrance hall, in a hurry, toward the street
She bumps into Chus, the porter, who is holding two metal objects ( Robert Indiana "", impressive and metallic, and a Gucci alarm clock in the shape of a , the  is also metallic
) Chus stops her, almost by force
She is a very "communicative" woman and Pina attempts to get her off her back, as quickly as possible, without being rude to her
Chus shows her both objects, with a questioning look on her face
100 Look at what 've found on the sidewalk, they fell from your terrace
They are gifts from Mr
Ivan and  tossed them out
He told me to keep them, but  don't want them
But you can't do that, Ms
Pina
You could have killed somebody
You can't just throw things off the terrace, much less if they are metal
In Naples, on New Year's Eve, they even throw out furniture, my grandfather was Neapolitan
carry it in my blood
But this is not Naples, nor is today New Year's Eve
was anxious and throwing things relaxes me
Keep them if you like
Thanks so much, Ms
Pina
But that's not right
Pina exits the entrance hall, leaving the porter mid-sentence, while the porter repeats, still, two more times
It's not alright, Ms
Pina
The scene is very simple, but it must exude charm
Chus is a natural comic talent and Pina's character must act with a flippancy that plays comically
At the same time, Lena is noticeably exhausted, both physically and emotionally
Instead of lending the text lightness, she brings it down
And she's aware of it
101 For the first time, Mateo does not hide his annoyance as a director because the scene turns out badly, and as a lover because he is jealous of her weekend with Ernesto Senior
Lena cannot stand to look at him, she can't bare his angered expression
Mateo takes her aside to a secluded corner of the set and away from the team
(Serious) Your tone is off, Magdalena
(Very depressed)  know
(In a very low voice) What's wrong
(Whispers, on the brink of tears) 'll tell you later
Mateo gestures for the Assistant to come over
Lena still has her back toward the team
Mateo says something to the Assistant, who then says out loud for all to hear: We break for thirty minutes, it's snack time

The members of the team slowly depart from the entrance hall
They take the opportunity to grab a bite or get some air, they gather close to the trucks or next to the catering
All except Ernesto Junior who remains inside and hides furtively behind a styrofoam panel, somewhat removed from the couple, who cannot see him
Mateo looks all around to ensure that they are alone
(With urgency) What's happened
've had a horrible weekend
But
we haven't rehearsed, so that you could rest
Rest
haven't slept a wink all weekend
(Sighs, on the brink of tears) It's been a nightmare
Mateo once again ascertains that there is no one in the entrance hall
He hands her a Kleenex so that she may wipe her tears
have literally had Ernesto on top of me, all those forty-eight hours, like a leech
(repulsed expression) He has not given me a second to breathe, the asshole

Various shots of Pina's loft
Everything seems chaotic, typical of the end of the work day
The furniture is out of place, silverware and plastic is all mixed together with electrical material and stage equipment
The warehouse lights begin to shut off
The team disbands
On her way to the dressing room, Lena tells Ernesto Junior that she is headed to her yoga class, as she does every day
And that she wants to go alone
104 My father asks me why it is that  don't go with you to yoga, he asks me all the time
Well, you tell him that  am a grown-up now, and free, and that 've forbidden you to follow me
You know  can't tell him that
Try it
It would do you good
can't
Do as you wish, but you're not coming with me
And she leaves him behind
Ernesto Junior watches her walk away, disoriented
He always has a tripod attached to his camera, as in "Peeping Tom"

It's the fist time we see this setting: the entrance of the building where Mateo lives
Almost all the windows are darkened
It's midnight
We watch this sequence through the 16mm camera, situated just in front of the building's doorway
We watch as Mateo appears on the sidewalk, walking toward the building's doorway
In front of the building, in the main narrative, we see Ernesto Junior filming with his 16mm camera
He is hiding behind a bush, or cloaked by a tree's shade
Either way, Mateo does not discover him

At the same time that the former is taking place, Lena arrives to Martel's mansion
She finds Ernesto Senior with a drink in his hand, in one of the living areas (or playing the piano), she approaches him and gives him a slight kiss on the lips, in a gesture of hello
(Quotidian and tranquil, an unexpected demeanor for a character of his temperament) How are you
Good, tired
And relaxed
(On guard) Yes
The yoga is doing you good, isn't it
Lena catches Ernesto's allusion, but she pretends she hasn't
She demonstrates her control over herself and her cold determination
Yes, especially after work
am going to snack on something
Will you join me
am not hungry, 'd rather go to bed right now
'll only have a yogurt

Ernesto listens to her steps as they recede
His ironic tranquility disappears and gives way to a furious expression

From black
( different day
) Framed by the window to Mateo's living room seen from the street, one observes the bottom halves of Mateo's and Lena's bodies, as they move around the apartment
Only half of their body is visible because the roman shades are halfway drawn
(One gets the impression that Mateo is showing her around the house)
They say goodbye
We see all this through a 16mm camera
Without a pause in the shooting we realize that the person carrying the camera crosses the street and waits outside of the front door to Mateo's building
82
'
1994 Lena exits through the door
The second she discovers the camera, she confronts it
Ernesto, what are you doing here
Working
107 Turn that off, you idiot
Hasn't Mateo forbidden you to tape us outside the shooting
Not far from them there is a garbage truck that is making horrendous noises and makes it difficult to hear what they are saying
The truck gets closer and the noises louder so that Ernesto Junior and Lena must scream back and forth at each other
My father has told me not to listen to him
he wants to see everything
You both have no scruples
Remember  am taping you
Lena throws herself at Ernesto Junior and attempts to take the camera from him
They struggle (the camera continues shooting, the images move around, dizzyingly)
Ernesto Junior manages to break free from Lena
They are both out of breath
Ernesto backs up a few steps in order to frame Lena again and so that he can focus her image
Lena could take off running, but instead she stays right where she is; she lets Ernesto bring her into focus and frame her correctly, while she fixes her hair
She looks straight at the camera: (In a barrage) Listen carefully, Ernesto
Yes,  am talking to you
(She points toward Mateo's house) was just with the man  love and  am the happiest 've been all my life because he loves me too
(screams) And listen carefully, Ernesto
will let 108 you be very soon
There is no need to spy on me
There is nothing left to hide
83
,  '
1994 (We see this at the same moment it's happening
) The next day, Ernesto Senior is watching the previous night's scene on the screen of his private projection room
We discover this when he is halfway into it; the images pick the action up at the point when Lena exits Mateo's house and confronts the camera, right after she has attempted to grab the camera away from Ernesto Junior
The shots in 16mm alternate with the shots in 35mm that belong to the main narrative
The sound is uproarious, we can hear what they say in a low volume, just as reference
Ernesto asks for the sound to be muted so that the "translator" can do her job
The "lip reader" tries, as usual, to be "neutral and inexpressive", but on this occasion she cannot help but have the violence of the scene affect her
She acts as a mere vehicle, not part of the conflict; nonetheless, she gets a little nervous
She is seated next to the volcano: Ernesto Senior, stony, frozen, silent, and about to explode
84
Just a little earlier, right before the dizzying images appear on screen, those caused by Lena's attempt to remove the camera from Ernesto Junior's hands: 109 On the opposite end of where the screen is, behind the back of both Ernesto and the translator, a door opens
Lena appears
She watches the scene that is unfolding on screen as she lets her voice rise to her mouth
(The entire dialogue in which she has addressed Ernesto Senior directly is seen during the action taking place in the projection room, not on the street
) At first, her voice overlaps with that of the translator, who becomes instantly silent and turns her head toward the door where Lena is standing
Lena is dubbing herself
was just with the man  love and  am the happiest that 've been all my life because he loves me too
And listen carefully, Ernesto
will let you be very soon
There is no need to spy on me
don't have anything left to hide
The translator watches Lena and Ernesto Senior, who is still motionless, watching the screen
On screen, we see Lena walking, her back turned, for a good stretch
With an equal obsession, she is followed down the street by the son and in the screening room by the father

' , '
1994 An avalanche of snow, on the television screen
(Some short shots of both ice and whisky as they fall into a tall glass function as an ellipsis between one scene and the next)
110 Lena paces around anxiously in her bedroom
She attempts to focus on a fashion magazine, but is unsuccessful
She takes a deep breath, makes a decision
She opens the closet and takes out a small, weekend suitcase
She fills it with her most indispensable clothes
She exits her bedroom, on the top floor
In the hallway, only a few meters separate the door to her bedroom from the stairway
There is a small landing just before the top of the stairs, it has a small table against the wall, a beautiful vase with flowers, a mirror and two small sofas on either side of the small table
Ernesto is seated on one of them, holding a glass of whisky in his right hand
It cannot be the first he's had
One could say he's been waiting some time now for Lena's exit, a bottle and an icebox keeping him company
Lena walks a few steps
Se approaches Ernesto, but keeps her distance
She speaks to him in passing
(Suitcase in hand)  am leaving, Ernesto
am leaving you
(Cold, drunk, contemptuous) You are not going anywhere
And how will you stop me
(Every single one of the words in this dialogue sounds laded and slow) No sooner has she said it than Lena realizes that it has been an unnecessary provocation
But it's too late to take back what's been said
Ernesto Senior shoots her a deathly look
But then gets up and changes his expression to calm her
(Pleading) Lena, please
111 One more time, Ernesto begs forgiveness, but Lena doesn't want to see him or hear him
She turns and begins to descend the stairs
The first step
Ernesto approaches her slowly, from behind
He is still pleading, as in a litany: "Lena, please"
"Lena
" 86
But Lena keeps her back to his supplication, descends one more step, her second one
Suddenly, without any change in his expression, Ernesto pushes her with a quick and unexpected movement of his arm
Lena loses her balance and falls, rolling, bouncing violently against the edges of the steps until her whole body hits the floor at the foot of the stairs
During the time the fall takes, Ernesto doesn't move, he watches her fall, bump by bump
He waits until she's on the floor and she casts him a fulminating glance, before he reacts
87
Lena lands on the floor, broken and stunned by the blows
She lifts her head and attempts to move, but can't
Ernesto descends quickly and comes to her side
He begs, calmly, without violence, for her not to move
Lena cannot stand, her battered body only allows her to drag herself toward the door, like a reptile
Ernesto takes her, delicately, in his arms
Lena gazes at him in horror
112 88
1994 He exits into the night, onto a green lawn, with the woman in his arms, they look like two newlyweds
The dogs, disconcerted, follow them in procession, they intuit that something is not right
Once inside the car (none of the hired help is there that night), he opens the gate from the inside and exits onto the highway
89
1994
Lena is lying on the back seat, pale and in pain, but she's not complaining
Ernesto is driving faster than 180 Km/hr
He alerts a pair of patrolmen
When he realizes he's being followed, he increases his speed
The patrolmen signal with their lights for him to stop on the curb, but Ernesto Martel ignores their signal until the police car catches up to him and forces him to stop
90
1994 The two patrolmen get out of their vehicle and head, enraged, toward Ernesto
They gesture for him to lower his window
Ernesto lowers the window, relaxed, despite the situation
The two patrolmen, especially the one who calls the shots, recriminate him, their voices raised, for all the infractions he has just committed
They are very agitated and they quickly notice the high level of alcohol emitted by the driver's breath
Knocked out on the back seat, Lena observes the whole scene
Her face is contorted with pain and anxiety
113 ( river of cars continues to pass nearby
) Using a nasty tone, one of the policemen asks Ernesto for his documents
The following conversation takes place while the policemen verify the vehicle's documents
Ernesto explains to them with a common sense that's disarming: We have to get to the hospital
My wife is badly hurt
Lena moans in affirmation
The Policeman takes a look inside the car, in order to ascertain that she is indeed not faking it
What's happened
was in the living room and, since we weren't planning to go out,  started drinking early
am pretty drunk, as you may notice
Suddenly,  heard a thump,  ran to the stairs and there she was
She tripped and fell down the stairs
Is this true, Madam
Yes
Can't you leave the paperwork for later
Your husband can't drive in this condition
What do you mean
Ernesto attempts to start the car, but the other policeman stops him
114 You're crazy
Lena moans inside the car
She may even start crying
Please
She says this to the two men
Get out of there
will drive
Absolutely not
You either let me drive or we all stay here until the ambulance arrives
(To Ernesto) Stop it, Ernesto
Let him drive
(To Ernesto, paternalistic and contemptuous) Get down and sit in the back, with your wife
(Threatening) If anything happens (referring to Lena), you better be ready
You have no idea who  am
Taking his time, Ernesto vacates the driver's seat and sits in the back, next to Lena
115 will pretend that  didn't hear you
will also pretend  noticed neither how drunk you are nor your affronts to authority, Mr
Martel
Sulking and with an alcohol-driven affection (and casual) he asks : Are you all right
(Screams) No
(to the policeman) And could we get (the fuck) going
The policeman gets the car moving and his partner follows them in the patrol car

"Don't move", "Don't breathe", etc
93
1994 The last thing we see is the -ray of the head, which dissolves over Lena's head and face as she asks a nurse for the telephone, telling her that she needs to make an urgent phone call
Ernesto censures her with his look
Once the last -ray has been taken, the nurse brings her a supplementary handset and plugs it in
She hands the handset to Lena
You really can't wait
(Defiant) No
Ernesto looks at her not knowing what to expect
Nonetheless, he remains seated next to her
Lena doesn't react, she doesn't care if he overhears the conversation, she almost wants him to
The brutal beating to which she has been victim is an inescapable reality that gives her an edge over Ernesto, an edge of which she intends to take advantage
She is wounded, but she is no longer afraid of him
She rings Mateo's number
They greet each other
Hello, Mateo
117 What's going on
Are you not coming
Not tonight
Has something happened
Something unexpected has happened, but don't worry, everything's
Tomorrow the shooting begins in the afternoon, will see you before then

Lena is sitting in front of her breakfast (or lunch), sullen, pale, implacable, she doesn't move a single muscle of her massacred face
Ernesto Senior is all sweetness toward his victim
Lena begins to pick at her food, listless, in silence, in order to keep her mouth and eyes occupied
(Begs, sincerely) What would you like me to do
What can  do so that you will forgive me
(Seriously) Take me to the studio
You shouldn't move
If you don't take me, 'll go there myself, even if have to drag myself
Her face is still covered in bruises, on her cheekbone and around her eyes
119 At some point someone from the hired help appears: "Sir, Madam, do you need anything else
"
"No, you can leave us alone,  have already told you this, for God's sake
" Ernesto Senior responds
The servant quickly vanishes
Lowering his tone: And what will you say
how will you explain the cast on your leg and the bruises
Lena appears implacable throughout the conversation
It's up to you
To me
will do whatever you ask, as long as you promise you'll stay with me
will stay, under the condition that you let Mateo finish the shooting, according to what he decides
He will barrage you with questions, that guy's not stupid
will tell him  tripped
And how will you shoot, if you can't walk
don't know
Whatever Mateo decides, but  want to rest assured that you will respect his decision, no matter the cost nor the time that it will take
Is that clear

He weighs out his options and realizes that Lena has the upper hand

An enormous drip eats away at one of the corners of the room
Lena is sitting across from him, on a wheelchair, and seated on an ugly armchair, Ernesto Senior
Judit is also present, she's standing
They have just finished talking
Lena has told the version that she and Ernesto Senior agreed on
121 And that's it
Mateo looks at them in disbelief
Judit, still as a statue, waits for the others' reactions
Lena breathes, expectantly
And Ernesto Senior looks uncomfortable and insecure, he is used to being the one who calls the shots; the inverse role, that of listener, disorients him and puts him in a bad mood
Ernesto is prepared to support whatever you decide
(Containing his rage) Decide, what
can't move from one shot where you are walking normally to another one where you are wearing a cast
How long must you wear the cast
Three weeks
Mateo lets out a huff
(To Ernesto Senior) Can we stop for those three weeks
With pay for the team, of course
If there is no other option
( bit agitated)  hate stopping
Movies, when you pick them back up, are no longer the same
Looks at Judit and Ernesto Senior
122 (Dryly) Do you mind if  speak to Lena alone for a moment
It's not a question but a demand
Judit shoots him a look of recrimination, as if saying "This is not the moment for that", but she cannot do anything to stop him
Ernesto Senior is also not pleased (but he knows he cannot say no, and this irritates him even more)
He glances first at Lena, who orders him with her own glance to accept, and then looks at Judit, who warmly invites him to exit with her
For some reason, Ernesto Senior empathizes with that woman

1994 Judit and Ernesto Senior exit the office and hang around not far from to the door
They smoke, perhaps
They are both restless
They look at each other as if seeking some kind of understanding, despite their differences
And they find it
They are joined by their jealousy
At the other end of the warehouse, like a mirage amongst the shadows, Pina's loft appears, majestic, ramshackle and mysterious
Ernesto contemplates it without understanding it, but is affected by its presence
He is unable to understand the essence of this make-belief game, but it's the first time he begins to grasp its hermetic fascination

On the white skin of her thighs, like in an uneven print, various asymmetrical bruises stand out
Mateo touches with his lips on every one of them, kissing them delicately
Lena shudders
Be careful, he may walk in
Let him walk in
And he continues kissing her thighs until he comes close to her pubis
Lena lifts and/or caresses his head
Mateo lifts it to look at her
Tell me the truth
People don't fall down the stairs, that only happens in movies
Lena avoids giving a direct answer, but in her own way, she lets him know, somberly and urgently
Mateo, we must finish the shooting as soon as possible
Until then,  cannot leave Ernesto
Why not
He's a psychopath
What more proof do you need
cannot leave, 've made a deal with him
deal
What deal
124 have promised to stay in his house in exchange for his letting you finish the film, under your conditions
But  cannot ask you for such a sacrifice
You have not asked me
can't accept it either
(Pleads) Mateo, please
There must be another answer
What else
The only solution is that  continue to live with him until you finish the film
Can you take it
You don't have to think about that
What's important is that you finish shooting
Exactly what have you agreed to
've told you, to live under the same roof, with him in his room and me in mine
He doesn't have the right to anything more
And you think he will be content with that
125 (Angst-ridden)  don't know
but the sooner you finish shooting, the better
Come up with a reason not to pause

This sequence is supposed to be the one that follows it
) 126 She has just left the note when Julieta appears, she is dressed conventionally, but with some extravagant detail, something that garners attention
She bumps into Pina by the elevator, Pina does not know her
Julieta knocks on the studio's door (just as Pina had done earlier), she doesn't get an answer
She notices the note that Pina has just affixed on the door
She takes it down and reads it, much to Pina's bafflement, who has been watching her from the other side of the landing
After reading it, Julieta crumples it up
Pina cannot believe it
She remains motionless on the other side of the landing, because she doesn't trust the eccentric looking woman
(Indignant) Leave that note there
It's not for you
How dare you take it and crumple it
Julieta throws the crumpled note through the gap in the stairway and looks condescendingly at Pina while she approaches her, prepared to walk down the stairs
What do you have to speak to Ivan about, you whore
It's none of your business
am his wife
His wife has been admitted at a psychiatric hospital for twenty years now
Not anymore

Short sequences of the minute work done by each of the teams, as if assembling ballet pieces, all of it accompanied by a musical score: The
sets up the lighting for the shoot, the bulbs are lit, the filters applied, the interior of the camera cleaned, the film is loaded
The atmosphere is set
Pina in her bedroom, lying on the bed, with one leg in a cast, is relaxing, breathing deeply
The actress playing Chon jokes around with the costume team, they laugh
But no one pays attention to the others
Edurne, in a close-up, retouches one of Pina's eyes
The mouth as well
Chon stops laughing so that the hair-stylist may shape her hair
All the images are very brief
The score predominates, the ambient sounds of the activities of the different teams is heard more like a whisper
The scene must not last longer than a minute
This set of images serves to abridge time and to indicate that the shooting is in its final days, after a long journey
There will probably not be many images, but less: the bulb that lights, Lena's eye as Edurne retouches it, its blinking, its sadness
Chon's mouth as she speaks without pause, stopping only when lipstick is added
The film loaded, the hair fluffed
Lena lying on the rug in her dressing room, totally motionless, her eyes made-up and closed, doing breathing exercises for relaxation, her leg in a cast, etc

Chon is a Better Midler type, in her 40s, that kind of extroverted woman who at first glance appears chubby but isn't quite so
She is wearing designer clothes, despite the fact that her demeanor is direct and crass
Both of them, Pina and Chon, are tired and hysterical, which each one of them interprets in her own way
Pina opens the door and Chon enters
Even though they are good friends, the last thing Pina is in the mood for is to see Chon, much less an over-excited Chon with "problems"
(Whispers) What a drag
(she opens the door, in a languid, bored tone) Oh, it's you
(Reproaches, depressed) 've left you a thousand messages
Yes
Chon notices Ivan's suitcase in the middle of the foyer and looks at it as if she'd never seen a suitcase
And this suitcase
Judging from the tone, one would guess she could care less
But the script asks for her to inquire about the suitcase and she inquires
(Sounding bored, asleep) It's Ivan's

During this time, Lena has been keeping her end of the deal and continues to live with Ernesto Martel but, as much as she attempts to diffuse it, its effect has been devastating
She is very depressed
She can hardly hold herself up
Lena's state of mind and how it affects the shooting, makes Mateo feel impotent and guilty
(Distressed, maybe she'll cry)  am sorry
Don't worry, it will turn out
(Acknowledges) But don't know what more direction to give you
(Exhausted, hard on herself) You have told me everything, in every way possible

That we make a piece of crap of a movie told you not to agree to that deal
Lena breathes, grasping for a solution and for breath
She attempts to regain her strength
We can't let him have his way

She has once again recovered her strength and her lightness
Her low spirits have disappeared and she comes off thoughtless and impudent

She's so much better
Grab this one
Yes
Mateo smiles, satisfied
On the same table where the Moviola sits, Luis, the editor, has a notebook in which each page corresponds to a 134 sequence, numbered respectively
The sequences are divided by shots and the shots by the number of takes
Luis draws a circle around take number thirteen
Let's look at fourteen, it's even better
Luis, an editing assistant and Mateo, sitting in front of the Moviola, examine the footage
There is a palpable complicity between Luis and Mateo
Luis has edited all of Mateo's films, they have been colleagues for a long time
As with Judit, despite their differences, one can tell that Luis belongs to Mateo's artistic family

1994 Time passes
The characters are dressed differently
As they load the film and sound onto the Moviola, we hear Harry's voice-off
Only audio: 2008

We hear it over the running Moviola
When we finished shooting,  quickly selected all the takes for the film so that  could rescue Lena as soon as possible from the Martel house
The situation had 135 worsened, we could hardly see each other, he had practically kidnapped her
They were difficult days for everyone, but Lena insisted that  leave all the takes selected
then, we could leave
He hasn't finished saying this when we hear the phone ring
The assistant, phone in hand: (to Mateo) "It's for you"
He takes it, surprised, he is still staring at the Moviola screen
It's Lena
It's Magdalena
Is there something wrong
No
'm downstairs
've forgotten my money
have to pay the cab
'll be right down
He exits the editing room

1994 Mateo descends the stairs of Cinearte at a good clip, he wasn't expecting Lena's visit
He can sense something's happened
When he arrives at the foyer, he can't find her
The phone operator (ugly, but polite) at the reception desk tells him Lena is in the bathroom
136 111
'
1994 He enters the bathroom and finds Lena, barefoot, wearing only her bra and panties, cleaning wounds she's suffered on her face and legs
The surface of the sink is tainted with blood
Mateo looks at her, horrified
(She is no longer wearing a cast)
man's jacket lies on top of the counter, this is the only piece of clothing that appears in this scene
(Horrified) But
what has happened
We have had a brutal fight
At the end, he ripped my clothes off and my shoes and he threw me out naked onto the highway
The jacket belongs to the cab driver
You must give him a good tip, if it weren't for him don't know how  would have made it here
Mateo cannot believe his eyes
He hurls insults at Ernesto Senior
Lena's apparent composure is purely hysterical
112
1994 Mateo and Lena exit Cinearte
They enter a cab that is waiting for them
(To the cab driver) Take us to the nearest police station
137 No, please
We must denounce him, Magdalena
He will turn against you
The cab begins moving
Mateo gives the cab driver his address
No, not your house
We have to look after you
Let's go to a hotel
(Pleads) Let's leave Madrid
Mateo looks through his pockets, fortunately, he has all his credit cards on him
113
1994 Mateo and Lena are living in a bungalow zone on Famara Beach, a complex nestled between the beach and the foot of a mountain
It is a special and intimate place, like an enormous grotto, where the sky is its ceiling and the mountains one of its walls
Lena and Mateo exit a bungalow and get into a rented car, a red Opel Corsa, not in very good shape
138 114
'
1994 On the peak of a reddish rock, on Golfo Beach, Mateo takes photographs of the natural wonders surrounding him
Next to him, Lena contemplates the view
What Mateo sees with his camera: a) Wine colored rocks b) The yellow-green lake circumscribed by a rope that has become white, against the black sand
c) The black sand of the enormous beach, licked by the shimmering foam of the waves
d) The rocky walls enveloping the beach, eroded through centuries by the wind on the surface of which it has created peaks and valleys resembling the jutted edge of a watch cog
One of the images captures part of a wine-colored rock
Below it, the infinite surface of the black beach, licked by the white foam of the waves
In the backdrop, an immense limestone wall, its surface full of pit holes where the wind circulates
The sequence ends with a close-up of the click of Mateo's camera's shutter, opening and closing like an owl's eye
115
1994 Mateo-Harry and Lena pick up their photos at the store's counter
The owner of the shop hands them to him, he is an attractive and bohemian middle-aged man
Mateo opens the envelope impatiently, he wants to make sure that his photographs are, in effect, the ones inside it
139 He looks at the last one closely, the landscape with the rocks, the beach, the foam, etc
Somewhere on the vast black-sand beach one can make out a couple, their size is tiny compared to the immensity of the beach
The two are melded into a tight embrace
The beach is deserted
Mateo had not been aware of them when he took the photograph and is overtaken by his discovery
He shows it to Lena
Half-joking
Look
It's us
( thought it was empty) Mateo asks the bohemian Attendant for a larger print
116
,   ,
1994 They go through various traffic circles
Mateo comments that it is "the island of the useless traffic circles"
"That's part of its charm", comments Lena
117
1994 They stop on one of the stop signs at the traffic circle
In the center there is a huge mobile sculpture by Cesar Manrique, rocked by the wind
Mateo and Lena exit the car to take pictures of themselves
Their faces close together, their eyes happy
The sculpture turning around itself produces a strange screeching sound
140 118
1994 Many days have passed
Mateo's hair is longer and he appears more tan, the proximity to nature and the absence of a social life has also affected Magdalena's appearance, now much more savage, but also more serene and more humble
She is dressed in cheap clothing, which she has bought on the island (and which fits her marvelously) and her hair is pulled up into a messy bun
The photograph, enlarged, presides on top of a small table where Mateo writes
The picture is leaning against the wall
It's the only image inside the bungalow
The photograph is a clear metaphor for the mysterious quality of the island as well as of the isolation of Mateo and Lena and of their fusion
While Mateo writes, Lena cleans the dishes or she does the laundry in the bathtub
The two wear -shirts, comfortable and sporty clothes
(On the tape-deck one hears La Lupe singing:
"porque hay un hombre para cada mujer y una mujer para cada hombre, y nosotros somos, nosotros somos
la pareja" [because there is only one man for each woman and only one woman for each man, and we are, and we are
the couple])
Mateo and Magdalena, the couple
In the bungalow there isn't much furniture; there's a large couch on which they can lie comfortably, a short table, along with the wooden table on which Mateo writes
Some armchair and lamps
And a tape- deck
Cut to
141 119
1994 Engulfed by the couch, Mateo and Lena are absorbed watching, on a small television, a broadcast of "Voyage in Italy" (Roberto Rossellini's)
The scene they are watching is set in a place where a group of men are working on some excavation
The married couple (in the midst of their breakup), played by George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman, is on a tourist trip in that area of Italy and they have gone to visit the excavation
One of the technicians describes the delicate work that is involved in excavating part of a city that had been buried, centuries ago, by the lethal eruption of the Vesuvius
At that moment, the men who are working on the excavation begin, bit by bit, to uncover a couple, a man and a woman, sleeping in an embrace, whom the eruption had taken unaware, leaving them preserved in this position for centuries
Ingrid Bergman cannot stand the sight of this couple calcined in an eternal embrace
She compares it to her own marriage, destroyed by their lack of communication and by the absence of generosity between them
She walks away from the place, unable to contain her tears
The scene affects Magdalena and Mateo as much as it had Ingrid Bergman
Mateo and Lena instinctively embrace each other, seeking refuge in each other, their posture echoes that of the calcined couple
Suddenly, Mateo breaks their embrace
He positions the camera on top of the table where he writes, not far from where the image of the other "embrace" sits
He points it toward the couch and he presses the automatic button
And they take a picture together, locked in an embrace

2008 Harry and Diego, now completely cured, are sitting on a bench
Do you want to go back home and return to the "Donate Blood" story
am hoping to get back to it, but first tell me what happened in Lanzarote
You can't leave me hanging
Harry takes a deep breath
At this stage of the narrative, it is only understandable that Diego would want to know everything
But it pains him to think of what is still left to tell
Without realizing, a month had elapsed
knew that sooner or later we would have to return, but we kept postponing it
was only worried about you and your mother
had not even said goodbye and you were still suffering from your allergy problem when we left
can imagine Judit was furious with me
You can't imagine how much
was planning to return soon to finish the editing
and to explain things to your mother
But Magdalena decided she'd wait for me on the island
She couldn't stand the thought of seeing Ernesto again

1994 Mateo and Lena are walking toward the office for the bungalow complex
(Part of the previous dialogue is heard as the couple are approaching the office) 121
,
1994 Behind the counter there are two foreign employees, a man and a woman
Lena addresses them in English, while Mateo keeps himself busy at the other end of the reception hall, next to a table with magazines and newspapers
He grabs a newspaper
In English: Sorry to interrupt
wanted to ask if there are any employment opportunities available here, with you
You always look so busy
have a lot of free time
We could use the help, especially now that the high season is about to start
Do you have experience
have worked as a secretary at
Capital, a very important finance company
(Looks at her) You could first work during the afternoons and, then, we could see
144 With his back to the counter, at the other end of the reception desk, Mateo reads a newspaper, frozen
Suddenly, the employee opens a National newspaper and looks for a particular page
He shows it to Lena
On the Entertainment page, an ad for Mateo's movie (Opening Soon)
The ad is a close-up of her, in her role as Pina, in the movie
Lena is stunned
She can't believe it
We were just saying that the girl in the ad looks like you
Lena looks toward where Mateo is standing and she notices that he is as perplexed as she is, staring at the ad for a soon-to-be-released film in the newspaper
(To the employee) No
It's not me
They exit the office
122
1994 Mateo and Lena walk toward their bungalow as if someone were chasing them
They have just run into the very thing they have been attempting to escape in Madrid
was wondering how long it would take him to emerge
145 (Disoriented) But they can't release the film so soon, right
No
It's a scheme to annoy us, and a trap to get you to return
The ad is only lacking the words "Missing
" What are we going to do
Nothing
Fuck them
123
1994 : few surfers are preparing to go into the ocean
father and his young son toss their kites into the wind
Lounging on lounge chairs, on a cobble-stone area before one reaches the sand, Lena and Mateo-Harry are reading the news of the opening of the film in a National newspaper
They only have one copy and Mateo's eyes are transfixed on the news
The note accompanying the event says, in bold type: "The financier, Ernesto Martel, has managed to gather all of Madrid for his first film as a producer, missing are only its director and star
" Two pictures accompany the news of the event
Printed next to them, there is a review entitled, "Disaster
" Mateo throws the newspaper away from him, enraged
He refuses to read the review
146 The wind dishevels the newspaper pages
Lena rises and chases the pages that fly, like kites, slightly above the ground
In mid-flight, she catches the Entertainment page and reads it as she approaches Mateo, who watches the ocean, feeling impotent, furious, unable to quite grasp what is happening
Lena sits down next to him, still reading
(Disconsolate) What does it say
That the only intelligent thing we have done has been not to attend the premier, that my acting is pathetic, that you seem like a first-time director and that you lack talent
At the end, it wonders who might have made your first films
Never before has such a resounding downfall been witnessed
How horrible
Mateo rises and heads quickly for the bungalow, which functions as the office for the complex
Lena follows him, alarmed
What are you going to do
124
1994 Cut to, directly to the shot of the telephone
Mateo has just dialed Judit's number
He gets the answering machine, hearing Judit's voice encourages him to leave a message
"Hi
You have reached Judit 147 Garcia's voicemail
Leave your message after the tone and  will return your call as soon as possible
" Mateo leaves his message
(Dryly) Judit
It's me
hope you and the boy are apologize that  left without notice, but terrible things have happened,  will explain
Speaking of which,  need to talk to you, urgently
Please call me
Here's the number
(Asks one of the employees) Oh, and, ask for Harry Caine,  have registered under that name
(said almost as an order) will be waiting for your call
He also rings Luis, the editor
He also doesn't answer
He leaves Luis a shorter and more violent message
Luis,  just read in the newspaper that the film has opened and  am beside myself
don't know what the fuck is going on there, but  would like to know
, 'll ring back
He looks at Lena, breathless, his face contorted from sheer helplessness

Harry is standing, pacing back and forth
Diego stands next to the bookcase
The drawer with the photographs is open
148 He looks at the photograph of the traffic circle and at the one of "The embrace" on the black sand of Golfo Beach
He has taken them out of the large brown envelope
At the bottom of the drawer one can begin to see Luis' (the editor) notebook
Diego is holding a Dymo label machine, (this Dymo has appeared in previous scenes) with all of its keyboard buttons, corresponding to the regular alphabet, in Braille
He is writing, in Braille, "Famara  Lanzarote 94" so that he can stick the raised title onto the old envelope
And mom, did she call you back
No
(Can't understand, he's almost indignant) Why
She was pissed,  suppose
remember that time, it was while  was undergoing treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis
It was a horrible time for me
Not just because of the illness, my mother was like a crazy woman
had just seen "The Exorcist" and, for some time,  believed she was possessed
(Smiles pathetically)  was the demon, Diego
And am sorry
suppose  behaved selfishly, but  am not sure  had a choice
Diego thinks about this
149 (Emotionally exhausted) No matter how upset she was, she should have alerted you to what was happening
The fact is she never did, and we've never spoken of it
Neither one of us has broached the topic
(Surprised) And you weren't curious
(Emphatically) Me
Curiosity was killing me
For two days  called both your mother and Luis non-stop, the editor (says it agitated), but neither of them answered
So  decided to return to Madrid the next day so that  could witness what was happening for myself

1994 (Night falls while they dine
) Mateo and Magdalena dine at "El Mirador," a local restaurant with spectacular views
Their table is beside a long sliding-door window that overlooks the valley
group of rocks seem to grow next to the window as if they were plants made of stone
The view of the valley is breathtaking
There are few patrons inside the restaurant
Perhaps a foreign couple, sitting far from Lena and Mateo
waiter brings their first course
They are drinking wine
Lena appears melancholic and fearful
How did you meet Ernesto Senior
150 (It's not a topic she likes, but she doesn't hesitate to answer
)  was one of his secretaries
And
how did you end up with him
You fell in love
He was very generous with me and my family
My father was dying,  needed to take him to a private Hospital and Ernesto took care of everything
He paid for everything
And he made sure that my parents could return to their home town and that they lacked nothing
Mateo imagines the situation, it upsets him
He is perturbed by the very idea of Lena's past with Ernesto, but he doesn't want to upset her on the night before his departure
They have gone out to dinner with just the opposite intent
(Lovingly) Pardon me,  have no right to ask you about that time in your life
It's only natural that you would want to know
And don't want any skeletons between us
(Unguarded) would like to be able to forget all that, but you have the right to ask
(Assuring her) No
do not have any right
For me, you were born the day you came for the audition
You looked at me,  saw your face and
was left hypnotized
Lena smiles
She is both comforted and relived by remembering that moment
151 remember your face perfectly
think  fell in love with the way you looked at me
thought: this man will be my salvation
Mateo is moved by her use of those terms to speak of their first meeting

1994 They exit in an embrace and head toward their car, parked nearby
They kiss before they get in the car
We notice another car which we will have the occasion to recall in the future, the camera gives it just a passing glance
(Childish) It's the first time we part
(Pampering) Either way,  will return next weekend
But if you are going to be worried, you should come with me
No
will be better off here
And she smiles, as if the worry has already passed, so as not to disquiet Mateo

The full moon allows us to glimpse through the darkness of the landscape

Show the highway illuminated by the headlights and the landscape as it appears to its left and right
From inside the car, one can see the mobile sculpture of Cesar Manrique at a distance
(Very insecure) And did  manage to save you from anything
(Enigmatic and unwavering) Yes
Lena does not elaborate on the dangers that Mateo has saved her from, he doesn't understand them exactly, but he likes to hear her say so
They approach the traffic circle
set of lights first betrays the presence of a car that appears from the left
Mateo yields to it, and briefly kisses Magdalena on the lips
Mateo continues on his way, a short instant later, as he enters the traffic circle, an  moving at full speed crashes into them
153 Everything happens very fast
From inside the car, without any particular attention to Lena or Mateo, the screen fills up with light, noise and darkness
All the different noises form a deafening magma
At the center of the traffic circle, Cesar Manrique's sculpture rotates, propelled by the wind
In any case, we will also shoot the crash from the outside
And although it will not be obvious at first sight, the back side of Mateo's car is illuminated by the headlights of a car that we never quite see, but which has been a witness to the accident
128
1994
The huge mobile sculpture by Cesar Manrique continues to rotate with the wind immediately following the collision
One can hear the screeching wheels of the  escaping from the accident scene
One also hears the sound of a second vehicle, which approaches and stops, and something that sounds like a door opening and a moan
The camera only focuses on the sculpture, swaying in the wind

Harry also says nothing

The entrance to a Hospital in Lanzarote
Through one of the windows, we can see Mateo's gaunt and nebulous figure resting on a bed, his head bandaged

Just as in the beginning, Judit is next to Mateo's bed
She is holding his hand and begs him: Mateo, say something
Mateo is dead, Judit

Through the window we can see the local surroundings
The walls are a pastel color, green or blue, an aquatic color, and they have various spots where humidity has seeped through
Other than the psychiatrist, there is another doctor present, explaining the situation to Judit
We call him by his name, but he doesn't respond to it
He insists Mateo has died
Images are the source of his work
and to live in the dark,  suppose that's death to him
Is there any chance he will see
None
His is what we refer to as a cortical blindness, and it's irreversible
It's the result of a lesion to the occipital lobe, the intelligent part of the brain, which has the role of processing all visual information
In other words, the neurons have died
and that's permanent

felt as though  had died with Lena
The Mateo- film-director who had left Madrid would never return
Days or weeks later
156 Judit exits the hospital, with blind-Mateo (he's hidden behind black sunglasses), now without the bandages or very few, and with little Diego (eight years old), holding hands
Mateo walks tentatively and slowly
He will probably be aided by the typical blind man's cane
They get into a car that is waiting for them
Judit instructs the driver to take them to Famara Beach, to the bungalow complex
134
1994
(This is a good opportunity to show some of the more dramatic landscapes of the island
The lava sea, black and twisted, and the rented car that crosses it through the highway that divides it
Or "La Geria" and its vine stalks buried in half-spheres of black dirt to protect them from the winds
The green palm tree fronds flop around against the backdrop of this black-dirt landscape
) Inside the car, Mateo asks Judit: Did you visit Lena's mother at her hometown
Yes
What did she say
She was very thankful to Ernesto for having taken care of everything
157 That's it
Yes, they buried her next to her father
Did you visit the grave
Yes
Mateo nods in defeated acknowledgement

1994
The car stops in front of the bungalow that functions as the "Reception Desk" for the complex
Judit and little Diego exit
Judit helps Mateo out
Mateo remains glued to the ground
He can't move
Judit stares at him
Even though Mateo had renounced being Mateo, he has inherited his most painful memories
Being near the  bungalow, and thus near the bungalow where he lived with Magdalena, generates some kind of spasm in him that keeps him from moving
He feels an intense heat (inside and outside of him), as if he were approaching a bonfire the flames of which would slowly scorch him, were he to move
(Perhaps we'll have to inlay the image with the flames of an imaginary conflagration)
The face contorted
What's wrong
158 (Weakened) You go
can't
'll wait for you on the beach
The idea excites little Diego
also want to go to the beach
He approaches Mateo and instinctively grabs his hand
Judit watches the couple
The situation unfolds before she can stop it
Do whatever you need to do
We'll wait for you there
Judit is worried about the wind
She buttons Diego's jacket and wraps his scarf around him
She does the same thing with Mateo
Bundle up
And don't get too close to the water
(To little Diego) Don't let go of his hand
Little Diego grabs Mateo's hand
Despite the wind, the boy is excited about the idea of going to the beach
He has just become Mateo's guide and Mateo lets him guide him, like a somnambulist

In the offices of the complex, the two employees are in the middle of a brawl
(Consult with the original) In front of the desk, Judit addresses one of them, in English
159 am here to pay Mateo Blanco's bill
We don't have anyone here registered by that name
Judit gestures that she doesn't understand
It's the man who had the accident
He was in bungalow number two
Oh, you mean Harry Caine
Yes, of course
Poor souls
They are not the first to have an accident on that traffic circle
Awful
137
1994
Mateo and little Diego walk only a few meters past bungalow number two, where he lived with Magdalena
At that moment they are walking facing the wind, a fierce wind that threatens to tear off their clothes
It is as if nature itself wanted to keep Mateo from walking away from the bungalow where he loved Lena
From this point on, his life will become just that, an endless battle against the elements and against the memory of Lena
160 Little Diego's voice distracts him
Look
There are kites
At times little Diego forgets that Mateo cannot see
So he points toward the sky of a nearby beach, whose surface is dotted by various kites
Mateo is grateful for the life-affirming sound of the boy's voice and so he allows himself to be towed
The wind's violent sweep over all the different elements that compose the landscape creates a symphony of strange sounds

Judit, using the key she was handed at the Reception Desk, opens the door to bungalow number two
She enters into what had been Mateo and Lena's love nest
She takes the entire space in with one glance; she is overtaken, as if she has entered an ancestral and sacred space
She imagines Mateo and Lena filling up the space with their presence
( strange modesty comes over her, but her curiosity is greater)
Lena's spirit (at least in Judit's mind) hangs in the air, but in the material surrounding her absence is absolute
Those who took her body did not leave any trace of Lena
Not a single object, not a single dress
Nothing
Ernesto Senior's cohorts (or Ernesto himself) took all of her things
Mateo's clothes and things are found piled up in a closet
Yet the table where he sat to write remains intact
On it, the photograph of 161 the embrace on Golfo Beach still rests, along with his notebook, blank pages and some envelopes
Judit observes the photograph on Golfo Beach as if it were alive, still palpitating
And she imagines that the two lovers, locked in an embrace, lost in the anonymous vastness of the black sand, are Mateo and Lena
She opens the desk's drawer and, much to her surprise, finds it overflowing with torn photographs of Mateo and Lena, shuffled in no particular order (one might say they had been thrown violently into the drawer
The violence of the hand that ripped and threw them has left its pulsating mark)
Judit picks up all the pieces, slowly and delicately, and she places them inside a brown envelope that she finds next to Mateo's notebook
Her sense of guilt is so profound that it dries out her throat and the expression on her face
139
1994
At the base of the complex, on one end of the beach, the car that brought them is waiting
Judit places the bags with Mateo's belongings, which she has just carried from the bungalow, inside the trunk
She raises her head, emotionally exhausted
From where she stands she can see little Diego, ecstatic, in front of a group of surfers wearing brilliant colors traversing the waves and a group of kites (around eight or ten) darting through the sky like flying fish
Mateo is motionless, in front of the sea, soaking up its strength
Judit's pain is at odds with the boy's joy and the overwhelming vitality that the place exudes at that very moment
162 She begins to walk toward Mateo and little Diego
Once she is a few meters away, she observes a surfer riding a wave
In the foreground of her line of sight stands Mateo, out of focus
As he comes into focus, Judit yells out to him: Harry
Harry Caine
It seems as though she is invoking the wind (a hurricane) which moves the waves along with the expert surfers riding them
When he hears Judit's voice, Mateo turns to face in her direction and : We're here, Judit
(And raises his hand like a child) Judit approaches them, petrified with emotion
The wind tears tears from her eyes
We have to go, Harry
(To the boy) Let's go, Dieguito
Give me your hand
(Protests, politely) Can't we stay a little longer
No
We must obey your mother
You've had enough wind for one day
But 'm already all better
163 Judit walks in front of the blind man and the boy, her eyes glitter
Mateo has responded to her call, and that has filled her with uncontrollable emotion
At this very moment she decides that she will dedicate her life exclusively to the care of this man
This is how it will be

He sticks on the Braille title, "Famara
Lanzarote 94
" In front of him, spread on the floor like a puzzle, lie the pieces of various embraces between Mateo and Lena (like archeological finds, like the Minoan paintings in Crete)
The pieces begin to join with one another, an order is established and, soon, the better part of the picture is clear
There are four photographs where, regardless of the missing pieces, one can make out the image
Two are of embraces and the rest are of domestic scenes
The scratches on the four photographs reveal the passing of time

On the spines, the titles are written in Braille
He has already asked him what he would 164 like to watch (he reads off some titles; in general, all the movies are made prior to '94, all classics)
Play "Elevator to the Gallows" and take a look at the ending
While he looks for it
Do you always watch the same movies
Yes
Since  know them by heart,  can visualize the action
Is there any new movie you'd want to see
Yes
But you'd have to describe the action
Your mother used to describe some to me, some time ago
wouldn't mind doing so
would like to "watch" one by Tarantino or Scorsese, and also some Asian cinema

They pick a movie (chosen by Mateo)
Diego hooks up the television, then inserts the

In front of the television, having heard only those two phrases, Harry jumps up as if propelled by springs
That's "Girls and Suitcases"
Diego observes him and then looks at the television
166 Yes
Turn up the volume
Sitting on the floor, next to the television, Diego turns up the volume
Harry focuses on the sounds from the screen and Diego on everything else

Chon enters
(They are supposed to be good friends)
Chon has an endearing appearance, she is a little chubby, well dressed, according to her age (forty) and her profession, a Counselor for Social Affairs
Spontaneous and direct (she is kind of a Bette Midler in her forties), but the actress is lacking grace and her restlessness reveals more about her fear of running into the moving camera, than about the very funny way that the character inhabits her own anxiety
Lena is also quite languid, lacking spark, tired and unenthusiastic
(As a comedy, it's without charm and, as a drama, it's uninteresting, that's what the critics said)
(Reproachful) 've left you a thousand messages
Yes
thousand from you, and none from Ivan
As if Ivan's phone call depended on Chon

Harry twitches around in his chair, anxious and impatient
He doesn't like what he hears

(Sees the suitcase sitting in the middle of the loft
Looks at it as if it were some strange insect
) And this suitcase
It's Ivan's
He's leaving me
And the cast on your leg
His ex-wife, the crazy one
She pushed me down the stairs and  broke my leg
All said without any spark
The actresses are reciting the text mechanically and they appear tired of interpreting it
Wow
Well, we're in good shape
also broke up with my husband

2008 168 Diego and Harry are still staring at the television
Harry with his ear turned toward the screen, disappointed and tense
Diego is more indulgent of the scene
(Annoyed) They're terrible
Each of the men focus their respective senses on the television screen
How could  have thought these takes were the good ones
What was  thinking
With the same fury with which he had thrown down the newspaper with the bad review of his film onto the sand, he abruptly shuts off the television monitor
He remains suspended for a few moments, as if trying to find an explanation for what he has just heard
Was he so caught up in Magdalena's problems that he was unable to distinguish when a take was good or bad

The next morning, Harry wakes up early
He has spent an entire night thinking about the same thing
Dressed in a bathrobe, but not showered yet, he walks over to his desk
169 All these scenes take place in the dark
faint light from the breaking dawn enters through the corners of the drapes that cover the windows
He opens the drawer with the photographs
(When Diego had opened it before, we had been able to see that along with the photographs there were other objects, for example, Luis' notebook (the editor)
Diego had not mentioned any of this to Harry)
Harry pokes around in the drawer with his hands, finds the notebook
He grabs it
He opens it on top of his desk
He touches the different pages
The tips of his finger tips run over the numbers corresponding to the sequences, the shots, the selected takes, attempting to find a message

Harry walks over to Diego's room with the notebook in hand
The boy is naked, drying himself with a towel after his shower
Harry asks permission to enter
May  come in
(Drying himself) Yes, come in
Not giving him time to get dressed, Harry hands him the notebook
Luis, the editor, sent it to me six years ago
At that time  didn't even bother to open it,  didn't want to know anything about him
am now thinking 170 that perhaps he had something to tell me
Would you mind seeing if beyond the takes and all of that there is something else written
Diego looks through it carefully
The last pages are empty
The rest only have the numbers pertaining to the sequences, the shots, and the selected takes, like we have seen in the sequence with the Moviola
Although, there is something written on the last page
"My new number: 91 6994079
" At the end he says this is my new number, a number's written down
Harry hands him his mobile phone
Call him, please
Right now
It's too early
It doesn't matter
Diego dials the number and hands the phone to Harry
May  get dressed
'm naked
Oh, 'm sorry
He turns around and leaves

He exits the bedroom and heads for his dark den
(On the phone) Could  speak to Luis, please

Oh,  am so sorry
had no idea
It was cancer
'm his widow
Who are you
Mateo Blanco
Luis edited all my films
(More serene) Mateo Blanco
Luis spoke to me about you
am his second wife
The one  know is Nieves, the first one
We married twelve years ago
(Sincere and sorrowful)  am sorry to hear about Luis' death
would have liked to speak to him
He would have liked so too
Once he was quite ill and didn't want to speak to anyone, he would always tell me that, if it was you,  should hand him the phone
Harry keeps silent
172 You have no idea how sorry  am

Diego is in the kitchen
He is preparing breakfast, both for himself and Mateo
Harry, heavy-hearted, approaches the kitchen, pensive
half-hearted "happy birthday" escapes Diego's lips
Harry doesn't react, perhaps he hasn't heard him
Noticing the look on his face Diego is not eager to insist
What's going on
My editor
just found out he died six years ago
Diego remains silent and lets Harry continue talking
Not long before he died he sent me this notebook
But didn't want to know anything about him,  also didn't know he was dying
and  put it away
until today
His wife just told me he would have liked to speak to me, that was the purpose of sending me the notebook
but  didn't give him the chance
Had you spoken since the accident
173 No
Never
Diego places plates with toast and juice on the table
He serves Harry some coffee and adds sugar
The coffee is in front of you
Harry finds the cup easily
Are you
Would you like me to stay here
No, no
You're heading out
My mother arrives today
would like to be home when she arrives
didn't know she was arriving
didn't either, she left me a message this morning
She's coming to celebrate your birthday, with us
It's my birthday
It seems so
Today's the (he tells him the day), does that sound right
Yes

Judit returns from location scouting
She enters her house
She hugs her son, effusively
She drops a large suitcase, with wheels
(The sequence takes place in various rooms in the house
From the foyer she should move toward the bedroom or the kitchen, where she makes herself some tea, or where she opens bags full of food that she's brought, typical to the region she's just visited
(She looks inside the refrigerator and doesn't find anything)
Things like that
was dying to see you
Are you , my son
Yes
was very worried about you
Mateo has looked after me day and night
Mateo
You're not calling him Harry
Diego had not realized
Yes
175 Today's his birthday, we must get him something
What have you been up to all this time
Nothing
Watching movies
and talking
(As if it were something strange) Talking
Yes
What about
Mom, please
Judit looks at her son
She finds him different
As if all the confidences shared with Harry had left a physical and visible mark on him
Diego seems to guess what his mother is thinking
So what happened to you
(Sort of joking) don't know if  should believe the thing about the stomach flu, you two used that as an excuse in a script
(Elusive) ( suffered)
an accident
But  would rather not speak of that right now
(Irritated, by the surprise) What kind of accident
It's hard to explain
(Orders him, annoyed) Try to
am not that stupid
176 Let's leave it for another time, yes
am all well now
Judit gets the sense that she can no longer speak to her son in the same way that she could before she left on her trip
Those two weeks have irreversibly changed him
What's wrong with you, Diego
Nothing
'm doing just fine
'm going to buy a present for Mateo
(Repeats) For Mateo
Alright, Harry
(Offended, she doesn't want her son to think she is a drag, so she makes an effort not to bombard him with questions) Call him however you wish
That's the advantage of having two names
Diego disappears and leaves her in mid-sentence
(Is this his way of avenging himself
Perhaps his reaction is unfair, but he cannot stand to stay there with his mother, answering thousands of questions regarding an "accident" when there has been another "accident" that he is much more intrigued by and that she has kept silent for fourteen years

Mateo and Judit talk, they are sitting on a sofa, the conversation is already mid-way
Thank you for looking after Diego
don't know how to thank you
You've been looking after me for fourteen years now
Judit brushes his acknowledgement off, with a half-smile
178 've found him somewhat hostile
He left without telling me what it was that happened
Will you tell me
don't know
It should be your son to tell you
Judit is upset by both of their evasiveness
What is wrong with the two of you
Why is it that he suddenly is not calling you Harry but Mateo
(He evades the first question, but responds to the second one
) Two weeks ago, at the place where he 's, by mistake, he grabbed a friend's drink that had been spiked with
, liquid ecstasy
He thought it was his drink, both drinks had Coca-cola
Liquid ecstasy
Yes
It's a very dangerous drug when it's mixed with alcohol and Diego had already had two Cuba Libres before he drank from his friend's glass
And
what happened
exactly
(Being vague
) He was badly affected
He spent two days in urgent care, after that,  brought him here
Judit looks at him, horrified
She can't seem to comprehend such a turbulent and simple story
179 Diego's a drug addict
No
've told you, he drank from the glass containing liquid ecstasy by mistake
But how can one make a mistake with something like that
At first glace one cannot tell the difference
Both glasses contained Coca-cola
It's not the first time it happens
Judit sighs, defenseless and horrified
Diego has not told you so that you wouldn't be alarmed
(That  wouldn't be alarmed
) Well, he hasn't succeeded
At some point he will have to speak to me, no
He is wanting to do so
Judit takes a cigarette out of its box and lights it
Is that so
Because  ask him and he doesn't answer
Then you should try answering him, when he asks you
180 Judit smokes in silence, she is curious to know what Mateo and Diego have been talking about in her absence, but she doesn't dare ask Mateo
The two of you are acting very differently
Both of you
You both have changed
She laments it, as if she had been put aside and they had not taken her into account

Judit and Mateo are having something to drink
Mateo tilts his head subtly in front of Judit
You smell good
(Insecure)  have put on some makeup and  am dressed as a woman
What's the dress like
Judit describes it, with few words and almost shyly
181 And the hair
How are you wearing your hair
It's been so long since 've asked you that  don't even know whether it's long or short
The fact that Mateo betrays that type of interest flatters and disconcerts her
haven't changed much, Harry
am wearing my hair short
Short like Jean Seberg in "Breathless"
Like Joan of Arc on the bonfire
Like Liza Minnelli in "Cabaret"
Or like Yul Brynner
Short, or rather, very short, like that of all fortysomethings who want to appear younger
am sure it looks good on you
Thanks for dressing up for me, Judit
Diego looks at them, amused
He hands Mateo three DVDs (Scorsese's "Goodfellas" (or the Coen Brother's "Fargo"), Tarantino's "Kill Bill," and Kiarostami's "Taste of Cherry")
Near them, on the bar table, two couples talk excitedly as if they were about to go on a ride at an Amusement Park
The barman tells them they may now enter

2008
182 Once they've crossed the doorway, a man signals them to follow him
He's a blind man that, like Mateo, moves smoothly, he knows the place by heart
The restaurant is completely shrouded in darkness, all the waiters, men and women, are blind
The one in charge of Mateo, Diego, and Judit introduces himself: My name is Javier
How many are you
Three
There is not a single light inside
The following sequences take place in absolute darkness
Please, grab onto each other's shoulders and follow me in Indian-file
will guide you to your table
It's number eight
What is the idea here, Harry
We are dinning in darkness
You didn't know this, ma'am
(Anxious, feeling slightly ridiculed) No
You should have been warned, but don't worry
People get used to it after a few minutes

2008
They have arrived to their table, as signaled by the waiter
Table number eight
He tells them where to sit
Imagine that your plate is the face of a watch
Your silverware is at 9h and at 3h
Your glass at 1h
Bread at 11h
Each of them reaches for the objects as indicated by the waiter around an imaginary clock
Judit still believes this is some kind of joke and that the lights will come on at any moment and that something spectacular will appear before her eyes
If she had been able to see, she would have been witness to the very interesting scenes surrounding her
Two couples kissing, with bestial enjoyment
And a well-bred woman performing fellatio on the man sitting next to her
No one sees them except our camera
Harry, what is all this about
The waiter responds
We want our clients to discover that the lack of sight harnesses the other senses
Touch, taste, smell and sound will acquire a special intensity tonight, ma'am
hope you'll enjoy them
184 Judit says nothing
She hides her nervousness in order not to ruin Mateo's night, he seems fascinated with the place and completely unaware of the process she is now living: the discovery of absolute darkness
bottomless pit
Will the gentlemen be drinking something
Bring us a bottle of wine, to toast
The waiter leaves them
Slowly, Judit begins to walk the plank that will plunge her into anxiety
The evening feels far from a party, but she doesn't want to spoil it for either Mateo or Diego
She hears Mateo explaining to : found out about this place in the newspaper and wanted to check it out
It's a German idea, there are various restaurant like this one, they're totally in fashion
(Can't believe what she's hearing
) Darkness, in fashion
don't understand
Silence
Judit pours herself some water and drinks
And she gets depressed, in silence
She lights a cigarette

Javier, the waiter, arrives with the wine
He tells Judit she can't smoke
She puts out the cigarette
(On the floor
) To enliven the occasion, Diego proposes a toast
Let's toast
Yes
Let's toast
Mateo pours the glasses
They each grab one
Clumsily, they bring them close until they can her the sound of the crystal clinking
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
We must look into each other's eyes
(She has already said it and it's too late when she thinks of retracting it
) Well, we're kind of screwed
Oh, sorry
It slipped
They attempt to clink glasses
It is not such an easy task
The three glasses head for each other in the darkness, it would have been easiest to have all three meet at the center, but instead each opts to find the other
Only Mateo puts his forward and leaves it in place, waiting for the other two to find his
When this happens, Judit's glass collides with too much force, breaks his glass and wine spills 186 all over the table cloth
Mateo attempts to make light of the situation, as if nothing had happened
He presses his fingers into the wine that has spilled on the tablecloth and exclaims: Joy
Joy
(to Judit) Bring your ear to me so that can sprinkle some wine behind it
It's for good luck
Judit attempts to heed his request, she leans forward, offering her head, parallel to the table
Mateo can't quite find her ear
Judit collapses
Her head topples onto the table, without strength, and she bursts into tears

Show both terraces, the exterior one and the glass-enclosed one
The sequence begins once all three of them (Judit, Diego and Harry) are seated and drinking
Judit's emotional state has not improved
The short sequence of events that she's had to live through since her arrival have been making her increasingly tense and worried
She is trying to combat the letdown by way of gin-and-tonic
(They are sitting on one extreme of the ellipsis that makes up the glass-enclosed terrace, decorated with cheesy Deco motifs)
At the center, where the bar is located, two or three waiters prepare to clean up the tables
Once in a while, they look over at the only three remaining clients
Once in a while, they are also able to catch Judit's words
And once in a while, the waiters function as the 187 audience, witnessing a theatrical production
Although on this occasion, the setting is real and so is the drama
Judit sips-down the gin-and-tonic quite rapidly
Mateo and Diego accompany her
Cut to
160
don't know what you've been talking about these past days
topic which they have waited to broach since she arrived from her trip
Neither of the two men respond, but they are both made uncomfortable by the comment
But  do know what  haven't talked to you about all these years
Mateo directs his face toward her, surprised and polite
've never asked you
But you must have asked yourself a thousand times
This is my birthday gift, Mateo
(To Diego) The gift is also for you, Diego
188 She takes another sip to draw courage, but she's already gathered enough momentum: (To Mateo) After you disappeared, Ernesto Senior thought only of his revenge
plan had occurred to him but, to carry it out, he had to bribe, at the very least, both Luis and me
It wasn't an issue, we both sold ourselves without hesitation
Luis and
With me, he had the courtesy to provide an alibi, he proposed that  leave for a month and a half to the United States, to the Mayo Clinic, so that Diego could undergo a cure for his aspergillosis, that way wouldn't have to be present while he destroyed the movie (because that was his plan, to make a mess out of the film)
opted to stay in Madrid and have Diego undergo his cure here
wanted to witness everything
If  was going to betray you,  wanted to pay the full price
What a living hell
For both of you
You said it
She takes a deep breath and continues: Yes
It was torture to watch Ernesto select the worst takes of each shot and Luis edit them together, turning your film into a monster (briefly tears
)
The only way of withstanding that was to suffer more
189 (Overcome)  sold myself to Ernesto because of my pain and jealousy
couldn't take it and  couldn't (then) forgive you for having abandoned Cinearte with Lena without saying a word
My betrayal was my revenge against you, against her and against myself
The only innocent one was Diego
(To Diego) Forgive me, my son, for the bitterness that you've had to absorb all these years
no one deserves to grow up like this
161
Judit rises
She approaches the bar table
She orders another gin- and-tonic
The waiter doesn't dare to tell her they've already closed, so he serves her
With the glass in her hand, Judit returns to the table where Mateo and Diego wait, expectantly
She has observed them whispering, but she hasn't heard what they have said
She sits down with them
Judit takes a sip
(Interrupts her) Don't continue, Judit
It's not necessary
Yes
Now that you once again call yourself Mateo, have no excuse
Judit takes a sip from her drink, to gather her strength
190 No one knew where you were
We had no idea
Ernesto Senior put everything together, the premier, all that ruckus, to see if you'd react
His revenge was pointless if neither of you found out about it
(Pauses) Ernesto asked me constantly if  knew where you were, but  said that  also didn't know anything, which was true
(Somber) That's why  never called you, but even if you don't believe it,  was very worried for you and the boy
believe you
Diego attempts to say that he, too, believes him, but Judit doesn't give him time
Ernesto hired various detectives to search for you, but before they found you, you called me, two days after the premier
(Slowly, debilitated
)  was too embarrassed to answer, and
too stunned
still am
When Ernesto Senior asked me again about you,  don't know why,  gave him the phone number for Famara
Mateo and Diego listen to her, with renewed attention
This new information reveals an unexpected possibility, something that neither of the two men had considered
Their reaction toward Judit's painful declaration changes in character
In Mateo's case, his compassion vanishes and is replaced by doubt, now incited by new suspicions
191 Ernesto sent his son to find you in Lanzarote
(Images of Ernesto Junior, inside a rented car, following the couple across various places on the island, including the highway that leads to Famara, on that last night
) He was the one who found you after the accident and called the hospital
Did he have something to do with the accident
No
But  can't stop thinking that had  not given his father the phone number, perhaps nothing would have happened
(Dryly) Why do you think that
don't know
(Categorically) If you don't know, then stop torturing yourself
He says this with spite and somewhat disparagingly
For Judit it's like a splash of cold water to the face
The confession, rather than ending as a liberating catharsis, has devolved in its opposite
The silence is weighed down by suspicion and the new abyss between Mateo and Judit
Never before has Judit felt Mateo this distant and antagonistic
Her dramatic confession, far from liberating her, has opened new wounds 192 and generated new suspicions
And Judit feels taken over by an arid anxiety, corrosive, unbearable
She almost can't breathe

She is glad that Mateo can't see her look of embarrassment
Good night

When the entrance door shuts like a resounding "no

Undone, and she no longer pretends otherwise, Judit returns to the car
Before she opens the door she bends over and retches violently
Diego gets out of the car and holds her by the waist
He attempts to help her
Judit's face is contorted
She wipes a thread of saliva still hanging from her lips
Despite the retching, she has not vomited anything other than liquid
(Touching her forehead) You are sweating
It's a panic attack
(Takes a deep breath, as if she had lost her wind) Hand me the purse
Diego finds the purse in the car and hands it to her immediately
Judit searches through the purse, impatiently
She takes the purse and drops all of its contents on the sidewalk
She find a box of tranquilizers
The pill she presses through the aluminum seal comes out with a pop; she places it on her tongue
She leans over the car
Diego looks at her, scared, he has never seen her like this

He wants to help her, but it doesn't seem like there is anything more he can do than what he already has
Judit attempts to smile in order to calm him
will sleep well with this
Do you want me to stay here
(Surprised) Here
What for
In case the panic returns, so that you don't feel alone
Judit eyes swell with tears
Thank you
am feeling better
and 'll fall asleep soon
Call me, if you are not feeling well

The next day
Standing over his desk, Mateo searches the desk drawer under the computer
It's open
There are not many things inside (credit cards, envelopes with money, a jump drive, the MP3, etc
), he goes through it meticulously until he finds the note that Ray  had left him the day he came to ask him if they could write a script together
Ray  has hand-written his own telephone number on the note
He goes over it with his fingertips, as if he could see through them
He dials a familiar number, Diego's

Diego's mobile phone vibrates four or five times
But Diego is sleeping and he doesn't wake up

In all the scenes where Mateo is alone at home, he never turns on the light
He will be in the dark, lightly illuminated by any light that the cracks in the windows let through

197 Diego is meticulously preparing breakfast for himself and Judit
He works hard to ensure that they both start their day with the help of a generous and varied breakfast, toast, juice, coffee and tea, marmalade, toasted bread spread with oil and tomato, etc
Judit appears through one of the kitchen doors, calm, with a look of having rested (but also with the hangover of having survived a nightmarish day, the day before)
Diego does not hear her approach
The mother takes advantage of this to observe her son with a tender smile
When Diego turns to look, the tenderness disappears a little, more out of modesty and a lack of habit
In any case, Judit enjoys the peacefulness of the moment: her son caring for her after the storm
Judit looks over the culinary display
How impressive
am specializing in breakfasts
would do the same for Mateo
Judit's expression changes, now a bit more somber
Are you
Yes, (still a bit beaten down) don't worry about last night
It's horrible, but it only happens occasionally and  know how to stop it
It scared me, it seemed as though an alien would pop out of your stomach
198 It's not a bad way of describing a panic attack
(Changing the topic, one can tell she's made the decision before she arrived in the kitchen)
Diego, there was one last thing  didn't tell you yesterday
Assuming it will be painful, he attempts to dissuade her: About Mateo
Yes
You can tell me some other time
Now it's time for breakfast
If  don't tell you now,  may never do so
At the end of the eighties, in `77, to be exact
The year of punk
Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and  became involved
In a love affair
Yes
We were just getting started in film, and we are still at it, but our love affair ended, at least on his side
That didn't keep us from working together
until now
knew all that, or  imagined it
There's one more thing
Mateo is your father
199 Diego looks at her, astonished
And that fleeting lover, my supposed biological father
You made him up
No
can hide things
but  never make things up
don't know how to make up
The fleeting lover existed, he was gay and our affair was short-lived
His name was Vicente and it was while  was with him that you were conceived, but your biological father was Mateo, not Vicente
Still thinking about what he has just heard, Diego places the breakfast on the main kitchen table and serves his mother a cup of tea
Judit begins to drink it, one tiny sip at a time
(Assimilates the news
He is not displeased) Does Mateo know
No
At that time, he asked me and  denied it, of course
didn't want to put pressure on him, didn't want our relationship to change because of it
After all,  had never asked him if he wanted to become a father
The pieces begin to fall together
see
200 If you think  made a mistake, don't tell me now
We have the rest of our lives for recriminations
Diego remains pensive for a moment
will not recriminate you
think  like being Mateo's son (the son of a bitch)
Speaking of, he called early this morning
Who
Mateo
At 8h
She looks at the clock and it's 11h
What did he want
For you to call him as soon as you could
(Surprised, tense) That  call him
Why in the world have you not awakened me
Because, after what happened last night, you needed to sleep
He didn't say it was urgent
You can call him now
Judit grabs her son's phone, agitated once again, and dials Mateo's number

In the beginning the shot is close up and so we are not aware of where he is
All one can see is a bit of a curtain, out of focus
Phone conversation
(Attempts to appear calm, since her confession her voice has a less authoritarian edge and is weaker) Diego has told me to call you
Are you
Do you need anything
(This is what she's most worried about
) (Almost with irony)  am not alright, Judit
And yes, do need something
The forty thousand meters of negative we shot during my last film in order to edit it
am at the home of Ernesto Junior and  just found out the material was destroyed in '94 imagined something like this,  just didn't think it would have happened that soon
(With urgency) Let me explain
(Cuts her off) No
am in a hideous mood, Judit, and  don't want to take it out on you
(Surprised and alarmed) What are you doing at Ernesto's house
202 The shot opens up, and we discover Ernesto Junior at the other end of the room, next to a 16mm camera (on a tripod) recording everything that Mateo says and does, while he searches around in some drawers
think  am going to bribe him
We need money, don't want Diego back at that damn bar
want to pay Diego a salary, we need money and he has money to throw

2008
The studio has a different configuration than when his father lived, but we recognize the place nonetheless; when the father was alive the space served a different purpose
Ernesto looks at Mateo fearlessly, he is still determined to search, urgently, for something inside the drawers of a chest
The place is a pretty big mess
Mateo, stop talking crazy
It is not craziness
can't think of anyone else to blame for Magdalena's death
My God
(She asks Diego to bring her the box of tranquilizers
) Wait a second
have something to tell you
Let it be, you already said enough last night
203 (She takes a pill and yells at him) Listen to me, Mateo
(As she raises her voice, she becomes dominant
)  was the production director, if you want to know anything about the footage, ask me
Since you insist,  will ask you
What do you have to tell me
In effect, Ernesto Senior asked for it to be destroyed
In '94
Very shortly after the release of that aberration
Yes
In any case, sooner or later the lab disposes of all the material
and that was many years ago
That's not anything that  don't already know
As the film's producer  was the only one who had access to the lab
to all the material
After  gave the order to have everything destroyed,  intercepted it
And  kept it
have all of it at home
You are lying to me
didn't tell you this last night because  didn't realize you wanted to edit it
took everything, all the double takes, the internegative, the sound tapes
Everything
You can have it whenever you want
The silence on the other end of the line reassures her
204 That changes everything
(Begs) Please, get out of that place, leave Ernesto alone
He had nothing to do with this
Mateo looks over at Ernesto Junior
The camera is still on its tripod, rolling
am not so sure
He has yet to explain what he was doing in Lanzarote
'll let you go, it seems he wants to talk
(Hangs up) Ernesto, finally, finds a
He has it in his hand and brings it toward Mateo
(His hand enters into view on the screen of the 16mm camera)
Here is a copy of "the making of"
And why would  want that
can't watch it
Plus, 'm not interested
Ernesto takes his hand and places the  softly onto it
Have someone you trust watch it and tell you about it
(This  proves that  wasn't responsible for the accident
) Oh, and even if my father had asked me to 205 harm you,  never would have
You are very important to me, Mateo
Ernesto speaks naturally, for the first time, Mateo takes him seriously

2008 Diego is watching the images of "the making of", while Mateo works out on his treadmill
At the last moment, an instant prior to being struck by the , Mateo and Lena kiss inside the car
They are then distracted by a noise from the car that is about to hit them
These images have been recorded from inside a different car, which has been following them from behind, at a safe distance (Ernesto Junior's car)
Mateo reaches the living room from the other end of the house, dripping with sweat
Diego has just watched the kiss and the accident
He rewinds and he pauses right at the moment when Mateo's and Lena's kiss fills the whole screen
Is there something new  should know about
(Surprised and moved) It's a very interesting documentary
And, yes, in effect, Ernesto followed you to Lanzarote, until the last moment
The images are there
206 Yes
Those of the last night
They take a look at the images that Ernesto taped at "El Mirador" from the outside
Through the glass of the large window we see Lena and Mateo talking
Yes
He recorded you at a safe distance, while you were on you way back after dinner
The scene is lit by the light of his headlights
It's not a lot, but enough to see what happened
Not only did he not have anything to do with the accident, he saved your life
Mateo watches the screen of the television without being able to see it, taking in the information Diego gives him
And one more e thing: When you were at the traffic circle, before the  crashed into to you, you and Lena kiss
kiss
don't remember it
It was an ordinary kiss, just one more of the many kisses a couple gives each other, almost without thinking
(Pensive) The last kiss
207 Yes
Even if it sounds cheesy, someone has to tell you: Lena did not die in your arms, as you dreamed, but the last sensation she experienced in this world was the taste of your mouth
Mateo watches without seeing the television, he gets close to the screen
With his fingertips, he caresses the surface, literally touching Lena's last kiss
Shots of Mateo's hand caressing the screen, with the image of the kiss
Shot of Diego observing the entirety of the scene, moved shot of everything
The appropriate kind of music accompanies the scene as it begins to fade out, bit by bit, while a sign appears: 177
2008 Luis' notebook, open on given sequences, as if Luis were present on this last moment of the definitive editing
An ashtray with a lit cigarette
The hands of the editor powering the Avid, directing the mouse through all the necessary steps until the screen fills with a block of sequences of "Girls and Suitcases," in Pina's loft
The images fill the entire screen of the main narration
It begins with the same sequence Diego and Mateo watched on television
Everything is the same, but it plays completely differently
The actresses are funny and fresh
The spectator does not know what the difference is, but, unconsciously, he must feel enthralled by the sequences of Pina and Chon, as if spellbound
208 178
"
" ' 2008 Pina limps (fed up) toward the door
Looks through the peephole, behind it, Chon
They are good friends, but Chon is the last person Pina wants to see right now
(Whispers
) What a drag
(She opens, not the least bit welcoming
) Oh, it's you
(Anxious, reproachful
)  have left you a thousand messages
Yes
thousand from you and none from Ivan
(Looks at the suitcase as if it were a menacing, strange bug
) What about this suitcase
It's Ivan's
He's leaving me
She notices that Pina is wearing a cast on her leg
And that cast on your leg
His ex-wife, the crazy one
She pushed me down the stairs
Well, we're in good shape
've also broken up with my husband
209 Oh, sorry to hear it
will make some coffee,  have spent my entire night looking for Ivan and  haven't gone to bed
Neither have
On her way to the kitchen Chon notices, through the bedroom door, that the bed has been burnt
She bumps into the phone that has been ripped out of its socket, now on the floor
She says nothing, she doesn't want to pry, but she thinks that Pina's situation must be more complicated than hers
179
'
2008 The chickens are living large, free to roam throughout the entire place
When did you leave him
Four days ago
could see it coming
The thing is that after breaking up,  go out onto the street and notice there is this "guy" looking at me
She also discovers the gazpacho on the kitchen table
(Voracious
) Oh my, gazpacho
Can  have a bowl
210 No
've spiked it with an entire box of downers
How so
In case Ivan arrived, he loves gazpacho
(Scolds her
) Pina, my God
Throughout the conversation Pina makes coffee and prepares a tray of Fornassetti cups and the whole bit
And that's not all
Since he wasn't calling, 've torn the phone from the wall, in a moment of rage
've tripped on the thing, but  didn't want to pry
And the bed
think  noticed it smoking a bit
dropped a lit match and it began to burn, and didn't want to squelch it
Fire purifies
will have to change the mattress, but all for the best whole lot of less memories
Chon looks at her friend
But excuse me, 've interrupted you
You were telling me
She grabs the tray, now full with coffee and pastries
211 Let's have breakfast on the terrace
The two women head for the terrace, which sits in front of the beautiful backdrop curtain of Madrid
180
'
2008 Chickens and rabbits, running around
Lots of plants, etc
An idyllic and false image
Only the feelings are authentic and the women's happy disposition for living in hysteria
(Struggling with what she's about to say
) Yes was telling you that  also have a suitcase at home
Your husband's
No
It's a suitcase with fifteen kilos of cocaine, uncut
Pina's eyes open wide
You've become a dealer, Chon
No
How could you think that
am still a Counselor for Social Affairs in the City Hall
The suitcase appeared in my closet
Imagine the scandal if the police find out
They could put me in jail
212 Certainly
have to get rid of those fifteen kilos as soon as possible
(Thinks
) Because of the hours we keep, politicians consume a lot of drugs
So, between my party cohorts and city hall,  could distribute two kilos, but what do  do with the rest
Throw it out
Are you crazy
How could  throw it out
have to keep the police from finding it in my house
have to take it some other place, immediately
But  don't understand
(Interrupts
) Well, it's clear, honey
(Finishes her question
) How is it that the suitcase appeared in your closet
(Drinks a little coffee, and takes a bite from a pastry
) As  was telling you, after breaking up with my husband,  bumped into this guy on the street who kept watching at me, good-looking, well hung
Summing up,  took him home and screwed him over and over
(Takes another sip of coffee
) An how was he
In bed
Divine
Look at my arm hair
've got goose-bumps
(She shows her the hair on her arm, 213 standing straight up
) He's that kind of guy who knows how to drive a woman mad with pleasure
So you lost your mind
What else could  do
So he asked me if he could stay at my place for a few days and  said , but couldn't promise anything
didn't want him thinking that  was that easy
So (breathes in) he brought the suitcase
He asked me if  cared if he kept it in the closet
He said that he was attached to the suitcase
And, well, why would  care
(breathes in) By pure chance,  am watching  last night and  find out that the police have nabbed him in the course of a drug sting operation and that he is one of the most wanted traffickers
open the suitcase and discover that it is filled with little bags of cocaine
ran out of the house and  haven't returned since
Pina breathes out in solidarity
What a story, my God
(Concluding
)  was wondering why he was such a good fuck
For men living in such high-stakes conditions, each fuck could be the last
(She reaches her arm out, again
) Look, the goose-bumps
Once again, she shows Pina her arm, hair standing straight up
214 've seen them already
They comes easy for you
(Changing topic
) And the suitcase
(Humble
)  was going to ask you
if you didn't mind that  brought it here
If they find it in my house, well, it's not about what could happen to me, but that it's just not an ideal situation for the Counselor of Social Affairs
Imagine how upset the mayor would be, and my party
My party can't take one more scandal
The doorbell rings: The police
Shush, how could it be the police
No one knows you're here
am a woman who attracts attention, Pina
Since was a little girl
Just pretend you're here for coffee
Pina limps toward the door, uncertain
(Behind it she will find new adventures)
She looks back, toward Chon, half-smiling, tired but charming, filled with understanding and a love for life, with all its emotions and its contradictions
It's with this half-smile on Magdalena's face that the sequence arrives at its end

2008 215 Mateo, Judit, Diego, and the new editor, somewhat removed from them, are seated in front of the editing table, they are both moved and entertained
This is hilarious
(Wants to be sure
) It doesn't sound like what we watched on , right
Not at all
This is a whole different thing
Judit is the one who is most deeply moved
She may cry, but this time her tears will be happy tears, welcome tears
It's wonderful, Mateo
We should re-release it
The important thing is to finish it
Films must be finished
Judit keeps crying
