By De Vincentis, Steve Pink, & John Cusack Based on the novel by Nick Hornby 9/11/98 London Draft Registered: WGAw '  - Not a minisystem, not a matching set, but coveted audiophile clutter of McIntosh and Nakamichi, each component from a different era, bought piece by piece in various nanoseconds of being flush
(
) What came first
The music or the misery
People worry about kids playing with guns and watching violent videos, we're scared that some sort of culture of violence is taking them over
Big thin LPs
Fields of them
We move across them, slowly
they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books
but then the 's start, and go on, faster and faster, forever then the singles, then the tapes
(
) But nobody worries about kids listening to thousands -- literally thousands -- of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss
It seems the records, tapes, and 's will never end until
we come to  -- always a hair out of place, a face that grows on you
He sits in an oversized beanbag chair and addresses us, the wall of music behind him
Did  listen to pop music because was miserable, or was  miserable because  listened to pop music
- Group of bags huddled next to the door
Not the go-on- vacation set, but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving out variety
Rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones
We hear what he is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time
, Rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately pulls the headphones off
She clocks him for a moment, catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment of nonpresence
She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to her, a little tardy for his big goodbye
Laura begins to cry a bit
don't really know what 'm doing
He smiles, and she doesn't
He adjusts
You don't have to go this second
You can stay until whenever
We've done the hard part now might as well, you know
Well stay for tonight, then
Laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs out the door
strap catches on a handle and the two of them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door open, until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and the door shuts behind Rob
He stays right there staring at the shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound of Laura and her dragging bags
Rob's left hand cranks the volume knob while his right switches the  changer to something loud and adrenal
He addresses us again
My desert-island, all-time, top five most memorable break-ups, in chronological order are as follows: Alison Ashworth, Penny Hardwick, Jackie Allen, Charlie Nicholson, Sarah Kendrew
Laura drags her bags, banging down the stairs -- ' Rob moves around the apartment, seeming to expand physically, looking for change as he continues
Those were the ones that really hurt
Can you see your name in that list, Laura
Maybe you'd sneak into the top ten, but there's no place for you in the top five
Sorry
Those places are reserved for the kind of humiliations and heartbreaks that you're just not capable of delivering
He adjusts the angle of the , stuffs a creepy family portrait into a drawer
That probably sounds crueler than it's meant to, but the fact is, we're too old to take each other miserable
Unhappiness used to mean something
Now it's just a drag like a cold or having no money
He moves through the living room to an open window facing the street
Looking down two stories, he sees Laura emerge from the building and drag her bags toward her car across the street
If you really wanted to mess me up, you should have got to me earlier
: -  - Rob and Alison sit on the bench, kissing awkwardly
(
) Which brings us to number one
Alison Ashworth
- The same shot, the next night: new clothes, same clumsy make- out session
(
) My relationship with Alison Ashworth lasted six hours
- Next night
(
) The two hours after school and before The Rockford Files, three days in a row
On the fourth afternoon
And the fourth night
(
) Kevin Bannister
Alison and another boy,
Kissing
In the background, Rob approaches and stops
He implodes with self- consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a casual gait as he mopes away
(
) It would be nice to think that since was fourteen, times have changed, relationships have become more sophisticated, females less cruel, skins thicker, but there still seems to be an element of that afternoon in everything that has happened to me since
All my other romantic stories seem to be a scrambled version of that first one
' Rob sits in his chair, a cord leading from the stereo to headphones draped around his neck
Behind him is the wall of music
Number two
Penny Hardwick
Penny was great-looking, and her top five recording artists were Carly Simon, Carole King, James Taylor, Cat Stevens, and Elton John
He lets the needle down on the turntable next to him
"Nobody Does It Better" by Carly Simon begins to play as -  - and continues as
, 16, is walking across the grass toward us
She's the clean, sporty, nice wholesome girl-next-door
She waves to off-camera friends, smiling a winning smile
(
) Everybody liked her
She was nice
Nice manners
Nice grades
Nice- looking
'  - Penny and Rob sit on the edge of the bed, kissing
Rob moves his hand up toward the breast, but the hand then seems to have a new idea, and dives south to follow the thigh into Penny's skirt
(
) She was so nice, in fact, that she wouldn't let me put my hand underneath, or even on top of, her bra
when he contacts skin, Penny rolls like a gymnast away and off of the bed, out of frame
Rob looks away balefully
- "Nobody Does It Better" continues as Rob walks Penny to her front door
She is smiling, he seems distant
(
) Penny was nice, but  wasn't interested in nice, just breasts, and therefore she was no good to me
And so  was finished with her
She leans in to kiss him, and he shrugs her off
What's the point
It never goes anywhere
Without looking at her, Rob turns and walks down the street, getting smaller
Penny watches for a while
: ""   -  - Rob sways with the other commuters
She cried, and  hated her for it, because she made me feel bad started dating a girl who everybody said would put out, and Penny went with this asshole Chris Thompson who told me that he had sex with her after something like three dates
How had Penny gone from a girl who wouldn't do anything to a girl who would do everything
looks up from his paper at Rob, then back down
- An old Chicago block of local merchants, on a busy street
Rob makes his way down the street, jangling a set of keys and talking to us
My store's right up here
It's called The Record Exchange
It's carefully placed to attract the bare minimum of window shoppers
Rob arrives at a storefront, and begins unlocking a rusty gate with two locks and then a beaten-down door
get by because of the people who make a special effort to shop here on Saturday young men, always young men, who spend a disproportionate amount of their time looking for deleted Smiths singles and "original not rereleased" underline Frank Zappa albums
- In almost darkness
More light might penetrate the windows if there weren't so many record-release posters taped to them
dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug
On the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to every noodling of Jah Wobble and Glen Glenn and other people you've never heard of
But as Rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church
The fetish properties are not unlike porn
would feel guilty taking their money if  wasn't, kind of, well, one of them
As he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back, he stops on a dime, steps back and pulls a  from the sea and replaces it almost the same position, but not quite -- meticulousness and pride in this gesture
After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting , a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth -shirt, a monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo
'Morning, Dick
Oh, hi
Hi, Rob
Good weekend
Yeah,
found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl
The one on Testament of Youth
Never released here
Japanese import only
Great
'll tape it for you
No, that's okay
Really
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls
etc
The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover
You didn't see the cover though
Yeah,  haven't really absorbed that one
Well, 'll just make it for you
(resigned) Okay
: - Dick is behind the counter, Rob in the aisles with a clipboard doing inventory
(re: music) What's this
The new Belle and Sebastian
Like it
The door flies open and , an acid-tongued post-punk rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to conceptualize his own rebellion, walks in
His teeth are clenched in air-guitar concentration and he's phonetically cranking a Clash riff: Dick shrinks back from him instinctively
He stops mid-step and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store
His face adopts an exaggerated grimace
Holy Shiite
What the fuck's this
It's the new -- It's the record we've been listening to and enjoying, Barry
Barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter, and Dick gets out of his way
Well that's problematic because it sucks ass
He pops the  out and frisbees it to Dick
(re: the ) Yours,  assume
Barry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in
"How to Kill a Radio Consultant" by Public Enemy comes through at through the red levels
(over the blare) ,
'
Barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears
Rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape
Barry's head pops out of the stockroom
What are you doing
don't want to hear Public Enemy right now
Public Enemy
All 'm trying to do is cheer us up
Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if care
don't want old sad bastard music either
just want something  can ignore
But it's my new tape
My Monday morning tape
made it last night just for today
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon
You should get out of bed earlier
Don't you want to hear what's next
What's next
Play it
Say it
(sighs) "Little Latin Lupe Lu
" Rob groans
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels
(defensive) No
The Righteous Brothers
Oh well
Nevermind
Barry bristles and moves slowly in on Dick
What
Nothing
No, not nothing
What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers
Nothing
just prefer the other one
Bullshit
How can it be bullshit to state a preference
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime
Since you brought that bullshit tape in
(sarcastic) Great
That's the fun of working in a record store
Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator
was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it
We'll do it next Monday
Well what's the point in that
From outside ,
Rob, Dick and Barry stop fighting to listen, then each moves purposefully to a spot in the store
Dick to the register, Barry to the back, Rob next to the door, as if bracing for a street fight
The  gets closer, then stops
The door swings open to admit  and , two fifteen-year-old skate punks
Vince's hair is post-apocolyptically hacked to different lengths, Justin's in uniformly shaven with leopard spots dyed browse
Rob follows them, watching their every move
Dick counters from his perch, getting another angle
Barry cracks his knuckles threateningly
Vince and Justin do their best browser impersonations
Finally Justin plucks a , and the two move to the counter
Hey
Didn't you steal that one already
Can  help you
Just this
That'll be fifteen-twenty-seven
Vince reaches into his deep pocket and pulls out a paper cup, with piece of paper attached that says "Please help me
'm retarded
"  He pours a mass of change and crumpled singles onto the counter
Dick begins counting it out
Isn't your name Dick
Yes
That sucks
Get it
Dick cracks a sad smile for a second
He bags the  and Vince and Justin are off
Rob walks back through the stock room door
: -   - Rob is on his knees, opening boxes with a razor knife
He talks to us as he works
'm sick of the sight of this place, to be honest
Some days 'm afraid -- Dick sticks his head in the door, looks at Rob, looks where Rob is looking (camera), and retreats back through the door
Rob continues
'm afraid 'll go berserk, rip the Elvis Costello mobile from the ceiling, throw the "Country Artists Male -" rack out onto the streets, go off to work in a Virgin Megastore and never come back -- He hears the bell on the front door , and he stops and listens, looks a bit worried
(
) 'm looking for a record for my daughter
For her birthday
" Just Called To Say  Love You
" Do you have it
(
) Oh yeah
We got it
Rob relaxes and goes back to work
(
) Great
Can  have it then
(
) No, you can't
Rob deflates, shaking his head
Barry leans back, elbows up on the counter behind him, talking to the , a middle-aged graying man in a raincoat
Why not
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not
Do we look like the kind of store that sells " Just Called To Say  Loved You
" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time
What's your problem
What did
Why are you -- Do you even know your daughter
There is no way she likes that song
Or is she in a coma
The Customer throws up his hands and starts out of the store
Okay, okay, buddy
didn't know it was Pick On the Middle-Aged Square Guy Day
My apologies
'll be on my way
He steps out of the door
'Bye
Outside, anger catches up to the Customer
He turns and throws up a middle finger -- -- and bolts
Barry smiles and turns to see standing in the doorway of the stock room
He feigns applause
Nice, Barry
Rob
Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's
Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins
"Is it better to burn out than to fade away
" You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry
We didn't even really have it happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk
"  was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny
Not the point
Oh, so what's the point then
don't want you talking to our customers like that again
"Our customers
" You think that Mr
Bean out there is going to be a regular
Rob's face begins to redden with anger
Barry, 'm fucking broke
know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop
Bullshit
The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway
Why not have a little fun
Big fucking deal
What did he ever do to you
He offended me with his terrible taste
It wasn't even his terrible taste
It was his daughter's
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker
You're going soft in your old age, Rob
There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street
Now all of a sudden 'm offending your golf buddy
(sarcastic) You're right, Rob
am so sorry
How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club
Rob is red and seething
And by the way,  tell you this for your own good: That's the worst sweater 've ever seen
have never seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone 'm on speaking terms with
It's a disgrace to the human race
Rob springs on Barry, grabbing him by the lapels and jerking him up against the wall
Rob is so mad he can't say anything
Hey, guys
Hey
Rob runs out of steam and drops Barry, who backpedals fast
(extremely shaken) What are you, some kind of fucking maniac
If this jacket's torn you're gonna pay big
Barry stomps out of the store
Rob turns and goes back to the stockroom, and sits on the stepladder
Dick appears in the doorway, terrified
Are you all right
Yeah
'm sorry
Look Dick, Laura and  broke up
She's gone
And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that
'Course  will, Rob
No problem
No problem at all
'll tell him next time  see him
Rob nods
Dick sets out into the uncharted conversational territory of interpersonal relationships
've ah
got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem
'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when  tell him the other stuff
Fine
'll start with your news before tell him mine, obviously
Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle (flashes  of pretty woman) playing at Lounge Ax tonight like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish
but, you know, good
So 'll tell him before that
Good news and bad news kind of thing
Dick laughs nervously
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight
mean, he liked Laura too,  didn't mean that
And he likes you
It's just that -- understand, Dick
Sure
'Course
Rob, look
Do you want to
talk about it, that kind of thing
Rob looks up at Dick, who is so nervous that his brow is wet
No
Thanks though, Dick
Dick sighs with relief, and smiles his way out of the stock room
: Rob to camera
Number three in the top five break- ups was Charlie Nicholson, sophomore year of college
Some people never got over 'Nam, or the night their band opened for Nirvana
guess never really got over Charlie
: -  - About twenty feet away we see a tall, thin beauty, bleach- blonde hair cropped short in darling '80's new-wave asymmetry
She is speaking animatedly to a , driving her points home with a forefinger
(
) She looked different
Dramatic
Exotic
She talked a lot, about remarkably interesting things like music, books, film, and politics
- younger Rob sits amongst a group of  who are engaged in a heated conversation
He is smiling, mouth closed, just happy to be there
Charlie sitting next to him, tousles his hair as she talks incessantly
(
) (over her talking) so we didn't have those terrible, strained sentences, that seemed to characterized most of my relationships
And she liked me
She liked me
She liked me
Charlie gives Rob a quick kiss and keeps talking
- Rob and Charlie walk arm in arm, Rob in cool clothes and sunglasses trying to look cool, Charlie making a point about something
Rob checks out how cool he looks with her as they walk by a store window
(
) We went out for two years, and for every single minute  felt as though was standing on a dangerously narrow ledge
couldn't get comfortable, couldn't ever stretch out and relax
Why would a girl -- no, a woman -- like Charlie go out with someone who only a few years ago sewed a Foghat patch on his jacket
felt like all those people who suddenly shaved their heads and said they'd always been punks
felt like a fraud
And  was depressed by the lack of flamboyance in my wardrobe
'  - The fabulous sophomore design student's studio apartment: White wood floor, white walls, overvarnished door, Doisneaux print on the wall, futon on the floor
Rob lies back on his elbows, watching Charlie in uncomfortable, worried awe
She stands, her back to him, wearing only her underwear and pulling on a -shirt -- a heartbreaking image to look back on
(
) worried about my abilities as a lover
was intimidated by the other men in her design department, and became convinced that she was going to leave me for one of them
Charlie turns around and looks at Rob with naked ambivalence
(
) She left me for one of them
The dreaded Marco
'  - It is  like crazy, and Rob is shouting up at a lit window, maniacally gesturing
The curtains part and Charlie's figure appears, clad only in a sheet
Next to her is a tall, built, handsome man, , also in a sheet
Eventually he falls to his knees with a splash and buries his head in his hands
The light goes out
(
) And  lost it
lost it all
Dignity, faith, fifteen pounds
- Rob wandering through the rain
(
) Any small idea of personal identity that  had acquired up to that point
- younger and catatonic Rob listlessly sorts through a stack of records
(
) came to three months later, and to my surprise had flunked out of school and started working in a record store
'  - Rob stands in front of his wall of music, shifting LPs around between the shelves and piles on the floor as he talks to us
What  really learned from the Charlie Debacle is that you gotta punch your weight
Charlie was out of my Class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much
What am
Average middleweight
Not the smartest guy in the world, but certainly not the dumbest
've read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time of Cholera, and understood them, think -- they're about girls, right
-- just kidding -- but  don't like them very much
My all time top five favorite books are Johnny Cash's autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil Stevenson, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser Press Guides to Rock, and,  don't know, probably something by Kurt Vonnegut
look through the New Yorker when my neighbor's done with it, and 'm not averse to going down to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles films, although on the whole  prefer American films
Top five being Blade Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first two Godfathers which we'll count as one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining
'm okay looking, average height, not skinny, not fat
My genius, if can call it that, is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame
You might say there were millions like me, but there aren't, really: Alot of guys have impeccable music taste but don't read, alot of guys read but are really fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards, alot of guys have a Woody Allen sense of humor but look like Woody Allen
Some drink too much, some drive like assholes, some get into fights, or show off money, or do drugs
don't do any of these things, really
If do okay with women it's not because of the virtues  have, but because of the ugly flaws  don't have
So
Charlie and  didn't match
After her  was determined to never get out of my league again
'  - Rob presses play on the answering machine
pleasant, older female voice is heard
It's , Laura's mother
(on machine) Hello, you two
Laura, it's your mother
Your father's angina is a little rough today and  thought he'd like to talk to you
No big deal
love you two
Bye
Beep
(on machine) Rob, it's Liz
Just calling to see, well, if you're okay
Give me a ring
'm not taking sides
Yet
Lot's of love
Bye
He pulls an  from a shelf, puts it on the turntable and sits back in his chair
-  - The  becomes  to the following scenes
Rob and , a thin, modestly attractive young woman, , walk and talk
They seem to be emphatically complaining together
(
) Charlie and  didn't match
Marco and Charlie matched
Me and Sarah, number four on the all time break- ups list, matched
She wore more or less the same clothes as mine, had an acceptable working knowledge of music, and she had been dumped by some asshole named Michael
He was her moment, Charlie was mine
Sarah had sworn off men
had sworn off women
It made sense to pool our loathing of the opposite sex, swear them off together, and get to share a bed with someone at the same time
'  -  - Rob and  sit up in bed, staring at the television
(
) We were frightened of being left alone for the rest of our lives
Only people of a certain disposition are frightened of being alone for the rest of their lives at twenty- six
We were of that disposition
Everything seemed much later than it was
'  -  -  ' of Sarah, sitting across the table, mid-confession
(
) When she told me that she met someone else it made no sense
Her meeting someone else was contrary to the whole spirit of our arrangement
All we really had in common was that we were dumped by people, and that we were against dumping
We were violently anti-dump
So how come got dumped
The  becomes  again, and Rob takes the needle off the record
You run the risk of losing anyone who is worth spending time with
But  didn't know that at the time
All  saw was that 'd moved down a division and that it still hadn't worked out, and this seemed cause for a great deal of misery and self- pity
And that's when Laura came along
'  - Rob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor
He looks to camera
'm reorganizing my records tonight
It's something  do in times of emotional distress
When Laura was here  had them in alphabetical order, before that, chronologically
Tonight, though, 'm trying to put them in the order in which  bought them
That way  can write my own autobiography without picking up a pen
Pull them all off the shelves, look for Revolver and go from there
'll be able to see how  got from Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty- five moves
What  really like about my new system is that it makes me more complicated than  am
To find anything you have to be me, or at the very least a doctor in Rob-ology
If you wanna find Landslide by Fleetwood Mac you have to know that bought it for someone in the fall of 1983 and then didn't give it to them for personal reasons
But you don't know any of that, do you
You would have to ask me to-- The phone rings again
Rob picks it up
Yeah
Hi, Rob
It's your mother
Rob deflates a bit
Hi, Mom
Everything all right
Great
Super-fantastic
How's the store
So so
Up and down
Your lucky Laura's doing so well
If it wasn't for her,  don't think either of us would ever sleep
Rob holds his lips together with thumb and forefinger, but succumbs -- She left
She's gone
What do you mean
Where did she go
How would  know
Gone
Girlfriend
Leave
Not say where gone
Laura move out
Well call her mother
She just called
She doesn't even know
It's probably the last time 'll ever hear her voice
That's weird, isn't it
You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and
dunno
Silence
There'll be another mom and another Christmas
Right
Silence
More silence
Hello
Anybody there
'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you
You know that's not what's upsetting me
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it
knew this would happen
What are you going to do Rob
'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch  and go to bed
Then tomorrow 'll get up and go to work
And after that
Meet a nice girl and have children
promise the next time we talk 'll have it all sorted out
knew this was going to happen
Then what are you getting so upset about
What did Laura say
Do you know why she left
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at
So you say
'd like to hear her side of it
Mom
For the last fucking time, 'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married
She is not that kind of girl
To use a phrase
That's not what happens now
Well  don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes
You meet someone, you move in, she goes
Silence
Rob busted
Shut up, Mom
Rob hangs up the phone
He fills up his glass again, takes a swig, and slumps into a chair
If there was any wind left in Rob, it just got knocked out
After a moment, he gets to his feet, grabs his jacket and heads out the door
: -
- Rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to enter the club
From inside he hears a , playing a tune that becomes familiar not only to Rob, but to us
When a strong, lilting female  begins to sing, we hear what it is: "Baby  Love Your Way," by Peter Frampton
Rob smiles at first, but begins to darken as the verse continues
He steps out of line and leans against the outside wall, listening
Is he beginning to cry
Yes, he is
: Peter
Frampton
That perm
"Show Me the Way"
phenomenon based on a live album that was actually recorded in a studio
What is happening
am getting misty, choked up at a song that  had the good sense at twelve to realize was so saccharine and stupid as to be inarticulatable, until Michael Bolton, that is
: -
He looks around self-consciously, and paces a bit, deciding whether or not to stay
He takes a deep breath, and heads in the door
- As Rob enters he looks to the stage, where   is standing alone with her acoustic guitar, heading toward the song's finish
Rob's expression begins to shift from the melancholy to something else altogether
Marie is beautiful, and Marie has touched his heart
Rob navigates toward her though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen
He addresses us over his shoulder
Sentimental music makes you nostalgic and hopeful at the same time
Marie's the hopeful part
Laura's the nostalgia part
These things happen
They happen to men, at any rate
This is why  shouldn't be listening to pop music
As he gets closer to the stage -- Rob looks over to see Dick sitting with Barry, a few feet away
He shakes it off and sits with them, extending a meaningful hand to Barry, who takes it
They turn back to the stage as Marie finishes the song
always hated this song
Yeah
Yeah
But now  kind of like it
Dick and Barry nod, then keep watching
All three of them are in their own private fantasies with Marie
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile
" Isn't her album called "Number Four With  Smile
" That's what  said
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and  think that there is a "The
"  But  could be wrong
You can be and are wrong
They drop it, so that their eyes can drift back to Marie
wanna date a musician
(nods in agreement) wanna live with a musician
She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes
Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes
Just in the background somewhere
as the song ends, and she smiles out over the room
The audience applauds
Thanks, you guys,  know 'm not supposed to like that song, but do
'm gonna take a break for a second
Anybody wants to buy one of my tapes, they're five bucks up here
One of my other personalities will be selling them
, , Let's go get one
Let's not
want a tape
Barry and Dick stand and begin to move off
don't need to go up there right now
and they're gone
After a beat, Rob gets up and follows them
Dick and Barry wait nervously to buy a tape, Rob just behind them
Marie processes sales with polite monosyllables, until the three get up front
Enjoying yourselves
They dart eyes to each other, then nod
Good
'Cause 'm enjoying myself
Good
Rob hands her a ten and she roots around in a duffel bag for change
So you live in Chicago now
Yup
Not far from here, actually
You like it
It's okay
Hey
You guys might be the sort to know
Are there any good record stores around here or do have to go downtown
Barry and Dick do not try to control themselves
They point to Rob
He's got one
On Clark Street
couple blocks
About six
We work there
You'd love it
Marie laughs
What do you sell
little of anything that matters
Rock, soul, &, punk rock, hip- hop, ska, new wave
Sounds great
The line behind them is moving in, and Marie smiles at them and turns to someone else
They scurry back toward their table
What did you tell her about the shop for
didn't know it was classified information
mean,  know we don't have any customers, but  thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy
Rob looks over Barry at Marie
She catches his eye as she looks over the room
His eyes shoot to the floor
: -   - Rob is going through a huge stack of used 's, sorting them off into different bins, bouncing his head absently to the music -- the same song of Marie's that Rob had on when Laura called last night
(
) Rob reaches over and hits the  button on the phone, still in the groove of sorting
Rob here
(
) Hey
It's Liz
What's happenin'
You called this morning
Yeah
just wanted to thank you for that message last night
It made me feel like
like less of an asshole
How're you holding up
Actually, 'm fine
'm great
Last night  got to thinking, "you know what
Maybe it is time to move on
Maybe we're just not right for each other
Or maybe we are
But time will tell and at this point 'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be
" You know
Yeah
Like  said,  don't want to take sides
And  like Laura with you
She's more fun, more open
You guys are good together
just wish you two could,  don't know don't think much of this Ian guy -- -- Dick bursts in, huge-faced -- Rob
Liz, hold on a second -- (turns to Dick) What
Marie LaSalle is in the store
Here, she's here, and now
Rob freezes, he and Dick turn to the speaker, which cranks Marie's voice
Rob goes to the phone and picks up the handset
Liz, can you hold for a second
He hits hold
(to Dick) 'll be out there
Go
(picks up the phone) Hey, Liz,  gotta go
Tomorrow night
Great
Green Mill
Fine
Seven
Done
Thanks
Right
Bye
He hangs up fast, spins around to look in a cracked one-foot- square cracked mirror bearing the logo of Aerosmith that is mounted on the wall, and moves out into the and up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns Marie's music off
He takes a deep breath and looks up, meeting her eyes
Oh
Hi
Marie smiles
(re: music) Don't you like that
No, no,  love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it
Well
He reaches back and puts it back on
He cracks his face into a smile, then walks fast back to the stock room door
Marie watches him go
where as soon as he crosses the threshold his fist clench and he grimaces: Dick comes in -- Rob --
--
Dick backs out fast
Rob leans on a wall
Barry enters -- We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all
All three of us
That's fucking great, Barry
We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each
Fantastic, Barry
We can take your car
It's not my car, now is it
It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it
So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab
Wow
Fucking great
Barry sighs, throws up his hands and heads out the door
Jaggoff
Barry exits
Rob seems to be having trouble staying on his feet
Who the fuck is Ian
: ' '  - Rob enters and walks to the mail table, looking like shit
He starts sifting through envelopes for his
Laura doesn't know anybody called Ian
There's no Ian at her office
She has no friends named Ian
She has never met anyone called Ian in her whole life
Although there may have been one in college -- but  am almost certain that since 1989 she has lived in an Ian-less universe
He slows
and stops
His face gets a little paler as he lifts a letter up to his face
-: cable service bill to a Mr
Raymond
as he looks at it, divining
"
Raymond
" Ray
"
"
: Rob to camera
Mr
Raymond
"Ray" to his friends, and, more importantly, to his neighbors
The guy who up until about six weeks ago lived upstairs
knew it was him the moment  saw the letter
start to remember things now: His stupid clothing, his music -- Latin, Bulgarian, whatever fucking world music was trendy that week--stupid laugh, awful cooking smells
can't remember anything good about him at all
never liked him much then, and  fucking hate him now
manage to block out the worst, most painful, most disturbing memory of him until  go to bed
'  - Darkness
We move silently through the rooms, and enter the bedroom
closer to the bed, we see Rob on his back, sheets held clenched up to his chin
He stares at the ceiling, sadly
To almost the same shot, but it's Rob and Laura in the bed, semi-tangled
Laura has a book in her lap
is heard
Laura's eyes go to the ceiling, and Rob sits up at attention
They look up at the light fixture, which shakes a little faster, with the rhythm of the creaking
Someone is definitely having sex upstairs, and they are going for it
Jeez
He goes on long enough
should be so lucky
They turn to each other and laugh
to Rob lying still in bed, staring at the ceiling
You are as abandoned and as noisy as any character in a porn film, Laura
You are Ian's plaything, responding to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic delight
No woman in the history of the world is having better sex than the sex you are having with Ian in my head
' -   - Ian mercilessly savages Laura from behind, below, and above, champagne showers, toe-sucking, and animal screams -- , imploding with disgust and sorrow
Tears run down his cheeks into his ears
Number five -- Jackie Allen
My break up with Jackie Allen had no effect on my life whatsoever just slotted her in to bump you out of position, Laura
Yes, you do in fact make it into the top five
Welcome
And just to remind you, the list is in chronological order, not in the order of pain and suffering
- Dick and Barry are stocking the racks
Rob stands at the register, rocking back and forth sort of like an idiot, to "Always and Forever" by the Commodores
He is a mess
Hey
Rob looks up to see a nineteen or twenty-year-old standing in front of him
Do you have soul
Rob smiles bitterly at her, clearly having a different meaning in mind
That all depends
She kind of backs away and goes back to browsing
The phone rings and Rob picks it up
Record Exchange
How many records
Right, well if you could bring them -- okay, well, where do you live
Right
how about now
can come right over
(Rob scribbles) Okay
He hangs up and grabs his jacket
Dick emerges from the back
(to Dick) Some lady's got some singles to sell
'll be back in a half-hour
Rob walks out
/
- Rob mounts the stairs and rings the doorbell
The door opens, revealing a too-tan  in her late forties, in designer jeans and a -shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign
She says nothing
Hi
You called about the records
She turns and walks into the house, leaving the door open for him
He follows her in and through a fabulous first floor, packed with big-bucks bourgeois: Rugs, art, and antiques: She ushers Rob into a large study, and turns the light on
He misses a breath
The walls are lined with mahogany cases custom-built for CDs, albums, epicurean stereo components, a couple priceless vintage guitars -- every one of the thousands of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum
She points to several boxes on the floor, full of hundreds of singles
Those
Rob steps into the room like an Undeserving, and carefully drops to his knees to examine the singles, each pristine in a plastic sleeve: the original God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols, original Otis Reddings, Elvis Presleys, James Browns, Jerry Lee Lewises, Beatles
on and on
The mother lode
Rob is doing the best to control the onset of hyperventilation
He dares a glance over his shoulder to her to see if this is a joke
What do you think
It's the best collection 've ever seen
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours
Rob's face goes funny
He looks around for a hidden camera
These are worth at least,  don't know -- know what they're worth
Give me fifty and get them out
But you must have -- must have nothing
Their my husband's
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old
friend of my daughter's
He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever go, minus a ten percent commission
Which reminds me
Can you make sure you give me a five
want to frame it and put it on the wall
It must have taken him a long time to get them together
Years
This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement
Rob looks back at the records but avoids the trance
Look
Can  pay you properly
You don't have to tell him what you got
Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest
Give it to charity
Or something
That wasn't part of the deal want to be poisonous but fair
(looking back at the records) Look
'm sorry
don't want to be any part of this
Suit yourself
There are plenty of others who will
That's why 'm trying to compromise
What about fifteen-hundred
They're worth five times that
Sixty
Thirteen hundred
Seventy-five
Eleven-hundred
That's my lowest offer
And  won't take a penny over ninety
They start smiling at each other
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing want
'm sorry but  think you better talk to someone else
Fine
Rob half stands, then drops again for one last lingering look
Can  buy this Otis Redding single off you
Sure
Ten cents
Oh, come on
Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all  care
Okay
Because you took the trouble to come up here
And because you've got principles
But that's it
'm not selling them to you one by one
: - Rob comes down the stairs holding his single, and walks down the street talking to camera
How come  end up siding with the bad guy, the man who ran off to Jamaica with some nymphette
just got left for someone else, so why can't  bring myself to feel whatever it is his wife is feeling
All can see is that guy's face when he gets that pathetic check in the mail for those records, and  can't help but feel desperately, painfully sorry for him
: - The bar where Al Capone used to party, and it looks about the same: colored lightbulbs, shadowboxes, deep plush booths and a stage for jazz
Rob slumps back in a booth, stirring a drink with his finger
After a beat, we hear a off camera, and Rob looks up with a bit of fear
Heavy footsteps get louder and closer, until a shadow shrouds Rob --  stands in front of him
She is enormous, and she is mad as hell
Rob reflexively shrinks
What's the -- hey, Liz -- -- No, no, no, don't even
talked to Laura, Rob
talked to her and she gave me a little background
And you're a fucking
She turns and stomps toward the door
Rob gets up and follows
- Rob comes out of the club and follows Liz
She hears him and turns on him, punctuating with a finger in his chest
To think  sympathized with you for two seconds
Poor Rob
Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs
You let me believe that
It's true
Rob
Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her
You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back
And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else
" Well she -- She turns again and keeps walking, holding a defiant middle finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street
- Rob sits, rocking slightly with the movement of the train
He stares at an   who do not speak to each other
She's right, of course
am a fucking asshole
did and said those things
But before you judge, although you've probably already done so, go off for a minute and write down the top five worst things that you have done to your partner, even if -- especially if -- your partner doesn't know about them
Don't dress things up or try to explain them
Just write them down in the plainest language possible
, even five or ten seconds
Pencils down
Okay, so who's the asshole now
: - Saturday
For the first time we see the place kind of busy
Rob watches the room
Barry is toward the back, talking to a
"Cruel to Be Kind" by Nick Lowe plays
It's almost impossible to find, especially on
Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables
But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album -- have all of the others
Oh really
Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain
They always seemed
They always seemed what
They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed
They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums
can't believe that you don't own that record
That's insane
He plucks it from the rack, and sticks it in the Customer's hand, who regards it with a bit a of shame
Well what about the new Echo -- Do not get ahead of yourself
is listening to a female customer, but he doesn't hear her voice
- ' The army bag with a red cross on it
The ring-of-ivy tattoo around the wrist
The monkey boots
The eye shadow
thinking, calculating
The interesting thing about Green Day is that so much of their music is in truth directly influenced by, in my opinion, two bands
The Clash
Correct
The Clash
But also the Stranglers
Who
think you would love the Stranglers
Dick pulls a Stranglers record and puts it on the stereo
Her brow furrows, and then she smiles
This sounds great
Dick smiles humbly
Two people in the store turn and approach
Is this the new Green Day
still talking to his Customer, who now has several 's in his hand
He looks at Barry with a mixture of hate and adoration
That is perverse
Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde
What about Television
have a television
--
Barry adds more records to the Customer's stack
- stand behind the counter
Rob holds a  in his hand, and surveys the roaming customers with a semi-serious air of authority
will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux
Do it
Do it
Rob pops the  in and it begins to play
He stands there with his arms folded, waiting
After a moment, a Customer approaches
(re: music) What is this
It's the Royal Trux
It's great
know
' of the room
Something has caught his eye: a cropped head with a leopard skin pattern surfaces and disappears, like Nessie
Rob's face gets hot and mad
He jumps out from behind the counter
Dick, ring the man up
He moves like a cat through the crowd
Justin sees him coming and counters around the middle island and heads for the door
Vince appears next to him, fiddling with his belt
He sees Rob now, and he and Justin bolt for the door
Rob doubles back
Dick sees Vince and Justin too late
Rob is right behind them and as they get out the door, he reaches
and comes up with the back half of a skateboard
- Rob emerges behind them, Vince's skateboard in hand
They have enough distance to bolt, but they can't leave that board behind
Okay, fuckos
How much is this deck worth to you, and how many 's did you rip off
Can you do the math
Justin pulls two 's out and slides them over to Rob
(to Vince) And what about you, dork
Vince pulls about six, and puts them down in a neutral spot
Rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them
Dicks pokes his head out of the door
Dick, call the police, please
Vince and Justin look at each other
(looking through the 's) Eno import
Sigue Sigue Sputnik
Break beats
Serge Gainsbourg
Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett
What's going on here
Are you guys stealing for other people now
Naw
Those are for us
Oh really
You two are slamming to Nico now
You're, like, so bigoted to look at us and, like, think you know what we listen to
You got the 's so can  have my board back
think you have more
Well we don't
can't frisk you but the cops can
Justin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up with a tattered old book, "How To Make  Record
"  He tosses it over
Jesus
That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months
Was it just your criminal nature or what
Hell,  would've given it to you for free
No, we
We don't know how it works
Nobody even knows, so we wanted to check it out in that mag
Rob snorts
Like, do you know how to actually make a
Rob can't resist edifying them -- the curse of the underappreciated expert
Uh, yes , like, do
It's simple
You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant
You press the 's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it
Records are those big round black things, right
Fuck off
Rob turns to go back in the store
Hey, can  have my board
Rob drops it and enters the store
: -  -  : Barry emerges from the back with three opened bottles of beer as the last customer goes out the door
The three lean against the bins, tired and smiling
(to Rob) What
What do you mean, "what
" What are you snickering about
'm not snickering
'm smiling
Because 'm happy
What am  missing
What do you have to be happy about
Well we rang $900 today
Yeah but more than that
'm happy because 'm proud of us
Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage
Dick and Barry look at each other
They almost know how to take a compliment
- Rob, now alone, turns the sign from "open" to "closed" shuts the door behind him, and pulls the gate across
Laura appears from the next doorway
He jumps
Shit
Hi
Hi
thought  could give you a lift back
Are you coming home
Yes
Well, 'm coming over to your house to get some things
My house
Laura turns and begins walking
Rob looks at camera
First of all: The money
The money is easy to explain: She had it and didn't, and she wanted to give it to me
If she hadn't,  would have gone under
've never paid her back because 've never been able to, and just because she's took off and moved in with some Supertramp fan doesn't make me five grand richer
So that's the money -- Laura's   is heard
He heads off
: '  - They move down the street, and it's a little tense
Laura pushes a tape into the stereo
Art Garfunkel's "Bright Eyes" begins to play
Rob turns away from her and makes a face, but she knows he's making it
You can make all the faces you want
My car
My car stereo
My compilation tape
Rob tries not to speak, but -- How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye
It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob
Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records -- -- Made
Made
Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in -- -- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't
Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are
Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye -- -- Alright, alright but -- -- and who says  like Marvin Gaye, anyway
He reels on her
Hey
Marvin Gaye
"Got to Give It Up
" That's our song
Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship
Is that right
'd like a word with him
But don't you remember
remember the song
just couldn't remember who sang it
Rob shakes his head in disbelief
can see why you prefer Gaye to Garfunkel
get it, really
But there are so many other things to worry about
They're only records, and if one is better than the other, well, who cares, besides you and Barry and Dick
mean really, who gives a flying fuck
Silence
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now
When  first met you, and  made you that tape, you loved it
You said -- and  quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection
" Well,  liked you
You were a deejay, and  thought you were hot, and didn't have a boyfriend, and  wanted one
So you weren't interested in music at all
Yeah, sure
More so then than  am now
That's life though, isn't it
The car slows, and Laura parks
But Laura
that's me
That's all there is to me
There isn't anything else
If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything
You really believe that
Laura turns the engine off and unbuckles her seat belt
Yes
Look at me
Look at our -- the apartment
What else do  have, other than records and CDs
And do you like it that way
Not really
She half smiles
Let's go in
She gets out of the car
Rob turns to camera, speaking quietly and urgently
Okay, Number two: The stuff  told her about being unhappy in the relationship, about half looking around for someone else: She tricked me into saying it
We were having this state of the union type conversation and she said, quite matter-of-factly, that we were pretty unhappy at the moment, and did agree, and  said yes, and she asked whether  ever thought about meeting someone else
So  asked her if she ever thought about it, and she said of course, so  admitted that daydream about it from time to time
Now  see that what we were really talking about was her and Ian, and she suckered me into absolving her
It was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and fell for it, because she's much smarter than me
He scrambles out of the car
- The lock turns and Rob enters, holding the door for Laura who slips by, her coat in her hands
She glances down at the table by the door and sees Ian's envelope
You can take it with you if you want
She slips it into her purse
He stands facing her for a moment, then crosses to her, takes her coat and tosses it on a chair
She opens the closet and takes out a big laundry sack
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection
She begins putting books and other things into the bag
You bet
've been saying that for years
Having no comeback, Rob goes for the moral high ground
So
Where have you been staying for the last week
think you know that
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't
Laura looks suddenly tired and sad, and looks away
'm sorry
haven't been very fair to you
That's why  came here to the store this evening
feel terrible, Rob
This is really hard, you know
Good
(beat) So
Is it my job
What
Gimme a fucking break
Is that what you think
That your not big enough a deal for me
Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob
don't know
It's one of the things thought of
What were the others
Just the obvious stuff
What's the obvious stuff
don't know
She stands and walks toward the bathroom
guess it's not that obvious, then
No
As soon as she shuts the door behind her, he turns to camera
And number three: The Pregnancy didn't know she was pregnant
Of course  didn't
She hadn't told me because  had told her  was
sort of
seeing somebody else
We thought we were being very grown-up, but we were being preposterously naive, childish even, to think that one of us could fuck around and then own up to it while we were living together
So --  didn't find out about it 'til way later
We were going through a good period and made a crack about having kids and she burst into tears
made her tell me what it was all about, and she did
felt guilty and so  got angry
She told me that at the time didn't look like a very good long- term bet
That it was a hard decision and she didn't see any point in consulting me about it
When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big -- We hear the bathroom door open
(
) What
(covering) What, what
Laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the door
Did you say something
No
So
Is it working out with Ian
Rob
Don't be childish
Why is that childish
Your living with the guy
'm just asking how it's going
am not living with him
've just been staying with him for a few days until  work out what 'm doing
Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else
You know that, don't you
left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it
And  suddenly realized that  like my job, and like what my life is could be turning into, and that 'm getting to a point where  want to get my shit together and  can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go
But  have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run
Probably nothing
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead
Laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the laundry bag
Rob turns back to camera
-- When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big lump like that, even the most shortsighted jerk, even the most self-deluding and self pitying of jilted, wounded lovers can see that there is some cause and effect going on here, that abortions and Ian and money and affairs all belong to, all deserve each other
Laura reappears, her bag half-filled with clothes, and goes to the book shelves next to the records
She starts topping off the bag with books
Look
Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me
Maybe 'll never see either of you again
don't know
All  know is that it's not a good time to be living here
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me
There's still a chance we'll get back together
don't know
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right
It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it
It means he might live
Even if it's only a remote possibility
suppose so
So we have a chance of getting back together again
Oh, Rob, shut up
Hey,  just want to know where stand
What chance -- --  don't fucking know what chance you fucking have
She abandons her attempt at packing
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together
Does that clarify the situation
Yeah
Great
(shaking her head) 'm too tired for this now
know 'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so  can get my stuff packed up
need to be able to think while  do it and  can't think while you're here
No problem
If  can ask one question
Fine
One
It sounds stupid
Nevermind
You won't like it
Just ask it
Is it better
Is what better
Better than what
Well
Sex,  guess
Is sex with him better
Jesus Christ, Rob
Is that really what's bothering you
Of course it is
You really think it would make a difference either way
don't know
Well the answer is that  don't know either
We haven't done it yet
Never
haven't felt like it
But not even before, when he was living upstairs
No
was living with you, remember
We've slept together but we haven't made love
Not yet
But 'll tell you one thing
The sleeping together is better
(trying not to smile) The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet
Will you please just go
- Rob shuts the door behind him and does a crazy Charleston/Cabbage-Patch/Boxstep/Touchdown dance of pure elation, then bounces down the stairs
: - Rob bounces along, a smile wider than we have seen yet
Maybe even jumping to touch an awning
He lands and tells us: feel good
feel great
feel like a new man
feel so much better, in fact -- - Rob moves through the room, still grinning a bit like a proud new father, toward the table where Barry, Dick, Marie and - Bone sit, listening to a story -Bone is telling
Marie turns to him
Hi, Marie
Everything go alright
Rob glances at Barry, who averts his gaze
She just wanted to pick up some stuff
No big thing
relief, actually
God,  hate that time
That pick up stuff time
just went through that before  came here
You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" play
That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections
It's a great song
Thank you
Rob glances at -Bone, his mind calculating the new info
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place
Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff
Yup
Marie slides closer, turning her back on the others
The loop is closed
You share a place with -Bone
No way
'd cramp his style
And wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall
'm way to unattached for that
understand completely
- Rob and Marie lean in to each other, everyone else out of focus
(
) Awhile back, Dick and Barry and agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like
- Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd -- What do you mean, the Crumblers
You know the Crumblers
Nobody's heard the Crumblers
Except me
Yeah,  know the Crumblers
bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it
My everything changed for a couple of weeks
Rob glows -- (
) Books, records, films -- these things matter
Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure was having one of the best dates of my life
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it
The Conformist
Exactly
Fucking ex-actly
(laughs) You haven't even seen it
Nor have you
They just laugh and laugh -- (
) References, titles, lyrics, flew and met each other in mid-air embraces
The evening goes with breathtaking precision
'  - Rob and Marie are kissing standing up
Are you okay
(nodding) Yes
You
For now
But  wouldn't be if thought this was the end of the evening
'm sure it isn't
Good
In that case, 'll fix us something else to drink
You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee
Whiskey
Marie goes into the kitchen, and they keep talking around the corner
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket
'd better go
gotta get up early
Go over to my parents'
When  said before that  hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, was, you know
talking about breakfast and stuff
She plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table
'd like it if you could stay the night
(as if it is dawning on him) Oh, right
Alright
Jesus, so much for delicacy
pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz
use it but  don't understand it when other people use it
So you'll stay
Yeah
Good
Marie picks up the drinks again and exits to the bedroom
Rob just stands there
and the
(to camera) Over nine million men in this country have slept with ten or more women
And do they all look like Richard Gere
Are they all as rich as Bill Gates
Charming as Oscar Wilde
Hell no
Nothing to do with any of that
Maybe fifty or so have one or more of these attributes, but that still leaves
well, about nine million, give or take fifty
And they're just men
Regular guys
We're just guys, because , even , am a member of this exclusive, nine million member club
In fact, Marie is my seventeenth lover
"How does he do it
" you ask
"He wears bad sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the Musical Moron Twins, and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan
What's going on
Listen up, because  think can explain, with all modesty aside: ask questions
That's it
That's my secret
It works precisely because that isn't how you're supposed to do it, if you listen to the collective male wisdom
There are still enough old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs running around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different
If you can't hack this simple strategy, there are some women out there, of course, who want to get pushed around, ignored and mowed over, but do you really want to be with them anyway
he goes through a door into the bedroom
Marie is taking off her earrings
Would you like me to turn the lights out
Or would you like them on
God, you ask a lot of questions
'  - Rob stares at the ceiling as Marie sleeps on next to him
(
) But in the morning we were just two people, slightly hung-over, who were not in love, sharing the same space
And  feel
Rob looks to the camera
Sex is about the only grown-up thing that  know how to do; It's weird, then, that it's the only thing that can make me feel like a ten-year- old
: '  - The two of them come out of the building and into the street
Which way are you going
(points left) That way
You
(points right) That way
And so it is
'll talk to you later
'll call you
(smiles) Right
- Empty
Dick prices records out on the floor
Rob leans against the register
Barry sits on a stool next to him
They're top-fiving it
Rob's heart isn't in it
Okay
Top five side one track ones
Number one
"Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash
Ehh
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run
"Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough
Not at all
Dick, did you hear that
Shut up
"Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On
"Airbag," Radiohead, from  Computer
(sarcastic) Ooh
kind of recent record
Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics
Nice
"Let's Get It On
" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that
Rob
Phone
(whispers) It's Laura
Rob springs to his feet, takes the phone and walks to the end of the cord
Deep breath
Hi
- Hi
've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and 'm thinking  didn't take them with me
Have you seen them around
'll look for 'em
How you doing
'm sorry to call, but  need that stuff
Fine, 'm sure it's in the file at home
'll call you when  find it, and then we'll talk
We'll talk some other time
Great
That's great
Rob comes back to the counter and hangs up the phone
Rob
What about the Beatles
What about the fucking Rolling Stones
What about fucking
fucking
Beethoven
Track one side one of the Fifth Symphony
You shouldn't be allowed to run a record shop
You shouldn't be allowed to -- : '
Rob's mouth slacks and he stares off
(
) There's something different about the sound of her voice
And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet
Yet
What does "yet" mean, anyway
" haven't seen
Evil Dead  yet
" What does that mean
It means you're going to go, doesn't it
:
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit -- -- Barry, if  were to say to you haven't seen Evil Dead  yet, what would that mean
Barry just looks at Rob
He pulls out a Game Boy and begins playing
Just
come on, what would it mean to you
That sentence
" haven't seen Evil Dead  yet
" To me, it would mean that you're a liar
You saw it twice
Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick
We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century
Yeah, yeah,  know
But say  hadn't seen it and  said to you, " haven't seen Evil Dead  yet," what would you think
Barry shuts off the Game Boy
'd think you were a cinematic idiot
And 'd feel sorry for you
No, but would you think, from that one sentence
That  was going to see it
'm sorry, Rob, but 'm struggling here
don't understand any part of this conversation
You're asking me what  would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen
What am  supposed to say
Just listen to me
If  said to you -- "--  haven't seen Evil Dead  yet," yeah, yeah,  hear you -- Would you
would you get the impression that  wanted to see it
Well
you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone
Rob brightens
Barry finally considers
But the word "yet
" Yeah, you know what, 'd get the impression that you wanted to see it
Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to
But in your opinion, would definitely go
How the fuck am  supposed to know that
You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie
Rob darkens
Why would they care
Because it's a brilliant film
It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass
They look at each other for a strange moment
never thought  would say this, but can  go work now
Let's pack it up
We haven't had a customer in four hours
Barry stands
Fine by me
still want pay to 7 o'clock
Ha
can't go to the club tonight, guys
Why
Dick smiles sheepishly
Who are you going to see
Nobody
Barry's eyes widen
Rob, looky looky
Dick
Are you getting some
Silence
Un-fucking-believable
Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all
How do you know about that
Oh come on, Rob
What am , an idiot
'm more bothered by Dick's thing
How did this happen, Dick
What rational explanation can there possibly be
What's her name
Barry is going a little hard
Dick shrinks back
Anna
Anna who
Anna Green Gables
Anna Conda
Anna Moss
Anna Moss
Mossy
The Mossy Thing
The Swamp Thing
Is she all green and furry
Shut the fuck up, Barry
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you
You two have to stick together now
Boners United
United in getting some
Barry picks up his bag and heads for the door
Don't be sad, Barry
You'll find true love someday
Suck my ass
Terrific
Rob looks to Dick, who looks guilty
Don't worry about it, Dick
Barry's an asshole
Yeah
Well
'll see you tomorrow, Rob
Dick exits
Rob watches the door close behind him, and looks out over the empty store
He    as he goes to the light switches and begins shutting them off, one by one
Why does it bother Barry that much that Dick is seeing someone
He's worried about how his life is turning out, and he's lonely, and lonely people are the bitterest of them all
until all the lights are out
Rob's silhouette slips out the door
- downpour is on
Rob has himself wedged into a phone booth, the little kind
(into phone) Hi
It's me
'm right outside
know
know
figured  could just walk you to the train and you could go
home
Or whatever it is
No
Of course not -- okay
'll be right here
Rob stands under the overhang, watching Laura walk the long hallway from the elevators to the door
(
) Laura looks different
Less stress- out, more in control
Something has happened, maybe something real, or maybe something in her head
Whatever it is, you can see that she thinks she's started out on some new stage in her life
She hasn't
'm not going to let her
She emerges from doors, says something to him and they start walking, sharing her umbrella
- Rob and Laura have just sat down in a booth
So, how are you
Have you slept with him yet
told you  slept with him
No, not --  mean have you, you know -- Is that why you wanted to see me
guess
Oh, Rob
What do you want me to say
want you to say that you haven't, and  want it to be the truth
She looks past him
can't do that
She starts to say something else but Rob is up and out
- Rob pushes through the rush hour raincoats, seeming to be the only one going his way
'  - Rob is soaking, slumped in his chair, his headphones on and the stereo lit up behind him
He talks a little loud, due to the headphones
Tonight we're gonna figure out the five best angry songs about women
Let's go
He holds up a stack of records and CDs
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where
"Motel Matches
" " Want You
" " Hope You're Happy Now
" "Green Shirt
" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass
" "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana
Maybe a Liz Phair track
There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with
Some devil's advocate stuff
The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you
But  think we're getting ahead of ourselves there
Ah
Dylan
Bob fucking Dylan
Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings
He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing
(
) You must have known it would happen
You couldn't have been entirely unprepared
Like you said, 've been living with the guy
We were bound to get around to it sometime
She laughs a bit nervously
(
) (machine) And anyway,  keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it
The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob
Are you there
What are you thinking
(barely a whisper) Nothing
(
) We can meet for another drink if you want
So  can explain it better
owe you that much
Look,  gotta go
work too, you know
(
) Will you call me
don't have your number
(
) Call me at work
We can arrange to meet properly
don't want this to be the last conversation we have know what you're like
You do, huh
He hangs up and stares at the wall for awhile
He gets a beer from the fridge and sits back down
He picks up the phone and dials
Yes, a residence, a Mr
Ian Raymond, North Side
thank you
He writes down a number and hangs up, then looks to camera
You know the worst thing about being rejected
The complete lack of control due to loss of control
He picks up the phone and dials, while continuing to talk to us -- If  could only control the when and how of being dumped by somebody then it wouldn't seem as bad
But then, of course -- He hangs up quickly -- -- it wouldn't be rejection, would it
It would be mutual consent
It would be musical differences would be pursuing a solo career
: '  - Rob is tucked into a phone booth across the street
He can see the silhouettes of Laura and Ian in the window
He picks up the phone, drops a quarter, and hits the numbers hard as he dials
a muffled male "hello
" is heard and Rob hangs up
He does it again
And again
And again
Until -- '  - Still an unpacked box or two, but it's set up: a framed "Woodstock - The Movie" poster, stacks of new fiction, a bread maker -- you get the idea
Ian is shorter than Laura, scruffier than Rob, and looks not unlike Leo Sayer/Steve Guttenberg
He stares at Laura with amused exasperation
She picks up the phone -- Hello
It's me
figured it was
(re: traffic noise) Where are you
think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and  think  know where you are
You're running
On the run
You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that  do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later
And with
him
'm not -- hold on
She walks into another room, shutting the door behind her
On a bookshelf is a picture of a younger Ian in a tunic, emoting on some college stage
She turns it face down
'm not in love with Ian, okay
She wanders over to the window, looking out absently
She sees Rob down there at the phone booth
Are you still in love with me
Jesus
do not know
'll talk to you later
Think about what  said
mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever -- (indignant) 'm not experimenting
Why don't you go experiment
don't want to
Don't need to love you
You don't ever think about other people
No
not really
mean,  think about it
but no,  don't really think about it
(
) (through the door) Laura
Are you okay
(covering the mouthpiece, to Ian) am fine
(to Rob) gotta go
Goodbye
She clicks the phone off
The door cracks and Ian sticks his head in
Are you sure you're okay
She moves past him back into the apartment
Yeah, 'm fine
'm off the phone
You look upset
'm upset, but 'm fine
Maybe  should talk to him
Mmmm, no
Not a good idea
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura
Nothing to resolve, Ian
Let's get a drink
She grabs her coat and opens the door
The phone begins to ring
(waving toward the door) 'mon, c'mon
' Rob stands on the sidewalk in the rain, Ian's building behind him and down a few doors
wish  could be one of those guys who doesn't call, the kind of guy that gets broken up with and appears not to give a shit
He doesn't make an ass out of himself, or frighten anybody, and this week 've done both of those things
One day Laura's sorry and guilty, and the next she's scared and angry, and 'm entirely responsible for the transformation, and it doesn't do my case any good at all
'd stop if  could but  -- His head turns at the sharp  of a door opening -- Ian and Laura are coming out of the building
He jumps behind a tree, peering around it as they fade down the street
- Rob sits alone, nursing a scotch
Rob looks up into the mirror behind the bar and sees an older woman,
, sitting alone a few stools down
Do  know you
' don't know
Rob remembers, and his gaze has a new found seriousness
You're Mrs
Ashworth
'm Rob
An old boyfriend of you're daughter's
Alison's Mom's brow furrows and her face darkens
Alison's
' Really
Long time ago
was just thinking about her
was her first boyfriend
'  What did you say your name was
Rob
Rob Gordon
Circa junior high
' hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend
Kevin Bannister
You gotta be kidding me
' That's right
Kevin
She's Mrs
Kevin Bannister
She lives in Australia
She doesn't seem too happy that Alison lives in Australia
Rob is thrilled
Really
Married Kevin
Her junior high sweetheart
What chance would have had against that
None, no chance
That's just fate
' beg your pardon
Technically, 'm number one
went out with her a week before Kevin did
Her first boyfriend
Me
She stands
' Well Rob, 'll tell her you said hello
If she remembers you
Alison's Mom strolls out
(calling after her) think she will
But it's okay if she doesn't
'm fine now
Rob turns to the bartender, smiling giddily
- Rob walks through Uptown toward the train
And suddenly  am fine
For the moment there is not one extra pound on my chest
This is fate
Alison married Kevin
You get it
That's fate
That's got nothing to do with me, that is beyond my control, beyond my fault
: Rob into camera, digging through a box, fishing through pictures and letters, concert tickets and other mementos
He begins to assemble a small pile of pictures of women
want to see the others on the Big Top Five
Penny, who wouldn't let me touch her and then went and had sex with that bastard Chris Thompson
Sarah, my partner in rejection who rejected me, and Charlie, who  have to thank for everything: my great job, my sexual self-confidence, the works
There's this Springsteen song, "Bobby Jean," off Born in the About a girl who's left town years before and he's pissed off because he didn't know about it, and he wanted to say goodbye, tell her that he missed her, and wish her good luck
Well, 'd like my life to be like a Springsteen song
Just once
know 'm not born to run, and it's clear that Halsted Street is nothing like Thunder Road, but feelings can't be that different, can they
'd like to call up all those people and ask them how they are and whether they've forgiven me, and tell them that  have forgiven them
And say good luck, goodbye
No hard feelings
And then they'd feel good and 'd feel good
We'd all feel good
'd feel clean, and calm, and ready to start again
That'd be good
Great even
: '  - Rob holds an old crumpled address book in one hand and the phone in the other
Penny Hardwick
This is Rob Gordon
From High school
Yeah
- Rob and Penny walk out of the theater mid-conversation
They look happy as they walk down the street
(
) Penny is as beautiful as she was in high school when  broke it off with her because she wouldn't sleep with me
In fact she's even more beautiful, and really grown into herself
- mid-scale trattoria
Rob and Penny sit at table laughing and talking
If we didn't know better we might think there is chemistry
(
) She tells me about her life, and get it
And  tell about mine, and she's interested
- -- (
) And then, with no real explanation, just launch into it:  tell her about Laura and Ian, and Charlie and Marco, and about Alison Ashworth and Kevin Bannister
and you wanted to sleep with Chris Thompson instead of me, and
and thought you could help me understand why it keeps happening, why 'm doomed to be left, doomed to be rejected and
He slows to a stop
We see Penny as she goes from happy to livid
Rob
was crazy about you
wanted to sleep with you, one day, but not when  was sixteen
When you broke up with me -- when you broke up with me -- because  was, to use your charming expression, tight,  cried and cried and  hated you
And then that little shitbag asked me out, and  was too tired to fight him off, and it wasn't rape because said okay, but it wasn't far off
And  didn't have sex with anyone else until after college because hated it so much
And now you want to have a chat about rejection
Well, fuck you, Rob
Penny stands and leaves
Rob just sits
(cheerful) So that's another one  don't have to worry about
should have done this years ago
Rob indicates to an off-screen waiter
Check
Rob to camera
Sarah's easy to find
She still sends me Christmas cards with her address and phone number on them
They never say anything else, except for "Merry Christmas, Love Sarah
" send her equally blank ones back
-  - ' of a door opening, revealing Sarah, a few years older but still pretty in her mousey way
She looks at Rob with a bit too much in her eyes
'  - Rob and Sarah face each other over a half-eaten pizza
can't believe  left you for him
Crazy
Sarah looks down at her plate, shaking her head, blushing
Rob looks uncomfortable
This is more than he was looking for
Well
probably seemed like a good idea at the time
She looks up again
Probably
can't remember why, though
and back down again
(
) haven't got the heart for the rejection conversation
There are no hard feelings here, and  am glad that she ditched me, and not the other way around
/
- Sarah, in the doorway, smiles painfully
It's clear she doesn't want to shut the door, but she does
Rob turns and walks down the hall toward the door to the street as he talks could've ended up having sex back there
And what better way to exorcize rejection demons than to screw the person who rejected you, right
But you wouldn't be sleeping with a person
You'd be sleeping with a whole sad single-person culture
It'd be like sleeping with Talia Shire in "Rocky" if you weren't Rocky
'  - -: as Rob's finger moves down the column, then stops
Rob looks up with a little shock, almost recoiling from the phone book
: Rob to camera
Charlie's in the fucking phone book
She has come to assume such an importance,  feel she should be living on Mars
She's an extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth, not a person with an answering machine, in the phone book
call and hang up on her voice mail a couple of times, then  leave my name and number and throw in a "long time-no- see
"  don't hear anything back from her for a few days
Now that's more like it, if you're talking about rejection: someone who won't even return your phone messages a decade after she rejected you
- Rob hears the door open as he stocks shelves, and turns
It's Ian
Rob reacts, gunfighter eyes
Can  help you
Hello, Rob
Remember me
'm Ray
Ian
Rob says nothing
thought maybe we should talk
Sort a few things out
Rob is disoriented on the way to angry
Dick and Barry's ears perk up
What needs sorting out
Come on, Rob
My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal
Funnily enough  haven't been too thrilled about it
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob
We're talking actionable harassment
Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house
Yeah, well, 've stopped all that now
We've noticed and we're glad
But, you know
how are we going to make peace here
We want to make things easier for you
What can we do
Obviously  know how special Laura is, and  know things can't be good for you at the moment
'd hate it if  lost her
But 'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, 'd respect that decision
Do you see what 'm saying
Yeah
Good
So shall we leave it at that then
dunno
Think about it, Rob
#1: Rob looking sure of himself, righteous
Good
So shall we leave it at that then
've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck
Now get your patchouli stink out of my store
Ian leaves, rattled
#2: Same thing
Good
So shall we leave it at that then
We won't leave it, Ian
Not ever
Rob springs toward Ian, but Barry blocks his way
Dick helps hold Rob back
Don't do it, Rob
He's not worth it
Rob reaches a pointed finger over Barry's shoulder
Leave town
Leave the country, you little bitch, because you're gonna look back on walks by the house and ten phone calls a night as a golden age
Get ready, mutherfucker
Ian trips backward and scurries out the door
#3: Rob, Dick, and Barry just beating the living shit out of Ian, Rodney King style
Ian lies on the floor trying to cover himself
Dick, already out of breath, breaks from the pack and jerks the air conditioner from the wall and hefts it over his head, preparing for the death blow
So shall we leave it at that then
dunno
Think about it, Rob
Ian walks out
Rob looks spent
He shuffles toward the back of the store
-   - Rob is laying on his back, staring at the ceiling
Dick sticks his head in the door
Phone, Rob
Somebody named Charlie
Rob pulls the phone into the bathroom and shuts the door
Rob curls up with the phone
Hello
'  - Charlie looks even better than when we saw her in college
Rob, hi, so sorry  missed your call
In  on business
You know how it gets
Yeah, sure
Good
Great
Yeah
Wow
Rob Gordon
Seems like a 100 million years ago now
Yeah
billion
Right
How are you
Fantastic but 'm a little busy right now
Listen
Do you want to come to dinner Saturday
'm having some friends over and  need a spare man
Are you a spare man
Uh
yes, at the moment
Great
Gotta go
See you then
' Sexy version of a hip wine commercial: a small mid-thirties crowd of successful, beautiful people
Rob sits at the table silently as the other guests talk and eat
Rob's central activities are working his way through maybe a few too many wines making sure his cigarette smoke doesn't get in anyone's face
His eyes occasionally dart around the table, but he says nothing to anyone
: '   - Rob is a little too settled into the couch, somewhat bleary
Everyone gone but the two of them, Charlie plops down into a chair across from Rob
Hey Charlie
Hey Rob
Why did you break up with me for Marco
(on her feet) Fuck
knew it
You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things
Huh
There's been a rash of them, recently
find it a little unnerving
In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and  wasn't really up for it
Do all men go through this
'mon, just answer the question
You can say what you like
What the hell
Charlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling, musters a look of "contemplation
" It's all kind of lost in the
in the dense mists of time now
It wasn't that  really liked Marco more
In fact  thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him
It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow
You used to act as if  was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what  mean
Your self-image started to rub off on me and  ended up thinking that  was strange
And knew that you were kind and thoughtful
you made me laugh, and dug the way you got consumed by things you loved
and Marco seemed a bit more,  don't know, glamorous
More sure of himself
(pause) Less hard work, because  felt like was dragging you around, sort of
(pause) little sunnier
Sparkier
(pause) don't know
You know what people are like at that age
They make very superficial judgements
Do you think that's superficial
He was a clown, if it's any consolation
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you
Oh God, no
didn't want to hurt his feelings
: Rob to camera
wanted the works and  got it
None of Alison Ashworth's fate, none of Sarah's rewriting of history, and no reminder that 'd got all the rejection stuff a little backward, like  did about Penny
Just a perfectly clear explanation of why some people have it and some don't
All 've learned from Charlie is that maybe my one talent, my genius for being normal, is a little overrated
: - Rob enters the already open store, in a bad mood, to find Barry putting up a poster
It reads: "/appearing Saturday night/Bucktown Pub" Hey
What the fuck is that
My band
What band
The band that found me and asked me to join
You are not in a band, Barry
You are not a musician
And no posters
Thanks for your support, Rob
Really appreciate it
Barrytown
Barrytown
Is there no end to your arrogance
didn't make up the name
It's the Steely Dan song
And it was in The Commitments
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown
They were fucking called that before was in it, okay
It wasn't my idea
That's why you got the gig, isn't it
Barry says nothing
Isn't it
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes
But -- Great
That's fucking great
They only asked you to sing because of your name
You can stick it above the browser racks over there
How many tickets can  put you down for
None
Christ
You're not even coming
Of course 'm not coming
Do  look like 'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave
Where is it
(looks at the poster) The fucking Bucktown Pub
Ha
So much for friends, then
You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that
Bitter
Because 'm not in Barrytown
You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk
(re: the poster) Just keep that out of my window
'  - Rob opens the door to find Laura filling a duffel bag in the living room
called and called but you were out
thought 'd be gone before you got back
Is that the last of it
Yep
might have missed some stuff
'm so used to some things being here that  don't even notice them
Those look heavy
Where's Ian
He's at home
Listen,  can't believe he went to the store
'm mortified, actually
'm really sorry
He had no right to do that, and  told him so
It was kind of funny
They smile
'm sure
You still together
Going all right
don't really want to talk about it, to be honest
That bad, eh
You know what  mean
Rob flops onto the couch and surveys the room
It's a dump, isn't it
Laura sits down, on the other side of the couch
Fix it up
It'll make you feel better
'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you
mean, how much are you making now
Sixty
Seventy
And you were living in this shitty place
You know  didn't mind
And it's not as if Ray's place is any better
'm sorry, but can we get this straight
What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray
What do you call him
Ray
hate Ian
hate him too
So  just call him "Mavis
" Or "Sissyboy
" Or "Mavis the Sissyboy
" Laura starts laughing, laying on the couch on her back, very close to Rob
Rob leans in, sort of looking down into her eyes
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at
But  already knew you could make me laugh
It's everything else don't know about
You know 'm a good person
Mmm hmm
You know that  can cook my ass off when  feel like it
Oh ho, so very infrequently
He moves a little closer
You know my favorite beverage is your bath water
She laughs
He moves in, not really trying to kiss her but leaving the door open for her
She almost goes for it, but instead gets to her feet
Time to go
She goes to her bags
Rob points to a pile of CDs
Don't forget your CDs
Those aren't mine
Sure they are
They're not really, though, are they
know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you
can't take them, know they'd just sit around staring at me, and 'd feel embarrassed by them and
they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand
That Sting record you bought for me
that was a present for me
like Sting and you hate him
But the rest of this stuff
(bending down to the pile) Who the hell is Nick Lowe
Or Gram Parsons
Or the Boredoms
don't know these people
Okay, okay
get the picture
'm sorry to go on about it
But, don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and  want to make sure you get it
got it
You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him
You're being deliberately obtuse
guess  am
Well, think about it
She hefts the duffel bag, opens the door and exits
Fuck
: Rob to the camera
What's the point in thinking about it
If  ever have another relationship, 'll buy her, whoever she is, stuff that she oughta like but doesn't know about -- that's what new boyfriends are for
And hopefully  won't borrow money from her, or have an affair, and she won't need to have an abortion or run away with the neighborhood, and then there won't be anything to think about
Laura didn't run off with Ian because bought her CDs she wasn't that keen on, and to pretend otherwise is just
just
psychowank
If she thinks that, then she's missing the Brazilian rainforest for the twigs
If  can't buy the Plastic People of the Universe's first album for new girlfriends, then  might as well give up, because 'm not sure  know how to do anything else
: - Rob walks toward the record store, and looks into a Starbuck's window he passes
He stops for a second, seeing Ian at the counter, chatting merrily with the espresso jockey
Rob keeps walking
-   - Rob tosses his coat down and picks up the phone and dials
(
) (muffled, almost a whisper) Hello
Hey, how ya doin'
No answer
Guess who  just saw, right by my store
Ian
In Starbuck's
Neat, huh
(
) can't talk right now
God, that's a cold and a half
Maybe you should bet back in bed
No response
Are you alright
(
) Pigsty
Don't worry about it
Just get into bed
Worry about that when you're better
(
) Pig died
Who the fuck's Pig
(
) (louder) My dad died
My dad, my dad
She hangs up
Rob comes out of the back, in a daze
Dick and Barry notice
What's up
Laura
Her dad died
Ooh
Drag
Barry goes back to his comic book and burrito
'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's -- You're a horrible person, Barry mean it
Barry looks up at him, shrugs, then gets an idea
Hey
Top five songs about death Laura's Dad Tribute list
Nobody can help thinking about it
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack
" The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right
"Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his -- -- It was Dean, you fucking idiot
It was Jan, and it was a long time after-- Whatever
Okay
"Tell Laura  Love Her
" That'd bring the house down
Laura's mom could sing it
Fuck off, Barry
'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness
And "You Can't Always Get What You Want
" Because it's in The Big Chill
Haven't seen it
Liar
We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat
Oh
Right
But 'd forgotten about that
wasn't biting the idea
Not really
The phone
Rob picks it up
Record Exchange
- ' Laura is curled up on the couch
Dick and Barry keep listing
'm sorry
No, no
When are you going home
In a minute
When  get it together
(to Dick) What about Sabbath
Or Nirvana
They're into death
Rob tries to signal to them to shut up but they don't see him
He moves as far away as the cord will let me
Can  do anything
"Abraham, Martin, and John
" That's a nice one
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz
"Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus
It's got that creepy Halloween feeling
No
No
Mom wants you to come to the funeral
It's on Friday
Me
My dad liked you
And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and
oh,  don't know don't really understand it
think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on
It's like
(small laugh) He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to
Do you want me to be there
don't care
As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand
Rob is silent
Look, are you coming or not
Yes, of course
Liz'll give you a lift
She knows where to go and everything
don't have time to talk, Rob
've got too much to do
Sure
'll see you on Friday
She hangs up
(to the tune of "Candle In the Wind") "Goodbye Laura's dad/blah blah la di da di da/ (belting it out) Seems to me/you lived your life/like a dentist in the wind
Rob stomps toward Barry, who jumps over the counter to keep singing -- '  - and
Rob is in a somber suit, looking through the windshield wipers as Liz drives
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him
It's a crematorium
You're kidding
crematorium
Jesus
What difference does it make
Is Ray going
No
They don't know him
And Ken liked you
Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know
It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story
Isn't that how it is for everybody
Liz and Rob sit in the back of the dark, smallish nondenominational room
At the front is a coffin, resting on a stand
Laura, her younger sister , and her mother sit in the front row, listening to the
Now and forever, Amen
He nods "offstage," and a muffled mechanical noise is heard
The coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it
low, baleful human  is heard, starting quietly but gaining in volume
(
) hear something in Laura's voice, but  know what it is, and at that moment  want to go to her and offer to become a different person, to remove all trace of what is me, as long as she will let me look after her and try to make her feel better
Rob stays back, watching mourners approach Laura and her mother, hugging them
After awhile, Laura sees Rob through the throng, hanging back
She breaks through and to him, holding him close for a long time
(
) And when she let's go of me, feel  don't need to become a different person
It's happened already
' '  - cozy old Victorian house, full of things -- furniture, paintings, ornaments, plants -- which don't go together but which have obviously been chosen with care and taste
Rob and Liz stand, drinking wine
Jo approaches them
(to Jo) How are you
'm all right,  suppose
And Mom's not too bad
But Laura
dunno
She's had a pretty rough few weeks already, without this
It's hard when you're putting all of your efforts into one part of your life and it doesn't work out
She glances at Rob, embarrassed
(sincere) Don't mind me
No problem
Just pretend you're talking about somebody else
Jo smiles, Liz gives him a look
We are talking about somebody else
Laura
Laura and Ray, actually
Rob begins to turn red
Anger, sorrow, everything else building
Enough, Liz
Enough of what
(getting louder) know  can't speak now because Laura's father died, and  just have to take it because otherwise 'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered
Well, 'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, 'm really sorry Jo
(lowering his voice) But you know, Liz
can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself
And maybe you think  should, but it's not much of a life, you know
Maybe 've been a little unfair
But is this really the time
Only because it's never the time can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know
If by "we" you are referring to men, then  have to say that just the once would do
Rob looks around the room, beginning to hyperventilate and near tears
He sees Laura in a corner of the room surrounded by four or five mourners
He crosses to them and breaks through to her
'm sorry
He breaks away from her and slips out the front door
- So darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining torrents and big sheets
Rob emerges from the front door of Laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street, hands thrust into his pockets
The rain almost immediately soaks him
In the distance, Rob runs toward us
As he gets to us we move with him down the street
He is drenched
We hear the rain, and his ragged breath
Headlights appear behind him and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine gets louder
Rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the black wet earth
The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and staring up at the sky
Off-camera the car engine catches up, and a door opens and shuts
He sighs and shuts his eyes
He opens his eyes again, to see Laura's face, wet as well, staring down at him
It is difficult to distinguish rain from tears
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night
Uh
No
But Rob keeps lying there
Laura pulls herself to a sitting position on the wall just above him
You're soaking
Mmnn
You're also an idiot
Rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall next to her
can see why you say that
Look, 'm sorry
really am
The last thing  wanted was
that's why left, because
lost it, and didn't want to blow my top in there, and
look, the reason  fucked everything up was because  was scared
just wanted you to know, that's all
Thank you
appreciate it
can't reciprocate
What do you mean
didn't mess things up because was scared
slept with Ray because was sick of you
And  needed something to snap me out of it
Sure,  understand
Look,  don't want to take up any more of your time
You get back, and 'll wait here for a bus
don't want to go back
What do you want to do
'mon
They swing their legs over the wall and walk to Laura's
'  - They drive sort of aimlessly through Laura's old neighborhood
Laura sees something on her left, and makes a sudden turn up a narrow road through some overgrown trees
They come to a stop in a formerly paved clearing, looking out on a field with an old abandoned school on the other side
Laura shuts down the engine
When are you going back
don't know
Sometime
Later
Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me
What
want to feel something else than this
It's either that or  go home and put my hand in the fire
Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm
've only got a couple left
'm saving them for later
It'll have to be sex, then
She pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger seat and kissing his neck
She pauses and regards him from above
Hello
It doesn't seem so long ago that  looked at you from here
Hi
knew there was a reason  wore a skirt today
Laura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing
You know, with Ray
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again
No, no
It's not
are you still on the pill
Yes, of course
There's nothing to worry about
didn't mean that
mean
was that all you used
Laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry
Look, we can do other things
lived with you
You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried  might kill you, and you're entitled to worry
Isn't that a terrible thing
Isn't that sad
She rolls off of him into her seat
They sit there in silence, watching the rain run down the windshield
: Rob to camera
Later,  wonder if  was really worried about where Ian has been have no idea where he's been, and that gives me every right to insist on protection
But in truth, it was the power that interested me more than the fear
wanted to hurt her, on this day of all days, just because it's the first time since she's left that 've been able to
- Rob and Laura lean back in a booth, facing each other
We get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since we last saw them
Laura
'm too tired not to go out with you
Rob leans forward
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split
But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together
(nodding) Everything's too hard
Maybe another time  would have the guts to be on my own, but not now  don't
What about Ian
Ray's a disaster
don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade,  guess, and blow it all apart
Mission accomplished
know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, 'm sure
just
need you, Rob
That's it
And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so
She looks up at him
Let's go home
Okay
Okay
: Rob to camera
But wouldn't you know it
Suddenly feel panicky, and sick, and  want to run around and sleep with female recording artists
: '  - Post-lovemaking
Rob and Laura lie on their backs
'mon
want to know
Want to know what, exactly
What it was like
It was like sex
What else could it be like
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex
What's the difference
You know the difference
Look, we're okay now
We just had a nice time
Let's leave it at that
Okay, that's cool, okay
But the nice time we just had
was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago
Laura is silent
Oh, c'mon, Laura
Just say something
Lie, if you want
It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better
Well  was gonna lie and now  can't, because you'd know  was lying
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway
To make you feel better
Oh, great
Rob begins to get out of bed
She grabs his hand and pulls him back down
Look, Rob
If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now
And that is my last word on the subject, okay
Okay
She pulls him close and they lie there, the matter seemingly settled
wish your penis was as big as his, though
He turns slowly to her
giggle from her turns into a laugh, then a howl, a roar -- - Rob and Laura walk the cement breakfront
Like Mexico
Or Jamaica
Or New York, even
Hey, great idea
What 'll do is, tomorrow 'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and 'll pay for it that way
'll pay for you
Even though you owe me money
We have to do something with the money  earn
need to
deserve it
You can just think of it as winning the lottery
Fantastic
The Girlfriend Lottery
Money does not matter
do not care how much you earn
'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like
But it wasn't supposed to be like this
When  met you we were the same people and now we're not, and
How
How were we the same people
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger
You wore jeans and -shirts, and so did
And still do, and you don't
Because 'm not allowed to
still do, after work
So, what
Should we just break up
Is that what you're saying
Because if you are, 'm going to run out of patience
No, but
But what
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years 've known you
If we've grown apart, then 'm the one who's done the growing, and all 've done is change jobs
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and
can't go to work with my hair dyed pink
And  can afford to go shopping more now, and 've met a couple people like over the last year or so
You're tougher
More confident, maybe
Harder
Less neurotic
Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life
'm alright
Yeah, you're alright
But you're certainly not happy
So what happens if you get happy
And yes  know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album,  use the reference deliberately to catch your attention
Should we split up because 'm used to you being miserable
What happens if you,  don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success
Time for a new girlfriend
You're being stupid
How
What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice
Rob is silent
All 'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself
Otherwise, what's the use
No use
/
- Rob comes out of the stock room and walks toward the counter where Dick and Barry stare at the tape deck like two concerned doctors, listening to a song that is raw and moody and lyrical -- Minor Threat meets Brian Eno, if that's possible
Rob joins them in contemplation
What is this
It's Vince and Justin
Who's that
The little skate-fuckers
No way
Yes way
It's really
Rob and Dick look at him, ready to pounce -- (pained to say it) It's really fucking good
Dick and Barry look to Rob, who continues to just listen
He takes a deep breath and walks to the front door and out, seemingly with a mission
Vince and Justin are doing noisy skate tricks against the curb across the street
When they see Rob they stop, get ready to flee
He walks across to them
Dick comes out and hovers in the background
Your tape
It's good
They mumble thanks
It's rough
But it shows promise
We record a couple of songs right, in a studio
'll take care of the rest
'll put out your record
Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys
Wait a minute
Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride
We're not there yet, Justin
'm Vince
Whatever
He begins to move toward the store
Vince and Justin look at each other
Rob gets to the door but stops and turns
Hey
What's the name of your band
The Kinky Wizards
What
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair
Nice
What's the name of your label
Rob looks at them
Then at Dick
Then through the window at Barry, inside looking out
Then at his own reflection in the window
Then back at them
Broken Records
Welcome aboard
Rob walks back inside
He seems to be shaking a little
What the fuck is that
What
heard you, man
Don't give me that "what" shit
You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them
So
You even said they're good
around here with a band, Mr
Branson
Mr
Phil Spector
Rob waves him off and disappears into the stock room
Laura enters
Hey, Barry
Oh, hi
Where's Rob
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite
Do you have an appointment
What are you talking about
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary
That's all
Laura puts it together, and smiles
She goes to the back and crack the door, finding Rob sitting on a box, thinking
Hi
Hi
What are you doing
Nothing
Wanna go to dinner
Where
At Paul and Miranda's
Paul from work
Oh
Well
We don't really get along
Paul and
know
But you've never met
It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him
Ha
: Rob to camera
We're at a point where  can't really walk away from gauntlets she might throw down, and so  go
And wouldn't you know it,  sort of fall in love with Paul and Miranda -- with what they have, and the way they treat each other, and the way they make me feel as if 'm the new center of their world
think they're great, and  want to see them twice a week, every week, for the rest of my life
Only right at the end of the evening do  realize 've been set up
'   - After dinner
Rob ambles in from the dining room
Laura close behind
He looks through the bookshelves until he finds a meager little grouping of CDs
He moves up to them and scans the titles: Tina Turner
Billy Joel
Kate Bush
Pink Floyd
Simply Red
The Beatles
The Windham Hill Sampler
Lame, right
Rob turns around to see  behind him
Oh,  don't know
The Beatles are okay
Paul laughs
We're kinda out of date
Hey, to each his own,  say
Maybe we can come by your store and you can hook us up
Sure, sure
Any time
Better hurry, though, Paul
Rob started a record label, so he's gonna be in the shop less and less
Rob looks at her
: '  - as they come in the door
"To each his own
" Unbelievable
You
Rob Gordon said that
You even sounded like you meant it
They throw their jackets over a chair
Rob turns on the player and "Call Me  Liar" by Palace begins to play
(smiling) You did that deliberately
You knew all along 'd like them
It was a trick
tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great
thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way
She moves to Rob and wraps her arms around him
They look deeply at each other
She breaks away from him and walks into the bedroom
He turns off the stereo and follows her
- Rob walks to work, drinking his coffee
He stops and backs up a few feet, and stares at a poster on a plywood board-up
"'   ' '/the debut single from The Kinky Wizards/on Broken Records/Record release party July 20 at The Artful Dodger/Featuring the triumphant return of /"Dance Music For Old People" Rob scowls, and storms off
'  - Rob paces, Laura sits on the couch, smiling
called Dan Koretzky because he -- Has Drag City Records,  know, know
You told Dan Koretzky about this
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record
Especially for what he said, and  quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally
" He helped me put out a press release
Just local, of course
And the "triumphant return of  Rob Gordon
" "Triumphant
" "Return
" had that idea when  was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that  was annoyed we weren't together anymore
It might even be why came back
You had no right
Supposing  was doing something that couldn't be cancelled
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled
That's not the point
mean, what if the single isn't done in time
Barry said its done
Barry
Barry knows about this
Yeah
His band is playing a set
Rob wheels on her
- Rob and Barry
Like fuck you are
Laura said we could
If we helped out with the posters and stuff
And we did
And we are
'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play
We're getting that anyway
What is she doing
Okay, 20%
No
We need the gig
110%
That's my final offer
'm not kidding
That's how much it means to me not to hear you play
We're not as bad as you think, Rob
You couldn't be
Look, Barry
There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums
How are you going to cope with them
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by
They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing
We're called Sonic Death Monkey
Sonic Death Monkey
What do you think
Dick likes it
Barry, you're over thirty years old
You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey
owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that
Over the edge, in fact
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night
That's what we want
Reaction
And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em
Let 'em riot, we can handle it
We'll be ready
Barry wanders off laughing
: '  - Rob and Laura
They'll go on early
Nobody will even be there yet and  told them they can't play for more than a half hour
It's no joke
'm responsible for what happens, you know
Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards
have to put down a deposit for the room
have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them -- We took care of that
Rob's brow furrows
Barry and Dick and me
Look in the bedroom
Rob goes to the bedroom door and opens it
It's sort of like Christmas: hundreds of Kinky Wizards  singles, painstakingly packaged and stacked on the bed
: Rob to camera
suddenly feel choked up
It's not the money, it's the way she's thought of everything: one morning  woke up to find her going through my records, pulling out things that she remembered me playing when  deejayed and putting them into the little carrying cases that  used to use and put away in a closet somewhere years ago
She knew  needed a kick in the ass
She also knew how happy  was when used to deejay
From which every angle  examine it, it still looks as though she's done all of this because she loves me
: ' Rob turns from the bedroom and goes to Laura, putting his arms around her
'm sorry 've been acting like a jerk
do appreciate what you've done for me, and  know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and  do love you, even though  act like  don't
That's okay
You seem pissed off all the time, though
know
don't get it
: Rob to camera
But if  had to take a wild guess, 'd say that 'm pissed because know 'm stuck with Laura, bound to her, and  don't like it
That dreamy anticipation you have when you're fifteen or twenty or thirty even, that the most perfect person in the world might walk into your store or office or friend's party at any moment
That's all gone,  think, and that's enough to piss anybody off
Laura is who  am now, and it's no good pretending otherwise
: - Rob is standing shelves
very pretty young woman, , comes through the door and looks around
She sees Rob
Excuse me
Rob looks up and takes her in like a dish in a window
May  help you
'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon
Uh
That's me
'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader
want to do a story on you
Right
Why
Well,  used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and  saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now
Oh
Okay
thought  would ask you a few questions if that's okay
Huh
You used to come to the club
shouldn't have let you in
You must have only been about sixteen
Rob realizes what he must be sounding like
He blushes and retreats
What  mean is,  didn't mean you look young
You don't
You don't look old either
You look just as old as you are
bit younger maybe, but not a lot
Not much
Just right
So
Is now a good time
Rob looks around: there is absolutely nothing going on in the store
He nods
She pulls out a pad and pencil
Right
So
You must have an enormous record collection
Yeah
could show it to you if you want to come over and see it
He winces immediately
Yeah, well
Let's see
What are you're all-time top five records
Pardon me
Your desert island top-five
Oh boy
In the club, or at home
Is there a difference
(a little too shrill) Well yeah, a bit
"Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but wouldn't play it at the club
It's a country-rock ballad
Everybody'd go home
Nevermind
Any five
So four more
What do you mean, four more
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing -- Can  go home and work this out and let you know
In a week or so
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter
'll do one
My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger
Rob is aghast, humiliated, quietly outraged
Oh, 'm sure  can manage something
"Sin City
" "New Rose," by The Damned
"Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic
"Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway
um
"Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley
And
"Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone
bit controversial,  know, but
Fine
That's great
Is that it
Well,  wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time
Sure, but is that it for the list
That's five
So
Why did you decide to deejay again
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it
So
(looking over her pad at the list) should really put a James Brown in there -- Nice friend
Yeah
What's his name
Who
Oh
My friend
My friend is Laura
girl
friend who's a girl
"Music for Old People
" What does that mean
Look, 'm sorry about this, but 'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there
Instead of "Sin City
" She scribbles and writes
Okay
"Dance Music For Old People
" Oh, you know
a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that
They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them
And the new label
And the Kinky Wizards
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what
Why don't  just make you a tape
Would you
Really
Wow
could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home
Haha
Right
It's no problem love making tapes
: Rob to camera
good compilation tape, like breaking up, is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem
You gotta kick off with a killer, to hold the attention
Then you have to take it up a notch, but not blow your wad, so maybe cool it off a notch, and you can't put the same artist twice on the tape, except if some subtle point or lesson or theme involved, and even then not the two of them in a row, and you can't woo somebody with Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi" and then bash their head off with something like 's "City Baby Attacked by Rats," and
oh, there are a lot of rules
Anyway,  worked hard at this one
'  - Rob sits Indian-style on the floor in front of the stereo
He has a pad of paper with scrawled titles and cross-outs, and is surrounded by piles of CDs and records
Who's that for
Rob winces, turns
He's busted
This
Oh, just that woman who interviewed me for The Reader
Carol
Caroline
Something like that
Laura turns and walks out of the room
- Rob is tucked into the corner, on the phone
Hi, Caroline
Oh, it's Rob
Yeah, listen,  have a new list for you and -- Oh
Yes
Of course
Well maybe next week they could print a, uh, retraction
Or a correction
Because the list  have now it really much more -- right
Okay
Anyway, have your tape
That's right
Shall  mail it to you
Or
would you like to have a drink
: Rob to camera
How are you not going to fall for someone who wants to interview you
Now Caroline is all  can think about
And in the daydreams  imagine every detail, the entire story of our future relationship, until suddenly  realize that there's nothing left to actually, like, happen
've done it all, lived through it all in my head know the whole plot, the ending, and the good parts
Now 'd have to watch it all over again in real time, and where's the fun in that
And fucking--when is it all going to stop
Am  going to jump from rock to rock for the rest of my life until there aren't any rocks left
Am going to bolt every time  get itchy feet
Because  get them about once a quarter, along with the store's tax bill
've been thinking with my guts since  was fourteen years old and, frankly speaking, 've come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains
You know what's wrong with Laura, what my problem is
What's wrong with Laura is that 'll never see her for the first or second or third time
That's all
Fuck it
'll probably mail the tape
Probably
: - Rob sits at a table in the bar, nervous
He watches the door, sits up straight when it opens, and follows someone with his eyes, all the way to his table
She sits
It's Laura
drinking lunch on a school day
What a nice surprise
Rob says nothing
Are you worried about tomorrow night
Not really
He plays with his drink
Are you going to talk to me, or shall get my paper out
'm going to talk to you
Right
He plays with his drink some more
What are you going to talk to me about
'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not
To me
Ha ha ha
Hoo hoo hoo
mean it
know
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch
'm sorry
But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you
Not in love, exactly, but
Well forgive me if  don't think of you as the world's safest bet
Would you marry me if  was
No
Probably not
Right
Okay, then
Shall we go
Don't sulk
What brought all this on
don't know
Very persuasive
Are you persuadable
No
don't think so
'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days
Fair enough
Fair enough
So
'm just sick of thinking about it all the time
About what
This stuff
Love and marriage want to think about something else
've changed my mind
That's the most romantic thing 've ever heard
do
will
Shut up
'm only trying to explain
mean, maybe you're right
But were you really expecting me to say yes
dunno
Didn't think about it, really
It was the asking that was the important thing
Well, you've asked
She leans over and takes his hands in hers, smiles at him
Thank you
- with the mixer in the middle
"Just Begun" by Jimmy Castor spins on turntable #1
hand reaches in, and begins to draw the slides down, quieting the music
Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst the instruments
The place is packed with people, and everyone seems to be having a great time
Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him and mocks a bulimic act
Rob gives him the finger
He sees Laura, and she beams at him
He comes to the front of the stage, and taps a microphone
Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight
hope you have a good time
And hope you like the record
The one by the Kinky Wizards
The record that we're having this record release party for
(hoots from the crowd) Thanks
Listen to it first, though
(laughs) Okay
We'll get to that later
Right now, 'd like to introduce
(mumbles) Sonic Death Monkey
Good-natured applause
Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura
Barry and his crew mount the stage
Rob takes a big gulp of beer
(to Laura) 'm an idiot
should have played the record first
This place is about to get burned down
It's gonna be fine
These people are ready for anything
(dubious) Yeah, well
Barry stands in front of the mic, surveying the crowd with a smile
He and the band all wear suits and ties
Thanks for the enthusiastic intro, Rob
We're not called Sonic Death Monkey anymore, though, ladies and gentlemen
We might be on the verge of becoming the Atavistics, but we haven't decided yet
But tonight, we are --And they launch into Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It Up," almost flawlessly faithful to the original
Barry is transformed -- shuffling footwork, a wide smile, and when the intro winds up, an almost perfect falsetto
The crowd goes nuts, filling the floor
Rob is stunned, begins to smile
Laura takes his hand and leads him out into the crowd
