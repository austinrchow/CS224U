Written by Josh Klausner June 11, 2008 : - modest city bedroom
Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes sit on one side of the room
Sc_-orLe's -moving in
In his bathrobe,  , a good looking guy in his mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of organized all over the bed
Just as he finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful , in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap
Hey, hey
Careful Clara
You were the one who told me not to mess up the precious picture piles
he gives him a long, slow kiss
( '  ) Minty fresh
That was nice
It was nice
Hey from now on when you change the toilet paper, could you just make sure it is out
() Wow
She moves in and the honeymoon's over
Oh, believe me, we're just getting started, Phil
(reaches into picture pile) Look at this one of your Mom with me mean that woman can't contain her 'Love
the wedding picture: , Clara's,mother, stands stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle deep in a manure bin
() She just takes a while to warm up
You guys are gonna be best buddies
You picked a favorite of us yet

Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara
(') That's exactly the one  picked
Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed
It's a
They look joyous, excited
young couple with the world in front of them
Man,  wish  was them
Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades as she stares at the picture
He notices
(') just
when  was growing up my Mom and Dad had a picture just like this
Now they can't even acknowledge each other
Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze
(') Let's always remember to have some time that's just for the two of us
No matter what else comes up in our lives - if it's work or friends or when we have kids- We're having kids
With an ""
( ) fine
But  promise you it's never gonna happen to us
Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that when 'm long in the tooth
You'll be even hotter long toothed
Right now to be honest Clara they're a little stumpy
( Oh really
As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and turns off the light
Suddenly, we hear the piles of pictures     and hit the ground
Beat
(') Phil
Tell me it wasn't the pictures
wasn't the pictures
You know how long that took
We'll fix the picture piles, Clara
We've got all the time in the world
From now on everything's gonna be just about us
Suddenly, a   breaks through the darkness
(
0
) The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks '  7   - Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an on a side table reads 6:45 am
(
) Mo-om
It's    as Phil and Clara stir
-id groan in bed
Clara has the comforter while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a -shirt
Without saying a word, they rise out of each side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the hall and Phil to the bathroom
(
) (') Mom
Mom
Mom
'm coming, Ollie
'  - As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's bed while , 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor
Phil showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack of  in his hand
Uh Phil
Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers
Yep
need to switch
've got an open house
Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but contains it
Really
Yeah
Really
As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands together
, so  say today we go for the slacker look - cool yet approachable
Yeah, well Mom says that
Ollie points to a   laid out on a chair
Oh
Well
that's cool too
' / - The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly through the bedroom
She lets out a  as her shin '   - he's left them open
She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then stops in the doorway
covers the floor
Grabbing a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror
As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's  as well
Ech
Mine
She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of razor hairs and bits of toothpaste
Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to discover it's
She tosses the box in the trash and shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper
Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the holder, turns it around and puts it back so it
As the  , the Talking Heads song fad Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits at the table
Phil finally notices
What
Breakfast
( ) Oh
Yeah, sorry
Your Dad's a boob today
What's it gonna be
Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign of his tom
How about
some Captain Crunch
Phil gets an idea and writes zickly
() Captain Crunch
The cereal
Uh
yeah
Sure
Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed in a suit, comes into the room and spots it
Ah ah ah
what's that Ollie
You had a bowl yesterday
But Dad already said yeah sure
Clara glances at Phil
said it
said it ) () (') Yeah, sure
You know it's only one bowl - ( ) week
One bowl a day a week
Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already in Phil's hand
Phil shakes the carton at Ollie
(') This is not for you today
() Yeah right
() Worth a try
Did you get his lunch together
Oh
Whoops
() You just get his breakfast and 'll do it
As Phil takes out some Special  and pours milk for Ollie and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton
Peeking back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch
He stealthily pours the   of milk back, quickly returning the carton to the fridge
(') ( ) Hey Jane
'm getting a late start but 'll be there as soon as  can
Sorry  dropped the ball
It's this Quarterly Report to Mr
Rivers today
You know how he freaks me out with all of his mixed animal metaphors that  don't - (focusing on Ollie's lunch) Ollie, do you want a banana
7
Did you hear me
(not looking at him) Uh huh
He freaks you out with his mixed animal metaphors that you don't understand
Banana Ollie
() So  should probably get going
With the highway construction it takes forever to get downtown these days
Have a good day
Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it off
He looks at her strangely
Noticing, Clara quickly kisses Phil on the cheek
-- ( '  ) Sorry
Your mouthy was still ail milky
Sorry for the milky mouth
He heads out
With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1i121 dirty glass on the counter
She cleans it in the sink, then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk in her own coffee
comes out
Shaking her head, she tosses the carton in the trash
'   - As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor  picks a newspaper off his lawn
(
) Well, well
We're up bright and early, aren't we
Yes we are
(under his breath) ike you say to me every morning
Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and Clara's
He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara' car is parked   and the door only opens a few inches
He tries to ''-- , but ends up halfway
(') Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and peers around the other side of Clara's
of room
Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger side
piled in the garage block the front passenger door
Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's seat
- The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as blocks 3 out of 4 lanes
In the middle of it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated
Peering out his window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in slick suit and construction hat
The sign reads Phil scowls, then checks his watch
Clara and , another sharply dressed realtor in her 30's, walk down the street putting up on the sidewalk
His name's Juan and he's some kind of Spanish,  think
He knows all these exclusive, underground places downtown
It's so exciting
And in bed
() never knew  could still get my leg back that far
Too much information, Jane
Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each move quickly around different parts of the vacant home, cleaning and inspecting
The divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me
Seriously
You know that great nervous feeling in your stomach
Where you don't know what's going to happen next
On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on the wall
She reaches into her large purse and pulls out a mini-409 mister and a rag
With the aim of a , she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she passes
(
) (') With Larry,  lost that
Everything had just become routine, you know
Boring
Jane's words hit Clara close to home
Passing on through the kitchen, Clara notices that the  makes a weird, loud buzzing noise
(') But now, all of a sudden 'm alive again
Good for you, Jane
Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki the side and silencing it
(') Good for you
- Clara and Jane sit on the floor, together prospectuses
There's this g---eat restaurant downtown we went to the ot__ar night that you guys would love
_"st amazing view of the city
You guys should check it out on your next date night
(focusing on stapling) Yeah, well, maybe
We don't really have those that much anymore
't have date nights: (shrugs), You know, we're pretty tired all the time between work and Ollie
And some of the shows on  these days are really great
Ah
see
10
1I121 They staple in silence for a second
Jane and Clara look at each other
know that's really lame
So it's Phil
() No, it's not Phil
It's the both of us
don't know
It just
happened
So why don't you change it
All you have to do is stir things up and have one great, sexy, exciting night again
guess
Maybe
Not maybe
Tonight
Nah
Tonight's no good
Why not
Seriously think about it
What's really gonna be more important tonight than that
Clara takes this in
Jane's right
Checking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
In the pits all around him,  and scream out their orders
' In a dark wood office with   'i12   lining the walls, a young, smartly dressed man in his 20's, , quietly goes through a binder with
, 60, at the older man's desk
As Phil bursts in they both look over
'm sorry 'm late
The construction on the highways is insane these days
Don't worry about it, Phil
It's fine
Catch your breath
George gives Mr
Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil
Phil nods back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch into his report
(') Uh, Phil
Listen, before we start
've been thinking
this next quarter we need to venture into open tundra
Start really ripping the meat
(beat, trying to decipher) Uh
You mean
take the fund in a more high risk direction
Yeah
That's wha:  - -aid
Sure
, fine
can work up some higher risk options and come back tomorrow
( ) The thing is Phil, tomorrow  want George to give me his thoughts on where we need to be hunting too
Oh
s nothing personal
() So let me get this straight
You're telling me that tomorrow 'm going to have to interview for the job  already have
Against George
wouldn't put it like that
Just need our pack leader to be more like
like a momma kangaroo
Ya get me
Kinda
() Actually, no
Not really at all
12
The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its momma's teat is just always there, ready to suckle
But at the same time, momma kangaroo's still a wild, dangerous creature
Sorry
Still not totally getting you
've had a wife and a family
Three of them
It's hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack, Phil
George lives in the city, doesn't have a family to worry about
He can rip the meat
Listen, Mr
Rivers
don't need to
was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when George was still
in the jungle
() What does that mean
can't be demoted, Mr
Rivers
just can't
Listen, nothing's set
It's just  gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little
well
tame
( ) That's all you needed to say, Mr
Rivers
'll see you tomorrow
Determined, Phil marches out of Mr
River's office
Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from school
So it's  if we drop him off at 7
Our reservation's at 7:45
She passes another  desperately searching for a Kleenex for her  with snot dripping from his nose
13
Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini- bottle of Purell and cleans her hands
(') ( ) Thanks Mom
really appreciate it
(
) Mrs
Foster
Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned , 45, walking toward her in the parking lot
Oh, that's Ollie's teacher
'll see you later
Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs
Cardigan with a warm smile
(') 've been meaning to tell you that you can just call me Clara, Mrs
Cardigan
'd prefer Mrs
Foster
Boundaries matter
1I121 Can we speak a moment
Alone
Sure, sure
Ollie, go to the car
As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs
Cardigan
(') Is everything
Well, 'm afraid not
Oliver's been antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately
Especially Jenny Diggs
Really
Oh no
Why do you think that's happening
'm going to leave that to you and your nd to figure out
But beyond that, ,i: overall attitude these days is just
sub par () 14
(') His penmanship is sloppy
He lacks motivation and tries to just "get by" o assignments
You know, this is a very competitive school, Mrs
Foster
In my opinion, maybe you should consider whether this is really the right environment for him
(beat, stunned) Uh
wow
Mrs
Cardigan starts away
Clara climbs into the car, watching Mrs
Cardigan
(') (under her breath) Wow
What a bitch
Did you just call Mrs
Cardigan a bitch
(remembering Ollie's in the ) No
Yeah you did
didn't
really didn't
Clara quickly pulls out
- Phil  out of his drivers seat with folders full of
As he walks toward the house he spots the of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes his head
Unbelievable
'  - Still carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who packs a suitcase
Hey buddy
Finally moving out
gotta tell you it's about time
'm going to Nana's tonight
15
On a school night
Why
() Mom says you guys are going out
Tonight
What
No
( ) Clara
'  - Phil marches into the bedroom
Clara
Cl- He stops in the doorway as he spots her
Made up in an evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara looks  as she finishes putting an earring on
(') Wow
Wow
Clara tns and smiles
thought  could take you out to celebrate you finally getting that report in
romantic dinner downtown like the old days, and teen
(raises :,er eyebrows) Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have the house all to ourselves
All night
Wow
It sounds
great
Great
She turns back and continues getting ready
It's just
is there any chance we coul take a rain check
() "rain check"
Yeah
Unfortunately  really need to do a bit of work tonight 16
thought all the cramming was for this report today
Did something go wrong
() Uh, no
Nothing like that
just decided  could play with it a little more
Make it a little better
Clara takes him in a moment
Oh
Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry back in the case
Listen, 'm sorry
You don't need to apologize, Phil
Listen, if  had more warning- Then something else would have come up
You know it
That's the thing, Phil
We used to do things on the spur of the moment all the time
Even after Ollie was born
Now we never do anything together
They stare at each other, then Phil breaks Listen
any other night
Maybe another time
Let me just get out of this and call my Mom then
As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her, feeling terrible
About to leave, he notices that around the room, Clara's    in anticipation of their romantic night
He looks down again at the papers in his hand and sucks in, conflicted
- As Clara starts to take her dress off, Phil scoots past her, humming to himself
She looks over to see him choosing a tie and jacket from his side
Clara looks him, still unsure
17
That dress really wasn't playing fair, Clara
With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie
(') Well get a move on, girl
She zips her dress back up
' , Clara's mother, opens her front door and brightens
(to Clara and Ollie) Hey sweeties
( ) Phil
Ruth
Nana rented us a special treat tonight before bed, Ollie
The Wizard of Oz
, Wow
Wizard of Oz
Don't you think that's a little scary for a 5 year old
(not looking at him) No, Phil,  don't
not so sure about that
Clara
What do you think
(putting her pressure on) Yeah, Clara
What do you think
18
Phil's flustered as he and Clara head out the door towards Phil's car
'm sorry, Phil
just felt like she's doing us a favor tonight
fine
Fine
oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops
You know,  should pee before we go
() Sure
As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in the driver's seat
(') 'll just wait in the car as you go back inside to pee
Again
- As the sun sets, Phil and Clara sit in It extends for  toward the center of the city
- Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents
You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor Diggs
Tries to widen all the highways to get reelected, but all everyone's going to remember when it's time to vote is all this mess
You're hot
Yeah
That's why  turned on the air
19A Clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes  to out of Phil's vents, into his face
He glances at Clara, oblivious, then reaches over and turns down the air
(') You know, Mrs
Cardigan told me today that Ollie's been antagonizing his daughter
Antagonizing
How does a five year old "antagonize
" 'm sure she wouldn't have mentioned it if it wasn't "the Mayor's daughter
" She also went on that Ollie's penmanship's sloppy and he's not motivated enough
(trying to make a joke of Got all my best traits, huh
He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,, not responding - a response in itself
He sucks in
(') think he's fine
She actually had the gall to suggest we should think about sending him somewhere else
Maybe she's right if the school has that kind of attitude
Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a breath, playing affection-
-ely with the back of Phil's hair
You know what
All we ever end up talking about is Ollie or work
Let's just focus on us tonight
) Great
'm all for tha Beat
They sit in silence in the traffic
Ga
So what are you thinking about
Right now
Traffic
Oh
Well,  heard this unbelievable story from Jane today
Yeah
She has this old classmate who went into labor with her second child the other day
She's totally healthy and everything's normal with the pregnancy
So she goes into labor and walks into the emergency room, and the second the nurses and attendants see her come in, they go into a panic and start yelling ,
ATMiA
What's
Advanced Maternal Age
() No
You've got to be joking me
kid you not
That's unbelievable
know
Beat
Clara looks out the window
(') The funny thing is she's my age, actually
Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible ulterior motive
Huh
21
Clara picks up on his change and figures out what he's thinking
bit flustered, she opens her vents again
Phil looks over at her
(') thought you were cold
was, but then you turned it down and got hot
But  turned it down because
you see when you open and close your vents it makes my
never mind
Phil reaches over and turns up the air again
Tapping his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up, suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding toward the exit
What are you doing
'm just gonna take a shortcut
Phil, please don't
You think they're shortcuts but they always take longer
And we're already- Clara, please just trust me, They zoom ahead for a moment in silence
Frustrated, Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a onto Phil's face
Biting his tongue, he just leaves it blowing on him as they drive
Phil and Clara rush off the elevator and enter the Signature Restaurant on the 95t Flcor of the John Hancock Center, with dramatic s- Lng views over skyline of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan
promise you it wouldn't have been any faster
promise
, Phil
Will you just tell them we're here
'm gonna go pee
1I121 22
Now
What
Nothing
As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his way through the crowds to the
Good evening
Welcome to the Signature Room
Thanks
The name is Foster
Foster
Oh, 'm sorry
We just had give away your table
You gave away our table
We're just ten minutes late
) Actually, you're 11 minutes late
() But don't you guys have, like, some kind of grace period or something
have an eight minute grace period
You have an eight minute grace period
How did you come up with an eight minute grace period
() just work here, So what if someone's 9 minutes late
We're allowed to give a two minute grace on the grace
23
Which adds up to ten minutes
We're 11 minutes late
That's just one minute later than the grace on the grace
'm sorry sir, but management specifically said no grace on the grace on the grace
After ten minutes, we send a host around calling your name and if there's no answer, we give the table away
Sorry
So how long's the wait for another table
Well, let's see
Phil looks on as the Supermodel Hostess runs her finger down a    -
As she turns to the next page
Oh boy
'  - Even the bathroom has sweeping views of Chicago
As Clara leaves a bathroom stall, she notices a washing her face over and over
knock and a    quickly peeks his head in the Women's room
We've gotta leave now
( ) Whoops
Sorry
It's
The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the Man
Clara looks after them a second, then washes her hands
- Clara finds Phil at the bar, downing handfuls of peanuts
How lc= -until they seat us
24
Two hours
They gave away our reservation
Peanut
What
Did you tell them that we hit traffic
They wouldn't care, Clara
If they call your name at the bar and you don't answer, they give your table away
So how about a nut
(not the Hostess) mills around the bar
Clara sighs, frustrated
mean, did you try something like telling her it was our anniversary, or my birthday, or slipping her some money- Oh,  see
Lying and graft were the answer
Clara shakes her head, then notices the searching for the party and starts focusing on him instead of Phil as she thinks
'm sure if you had been there instead of peeing again you would have done it better
( ) You're not even listening to me, are you
(repeats, still watching) Yeah  am
You're sure if  had been there instead of peeing again  would have done it better
25 Clara, Just because you can repeat the words  say doesn't mean you're- - Sorry
We're right here
Wait
What are you doing
Shhh
The Young Host approaches
Gale party of three
The third's running a little going to start without them
eat
Follow me
Phil shoots Clara a look, but she ignores it
He falls into line after her as she follows the Young Host to th restaurant
- hields his face as they pass the Supermodel Hos at the Greeting Station
The Young Host leads them secluded table right by the windows - (handing them menus) Enjoy your dinner
The Young, Host leaves
See
Was that so hard to do, Phil
bad to be the Gales, eh
Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the restaurant
(') Look Phil
It's white truffle season
'm totally doing it
26
We can't do this, Clara
'm taking you out
Not the truffles
( ) This is stealing
() Stealing
You're kidding, right
We're not the Gales
So
You said yourself - if you don't answer at the bar they give your table away
Well, what if they show up now
2 u get spanked' 'm serious
( ) don't know
What if they do, Phil
Clara picks up her menu and reads, shaking her head
What
It's just
don't know
You used to be the one who would think up stuff like this all the time
This hits Phil
He takes in his wife reading the menu for a beat
You know what
You're absolutely right
Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for what feels like the first time tonight
(') 'm sorry, Mrs
Gale
27
() It's , Mr
Gale
And might  add you look very handsome tonight
You're not looking too shabby yours Mrs
Gale
(
) Mr
Gale
They turn, surprised, to see    in suits at their table
The Older of the two politely speaks to them
We need to have a word with you both
What's this about
k you know what this is about
you could please come with us
Why can't we talk here
u ' (beat, smiles) think it would save everyone a lot of embarrassment
(gestures with hand) Please
The Younger Burly Man comes behind Clara's chair to pull it out
Getting up, Phil shoots Clara an " told you so" look as he follows the older Burly Man through the restaurant toward the kitchen doors, the Younger Burly Man walking behind them with Clara
- The Burly Man leads them through the kitchen stops, surprised
Can  help you
s _ i12' Nah
We're fine Walking to the rear service elevator, the Older Burly Man pushes the down button
The elevator opens
28
Whoa
Wait a minute
Where are we going
Get in, please
The Younger Burly Man coming up behind them crowds them into the elevator
Hey
Jesus
The elevator doors shut and the older Burly Man pushes the  Floor then nods to his partner
They reach in their pockets
Listen, this is all getting out of hand, admit we maybe did something a teeny bit wrong, but- Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting over their noses and mouths
Phil and Clara veil and struggle for a moment, then
' An   waves back and forth under Phil's nose and he startles awake, disoriented, to see he's in the middle of a on a tripod aims at their faces and across the room, the Younger Burly Man sorts through items from Clara's purse and Phil's wallet scattered all over the table
Whoa
What the hell is this
Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older Burly Man waves the stick under her nose
() Phil
What's going on
don't know
speaks from a speakerphone on the table The chloroform may make you feel dizzy for a few moments, but it will go away
29
Phil takes in what's going on, freaked
Listen
you can just have all our money,
Whatever's there, it's yours
We're not looking to cause problems or put up any kind fight
We'll just walk away and not report anything,
All we want is for you to let us go unharmed
We need to discuss your little stunt tonight first, Mr
and Mrs
"Gale
" Or should we say
what is it Harry
, the Younger Burly Man reads Phil and Clara's IDs, which he's grabbed off of them
Phil and Clara Foster
() That's what this is abo else would it be about, Mr
Foster () Wait
`'This a joke, right
Some funny little bald guy's gonna jump out and scare us and say, "Gotcha
" or somethi , where is he
Where's that guy
You think this is a joke
Phil looks at the faces of the two thugs
No one's joking
() No
Are you insane
You don't drug people and tie them up for that
This i just-  hope you know this is gonna go way beyond a shitty review in Za 'm seriously pissed off
talks on a phone as he looks at a screen showing Phil and Clara in chairs
30
1I121 Yes
Well, 'm a little upset as well, Mr
Foster
And confused
It would help me to know why a couple like the two of you would try to pull something like this
Phil's now getting really annoyed
You must be kidding
Like a million people don't do it every single night of the week
This is unbelievable
'm just in shock here
Harry and Frank look at each other, puzzled
enjoy your humor, Mr
Foster
Now why don't you start by telling me how you got into the Rainbow to set it uD- "Into the Rainbow
" What the hell's that
Restaurant code
-and then you can tell me where the photos are that you arranged to bring tonight
Photos
Clara figures out what's happened
Wait a minute
think there's been a really big mistake here
We're not the Gales
know you're not the Gales
They know we're not the Gales
Don't you get it
No, Phil
think they think we're actually "the Gales" who made the reservation tonight
31
() Ohhhhhh
Oh
No
She's right
We're not those Gales
You've got the wrong people
Really
Then why were you two at the Gales' table, Mr
Foster
, listen, what happened is we lost our reservation and when the host came around yelling the Gales' name and no one answered, my wife said that we were them
swear on my life to you that's what happened
You're saying you just took someone else's reservation you didn't know
That's what you want me to believe
know that seems really weird
Listen, agree, that's what  said to her
One problem with your story
When  came over to the table - and you guys were all alone - you were still calling each other Gale
That was just
we were
no, you don't understand
We'll need to move things along, Frank
With a nod, Frank reaches into his pockets, slowly taking out a  and a handful of
He loads the gun as Phil and Clara watch
Wait a minute
What's going on
don't t don't like this
Clicking the loaded gun, Frank and Harry both come toward Phil and Clara
1I121 32
If in ten seconds you don't tell us where the photos are, you lose a knee, Mr
Foster
Ten more seconds, you lose another
Then we go to your wife
Please
You can't do this
We're not lying
One
two
three
four
Frank clicks the loaded gun at Phil's knee
Oh Jesus
Don't do it
Five
six
seven
eight
Jesus
Everyone looks over
Phil's surprised
(') But we can't just tell you where they are
We have to take you to them
- In the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows them
As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the keys back to Harry
You drive with her in front
() So what's your plan here
() don't have a plan Phil
() You don't have a plan
33
() No
was just trying to keep our knees for the time being
() Well, if we end up in that car with them we're as good as dead
Quiet
() Well, any time you want to help
() What's that supposed to mean
said quiet
They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing hard
Suddenly, his expression changes and he star s weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead
Phil
He drops to the ground
Whoa
Phil
What is it
'm
not feeling so great
's wrong with him
: don't know
( ) didn't
eat dinner and when  don't my blood sugar
Hypoglycemic
You're not hypoglycemic
Phil shoots Clara a quick 34
(') ( ) You're diabetic
You never get the terms right, Phil
Oh no
This is bad, guys
just can't
go any further
Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do
Should we call Mr
Stockton
Don't say his name, you idiot
Sorry
was just- We'll just throw him in the back and have her show us
hey move over to pick up Phil
Clara thinks fast
Wait
In my purse there's a Luna Bar
If you give it to me  can find it for him
With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse
She rummages inside
and quickly   her  409 , spritzing Frank right in the eyes
With a shriek, he falls back grabbing his face and dropping his gun
Clara makes a dash and grabs it
As Frank blindly lunges after her, she
He collapses on the ground, whimpering in pain
She spins and points the gun at Harry
(') Drop the gun and the keys
oa
Clara
No Harry drops them, raising his hands
Phil gets up and grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the gun
Harry looks at him, confused
Ow
Why, man
35
Sorry
i was trying to knock you out
Why, ought that's what you do when- Phil
Just c'mon
) Sorry
Befuddled, Phil meets Clara at the car and they climb in and speed away
(
0
) (') , let me just start from the very beginning
- Phil excitedly chatters next to Clara at a table in an interrogation room in the police station
Across the table, a    takes their statement We got to the restaurant late because we hit all this traffic on the highway- the shortcut
What
) just think we might have made it on time if we stayed on the highway
Your shortcuts end up being long cuts most o the time
() , are you going to tell the Policeman or and  gonna tell him
You can tell him
Because you always interrupt me when try to tell stories, and every time you do it disrupts my flow
Fine, you tell it
won't say another word
Fine
() See, now 've totally lost where  was
You got to the restaurant late- Yeah
Even using my shortcut which, by the way, was a shortcut - and they gave away our reservation
So we were at the bar and the host was calling out for these other people over and over- Which is what they do right before they cancel a reservation anyway
thought you said you weren't going to interrupt me, Clara
just want him to understand we weren't really "stealing" someone else's Across the table, the Young Police officer, eyebrows raised, watches Phil and Clara volley back and forth
Do you think he really cares, Clara
were just kidnapped,  and almost shot
don't think he's going turn around and book us for reservation theft
Am  right
Please
Go on
So all of a sudden Clara yells out that we're these other people
() You just took someone else's reservation
37
Yeah
know
Even the guy on the speakerphone couldn't believe it
You two kinda bonded over that, didn't you
We didn't "bond" over it
'm just saying, speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do
Guys, you lost We were in the restaurant
( ) Ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who's kidnapped and drugged us thinks it's weird to do so it's weird to do
Guys
You're new "buddy
" Oh c'mon
And we found out speakerphone guy's name, Phil
It's Mr
Stockton
The Young Policeman looks up, interested
Mr
Stockton
Hold on a minute
The Officer dials an extension on the phone
'-) Lieutecant Manning
i12eeird story
Havea couple '
n here who claim --o have escaped a kid- 7-ng this evening and the name Stockt came up
Will do
He hangs up
(') Lieutenant Manning likes to be notified ere's anything involving Mr
n
38
Wait
So you already know about this guy
You know who he is
knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's, , enters the room with a smile
He reaches over and shakes their hands
How do you do
Lieutenant Manning
The Officer offers him his note pad
(') Nah, as long as they're here might as well get everything from the horse's mouth, right
As the Officer heads out of the room, Lieutenant Manning sidles down into his seat
(') Can  get you guys anything to drink
Coffee
Water
Maybe a shot or two of r whiskey
1 1 That sounds more like So why don't you tell me all about your incident with Mr
Stockton
You tell it, Clara
Oh, don't be like that, Phil
Please
Guys
you've obviously been through something traumatic tonight
Thankfully it's over and you're both safe and sound
Maybe you should cut each other a little bit more of a break
Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air
Manning's right
Seriously, Clara
You tell him
__ Well, we never a
t_::ally "met" Stockton
() 39
(`) He was in another room on a speakerphone where these guys who kidnapped us took us
But he was obviously the one pulling the strings
Who is this Stockton guy anyway
'' () Let me fill you in on all that later
Now, why would he have wanted to kidnap you two
Honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but it's because we sat down at the wrong table tonight for dinner
(looks up, interest Really
The wrong table
We pretended to be someone else who didn't show up for their reservations
My idea
And it turned out that these people must have something this Mr
Stockton wants
1I121 Do you know what
() Photos
Lieutenant looks up, interested, then writes again
That's all you know
Phil and Clara look at each other
Nod
- (') 'm just confused about one thing
When you took this other reservation, how did you know for sure that the real Gales weren't going to show up late
() Excuse me
How were you so sure the Gales weren going to show up if you don't know the at all
Clara looks down at the table, furrowing her brow
Clara
Sorry
lost my train of thought
Well,  can pick things up then
Phil notices Clara giving him a
(') What
Why are you looking at me like that
(intensifying the look) 'm not looking at you like anything
doesn't pick up on it
Shrugs
1I121 , well,  had the same question for her when we sat down, which she thought was - Rubbing her forehead, Clara  Phil's leg  under the table
(') Jesus
Clara stink-eyes Phil , trying to get the message across
(') And there's that look again
look
No
Looking
At all
Lieutenant Manning reaches into his jacket pocket and checks the number on the cellphone
He hops up
Can you excuse me a moment
41
utenant Manning gets up and exits the room
Clara does to the window in the door and watches him walk down the hall to his office as he talks on the phone
Phil puts his leg on the table, pulling up his pant leg to inspect
, 'm not dense, Clara
That was not an accident and if those weren't looks- Phil, we're in trou What are you talking about
He's in on this
He's got something to do with it
The police guy
Clara, that's tota - never told him about the Gale What do you mean
He said, "How did you know the Gales weren't coming
"  never told him that was the name of the reservation we be  said it to the other He didn't take the other notes, Phil
Remember
s hil as well
Oh God
How do we get out of here
'  - Manning talks in his off ice
42
Uh huh
know you don't
It will be contained
Right now
Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through the police station to the interview room
He stops in the doorway
it's
Confused, he turns to an  outside at the desk
(') Where'd they go
They said you were done with them
Manning walks quickly back to his office
Sitting behind his desk, Manning enters a password on his computer and starts typing out an
We are   on the computer screen as the words come - Clara drives as Phil scans the rearview mirror from the passenger seat
We can't just go to another police station, Phil
We don't know how big this is
It might not just be Manning
Well then we're screwed
Who do we go to
The
The
( ) They're not going to believe us over a Police Lieutenant
() Shit
This is their car, Phil
We gotta lose it too
Searching the street, Clara spots a
She whips the wheel around, trying to parallel park into the space
43
RI12 You've got it, Clara
Spin it back now
just let me do it, She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb
(') Dammit
hate this
It's all right
You just should have spun it when  told you to
Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again
(') rn
Quick
Would you stop it
You're stressing me out
Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, the car behind them and setting off a loud ` Hearing the alarm, a   rushes out of a restaurant nearby, looking at them
Hey
You just hit my The Large Man stomps toward them
Run
Phil and Clara get out of the car and run away on The Large Man marches over and inspects his bumpe yells after them
Assholes
They catch their breath in the alley
So we've got no car
They know where we live
So where can we- ( ) shit
44
Clara's eyes go wide as it hits her as well
Ollie
Phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials, listening as Ruth
() Hello
Suddenly,    over the phone
Oh God
Ruth
Is everything
() No it's not, Phil
What's wrong
'   - Feet up, Ruth eats Fiddle Waddle as she watches an action- packed   on
It's  night
Call after 11
Ruth hangs up the phone, shaking her head, and takes another mouthful of Fiddle Fiddle
- Phil looks at the phone, incredulous
What's wrong
() What
Just call her again and tell her what's happened
Phil dials the number again
Ruth picks up
Ruth,  need you to listen
We've - 45
'   - We sure do Phil
We sure do
Ruth slams the phone down and pulls out the phone cord so she won't be bothered again
- Clara tries on her phone, then hangs up, frustrated
Great, Phil
Now she's not picking up at all
You think this is my fault, don't you
- ft () No
just don't know why you two can't get along is all
You know, your Mom shows me no respect, 0 Clara
And you just pretend like it isn't happening
So you think it's j1y fault
Listen, Phil
Every single other boyfriend ever dated got along with her just- () Wait a minute
Holbrooke Peterson
What
Clara starts looking through her purse for her phone
Holbrooke Peterson does something hush hush with the
think he even lives down here
Holbrooke Peterson
You mean the tongue guy
What
46
Holbrooke was your prom date who you said had the really long tongue, right
(' ) Oh yeah
(catching herself, shrugs ) Uh, yeah
something like that
She finds her phone and dials
Since when have you been in touch with Holbrooke Peterson
() We found each other on FacebookA Facebook
didn't know you were on Facebook
It's a networking thing for work
Everyone's on Facebook
1I121 0 yeah
Who else are you "in touch" h on Facebook
) Hello
Holbrooke
Thank God you're there
It's Clara Foster
- , a thoroughbred of a man in his mid- 30's, opens the door to his candlelit apartment with a smile to find Phil and Clara
Wow
Clara
You look exactly the same So do you
He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little
You feel exactly the same too
Phil double-takes
Did he hear him right
47
R1 This is my husband, Phil
Ah
The man who actually landed Clara
Holbrooke gives Phil the up and down with a winning smile and holds out his hand
(') Philly Cheese Steak
Nice to meet you
Um
yeah
don't go by
it's 1 - usL Phil
Nice to meet you, too
Well, c'mon in
If you don't mind, take off your shoes
Oh
Sure
Cutsdown on the cleaning
Which cuts downon the use of all those chemicals andplastics, blab blah blah
Reduces my Carbon footprint
Oh
The environmental thing
() Yeah, the "environmental thing," Phil
As they walk into the apartment in their socks, they notice the whole place is filled with reclaimed and recycled furniture and
How beautiful
Or, the candles
Did we - Oh, no
jus-_
--'-
> myself off the gr a few weeks ago
The grid
48
1I121 Power grid
actually have a negative carbon footprint now
Making up for, you know, all you "Phil"-i-stines in the suburbs
Holbrooke chuckles
Phil's about to say something when a look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip
Holbrooke gestures to some cardboard furniture
(') So have a seat
Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show of taking a   out of his shoulder holster and putting it on the table
Whoa
You carry that around at home
Yeah
'm supposed to sleep with her under my pillow
() Wish  didn't have to, but  just see it as
carry the weight so citizens like yourselves don't have to
1I121 It's so funny
always knew you'd end up doing something in public service
( ) don't know
That's lust how Phil looks to Clara - can you get a load of this guy, but Clara's focused on Holbrooke
(
0
) (') Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is not a man you want to get on the wrong side of
'   - Phil watches as Holbrooke licks the salt allllll the wav around his Margarita glass with his extra long tongue
Clara listens intently, eating some jicama slices from a platter on the table in front of them
He's like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his head deep in his shell unless he absolutely has to stick it out
Those photos must be really important to him
() 49
("  ) () 1I121 More jicama, Clara
And sure no Margari-La to calm your nerves
No thanks, 'm Holbrooke picks up the plate and Margarita glass, then crosses to his  , adding the extra liquid and scraps
(') What does Stockton do
Officially, he runs a bunch of these exclusive private clubs downtown where his high powered friends go to let their hair down
Has one place called Le Passage, another called The Rainbow- e Rainbow
Stockton asked how we there to set things up
() Interesting
've had some of my guys looking into Stockton for years, but nothing ever sticks to him
He's very careful - ties up his loose ends and covers his tracks
But with this
he might have accidentally left himself open
( The th need to do now is keep you two safe
'm going to call the office, put you under some protection until we figure out the best game Should we be worried about our s (shakes his head) Wouldn't be Stockton's pattern to risk ing this any larger than it is
Where is he
s staying at my m ( ) Aw, how is Ruth
Always thought the world of her
1I121 50
And she of you
As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily looks over at Phil
Holbrooke goes to a pile of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along with a pen
'll just need your full names and your socials so  can get the paperwork started at the bureau
Not yours, Clara
Know that by heart
Both Phil and Clara are taken aback
(') () Just kidding
But 'm sure Phil-a-buster knows 'em both, right
Phil looks on both sides of the paper Holbrooke hands him
Uh
there's already writing all over this
( ) Does another tree really need to die for me to get your socials, Phil
Phil bites his tongue yet again, squeezing the writing into a side of the paper
(') So just one kid, guys
What's keeping you
Clocks ticking Clara - tickety tock tuck
() Yeah, well, that's a topic for another- It's just that by now, you and  woulda had a whole brood
(under his breath) That's
charming
Phil scoots the paper back to Holbrooke, who squints and dramatically turns it sideways
w
Paging Dr
Illegible, egible to Emergency
Holbrooke and Clara burst into laughter
Phil (  '  ) ,, right
(thinking he doesn't ) It's because you're writing's hard to read, Phil, and everyone knows how when doctors write things down- No
Yeah
get it
Holbrook
makes a big show of putting his gun back holster as he gets up
We'll have you stay at the bureau for the night
Safer for you
Thank you so much, Holbrooke
(sighs, relieved) feel like we're in good hands for the first time tonight
As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood
What's wrong
don't know
Maybe  should have had one of Holbrooke's eeegerag warn raaaarrrrghereeeeetas
- Clam::- olbrooke in the front seat and Phil crt-- - in t=-i12 back, they pull up and park at the bui Aing m smells like french fries back here, ' Car runs on cooking oil
just go around to restaurants and recycle their old fry oil
52
Phil's really had enough with this guy
Your goodness
where does it end
Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke doesn't get his sarcasm
() How  roll
Now for some reason they wanted us to come in the back entrance
He makes a big show of putting his gun back in his shoulder strap before getting out of the car
Through the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara walking toward the back of the building
In the foreground,    watches them, then whispers into his walkie
Positions
- Holbrooke uses a  on his keychain with a flourish to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and Clara through the doors
Suddenly he stops and Phil and Clara  behind them
At the other end of the hallway, an   in bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of them
#1 in the center, obviously the agent in charge, yells to them
Continue slowly down the hallway
sudden movements
Are they armed, Peterson
Uh, What the hell's going o don't know
53
Well, tell them to stand down
Uh
Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke
#1 His men
The Agents look at each other and chuckle
#2 What do you want us to do, Holbrooke
Reformat our hard drives
#3 Our badass
guy
The laughter builds
guy
'm not the "
guy
"  help out with computer questions out of kindness
But see if that happens anymore, Harold
#1 Alright, enough
Point is, Agent Peterson scored tonight
When  typed in those socials, an  shot up with a whole laundry list on these guys
What
crooked cop did it
It's a lie
#1 It's your booking, Peterson
We're Just here to back you up
Holbrooke
Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and Clara
He turns to them, taking Clara's arm
Listen guys
'll just book you and then tomorrow we can straighten the whole- 54
(pulling arm away) What
Oh no you're not
Oooohs from the Agents
#3 You just gonna take that, Peterson
() All right
Didn't want to have to- Holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun
but  it and it falls to the ground, right at Phil's feet
Looking down, Phil instinctively  , holding the gun to Holbrooke's head
All right
Nobody move or he gets it
Clara's
The Agents look at each other, but don't seem overly concerned
#1 Holbrooke has a gun
Why does he even a have a gun
( ) Listen, man
'm not that important
'm really not
'm not the  guy but 'm just one step above him
No reason to do something rash, all right
#3 You think it's even loaded
` -
don't
() loaded, guys
It's loaded
'm not screwing around
He's not screwing around
He's not screwing around
Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward the rear exit of the building
They try the door, but it's locked
55
1I121 Keycard
What
He wants your keycard
Thanks
He and , the communication isn't great
Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door unlocks and they back outside
- Phil and Clara back away, keeping Holbrooke between th and the agents
Through the door, Agents slowly creep down the hallway after them, guns trained
Seriously, Phil
'm a bad shield promise
Wow, Phil
Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise
Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke
When we're about to drive off we'll let you go
Uh, they were on the keychain
What
'
n`_ The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard inside
The keys were on that
And so the hero falls
Shit
we'll never outrun them
56
Searching around, Phil eyes the   outside the entrance
He aims the gun and ,
Both he and Holbrooke cover their ears
Man is that loud
As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock
(') (stunned, looks at her) How are you so good at that
The Agents try the door, but are
Agent #1 tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass, but it's
He gestures and all the Agents rush around to the front
gotta get going
Quick
Where
They both look around, unsure
Across the bridge a few blocks down that street there's an entrance to the Green Line subway
Get on it and you can get anywhere in this city
Phil and Clara look at him, confused
Aren't you supposed to be our hostage
() Whatever
don't know
Sure
What's the difference
'm never gonna get behind that desk now anyway
my gun
dropped it in front of everybody
It wasn't so much of a drop
it was more of a
bobble
Yeah, a bobble's bad
57
Listen, if you just leave me here  can tell them you ran the other way
It'll buy you time to get there
And maybe can work on clearing all this up for you
Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run away
Suddenly Phil stops, thinking
What
Let me have the gun
As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and hands it to Holbrooke (') Here
Tell them you got it back from us
Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful
Thanks, Phil
As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of husband
- lit up raucous   in a canal starts to pass under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it
Phil glances back over their shoulders - the road is
it's just on the other side of that bridge
think we're going to make it
He notices Clara looking at him
( What
Nothing
That was just nice of you, back there
() This is crazy, but you know what 'm, reminded of right now
Bourne identity
58
'm talking about right now
When we used to walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs
We couldn't ever find a cab, remember
We'd grab those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler Planetarium to watch the sunrise
Where  held your hand for the first time
can't believe we used to stay up all night like that
It's because we could sleep 'til noon
( ) If  remember correctly, we weren't always "sleeping
" Beat as they share the moment together, walking
just don't understand when we got so
don't know
Old
No,  was thinking numb
When did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad
We're not that bad, Phil
just think we haven't been that honest with each other recently
Phil doesn't understa (') Not big things
Just little things keep adding up and putting this thing between us
() Like the fact  know you never want to talk about us having this other baby
59
It's not that  don't want another kid, Clara
It's just
used to be the whole pie with you
And now with Ollie and your work, 'm barely even a piece of the pie anymore
'm, like, maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie
So part of me's not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan  have left of your attention going into some new baby's mouth
But that's crazy, Phil
When you're home you're the one who seems like your hardly even there
It's all about your work
Believe me, if you- Clara suddenly notices a  , lights off, drive past them over the bridge
(') Shit
think we're
Just play cool and keep walking
The patrol car continues across and down the street
1i121 Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief
Then suddenly, a few blocks down,
The patrol car turns around and    , zooming back toward them
(') Now you can say shit
Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge with no place to run
Then he notices the lit up coming out the other side of the bridge beneath them
(') e 's only a few feet
What u high
No way
But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them, Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge
(') 1I121 60
As she's    , Clara  onto the railing
With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they above the water and the boat
(' Ahhh
Are you
Let go, Clara
of   on the boat, spotting them, cheer below
Some even take
Phil looks down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going to miss the boat
go or 'm going to tickle you
( ) No you're not, Phil
We have a rule
tickling
'm not- He reaches up and  Clara under her arm
She giggles
(') () Ah
Stop it, Phil
Ah
It's not funny
mean- Stop it
Ah
Clara can't hold on any longer
They land -
- onto the top deck of the boat, both groaning as they roll back and forth while the Drunken Partiers  and
Ow
think  broke my butt
Dammit, Phil
What's our rule about tickling
'm sorry
didn't do it for pleasure
What is our rule
61
( ) "It's only funny if it's funny for the both of us
" Right
And guess what
It wasn't funny for me, Phil
Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm
Walking down the side of the boat, she passes a  down on one knee in front of an  , who nods, accepting his proposal
(') ( ) i g mistake
They look at her, stunned
- M0_,'_= -1; Phil limps along, finally finding Clara alone and calmed down, looking out over the rear of the boat
He comes next to her
Beat
' s your elbow
() 's , How`s your butt
Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a moving boat, not so bad
( ) can't even fucking believe this is happening to us
You know, we're kind of running ou ons
Maybe we could just hide or something until this all blows over
What makes you think it ever wil iaybe we should just turn ourselves 1I121 62
() Imagine what it's going to be like for Ollie when everyone hears about this tomorrow
bet our pictures are going to be all over the papers
Phil nods, gazing out
Then suddenly an idea comes to him
Wait
What if we found the pictures
What do you mean
These pictures that everyone's after
we could get them we'd have some kind o bargaining chip to get out of this
But then we'd have to find the Gales
don't know anything about them
() Except
the Rainbow
( ) The pictures have something to do with that place
Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these clubs are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in- Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone, dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head
What
You're not listening to me again
"You have to know where they are and h to get in-" That's great
Clara wanna cracker
63
'm calling because of what you said, Phil
know who can help us
Clara dials the number
CLARA_ (') Hey Jane, it's Clara
() Where am
(beat, looks around) 'm
'm on a party cruise around Chicago
Oh yeah
It is turning into quite a night
Listen, we need to go to this club called the Rainbow later
Do you know how we can get in
Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her ear and listens
Phil watches her until he notices the boat
He looks around the side
slew of   on the shore
He taps Clara
ara
Clara turns and looks
Oh shoot
You know what Jane
've actually gotta jump off right now
- swarm all over the tour boat, checking every compartment
shows Lieutenant Manning of Phil and Clara landing, groaning, and arguing on the back of his digital camera comes up to Manning and shakes his head
Check again
Manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away
Hey
That's mine, man
Evidence
The Partier mumbles "Asshole" as he stumbles Manning si i
s and looks out over the wa 64
- It's  and  as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and slosh down the street
Clara, missing one heel, dumps water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone
Mine's totally shot too
You got the info from her though, right
Yeah, but we can't get in looking like this, Phil
don't think we have a choice
Not a big shopping hour
They walk past the 24   , lights blazing
Windows show machines filled with young working out
(') Now if we wanted to do a little cardio, on the other hand
Who knew that many people worked out at 1 in the morning
Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks back up at the building
(') You wanna do a little cardio
Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it
He shakes his head
(') , now that's scary
You know you're starting to think like a real criminal
You know that, don't you
Clara waggles her eyebrows
We hear Devo's "Secret Agent Man" over a TrC _
24    - - Phil and Clara walk up to the front counter, where the boredly watches
They say something and the Greeter waves them through without looking up
As they hurry on, the Greeter's  goes to a for the local late night news: a  of Phil and Clara from the boat with a caption that reads: 65
1I121 - In the '  , Phil pulls at the , searching for an open locker
Unable to find one, he picks up a bench to throw it at them when   in workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he holds the bench
Phil moves the bench back and forth, pretending it's part of his
- In the '  , Clara, wrapped in a towel, blows out her hair at the mirror
An walks behind her toward the showers and they smile at each other in the mirror
As the disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a for the lockers
- Back in the '  , Phil lingers as a undresses, getting ready to work out
As the man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him, excitedly telling him something and pointing outside
The man, confused, exits, and Phil  , quickly undressing
- The Attractive Thin Woman comes back to her locker and opens it
Her face drops
Inside hang  " -   , Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then stops, stunned
Clara, waiting for him with her hair blown out and in a tight fitting    with a , looks
From her expression, she feels the same about Phil
- Looking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a dark, derelict alley
Down here
It's what she said
And if you die, does Jane get your commissic-l on the open house
Up ahead, a  :_=:   huddle near a bunch of   watching them, a   nearby
Nervously, Clara approaches
Excuse me
Men shoot her a fierce look
66
(') Um
do you know which is the way back to Kansas
They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down
One of them , and Phil jumps back
but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a going down
#1 Welcome to the Rainbow
- Reaching the bottom of the stairway, Phil and Clara, amazed, take in
It's a     that's been converted into a
The place is with an elite looking
Everything in the room - the carpet, the tapestries, the clothes of the waitstaff - is
Phil and Clara nod at each other then separate, disappearing into the mix
- Phil looks around, amazed as he wanders between and  tables, where well-to-do  guests gamble large sums of money, fast looking  cheering them on
(
) If you wanner be pissed at anyone about it, be pissed at Stockton
Hearing the name, Phil spots a   talking to 2 other  at one of the tables
He lingers closer
You know, rumor is he's behind the whole mess
Raking it in on both ends
What do you mean
Hush hush shell companies he owns
One of them hires all the construction inspectors
Another he's got rents all the construction equipment
The more one slows things down with violations, more the other takes to the bank
67
The Balding Man leans in and speaks more quietly, causing Phil to lean in even more
(') My guess is he's trying to screw up Mayor Diggs' reelection
Imagine what someone like him could do if he got someone less "squeaky clean" in the Mansion
The Balding Man suddenly notices Phil listening
Phil pastes on an excited face
you
Gale, right
What
Sorry
From the side
confused you with somebody else
Phil quickly moves on
- Clara talks to a   at the bar as he scrambles to fill drink orders
--Y_-_
really get s,-
y names
Thanks any-way
With a sigh, Clara starts away from the bar, when she ough the crowd,  and  walk right toward her - but they haven't seen her yet
Clara spots the nearby and rushes through
-  vUOUS Clara peeks out through the double door windows
Frank and Harry continue through the crowd, unaware
(
) Watch it
Clara quickly hugs a large bulletin board covered with pictures and time schedules as a  carries a large tray of food past her
68
As she moves off the wall, some papers drop
Clara pins them back on, when something else on the bulletin board catches her eye
Among all the snapshots of staff scattered on the bulletin board is a picture of a backyard party with a whole group of laughing young people, and the middle of the picture, smiling at the camera
is Clara pulls the picture off the wall
She catches a coming back through the double doors
Excuse me
Does she work here
Dora
guess she still does
Hasn't been showing up lately, though
Do you know where  can find her
You could try back tomorrow, see if she- need to find her tonight
Did you try Ray's place
Ray
That sleazebag boyfriend of hers
He's got that place a few blocks from here where he used to throw those after work parties
Do you remember where it is
Phil scans the crowds, back and forth
(
) Phil
Hearing his name, Phil nervously turns
and stand together in a corner
69
1I121 ( ) hit
This is a surprise
What are you doing down here
Uh
well, same thing as you guys, would guess
Working those "extra hours," right
(
) Phil
Clara, looking amazing in her red flapper dress, weeds through the crowd
Mr
Rivers and George take her in, obviously impressed
(') Phil, we gotta go
found out where- ) Clara, you remember Mr
Rivers
Clara suddenly notices Phil's boss
Oh
Oh
Yeah
And 'm George
Sorry, but 've got to steal him
We've gotta be somewhere else right now
At 2 in the morning
Where are you guys headed
() 'm sorry, Mr
Rivers
We really can talk about it
Phil and Clara move off quickly through the crowd as Mr
Rivers watches the hand_i12__e, dressed up couple, intrigued
Phil Foster with places to go he can talk about at 2 in the morning
( ) () 70
(') You know what makes kangaroos so damn dangerous, George
They look so sweet and tame, so you forget they're wild animals
Lethal when they want to be
George, not fully understanding, chuckles and holds out his hand for another handshake, but Mr
Rivers, still watching Phil,
of Phil and Clara making their way through the crowd to the exit
In the dark room, Frank and Harry look expectantly to the well dressed man in a dark suit, who absently twirls with two metal balls in his hand
See where they take you
- Phil and Clara knock on the door of a the deserted looking row house
No answer
Clara tries the door
That never really- She shoots Phil a look
(') Never mind
Phil and Clara inch insi - As they start down the dark hallway to the living room, Phil hunches over, hugging the wall
are you bent over like that
sneaking
Rut why don't you just walk normally and quietly
This is the wav  sneak
You sneak in your way and 'll sneak in mine,
71
() Fine
was just asking
Clara walks quietly behind crouching Phil
Reaching the living room, they spot    on the couch
Suddenly, the   behind them and  holds a gun to Phil's head,  nervously next to him
Talk
Who are you
You know, that's like the 5th gun 've had to my head tonight
Just lower that thing and cool it,
Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does
She was in the bathroom at the restaurant
Who are you
Who are we
Good question
Well, everybody thinks we're "the Gales" because we were lucky enough to take your reservation tonight
() What
Why would you take our reservation
Phil shoots Clara a look
Don't
Both of you
Stand ov there in the corner
Dammit Dora, ere's your goddamn brother
He was ,
--,-Dc
-zed to b here an hour ago
don't know, Ra_, He's not answering his phone
Yeah, well, if these guys found u long do you think it's gonna take other guys
We're dead
72
Excuse me
In the corner, Clara raises her hand
Ray eyes her strangely
(') Sorry
have to pee
() You have to nee
Clara nods
Phil shrugs
That's my wife
Flustered, Ray waves Dora to take Clara
- Dora talks to Clara as she washes her face in the sink
You must just think 'm awful
don't think anything about you
just want this to be over
Ray saw Mr
Stockton making all this money blackmailing people at the club
When he found out who was interested in me
he said it would be so easy
We'd never have to work again
(
) ,
We're coming
- Ray peeks nervously out of the window, searching the street
Listen, it looks like things didn't turn out the way you planned, but  think all Stockton wants is his pictures back
As soon as he gets them  bet- 73
Stockton's pictures
You
think they're Stockton's pictures
() You really have no idea what you've gotten into, do you
The window  and Ray and Phil hit the deck
As Ray starts blindly firing back, Phil crawls on his knees and elbows across the floor toward the bathroom
(
) 'm
'm
Ray spots Phil crawling away and gets up, turning to him
Hey
Get- Suddenly, Ray is     through the window
He drops to the ground in pain, yelling and clutching his arm
(') Ahh
Phil crabs along even faster
Clara rushes to the bathroom door, pulling Phil inside and locking it
As Clara focuses on Phil, Dora thinks fast, taking an out of her purse and putting it into Clara's bout them seeing
Oh God
Are you hit
No
just
a little
winded
that
crawling's
tough
on the core
- As Harry kicks the gun away from Ray, moaning on the floor, Frank comes to the bathroom door
He lightly raps on it, then speaks softly
74
How about you guys let me in before someone gets really hurt
Dora quickly opens the window and gestures for Phil and Clara to climb through
Just as they squeeze outside
The door handle's   and Frank kicks the door in
He grabs Dora, rushing toward the window, but Phil and Clara are
Dammit
Frank eyes Dora, then     , sending screaming to the ground in pain
(') You stay put
He hurries back through the house
- Phil and Clara sprint to the street as a  pulls up in front and a confused looking   steps Hey
Which is 357 Maple Street
You're Dora's brother
Who are you
You're late
sorry
The roads are all screwed with all this construction- They wince as a  hits the rearview mirror of the car
All three spin to see Frank aiming his gun and marching toward them, Harry right behind him
(') Hey
Phil quickly pushes Dora's brother aside as he and Clara hop into the Buick and
75
Frank and Harry  for their Towncar down the block
- Phil screeches the car around the corner
Phil
Careful
Phil  the car around another bend
(') Please, Phil
It's not going to do any good if you- (taking another sharp turn) Clara
Please
Just leave the driving to me,
know what 'm- - they  something head-on,  the windshield
Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward
They're face to face - nose to nose - with another broken windshield
In the driver's seat of a h fiber-optic colored lights, a    a stares at them in shock
No no no
Tell me you did not just do that
Shit
The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in hands
Oh, man
You did not just do that
Whew, you gonna be payin' for this
owe you one
Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place
Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees that '
_- The Black Dude comes toward him
76, Oh no no no
You're gonna get outta this car and hand me over a license and some insurance
We gonna do this right
Man, think  got whiplash and shit
Phil looks back to see   ' TOTnNCAR coming around the corner
Shit
Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into the Black Dude's souped up Honda
Hey
What do you think you're doing
The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's door, but Phil's  it
Phil yells to Clara
,
What
That's insane
Frank and Harry's car
It will smash into them in seconds
Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to reverse, and guns it
At the same moment, Phil steps on the gas
The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, as he's
The conjoined cars , just in time to dodge the Towncar
The Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield into the passenger's seat next to Phil
' Huh
77
Phil, this is- (to Black Dude) Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps on it
Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels smoke and speed up in the
They race past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in pursuit
Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly back and forth
They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK a whole row of mail boxes until Phil spins h--'-s v;:-reel, getting them back into the street
Just let me out,
You can have it
1i121 You can have it
( ) 'm not yelling
'm just talking in an very animated voice
Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they're approaching the lar ge intersection with Michigan Avenue
(') , now when  say so, spin your wheel
() On his command, Clara spins her wheel sharply to t1- right
, but it's the wrong way and their cars across the road
An   honks desperately
(') Ahhhh
Other way
Other way
78
Flustered, Clara  her wheel in the other direction, and their two cars tilt up on four wheels (out of eight), barely screeching past
Landing again and taking in a deep breath, Phil shoots her a pissed off look
What
You just said spin the wheel, Phil
You didn't say which way
Yes  did
No you didn't
She's right
You di () God
Thank you
Can we take him home
need him
Both Phil and the Black Dude sees that the Towncar's turned onto Michigan Avenue and is still right behind them
Aw man
( ) say our best chance is to reverse again, then use both engines to floor as fast as we can all the way down Michigan
Why stay on Michigan
Why stay on Michigan
Because it's a wider street
It's also a busier street
think it would be better to try to branch off
() Why do you have a problem with every route  take
Flustered, Phil turns to the Black Dude next to him to commiserate, unaware that his
79
1I121 (') She does this wherever we go
Every time
Phil doesn't notice the    behind him
Phil and the Black Dude look over their shoulders to see they're heading straight for a , Phil  the wheel sharply and they go , jumping the curb and soaring into
In their car following them, Frank and Harry's -mouths drop
The conjoined cars sail across the grass and a barrier, landing on the
Their cars     across the ice
Phil, Clara, and the Black Dude are all   as the world is a   around them
Finally, they hit the other side
Getting his bearings, Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them
He searches where to go next, then spots something
Clara
Reverse it, keep it straight put your foot to the floor
Give it everything
Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors it
The car goes faster
faster
Oooh
really woulc_n
't be doing that
Doing what
What are you doing
Clara glances over her shoulder
Their heading strai toward a
(') Oh God
80
1I121 Just trust me
The conjoined cars  the steps and their wheels as the The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine doesn't have enough power
Swearing under his breath, Frank reverses back down the steps
Phil and the Black Guy both look back over their shoulders as they speed by Anish Kapoor's large metallic No sign of the Towncar
The Black Guy holds up his hand for Phil
Ha
That last move was wicked, man
Wicked
They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil, the   , muddles it up
a Sorry
s cool
( ) They're back
They peek again over their shoulders
The Towncar's driven around and is now
Jesus
What the hell are you guys in trouble for
' () f i ght
you name it
Phil and Clara's conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss of the Great Lawn in Millennium park, then  onto Columbus Drive, the Towncar giving chase
81 Phil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs, looking at Clara
Can we just try to work together at this
- 'm not blaming you
Please
Clara nods
(') Now whatever direction  give you, take your normal version of it and tone it down like 85 percent,
35 percent
Fine
Small left
Now
Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts They  around the corner
(') ( ) Yes
That was awesome
Perfect, Clara
Now give me a medium right
Do it
She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another street
Yes
Now we're cooking with fire
Now tiny le ( ) You act it
They make the slightest turn
1I121 82
1I121 Yes
(spotting something ahead) No
Oh no
What
Clara turns around to look
as a comes down across the road -   ahead is slowly rising
Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in
The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil
say we can pop you guys up and over
Excuse me
What are you talking about, "pop you guys up and over
" You climb over, then we both reverse it and leadfoot the motherfuckers
Send you flying over the top
What
Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back to the Black Dude
As the conjoined cars zoom toward the drawbridge, Phil , sitting next to Clara
(') Phil, don't even think of it
can do it
Clara
No, Phil
We can't
It's suicide
Here we go now
One
two
83
But Phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse, stepping on Clara's foot to
(') The two cars  as their wheels spin in opposite directions, then
Phil and Clara's car flies reverse
and , causing   to deploy all around Phil and Clara
The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his Honda across the road, and
Frank and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but the Towncar  right into the Honda
ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank and Harry
Hope you all got insurance
Hitting a button, he starts a -   on his Honda
'   - As their car comes to a ,   in the middle of the deserted road, Phil sandwiched in air bags, catches his breath
() We did it
We did it
Phil moves an air bag aside to see Clara down the street
- Phil rushes after Clara, trying to catch up
Where are you going
want to make sure that at least one our son's parents survives tonight
What
84
You almost just got us killed
see
almost got us killed
Forget about the people chasing and shooting at us all night long because of the reservation you stole
There's a difference between fleeing from people shooting at you and knowingly driving a car in reverse over an open drawbridge
Unbelievable
You know, all you complain about is that  don't take risks anymore
Then the second  do, you get mad at me for doing it
can't win with you
Poor Phil
You have i so bad, don't you
Oh, you have no idea
Every single day from the moment we wake up you're bossy, a disapproving, inconsiderate- 'm inconsiderate
'
Have you ever seen our bathroom in the morning after Tsunami Phil's blown through
The floor
The sink
You use my toothbrush
What's the difference
Afraid you're gonna get my cooties
want my own toothbrush, Phil
Sue me
And how many years have  asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet paper in right
Listen to yourself
You have problems with how  pqt in the toilet paper
Because under makes no sense, Phil
Under makes no sense
When it's under it doesn't pull off right
It just keeps spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade properly
() 85
() After ten years of asking you to have roll the right way, you still can't do it
Yeah, how about the fact that  have not woken up with our comforter over me once in those 10 nears
You steal the whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself
What
Phil,  do not "steal" the comforter
It just happens when we're- (points at her) Bulls Bull-shit
Don't you point that at me
see your hock leg lock maneuver
Don't think  don't
() You wrap that leg around and lock the comforter down then reeeeel it in so can't pull it at all
do not leg lock the comforter
Oh yes you do
u think  don't know your little icks
Where you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it back in the fridge so you don't have to be the one to "finish" it and replace it
You're right
do that
You know why do that, Clara
Because you don't want to haul your ass to the market to buy it yourself
Because 'm afraid to
God forbid the wrong kind of grass-fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath
You're like the Nutrition Nazi
() 1I121 86
('  ) And 've got to be your little Nutrition Nazi Goebbels because we have to be this "united front" with Ollie
What's wrong if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar instead of one
Or if his handwriting isn't perfect
Or if he goes to school for one day not dressed like Finneas
Nerdo
Poor Phil
feel so sorry for you must be hard having to be the cool fun parent while  get to be the one who makes sure our child's fed, clothed and How would you even know
You don't give me or anyone else a chance
You're so goddamn controlling
You've got to be Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line, looking down on them from her fancy Wonder Woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonder superpowers
You paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being the superlady
Urgh
You know w sometimes  don't pay attention to you, Phil
Because you give me a headache
Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a frustrated sigh
What
No aspirin in the wonderpurse
How could it be
Clara, furious,  her purse at Phil's head
He ducks and the contents spill all over the road
Screw you, Phil
Yeah, fine
Sure
Screw me
Even if survive tonight 'm screwed all around anyway
Screwed with you
Screwed with my job
What are you talking about, screwed with your job
87
1I121 was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a new brilliant plan for the fund so George wouldn't take it over tomorrow
Doesn't look like that's gonna happen
Why didn't you tell me
don't know, Clara
Maybe because didn't want you chiming in on how Mr
Rivers was right
He wants the new guy for all the reasons you complain about me
Someone who doesn't "play it safe
" Someone who'll "take a risk
" can't believe that's what you think do
Yeah, well
() You know, when you set up this whole "magical" night, in that dress
got this glimmer that it was going to be like it used to be with us
But
don't know
guess we're just not those people anymore
() guess we're not
Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away do-- the street
Clara, trying to hold it together, h and starts to gather the items from her purse something catches his eye
She picks up the that Dora put in her bag
- As Phil walks along, Clara comes running up behind him
Phil
Phil
She steps in front of him, trying to catch her breath
think we said all needs to be said right now, Clara
Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope
88
This
this
this
What
() Side cramp
Wow
She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends down, trying to stop her cramp
Confused, Phil opens it and looks at the pictures inside
His brow furrows
What is it
Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and Phil's eyes go wide
(') Oh jeez
It's
it's
It's the Mayor
Phil looks at Clara, taking it all in
(
0
) bet this didn't have anything to do with Stockton at first
- Phil and Clara walk quickly down the street as they piece things together
The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's club one night
He saw Dora working there and obviously gave some sign that he was interested
So much for "Mr
Squeaky Clea Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and convinces her to take him up on it so they could photograph it and blackmail him
They knew it was an election year and he would have to pay them whatever they asked
89
But somehow Stockton found out about the photos too and wanted that power over the mayor himself
So he sent his guys to the restaurant to intercept the Gales and get the photos
But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed before the Mayor even had a chance to show up
Phil thinks
He snaps his fingers
What
If we could find some way to get in touch with the mayor directly, without anyone else knowing, there actually might be a way out of this for us
Clara thinks for a moment
light comes to her eyes
can
- Phil and Clara walk into the lobby of the doorman building and start toward the elevator, straight past the Whoa whoa whoa
Where do you you're going
Oh, we're guests of Apartment 605 The Doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmen And you are
looks at him in shock
Are you crazy
It's 4 in the morning
We were lust out for dinner
Trust me 90
'm not really allowed to just let you up there
Please
Just look at us
The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well dressed suburban couple
Yeah
Go ahead
The elevator door opens and they get inside
Have a nice night
You too
As the elevator doors close, Phil and Clara look at each other, then simultaneously slip   with  and over their heads
'  - Mrs
Cardigan, in her frilly nightgown with her eyemask pulled up on her forehead, walks through her dark living room toward the  on her front door
(
) ( ) All right
All- As Mrs
Cardigan opens the door, Phil and Clara, in their masks,   her
Screaming, Cardigan dodges, running back to her desk
Phil and Clara give chase, but Cardigan grabs a    and starts over and over on his paper bag head, screaming the whole time
(') Clara grabs her from behind, bringing her down
1I121 rubs his paper bag head

'  - Having put Cardigan's eyenask back over her eyes, Clara, bag off, holds Cardigan in a chair as Phil comes back into the living room holding two spools of
can't find any rope
Only yarn
Yarn
Fine
Just use that
'll start looking
Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying Cardigan's arms to the back of the chair, while Clara searches Cardigan's desk
You two weren't very prepared
Excuse me
You should have been more prepared
Thought ahead and brought the rope you
, why don't you lay off the critiqu ---'--' 's not a critique
It's a fact
Oh is it a fact

Wrong word choice
Unbelievable
Well, let me throw a little word choice "correction" your way
Partner
Five year old kids can't be "antagonistic

Phil looks over
Clara makes the "Cut it out" gesture across her throat
(') If you're done tying her up, come over and help
Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks on the desk
The name's Cardigan, not Rockefeller, if you haven't figured it out yet
What idiots
You must be such a positive influence on our youth
You're one to talk
Partner
( ) 1i121 Listen, lady, just sit tight and we'll be out of here before you know it
Phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook, when he spots something and doubles back, starting to read
His brow furrows
Clara, deep in her own workbook, suddenly brightens
(') Got it
She notices Phil's expression
( '  ) What
hands the book to Clara to read
She does and darkens
(') Oliver told her he's being mean to Je y Briggs because
he says he wants to marry her
() And that's what married people do

As this hits them, Phil and Clara look at each other, then at Mrs
Cardigan, blindfolded in the living room

No "crown jewels" yet
Let's make the call, '  - The   in Mayor Reynold's bedroom

And whether you realize it or not, we ended up doing you a favor
You see, this man named Mr
Stockton - know if you know him- (( know who he is
Well, he tried to steal the photos from the Gales
He's even got cops on his payroll helping him out
We think he was planning to sabotage your re-election
() So what do you want for them
What do we want
Phil looks at Clara
(') We just want our lives back
We want to go home, Mr
Mayor
'  - The Mayor looks over nervously as his wife stirs
She goes back to snoring and he whispers into the phone again
' () That's it
Mayor Diggs breathes out and rubs his forehead
If you really can get me
what  was supposed to receive earlier without this getting out,  promise you 'll take care of your safety
() But now the police think that- Trust me
Get me the photos and he won't be bothering you again
' Clara sees Phil furrow his brow, confused
is it
Phil's concentrating hard on something
Thinking
() Uh
yeah
We'll meet you at the Adler Planetarium in 1 hour
Come alone ' The Mayor rubs his forehead
Of course
And
thank you
Click
The Mayor hangs up the phone and quietly leaves the bedroom
' Downing a glass of scotch, the Mayor sits at his desk and lets out a sigh of relief
Beat
He picks up his desk phone and dials
( ) We dodged a bullet
They calac _e
'   - Mr
Stockton sits at his desk, staring at a blueish monitor screen
1I121 96
interesting
'  in front of him we see that Frank and Harry hold a wounded Ray and Dora in the meat locker
() They thought you were stealing the photos from the Gales to try to blackmail me yourself
Did they, now
That's great
() They're going to meet me in an hour with them
Alone
st keeps getting better
- Phil and Clara sit silently on the steps of the beautiful, old Alder Planetarium looking at dawn hitting the
Man,  love this city
Always have
When was the last time we watched the sunrise together
Probably the last time we were here
() Nope
it wasn't
It was the morning that Ollie was born
, ) You're The morning Ollie was born
They look at each other, remembering
(') Man, 'm starving
Me too
() Sorry you never got your truffles
97
Clara reaches into her purse
Who needs white truffles when you've got a lemon zest Luna bar
Clara breaks it in two and hands half to Phil
They click the halves together, toasting each other, then silently chew, looking out
Phil shakes his head and starts
(') What
() , what happened to us tonight
the hell are we doing here
Clara starts laughing too
It's not funny
No,  know it's not funny
It's not funny at all
en why are you laughing
Why are you laughing
They're both cracking up
then Phil notices a moment later that Clara's laughter has turned to ( Wha e gonna be , Cla --, No
It's not that
just
this is nice
Right now
(tears up again) You don't understand
really don't want to be Wonder Woman, Phil
don't At all
() You don't see that this whole time 'm flying in a glass plane
In a glass Mane
() Uh, , but  think Wonder Woman actua flies an invisible plane, not a glass plane
98
This makes Clara break into a bigger round of sobs
You see
It isn't even there at all don't even have a plane
No plane
'm running on fumes
You're not running on fumes, Clara
'm not trying to be uptight, or controlling
Or a nutrition
Nazi
Nazi
'm just trying the only way know how to keep everything from fall apart
It won't fall apart
And  really can help whenever you feel like it is
With Ollie
Whatever
You just never act like you need me to
That's because as it is you see us as a distraction from your work
You think  see you guys as a distraction
God no, Clara
( ) You don't understand
have this wife who does everything better than anyone 've ever known
And the greatest son
You want to know why  obsess so much about my stupid job
Because  want to feel like
like  can do something good enough to deserve someone like you mean,  look at you and  jest don't stack up
That's crazy, Phil
You do
You're a god man
You're the best man  know
'll never be the guy who remembers always put toilet paper on the right way
99
don't think  would really want to be with that guy, Phil
just
want us to be on the same team again
As Clara sniffles, Phil takes this in for a beat
He nods
Listen, you know what  said before, about not being the people we used to be
Phil, we were angry- No, Clara
It's true
We're not
And know 'm going to drive you crazy again, and you're definitely going to drive me crazy
But  wouldn't want to do it with anybody else
He hugs her tight
(') We had a good fight tonight, didn't we
Yeah, we did
You know the worst part about not talking about all this recently
What
We missed out on a lot of make up sex
And our make up sex woulda rocked
You think
Oh yeah
Phil s when he spots something behind Clara
looks both walks from his car in the parking lot toward the--
Here we go
() Tell me now
Do you need to pee
1 hold it
100
They get up and start walking down the steps to meet him
- Phil and Clara meet the Mayor at the bottom of the steps
Clara takes the manila envelope out of her purse, handing it to him
This is what you're looking for
've tten down our information inside
And that's it
That's it
We're going home now
The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him toward the parking lot
Mayor Diggs stays behind, nervously tapping the envelope in his hand
As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot,   ' , and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr
Stockton climb out
Frank and Harry pop the trunk and grab
Phil's eyes go wide
(') Oh God
Run, Clara
Phil and Clara start to run, when a  hits the ground in front of them
They turn, when rings out
The next one won't be a warning shot
They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with the plastic
(to Harry and Frank Let's do it over there
y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on the grass nearby
'm going to wait in the c r don't mind
Sure thing, Mr
Mayor
As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he opens the manila envelope
Manning gestures for Phil and Clara to walk to the plastic sheets
Please
Please don't do Over there
Please
We have a child
' said over there
i12J () Just me then,
promise you she's not going to say anything
Please
We have a child
Last time 'm going to say it
Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground
1I121 (') On your knees
Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara
She takes looking back at him and they kneel in front of the plastic, side by side
Mr
Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his gun
(
) Mr
Stockton and Lieutenant inning turn
Mayor Diggs sifts through pages of  : that were in t h ''w Wila Envelope
-eally were planning to give you the pictures, Mr
Mayor
That is, until you -
sre so casual about is not needing to worry about the cop who was after us
That made me a little suspicious because never told you which cop it was
Then we got to talking and realized how dumb we were
() 102
(') If you came on to some waitress at the Rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn comfortable there
Which meant Stockton was probably your buddy
Where are the pictures
But we were still confused, because if you guys are buddies, how do you explain the Falconwood Corporation
Mr
Stockton's face blanches
They're obviously not going to tell us
Just shoot them
Wait
've heard that name
What's the Falconwood Corporation
Runs the hiring of inspectors for the Department of Highways in Chicago
You know, the ones who have been finding all those violations
Manning
said shoot them
work for the Mayor, Terrence
Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence
Maybe because according to the paperwork you've got there, he owns Falconwood
Not only that, you'll see those other pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called Eurostruct - which rents the city all of its construction equipment
Frank, Harry
Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns his gun on them
103
The more violations Falconwood finds, the longer Eurostruct rents the equipment
That turns into big bucks, Mr
Mayor
'm sure that's not a moral problem for you, but he's kind of screwing you in an election year, isn't he
Some of us are pretty pissed off about the roads
Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all You did this to me
don't get it, Terrence
Why
How much do you need have the Lieutenant here watch your back on all of your gambling clubs- Oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble at
Where  cover your debts
Those clubs
slipped your company 5 no-bid foreclosed buildings for a dollar each downtown
a You think that pays for what  do for you
The girls  have to pay off
The jet charters
And let's not even get into your "re-election fund"
Let's not even go there
( ` ) Listen to them
Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck
How did you get this
How
(
) Tha be from me
Mr
Stockton and others turn around to see P_IF , brandi= --
g his gun and looking like the he always -t e_' to be, leap -= a pack of Cher = as they     '_: "_ :
( '  ) Drop it
104
Manning tried to object, pulling out his bad (') Yeah, yeah
know all about you, buddy
With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the under their clothing
Seeing them hand over the wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just revealed
Aw fuck
() Makes you feel any better,  wasn't gonna vote for you anyway
either
'  - As Holbrooke drops Phil and Clara off in front of their house, his  buzzes and he checks it
Everything
Yeah
They just need me downtown in half an hour for a news conference with the Deputy Mayor
Want it for the morning shows
Don't think they're going to be calling you the  guy any-more
Listen guys,  feel weird about not even acknowledging you two
Don't
But you should be up there with me
You handed this whole case to me
(smiles, winks) Yeah, well-, that's how we roll
They get out of the car and start up the driveway
105
- As Clara opens the front door, Phil slowly bends down, picking up the morning paper
(
) Hey hey
Up bright and early, aren Phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in his jogging suit
He smiles, appreciating Chaz for the first time
Yep
We sure are
As he joins Clara on the doorstep, they take each other in
You have your presentation in a few hours
() Yeah
You know,  think 'm gonna be
had a good time tonight
Yeah
Me too
It was fun
It was
So
let's do this again sometime
() like that
For the first time the whole night,
Interlocking fingers, they head inside, closing their front door behind them
