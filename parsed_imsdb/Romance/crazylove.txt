Written by Carol Watson 3/10/04 : -  - The sweet silence of slumber
Suddenly, an alarm clock on a nightstand  the operatic tones of Maria Callas
well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze button and mutes Maria
few seconds reprieve
Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the of the "William Tell Overture
" Toes, also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser
, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music
She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are arranged by color, from white to beige to black
Behind the panties are rows of bras, also organized by color
Letty pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties
Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen suit
She lays it on the bed
Beast, her cat, jumps on the bed and settles into the jacket
Letty swoops the animal off her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit
Listen, Beast
What have  told you about linen
The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that from another room
On cue, Letty heads down the hall, dressing as she goes
She  for Beast to follow
- Letty turns off the alarm clock that  "Urge Overkill" from the counter and checks the time against her watch
She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food arranged by type
Seafood on the left, chicken in the middle, then, naturally, beef
Letty reaches for a can
(looking at Beast) It's liver saute
Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can
Fine, then, chicken in gravy
But you're going to have to eat the liver tomorrow
2
- Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair spray
Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time  the voice of shock jocks
- Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is mounted near the front door
She bends down to kiss the cat good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves
-    - school bell
Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door
She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to turn the handle
Letty is stopped cold when , 7, the victim of a bloody nose, runs up to her, bawling
Miss Mayer
Miss Mayer
Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door
(to Chandra) Goodness, this is a bad one
Tip your head back
She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head
Chandra, off balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel, staining it for all eternity
Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes
Come on
Pinch it, Chandra
Pinch it
'  -    - , 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with , the 50-something school Superintendent
Also present are
, who is a School Board Member, and two other
Principal Gail glances at the clock
Mrs
Montes taps her foot
Johansen clears his throat
3
Well,  have a full calendar today, and 'm afraid
The door bursts open
Letty stumbles into the room
She clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her blood-smeared lapel
Mr
Johansen, hello
'm so sorry 'm late
It's very nice to meet you
Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending down to shake hands with Johansen and the others
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave
do apologize
student had a crisis
crisis, you say
bloody nose
There is no response
Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase and reveals the stain
bloody nose of epic proportions
Johansen smiles
, Miss Mayer
Ten minutes
Wow us
-    - bunch of  play kickball in a haze of sawdust
Chandra sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose
, a limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym
Letty talks on her
She glances around to monitor her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball game

No cherry drops, Jenny
(into the phone) Yes, hi
'm calling for Paul Lascher
(beat) Could you tell him it's Letty
(beat) He can't
Um, well, tell him, tell him that they went for my math idea
Thanks
Letty dials again
She sees two boys fighting over the ball and moves in to break them up
(to boys) Not so rough, guys
(into phone) Mom
Hi
You'll never guess what
've got the best news
(beat) No, about work
How about dinner
Brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, Letty catches Jenny make the daring Cherry Drop back flip off the bar
She blows a series of ,   on her whistle
(to Jenny) You're in trouble, young lady
(into the phone) know, Mom
But it's the only place  can call from
(beat) Can you tell Ruth about dinner
(beat) Paul's fine, just fine
The class bell
Got to go, Mom
The monsters call
- Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the patrons dare speak only in hushed tones
Letty sits sipping wine with her mother,
, immaculate in a cream suit, young looking for her 50-odd years
5
Letty's sister --early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair and an ever-present smile--bounds into the restaurant, oozing happiness
Letty discretely waves her over
Sorry 'm late
Letty pours her a glass of wine
Letty was just getting ready to tell me her good news
(to Letty) Tell, tell
(leaning toward Letty) Letty, dear, is that a cat hair on your blouse
Letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse
So,  got the district to approve my after-school math program
Ruth smiles at her, but vacantly
How wonderful, darling
(beat) What does that mean for you
'll be running it three days a week, and
Will you get time off to do that
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program
Ruth stares around the restaurant, a shit-eating grin plastered across her face
(to Ruth) What's up with you
6
Me
Nothing
Tell me more about the job
(to Ruth) Not a job, a promotion
No, Mom, it's more of a prestige thing
Mmmmmmm
Letty passes her hand in front of Ruth's eyes
Ruth
Calling Ruth
(laughing) Sorry
Just go ahead and tell us
There's nothing to tell
(to Ruth) Are you sure, Dear
Come on
No, really
Tell me about the promotion
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest
Ruth can't hold it a moment longer without bursting
(almost screaming) 'm getting married
7
Mrs
Mayer's eyes immediately fill with tears
Ruth leaps up and hugs her mother
Other diners glance toward the table
One     taps the side of her glass with her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth
Other follow suit
Ruth grins back and starts to giggle
'm so happy for you
It's just wonderful
Mrs
Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin
My goodness
wedding
My goodness
Wow
Congratulations
Ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned Letty
(to Letty) Can you believe it
Ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse
She slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of Letty and her mother, who peers at it with approval
Tell us every detail
You've only known Jake a few months
Three and a week
(screaming again) Isn't it great
My goodness
What about an engagement party
We must start planning
(signaling a waiter) Champagne
Girls, we need some champagne
Off Letty's frozen smile, we : 8
- '  - Letty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart , early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off his expensive suit
He opens a drawer of Letty's dresser, and removes a neatly pressed -shirt
He smooths out another shirt he has accidently rumpled in the process
So, another one bites the dust
It's not another one
It's my sister
(beat) Aren't you happy for her
She's only known the guy a few months
Paul lays his folded trousers across Letty's desk
Can  put these here for tonight
(pointing to the closet) In there's better
(beat) It's kind of romantic, don't you think
really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well
Paul sits on the bed, and leans against a pillow
Believe me,  know your feelings on the matter
The receptionist said you called earlier about something
Letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to Paul
9
My math program
The Superintendent said he'd fund it
Good going
knew you could do it
Paul kisses Letty on the cheek
It looks like we're both bucking for advancement
Yeah
Huntley told me today that if come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate
Letty hugs Paul
Congratulations
We should celebrate
was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark
mean tonight
Letty sensually caresses his shoulders
Like right now
Actually,  need to review the deposition questions tonight
Maybe tomorrow
Oh, ok
Maybe
10
But  thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how  come across
(beat) Sure
Of course
Letty continues coloring her multiplication chart
Letty, please,  need your full attention
Letty puts the chart down and sits up straighter
Let me have it
-    - Letty rubs her eyes with fatigue
Bobby stands next to her holding a crumpled paper bag
My dog ate my turtle, and the shell went crunch
brought it for show- and-tell
The children perk up at this news
'm sorry about your turtle Bobby, but you know we only have show-and- tell on Mondays
Today, we're scheduled for grammar
But my mom says  have to throw it away tonight
Bobby opens the bag
He reaches in to remove the turtle
The children
Letty's on him in a second
Don't even think about it
She grabs the bag
From outside, there is a
Letty and the students look toward the window
It's Ruth
She's been crying
She waves to Letty
Chandra waves back at Ruth
11
Letty puts up her finger to signal "just a minute" to Ruth
She sets the turtle bag on Bobby's desk
Class, why don't you
Ruth knocks on the glass again
Letty glances at her distraught sister and walks quickly toward the door
(to class) You guys pull out your verb sheets and review them
Letty leaves the room
The class watches through the window as Ruth throws her sobbing self into Letty's arms
-    - She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica
Mom won't miss your wedding
She'll come around
promise she will
Letty glances through the window at her classroom, where Bobby waves the turtle over his head
How
'll talk to her, and to Dad, too
(beat) few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something
Letty looks again at the classroom, where the students are lobbing the turtle back and forth
Maybe
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty
12
Letty's attention snaps back to Ruth
Oh, wait a minute, now  see where you're going
Please, Letty
Mom and Dad
At dinner together
Are you crazy
Ruth starts to sob--big, loud, air-gulping sobs
Letty pats her shoulder
Maybe, though
Maybe it would work
could throw you an engagement party maybe
Really
Principal Gail, trolling the halls, spies Letty with Ruth
She dispatches a stern look in Letty's direction
(nodding toward Gail) You know what, Ruthie
better get back to my class,
And the party
Yeah, it'll be fun
Ruth grabs Letty in another hug
Thank you so much
- Letty strides into the classroom, pulls the turtle away from Bobby and drops it in the trash
Who can come up here and give me a sentence with a "to be" verb in it
13
Who was that girl
Come on up, Zach
Zach approaches the board and begins to write, " am
"    He doesn't get any further before Letty cuts him off
Neater, Zach
Zach begins again, but Letty stops him when he reaches "am
" Zach, you know the line by the "a" has to come straight down or it looks like an "o
" Zach looks back toward his classmates for help
What's wrong, Zach
Letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a
" She erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect
Try again, Zach
Like that
Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk
Zach freezes
He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and, above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at him
Letty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks like a pretty good "a
" don't believe it
You still can't do it
'm sorry, , Miss Mayer
No, it's not
You'll never get to college on
Letty's fingers press into Zach's arm
tear slides ominously down his cheek
14
It has to be good, Zach
Do you understand me
Zach wrests free of Letty
He's in full cry now
He backs away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat
Bobby at Zach's misfortune
Other children glance around, unsure, confused
Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and looks at the children again
She sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands
Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax
She takes a deep breath and raises her head
'm very, very sorry, Zach
Zach continues to cry
Letty looks down at her desk
She grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste
You know what, guys
Wednesday's not a grammar day
It's a collage day
It's a collage day
Letty jumps up
She slaps the paper on the wall with some paste
She motions for the students to join her
The children slowly approach her
Zach lags behind
And, Zach
Zach,  want you to be in charge of paste
- '  - Letty lies in bed
The alarm clock  opera
Letty fumbles for the switch
She can't turn it off
She yanks out the cord
Letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the second clock before it rings
She goes to the  and snaps off the alarm, then heads down the  and shuts that alarm off, as well
Letty hurries back to her  and crawls into bed
Paul, toweling his hair dry, walks in
15
What are you doing
You're going to be late
'm calling in sick
Paul sits on the bed and puts his hand to Letty's forehead
You don't have a fever
don't feel like going to work today
Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late
It'll be
But what about that math project
Paul,  just can't go
Is that with you or am  committing some horrible crime
Forget  asked
'm sorry
(beat) 'm just
'm so tired lately
Maybe you ought to see a doctor
No, it's not like that
Letty starts to cry
It's just 've got those parent conferences, and 'm supposed to set up the math program by next week
() 16
(cont'd) And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner
You can get out of the dinner
No,  can't
've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come
Come on, Letty
It'll get done
Paul touches Letty's shoulder
She pulls away from him
don't think so
Of course it will
Remember the big talent show you planned last year
And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute
But you still pulled it off
Yeah
You just need to get more organized Maybe
Let's make a list of the things you need to do,
Letty nods her head, and Paul grabs a legal pad from his briefcase
-    - and
, over-eager parents, sit across the desk from Letty, who stares at the legal pad in her lap
As the Andersons talk, Letty twists a lock of hair tighter and tighter
So at home, we've started our own little library for Chandra
17
We thought it would be a good project for her to set up her own card-catalogue
see
Letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her hair
But what 'm wondering is whether we should also be spending more time on her computer skills at home
What do you think
Well
Because we don't want her to get behind her classmates
And we trust your opinion
Chandra's always talking about Miss Mayer
Oh
Just the other day she came home and told us about you taking care of her bloody nose
And she went on and on about the collage
That seems very inventive, Miss Mayer
Letty stares blankly at the couple
Miss Mayer
What the fuck
It's my job
Off Mr
Anderson's raised eyebrow, we : 18
- '  - The room is a mess of scattered papers and the math Twister game
Letty sits on the ground crying
She makes a pyramid out of the wadded-up tissues that surround her
- The upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots of signs announcing "Sale Day
" Frenzied women pick through dresses as "Pachelbel's Canon" plays in the background
Letty is wedged into a corner, sipping coffee approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries
More coffee
Hit me
Danish
(rooting through the tray) No more bear claws left
Ruth bounces into the shop
(to Ruth) Danish
Oh, no thanks, 'm too excited to eat
The clerk gives Ruth an approving smile as Letty rips into a sweet roll
Ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns
(to Letty) Where's Mommy
Do you have to call her Mommy
Where's the old bag  sometimes call Mommy
19
She said she'd be here at 10
Ruth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up
What do you think of this one
'd have to see it on
Ruth looks closer at Letty
Have you been crying
Your eyes are all puffy
Letty self-consciously touches her eyes
Things have been kind of stressful lately
But everything's
Ruth is trying on a veil at this point
Yeah, everything's under control
What about the engagement party
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty
Jake's really looking forward to it
Letty sighs, moves to the racks and pulls out a dress
You better start trying on before the vultures get all the good ones
- uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as Letty picks up discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up
20
What about this one
(with sisterly pride) You look beautiful
Really
Truly
Martha Mayer is led in by the clerk
Hi, Mom
Look, Mom,  think 've found the dress
You look just wonderful, Ruthie
But  really think you should try on a few more, don't you
Letty and Ruth shoot each other a look of doom
- bedraggled Letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at dresses
They are bumped and jostled from all sides
Has Paul heard about his promotion
No, not yet
But you know Paul
He's sure to get it
Ruth comes out of the dressing room in another gown
don't like the bias cut on that one
Mrs
Mayer holds up an ornate dress
No more
can't stand to try on one more dress
21
Letty,  think this would be beautiful on you
Oh no
Paul could pop the question at any time
Mom, please
Especially with a promotion in the offing
Go on, Letty
want to see it on you
(to Ruth) Do you think  should
Yes, yes
It'll be fun
Letty takes the gown and disappears into the dressing room
- Letty emerges from the dressing room
Mom
Mom
Ruth
Letty peers around the corner, becoming a tad frantic
But neither her mother nor Ruth is to be found
It's just Letty, resplendent in ecru satin
think they went over to the next shop to take a peek at shoes
Letty pushes back her veil, sits down on the floor and takes a sip of her now-cold coffee
22
' /  - "House and Garden" picture of elegance
Letty, Paul, Ruth and Jake stand at nervous attention, decked out in their Sunday best
marks the first arrival
Letty opens the door to her mother, who does a quick reconnaissance of the room
gather he's late as usual
(to her mother) Can  get you a glass of champagne
The doorbell
Letty greets her father, a mid 50s business type, and his wife , a younger version of Letty's mother
Hi, Dad, Monica
'm so glad you could come
Suddenly, the parents are face-to-face, Letty standing between them
Mom, this is Monica
Monica, my mother, Martha
The two Mrs
Mayers make appropriate
Letty's parents stare each other down
Ruth shifts from foot to foot
Silence falls in the room with a thump
Dad, Mother, you've met before, right
Ruth takes a dramatic gulp of air
The evening hangs in the balance
Finally, How've you been, Martha
- '  - Mr
Mayer and Monica cozy up to each other on the love seat while Mrs
Mayer, Ruth and Paul sit on the opposite couch
Letty passes hors d'oeuvres, and Jake doles out napkins
23
It's mushroom-time, folks
(biting into one) like the touch of cilantro
It is cilantro, isn't it
You can always call it, Dad
You must get your cooking skills from your father, Letty
Uncomfortable silence falls on the party
Monica wipes the edge of Mr
Mayer's mouth with her napkin
Ruth's narrowed the dress hunt down to two, Dad
Tell me about them
One's a silk
Not in front of Jake, Ruthie
It's bad luck
Ruth looks at Letty nervously
remember how hard it was looking for my dress
must have been to 100 stores
Mrs
Mayer clears her throat
More silence
You know what  think we need
Martinis
How about martinis to celebrate
Yes
That might be nice
24
As long as you have
Puglia olives
Would  forget
(beat) round of martinis coming right up
Letty leaves with Paul hot on her heels
- Letty shakes the martinis while Paul gets out the glasses
Ruth enters the kitchen and sidles up to Letty
How can  help
Paul, can you hand me the olives
Ruth,  need you to, what was it
What about the souffle
Has that gone in
Yeah,  just put it in
But the squab,  think that needs to be basted
Paul hands Letty the olive bottle
(to Ruth) Kind of icy in there
(to Paul) Thank God we have alcohol
Letty skewers olives and puts them in the martinis
Bits of fleck rise from the olives, then swim to the tops of the glasses
Fuck me
What's the matter
Letty grabs the olive bottle
25
Letty
Letty stands still, fixated on the olive bottle
Let Olives Aux Herbes De Provence got the wrong kind of olives
Ruth holds up a glass
What's all the dreck
Sage, rosemary
(in a sarcastic French accent) Les Herbes
It'll be fine
No, no
They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate
Jake enters
The three turn on him
// You can't leave them alone
/Get back in there
/Are you nuts
Jake whirls around and exits
Letty looks for olives, banging open the cupboards one after the other
Quicker and quicker
More and more frantic
- Jake, Mr
Mayer, Monica and Mrs
Mayer stare at each other, listening with alarm to the wild slamming of cupboards in the kitchen
What do you think of those Lakers
26
- Letty paws through her purse
What are you doing
(wild-eyed) Can you loan me a 20
Sure
Why
'm going to the store
think you're overreacting
Letty turns her best school marm look on Paul
He hands over a crisp bill
Letty, dinner's almost ready
The souffle
'll be back before you can say souffle
Letty leaves from the kitchen's back door
Ruth heads to the living room
Paul leans wearily against the counter, savoring one of the herb-filled martinis
- Fluorescent lights beat down on Letty
She races through the aisles
She clutches her keys in one hand, a $20 bill in the other
Letty careens around a corner
At the last second, she avoids smacking into another shopper
She stops
' : Shelf after shelf of olives
black olives
all black
: Letty darts up and down the aisle, searching, searching
Nothing
27
Letty scurries to the front of the store
She taps a on the shoulder
Six people waiting in line mutter, annoyed
can't find martini olives
All you have are black
(without looking up) Aisle 2A
Letty whips down an aisle
She starts to sweat
An   blocks her path
Excuse me, Miss
can't reach the cat food
Letty pauses
She reaches up and hands the woman a can of food
And a turkey and giblets, too, please
She does like her turkey
Letty grabs another can, throws it in the Old Lady's cart and darts away while the Old Lady continues to talk
' : The sign for Aisle 2A
Olives
Lots of them
Green
All shapes
All sizes
: Letty's shoulders relax
She scans the shelf
's : Labels of olives: big, small, with pimentos, without
None from Puglia, Italy
: Letty zooms back to the front of the store
To the clerk
They're not there
need the ones from Puglia
28
She gets no response from the clerk, who counts change for a customer
Letty gestures wildly with her hands
They're the ones that are packed in brine, but they don't overpower the, you know, the palate
(without looking up) Specialty foods
7B
Letty's off again
To the land of pink peppercorns, dehydrated mushrooms and Chinese 5-Spice
But no olives
Not a single bottle
Letty paws through the shelves, knocking things over as she scours the aisle
She is oblivious to the mess that surrounds her
An  with a price checker walks half-way down the aisle
He spots Letty and rushes away
Where are they
Where are they
More and more items crash to the ground
Letty is beyond frenzied
( ) Manager to 7B
Manager please
Where are they
Letty pounds her fist against the shelf
More goods fall
Shoppers stare
The Manager rushes toward Letty
What's wrong, Miss
Tell me where they are
She gestures
She knocks over a bottle of fat-free Lingonberry preserves
It crashes to the floor, spewing jam
think you should go now
need my olives
29
It's time to leave
The Manager places his hand on the small of Letty's back as if to guide her out of the store
Letty backs away
The manager grabs hold of her wrist
Letty whacks him in the shoulder with her free hand
She pushes him away
Hard
He staggers against the opposite shelf
Customers and employees gather at both ends of the aisle, riveted by the spectacle
Call security
Where's security, please
Letty takes her arm and slides a shelf-full of products onto the floor
They crash and break
She screams
Fucking olives
Fucking, fucking olives
Two   turn the corner
Letty spots them
One creeps closer
No, no, no
Go away
Guard One continues to approach, cooing encouragingly
Letty throws a jar at him
It clips him in the head
He turns away, bleeding
Guard Two pulls out a billy club
(yelling) Call police
Now
Letty stops
Dazed
She turns around
Guard Two walks toward her
His stance suggests he's stalking a wild animal
Letty tries to brush off the jam that dribbles down her skirt
She looks to both ends of the aisle
' : Faces, dozens and dozens of faces, stare down at her
People point
One boy
: 30
Letty backs against the shelf
She slides down it until she is sitting on the floor
She buries her head in her knees, sobbing
: : '  -    - The room is furnished like a Hyatt Hotel minus anything you might use to kill yourself
Letty sleeps
, mid 30's, in jeans and -shirt, sits in a chair next to the bed
He looks intently at Letty, checks his watch and taps her on the shoulder
She stirs
Miss Mayer
Miss Mayer
' : Everything's a morning blur
Gradually, items come into focus -- the intercom for the nurse, the door with a window in it, the three tissue boxes on the bedside table
It's a hospital, all right
Letty's vision is filled suddenly by Michael's concerned face peering into hers
: know you've had a rough night, but  have a few questions for you, Miss Mayer, or Letitia
Letty pulls herself up to a sitting position
Do you mind if  call you Letitia
Letty
(consulting his notes) First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are
answered these questions last night
31
know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night
Hillview Psychiatric Hospital
Great
Now, Letty, 'd like you to remember three items
'm going to ask you to repeat them in just a few minutes
They are chair, cup and ball
Did you get that
Letty nods
, let's subtract 6 from a succession of numbers starting with 91
85
And 85 minus 6
59
Michael waits
No, 79
Sorry, this makes me nervous
It's
It's not a pass-fail kind of thing
Letty smiles uncomfortably
Now the three things  asked you to remember
Chair, cup and ball
32
Terrific
Letty smiles, a real smile this time
Let me shift gears here a minute
(beat) Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't
No
What about patterns
Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks
Or washing your hands over and over again
Letty shakes her head "no
" How about arranging your possessions in a certain way
Letty pauses
Yes
Go right ahead
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear
Michael leans closer
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton
By color
What if it's got a pattern
Is this really important
Because don't think it's a problem
33
see
(looking at his notes) How long has it been since you've done something you've enjoyed, Letty
(beat) while,  guess
That must be really difficult
Letty tears up
Michael puts his hand lightly on her arm
Hey, it'll be
We'll make sure of that
Letty gives him an appreciative look
For now, why don't you just take it easy while  confer with my colleagues
nurse should be in shortly
'  - Letty, dressed and made up, sits rigidly on the bed
She writes in her organizer
, early 40s and in jeans, enters with his own organizer
Hello, Letitia
'm Dr
Emlee, and have some questions to ask you
did this already
It's hospital policy
To be interviewed every hour
'm the only doctor making rounds this morning
34
Well,  don't have hallucinations
Honest
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair
Yeah, and a dimple
Dr
Emlee shifts uncomfortably
'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor
Psychologist, therapist, whatever
Patient
What
Michael, the man who came to see you, is a patient
What kind of place is this
apologize for the inconvenience, but  must ask you some
want to see my mother immediately
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced
don't think you understand won't wait
35
You'll have to
Your family agreed to the conditions not to see you when they admitted you to Hillview, Letitia
(beat) We can talk about how that makes you feel, but we can't change the rules
Letty sinks back on her pillows, the wind knocked out of her
Dr
Stone's evaluation from last night indicates you're experiencing a great deal of anxiety, probably related to depression
' : Dr
Emlee continues to talk
His words become more and more distant as the  in Letty's head grows louder
We need to talk about starting you on drug therapy
Most depressive personalities benefit from a drug like Prozac or maybe Zoloft
: -    - It's a bigger version of a waiting room you'd find in a doctor's office
And it has more games
Some patients watch television
Others play pool
Several form a group around Michael, who holds the same notebook he used in his session with Letty
, unkempt in a bathrobe, hands him a few ratty dollar bills
'm in for 5 for manic depressive
, late 40s and in a suit, waves a $5 bill at Michael
'll go with that as well
Michael takes the money, and turns to , late 30s
36
(to John and Thomas) You two always bet manic depressive
to Michael) Tell me more about the guard she strangled
No, just hit in the head
What about voices
Does she hear voices
Not that she admits to
Is she a washer
No, but she is exceptionally organized
How organized
She arranges her underwear by color
Michael motions to
, mid 50s, who shuffles by
Mrs
Hallstrom, you want in
All tapped out
'll float you
Mrs
Hallstrom keeps walking
(to Michael) It's been weeks since she played
What about you, Marie
37
(handing Michael a $20 bill) 'll say major depression complicated by obsessive compulsive disorder
(beat) And could  get my change in ones
-    - Letty lags behind  , early 30s and in civilian clothes, as they walk down the hall
Treatment schedules are posted on the bulletin board
Dinner at 6, lights out at 10 and no fraternizing between patients
Letty nods
(pointing as she goes) That's the rec room
We show movies there on Wednesdays and Fridays
And this is the dining hall
Letty stops in her tracks at the sight of the room, an upscale version of a college cafeteria
Groups of people eat and talk
paper airplane sails from one table to another
'm really not that hungry
Just eat whatever you want
This will give you a chance to meet some people
You know, my mom's coming to get me tomorrow
'll be leaving
It's , Letty
'll be right here with you
- Nurse Gates guides Letty to a table where John, Mrs
Hallstrom, Marie and Thomas sit
38
So  said to my publisher this afternoon,  said, don't you even-- (interrupts) Hi, gang
want to introduce you to Letty
(to Letty) Letty, this is Mrs
Hallstrom and Marie, and John and Thomas
(to Letty) Just discussing my pesky publisher
May  ask what you do when you're not vacationing
(to Thomas) Let the poor girl get some food, for Heaven's sake
'm a teacher
As you may have gathered, 'm a writer
John snorts
Thomas ignores him
Mrs
Hallstrom stares down at her plate
don't like to say novelist
That sounds a little grandiose, but  am on my third novel and
Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas, but we really should get some food
Nurse Gates leads Letty to a table, and hands her a plate
Letty looks up to see Michael at the other end of the table, doing a card trick for two
(to patients) Now 'm going to say that the card you picked was the Ace of Spades
39
He flips the top card up and it's the Ace of Spades
The patients chortle
Michael
Michael turns toward the nurse
Michael, this is Letty
She just arrived yesterday
Letty stares at Michael coldly
We've met
(to Michael) missed you during rounds this morning
Letty turns and leaves, carrying her empty plate with her
(to Michael) This doctor thing has got to stop
Nurses Gates hurries after Letty
-    - Letty stands outside the waiting room door
She tucks her blouse into her jeans and enters
-    - Letty's mother sits on the edge of a couch in a room that looks much like the library of an English country manor
She springs up as soon as she spots Letty
They rush to each other
Letty's mother strokes her hair
'm here, Sweetheart
'm here
It's going to be
'm sorry
'm so sorry
Oh, Letty, what happened
Mom,  was there, and  just,  was so
() 40
(cont'd) They didn't have the olives, and , got so upset
don't know how it happened
've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says
'm so glad to see you
You can't believe the people in here
They've got patients posing as doctors
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing
just want to go home
Can we go home now
think the best thing for you right now is to stay here and get well
Maybe  should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul
We all agree with the doctor, Dear
He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while
Letty listens, waits, can't absorb it
You all really think  need to be here
Yes
But what about Beast
Who'll
Ruth's already taken him home
41
And my class
It'll be hard to find a good substitute
And what about my math program
Paul said he'd call the school
(beat) And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help
Charges
For his injuries
guess you guess he got hit in the head
Mrs
Mayer holds out a duffel bag to Letty
packed up some of your clothes, and  can bring whatever else you need
Letty refuses to accept the duffel bag
Her mother sets it on the floor and stands
Letty is five again
Mom, no, please don't go
Please
Letty's mother holds her
Mrs
Mayer, crying, pulls away from Letty
She kisses her daughter on the cheek
'll see you soon
Tomorrow
As soon as Dr
Emlee says
Letty's mother walks out the door
Letty stares after her
'  - Letty, crying, unpacks her duffel bag, laboriously smoothing and refolding every item she puts in the drawer
Finishing her task, Letty goes to the mirror and stares at her reflection
Finally, she fixes her makeup
42
Letty leaves her room
We follow her  down the hallway
In the distance, Letty sees the Rec Room
She hears the  of voices
Every step is agony
Letty stops herself just before entering, trying to collect herself
(
) Four people bet  and clinical depression so  split the pool
(
) Yeah, her diagnosis was no mystery
Especially the
Sick realization spreads over Letty's face
(
) Fuck,  mean, anyone who color- codes her panties has big problems
Letty freezes
Michael rounds the corner
He stops when he sees her, falters, recovers his composure
Hey there
They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you
You took bets on my diagnosis
It's no big deal
We all compare
(voice rising) ho do you think you are
- Patients are grouped in front of the , watching Bill Murray
Heads turn as they hear shouting in the hallway
Not even a moment's hesitation before, one by one, they get up and hurry to the hall
Only Mrs
Hallstrom remains
- John, Marie and others gather around the fighters
Don't take it personally
43
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game
Stop acting like you're someone special
You're just like the rest of us
'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor
'm not the one who's, who's
(to Letty) He's schizophrenic
'm not the one who's schizophrenic
don't see people who aren't there or run around acting crazy
Letty pounds her fist against the wall
Go, Girl
/ Come on, Michael
Oh, no, you're perfectly sane
That's why you're here
Letty looks like she's been slapped
She thinks for a moment
The patients wait, breathless, for her retort
Go fuck yourself
Michael grins at Letty
She turns, and strides down the hall
There's a smattering of applause
It grows stronger
We see Letty's eyes fill with tears as, behind her, the patients yell
Bravo
/Encore
/Re-match
44
'  - Letty, unable to sleep, tosses and turns
She gets out of bed and paces the room nervously, trying to hold herself together
She slumps to the floor and starts to cry
-    - r
Emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding chairs
Michael, who sits next to Emlee, practices rolling a quarter back and forth across his fingers
Letty sits across from Michael and Emlee, her legs and arms crossed tightly
The group concentrates on Mrs
Hallstrom
can't stop thinking about the things  did wrong when my daughter was little
And how's that make you feel
just feel like sleeping
All the time
Hell's bells, you can count me in on that
haven't had enough 's since  ran those sleep disorder experiments at Stanford back in the 70s
We really miss doing things with you, Mrs
Hallstrom
Michael, sitting next to Mrs
Hallstrom, squeezes her arm
Maybe when  hit my manic phase again
Group members smile
've noticed Letty doesn't much like to do things with us
The group looks expectantly at Letty
45
Oh, no
Of course  do
Then why are you so defensive
(to John) don't think we need to sacrifice Letty to pep up a slow session
(to Michael) You're the one who told everyone about her panties
Michael grimaces at John
Letty's head is bent down
Maybe you'd like to share some of your feelings about  or depression with us, Letty
Letty eyes the doctor
She's dangerously close to tears
Do we have to talk about this
think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others
Michael reaches his hand behind Dr
Emlee's head, catching Letty's eye in the process
Michael pulls a silver dollar out of Emlee's ear
Letty looks but doesn't respond
The other patients ignore Michael
Emlee is oblivious
You never know, Letty, how the person sitting next to you may be able to shed light on one of your problems
Michael goes for a bigger trick
Reaching again behind the doctor's head, he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers
Letty, almost against her will, smiles
46
by revealing something that's going on in his or her own life
Michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctor's head
Letty's smile broadens
(responding to her smile) There, now,  knew you'd feel better once we discussed group process
Let's talk a little about your
-    - Letty ponders a shelf of ratty paperbacks
Michael turns the corner, thumbing through a dog-eared book
Letty spots him and moves away
Michael sidles up next to her
Looking for a romance
Excuse me
What are you looking to read
Anything interesting
Michael holds out his book to her
This is good
Letty glances at the title, "101
" But you're checking it out
've already checked it out 17 times
Michael reaches behind Letty
She pulls away
He produces a scarf from behind her back, and presents it to her
She doesn't take it
You keep the book
'm looking for Emily Dickinson
47
Letty walks away
Michael follows
Hey, if you take the magic book, 'll feel like maybe you accept my apology and don't hate me anymore
Letty hesitates
haven't heard an apology
Michael drops to one knee
'm really sorry  hurt your feelings
got a little carried away
Can you ever forgive me
Letty takes the book from him and walks away
-    - Letty sits in an arm chair staring out at the garden
Her attention is drawn to a nearby couch where Michael sits opposite Mrs
Hallstrom, apparently playing cards
Michael lays a card down
Mrs
Hallstrom, 'm pretty sure you could use that
She shakes her head slowly back and forth
Michael places it in her hand of cards
Now, don't you have a gin rummy, Mrs
Hallstrom
(beat) Go ahead, now, just lay those cards down
Mrs
Hallstrom slowly spreads her hand of cards on the couch
Hot damn
Gin rummy
told you so
You're three games up on me
Mrs
Hallstrom smiles
Michael catches Letty watching them, and Letty quickly looks away
48
'  -    - Letty opens her drawer to pull out a -shirt
Several are rumpled
She starts refolding them when she spots it
There, nestled among her clothes, is a book of Emily Dickinson's poetry
Letty picks it up, runs her hand over the cover and starts reading
-    - Paul and Letty walk onto a postcard-perfect stone terrace overlooking the garden
Paul pulls up a chair for Letty and stares out at the scenery
It's prettier here than  thought it would be
Yeah,  guess it's all right
Are you all right
That's a big question
hope it wasn't something  did
Something you did
That put you in here
Of course not, no
(beat) Is that why you're here
think we need to talk about some things
Yes,  suppose so
This has been really difficult, this whole thing
() 49
(cont'd) These past few weeks, it's made me really go back and examine our whole relationship
(beat) mean, we've been going out for four years, and it hasn't always been so easy
No
Especially this last year
(softly) Especially now
So, 've been thinking a lot
have too, Paul
talked to Ruth a little bit, and think it's about time
know
We can't just keep going through the motions
Exactly
It's time to make decisions
You don't have to say anything else
've known for a while that this was coming
just wish we'd done it sooner
Paul takes Letty's hand in his
Will you marry me
Paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on Letty's finger
She stares at it, mesmerized
50
had to smuggle it in here guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry
(by rote) Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients
hope you like it
It's a Marquis cut, 1
5 carats
They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines
(beat) Letty
It's, it's really nice, Paul
You can take it back and we can have one custom made if you want
No, you've done a perfect job
So, what do you say, Let
Letty looks him in the eyes for the first time
Do you think, really, that it's to get engaged when 'm in here
Sure
We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out already told your mother
hope you don't mind
No, no
So will you
(working up a smile) Of course
Yes
will
do
51
Paul and Letty kiss, then hug
-    - It's completely dark
Letty sits in the same position we saw her in hours ago
Michael walks up to her
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner
wasn't hungry
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs
Hallstrom's milk
(smiling) Finally
was getting tired of watching him try every night
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter
Paul
He looked pretty serious
He asked me to marry him
Very romantic setting
It was romantic
He's very romantic
So are you engaged, or what
Letty holds out her hand, where the diamond glistens
Michael bends forward to look at the ring, caressing her hand as he does so
Letty pulls away
The ring is gone
52
What have you done with the ring
It's magic
Letty stands up
This isn't funny
Paul would kill me
Michael holds his hands in fists toward Letty
Guess which hand
Enough with the abracadabra
Guess
he left one
Michael opens his hand
It's empty
Michael addresses an imaginary audience
(to audience) The fair maiden guesses incorrectly
Should we give her one more try
(to Letty) The audience says one more try
What guess you now
The right one
Michael opens his right hand
plastic, Cracker-jack ring rests in it
Come on, Michael
Michael grabs Letty's hand and slides the ring onto her finger
With this ring,  thee
53
Letty pulls her hand away
Really, this isn't funny
, , 'll give it back
Letty holds out her hand
For a price
Good God
small price
won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup
No
And 'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos
want a kiss
Letty stares at him
She laughs
Get serious
Michael moves close to her
'm serious
Letty looks into his eyes
(softly) Everything's a joke with you
Michael and Letty kiss, long and deep
Letty pulls back
She gazes at Michael
She steps closer to him
They kiss again, longer and deeper
54
They separate
Letty looks ready for another kiss
Michael caresses her cheek
He walks back toward the hospital door
He stops, comes back to Letty
He hands her the diamond ring
Here
He walks inside
Letty watches him go
'  -    - Dr
Emlee and Letty sit across from each other
The medicine's still bothering me
It feels like  have cotton wrapped around my brain
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next (week
beat) How are other things going
think 've told you all the news
Let's see--the engagement
Oh, and my sister's coming to visit me, and they say my cat misses me
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling
miss Beast a lot, too
'  -    - Darkness
Michael sleeps
Christmas Carol  through the intercom system
Hark the Herald Angels sing
Michael bolts awake
He stumbles out of bed, in wildly striped boxers, and races toward the hall
55
-    - Doors open like kernels of popcorn exploding
Michael, Marie, Thomas, John, then Letty
The music  on
Nurse Gates runs down the hall and shouts to Michael
What are you doing
(yelling) Not me
The music lowers
Mrs
Hallstrom, in a Santa cap, appears
She distributes erasers as she threads through the patients
Sorry, sorry
Candy canes are out of season
Mrs
Hallstrom
Mrs
Hallstrom gives an eraser to the nurse
Come on
Come with me, Mrs
Hallstrom
Nurse Gates leads Mrs
Hallstrom away as the older woman continues tossing erasers down the hall
Marie stares at Michael's shorts
Hot boxers
Michael smiles awkwardly at Letty
She returns to her room
'  - Letty climbs into bed
She opens the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Tiffany's ring box
There, cradled in the satin lining, is the diamond from Paul
Right beside it is Michael's Cracker Jack special
Letty puts on Paul's ring
She studies her hand
With an air of secrecy, she slips on Michael's ring
She quickly takes it off
Wearing Paul's ring, she turns off the light and snuggles into bed
56
,     - Afternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned hedges and tea roses
Letty and Ruth power-walk down a cobblestone path, heading away from the English Tudor hospital that looms large in the background
Letty wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo for the University of South Carolina Cocks
can't believe you finally gave me the shirt
Loaned you
And it's only 'til you get out of here
That settles it
'm never leaving
can hardly wait 'til you're free
Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster
You're slowing
(picking up the pace) Mom and  fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white
Letty checks her stop watch
What do you think
Ecru
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print
Letty completely stops and faces Ruth
Do we have to talk wedding details
57
Oh, no, of course not
mean, you can always send me fabric samples to look at or pictures of dresses
But, it's been so long since we've seen each other
Of course
You're right
Besides, we should be talking about your engagement
They start walking again
Tell me more about Beast beating up that other cat
Bloody furry mess, like  said
(beat) Aren't you so excited about Paul
beat) Letty
Ruth stops this time
What's going on with you, Letty
Ruthie, do you ever wonder if you'll meet someone else
someone besides Jake
Power walking's forgotten
Ruth and Letty start to amble
What's his name, Letty
didn't say
Don't even try
What's his name
'  -    - Nurse Gates passes by the open door, and pokes her head in
58
Lights out, Letty
Letty closes the door
She pulls a nightshirt from a drawer, disrupting a perfectly-folded -shirt
Letty bends down to straighten it, but changes her mind
She shuts the drawer
Letty puts on the nightshirt, crawls into bed and snaps off the light
She fluffs her pillow, and turns over
She rolls back
Letty turns on the light
She goes to the drawer, opens it, pulls out the -shirt and refolds it
She shuts the drawer
Letty yanks open the drawer again and looks at her handiwork
It's a fight with the drawer
Opened and closed
Until Letty takes a deep breath, pulls it open a final time, hesitantly ruffles the -shirt and slams the drawer shut
She runs to bed and hops in, turning off the light and burying her head under the pillow
few moments pass
on the door
Letty opens it to find Michael
We're supposed to be asleep
Exactly
Michael takes Letty's hand and pulls her toward the door
We'll get caught
No rounds for another three hours
Michael checks the hallway and pulls Letty into it
Nervous
Scared
Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions
Don't be ridiculous
Rendezvous at the closet in 30
59
Letty forges ahead to the nurses' station, while Michael turns a corner in the hall, peeking out so he can watch Letty approach Nurse Gates
'  - Letty, you should be in bed
There's a spider in my room
Yeah
It's got a green dot on its back
can't go to sleep with it watching me
Sounds awful
guess we better check it out
Letty and Nurse Gates walk down the hall to Letty's room, passing the alcove where Michael lurks in the shadows
He sneaks into the main hall and pads up to the nurses' station
'  - Michael wanders around the desk, crouches on the floor so he can't be seen from the hallway and pulls the phone down to his level
He dials
Extra large pepperoni and mushrooms
(beat) And two cokes
(beat) Hillview Psychiatric Hospital on Glenfield
Off the Fourth Street exit
Michael reaches up to a hook and grabs a white lab coat
He puts on the coat, which identifies him as "Val Williams
" : '  - Letty and Nurse Gates, sprawled on their stomachs, peer under the bed
60
It had this red spot on its back
Green spot
Mottled really
Green and red
Nurse Gates looks Letty squarely in the eye
don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty
Lie
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so
To talk
(beat) Well, , that might be good
understand you just got engaged
Maybe that's where we should start
Off Letty's look of dismay, we : -    - Michael pays the '   and tries to walk past the guard, , who blocks his path
'm afraid  can't let you take that in without the proper invoice
It's a pizza
All the same, rules are rules
61
You don't understand
This is a very important, very special, morale-boosting pizza
What  understand is how low morale gets when you're posted at a guard station all night, Val
Reluctantly, Michael opens the pizza box, and Jim helps himself to two slices
Michael starts to shut the box
Jim reaches in for a third slice
: '  - Letty and Nurse Gates sit cross-legged on the bed, facing each other
Letty's face is puffy from crying
don't mean to go on and on like this
It's
It's good to let it out
Michael passes the open door with the pizza box and points down the hall
Letty stares right through him
Did you ever tell Paul how you felt
He was graduating from law school, and he just assumed  was  with dropping out
(beat) We never really talked about it
But  know he was disappointed in me
: - The roomy closet houses an inconceivable number of white sheets and towels, arranged on wide, tall shelves
62
The pizza, cokes and a candle sit in the middle of the floor, which Michael has draped with a sheet
Michael stares at the dwindling candle : '  - mean 'm just not sure  want the same things now that  did even a month ago
Nurse Gates nods sympathetically
Is that so wrong
Michael passes the open door again, waving his hands wildly to attract Letty's attention
She doesn't notice him
You can only do what feels best to you now
guess so
think that's right
: - Michael blows out the candle
: '  - Letty blows her nose as she walks Nurse Gates to the door
You've been so great
just feel a lot clearer about things
'm glad
And if  need to talk again
Yes, of course
Whenever you want
63
Letty gives Nurse Gates a hug
- on the door
Michael looks up
He jumps to his feet and lets Letty in, gesturing for her to sit
They lean against a stack of pillows
Sorry 'm late
Michael puts his finger to Letty's lips
Shhh
: ) The two munch on pizza
Michael picks off black olives and hands them to Letty, who plops them on top of her pizza
) Michael hands Letty a cigarette
She gestures no
He lights one for himself and begins blowing smoke rings
) Michael offers Letty pizza
She clutches her stomach to show that she's full
) Letty indicates she wants a cigarette
Michael demonstrates how to smoke, affecting the style of a 1930s movie star
Letty follows suit
) Letty grabs a pillow and hits Michael over the head
He pulls the pillow away from her
Letty stands up, grabs another pillow and hits Michael again
He whacks her in the back of the knees and she falls on top of him
Enough of the fighting
They kiss
Michael strokes the back of Letty's neck
approach the door and stop
Michael and Letty stop kissing and look at the door
The  continue on
Michael pulls Letty's shirt up
She starts to pull it over her head, but can't get it all the way off in the cramped space
Michael kisses Letty's mouth through the shirt
She Michael helps Letty off with the shirt
He kisses her chest
Letty bites him lightly on the shoulder
Michael pulls away in surprise, grinning
Letty reaches up and bites him again
Michael bites her back
64
Letty reaches her hands behind her head, searching for something to hold onto
She grabs a stack of sheets, which topple onto Michael
Michael sits up, trying to clear the sheets off himself and Letty
Letty pushes him down and crawls on top of him
her hands as they unbutton Michael's Levis, and we : -    - Mrs
Hallstrom sits close to the television, watching Joan Rivers hawk jewelry on the Home Shopping Network
Michael drapes the room with streamers, and surveys his work
How's it look
Shhh
They're coming to the cubic zirconium
like those sapphire earrings myself
imulated sapphires
bet my daughter would love those, too
Michael sees Letty pass by the room as she heads down the hall
He follows her
'  -    - Marie enters with her toothbrush and toothpaste
She moves towards the sink but stops as
come from the stall
She looks closer, sees two pairs of feet and one familiar pair of boxers
Jesus
just get a room
Marie walks out
65
- '  - Letty and Michael, partially disrobed and hugging each other tight, burst into
'  -    - Letty sits on the couch
Emlee leans forward in his chair
think it's a problem that you never told me about Michael
had to hear it from another patient
couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital
'm a grown woman, Dr
Emlee can take care of myself
What about Michael
Do you know the extent of his
know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs
Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and  heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty
But you need to know what you're dealing with
don't need a lecture
care about Michael
Then that's even more reason to listen
Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality
They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes
() 66
(cont'd) (beat) You could be lying next to Michael in bed one night, and he could have a hallucination, or a delusion
It might happen when you're driving or
Look,  know he's almost through with treatment here
And, he's on medication
Drugs can help suppress symptoms
But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh
(beat) And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress
He's been in and out of
don't want to hear anymore
'd like you to promise you won't carry on a relationship with Michael
Otherwise, 'll consider moving one of you to another ward
First you tell me to do what  want to, then you tell me to stop
All  want you to do is think about what's best for you
Really think about it
-    - Letty lies in the middle of a copse of trees, reading Emily Dickinson
Michael walks up and hands her a dandelion
daisy for the lady
The lady knows this is a dandelion
rose is a rose
67
Letty kisses him on the cheek
Thanks
Where've you been all day
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink
Sounds important
'm not allowed to see you anymore
Really
Me too
had to sneak by the guards to get here
They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery
Wow
'm bad news
What's my rap
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions
Fuck
That's all true
Letty laughs
Really, though
My thoughts go haywire sometimes
What are the delusions like
think people are after me, crap like that
(beat) () 68
(cont'd) When  was 18, my mom came home and found me sitting naked on the kitchen table
thought  was God
He waits for Letty to register the information
Shocking, huh
Sure
But  took out a whole grocery store
wish  could have seen that
'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent
y Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight
Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light
(beat) But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones
Lying on their backs, Michael and Letty stare up at the leaves overhead
(with a start) Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors
That's no way for us to break up
Break up
They wish
Michael and Letty hug
'  -    - Nurse Gates pours tablets from a potpourri of pill bottles into little paper cups
Federal Express delivery man with a bunch of boxes stops at the station
69
need a signature, please
Nurse Gates looks at the form
What is all this stuff
just deliver it, Ma'am
Well, who exactly is it for
Mrs
Eunice Hallstrom
see
Can you wait a moment
Nurse Gates locks the medication in a cupboard, and hurries down the hallway
- Our usual cast of characters
But how does that make you feel, John, what Letty said about your hostility
She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about
Nurse Gates barrels in
The group looks up
'm sorry, Doctor
just need a moment with Mrs
Hallstrom
What seems to be the problem
They say she ordered
Mrs
Hallstrom, did you order a bunch of stuff, because Federal Express
rs
Hallstrom's face glows
70
It's here, everyone
Come along
It's here
She runs out
Nurse Gates follows her
moment passes
The patients look expectantly at Dr
Emlee
Oh, fine, let's see
They storm the door
'  - By the time the patients round the corner, the Federal Express man is leaving, and Mrs
Hallstrom has ripped open one of the boxes
She clutches a handful of jewelry
For you, John
And, Letty
And, Michael,  know you'll love these
She hands Michael a pair of faux sapphire earrings
He clips them on
Letty and several others carry necklaces
Thomas sports a rhinestone tiara
The patients compare jewelry
Mrs
Hallstrom, you ordered all this
(to Mrs
Hallstrom) Thomas got a crown and all  got was a lousy bracelet
You must have spent thousands of dollars
Don't worry, Doctor,  didn't forget you
Mrs
Hallstrom hands Dr
Emlee a fake ruby hair comb
Mrs
Hallstrom, you can't possibly afford to pay for this
It must go back
Chatter in the hallway stops
71
Why, no, Doctor
It can't
Most of it's for my daughter, Lily
She's coming to family day tomorrow
all the way from Cleveland with my grandson
(beat) You can't be taking away their "Welcome to California" presents
It's going back
We'll contact the company this afternoon
(to patients) Take the jewelry off, please
The patients reluctantly remove their gifts
But  have to keep something for my daughter
Let's go back to group, and discuss it there
Back to group, everyone
The patients head back to group
Dr
Emlee turns to Nurse Gates
(to Nurse Gates) Increase her lithium to 600 milligrams, three times a day
Oh, and Nurse, let's see about canceling the cable
-    - The place buzzes with festivity
" " sign hangs from a patio beam
table is laden with cookies and lemonade and platter after platter of carrot curls
Letty takes a cookie and looks toward the lawn where Michael plays frisbee with his family, even his grandmother,
Nurse Gates walks up to Letty
Your mother's in the rec room, Letty
72
- Letty passes Mrs
Hallstrom, who sits by herself, holding one small gift on her lap
Letty spots her Mom across the room, and walks up to her
Her mother has covered a table with swatches of fabric
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart
You too, Mom
You're looking good
little thin, but good
Letty examines a fabric sample
Thanks so much for doing this
Ruthie and Jake are up to a million things
And  just can't decide
Letty rearranges the fabric samples on the table by color
Which flowers did you order
We haven't
wanted to talk that over with you, too
Oh, , well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway
was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask
Letty holds up a swatch of bright yellow
This would complement the blue in the bride's maids' dresses
Look
Where's your ring, Sweetheart
73
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you
(beat) Of course, if that's what you still want
Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here
Letty pulls out a cigarette, lights it and starts smoking
haven't had a crush since  was 12
When did you start smoking
'll put it out if it bothers you
The puckering, dear
It doesn't seem so now, but in time, it will cause wrinkles around the mouth
Letty grinds the cigarette beneath her heel
She bends over the fabrics
You know, your life isn't about being in a mental hospital
What
hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic
Mom, please
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much
74
Mom, look, if  want to dump Paul, 'll dump him
If  want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then 'll do that
Thomas, who sits across the room, looks up from his book
(whispering) 'm only looking out for you
(yelling) And if  want to smoke, 'll fucking smoke
Letty races out the door and into the garden
In the distance, Michael spots her and jogs over
Letty's mother watches them
Thomas approaches Mrs
Mayer
Mrs
Mayer, 'm sorry but couldn't help overhearing
just wanted to say, not that it's any of my business
Yes
think, really,  think 'd go with the cream damask
- Letty and Michael walk through the rec room toward the dining hall
Nurse Gates bends down in front of Mrs
Hallstrom, who sits where we last saw her
It's  to be upset
(gaily) Upset
Why of course not
My goodness, no
'm sure she just got hung up
Letty and Michael stop
75
Mrs
Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner
You'll love my Grandma Rosa
That's so sweet, Michael
But, really, 've so many things to do
If you change your mind, we'll be in the dining hall
Michael and Letty walk on, exchanging a sad look
- Mr
Santucci and Mrs
Santucci sit at the heads of the table
Letty sits between Rosa and Michael
(to Letty) What do you need now
(to Mr
Santucci) Send down the lamb
This girl's as thin as a stick
Oh, no
'm stuffed
Tell her to eat, Frank
Mangia
Mangia
(whispering to Letty) You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's lamb
Or my eggplant
make the best eggplant in
The mozzarella use, it's so fresh it sweats
Letty heaps more food on her plate
Michael says you're a teacher
76
was
'm hoping 'll still have a job when  get out
Mrs
Hallstrom walks into the room, wearing her Christmas stocking cap
She starts to dispense erasers
What's she doing
Mrs
Hallstrom, practically skipping, zeros in on Grandma Rosa
She hands Rosa the gift meant for her daughter
Rosa, Rosa, you must have this, Rosa
Grazie
Mrs
Hallstrom, join us
Please
But, by this point, Mrs
Hallstrom's already bounded away, divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered parents and delighted children
She clambers onto a table in the middle of the room
Marie gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help
Merry Christmas to all
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Michael, we've got to stop her
Michael pushes back his chair
He's trapped between the table and the wall
My goodness, it's so very warm in here
So warm
She takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking man
But she doesn't stop there
With haphazard abandon, she begins to disrobe, first her blouse, then her skirt
Way, way, way too warm for December
Now, let's sing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way
77
The group looks on in horror, mesmerized by her behavior
Then, almost as one, the patients spring into action
Michael bolts over his dining table and runs to Mrs
Hallstrom
He jumps onto her table, trying to restrain the dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her
By this time, John, Thomas and Letty have surrounded her in a protective enclave
Michael sets Mrs
Hallstrom on the ground
She looks up at the group, and continues belting out "Jingle Bells
" -    - Letty and Michael lie on the floor next to each other, trading puffs on a cigarette
The glowing ember is the only light in the room
You must have thought about it
Everyone does
just want to see Beast
(beat) Where would you go
The mission up in Santa Barbara
No way
That's where  always go when  get out
Why
My dad used to take me there when was little
It's totally quiet
And you can see the ocean for miles
They smoke for a while
What else would you do
78
'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together
And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper
And we'd eat Spaghetti-'s in bed from the can
How can you even mention Spaghetti- 's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight
have a terrible confession
Tell the doctor
don't like lamb
Michael sits up
Then it's over
Lie down
Michael lies down
It's a good thing my family loves you
Your family just met me
You're right
guess  was projecting
What  should have said is, "It's a good thing  love you
" Do you
79
do
Michael,
It's
You don't have to say anything
But  do
love you, too
Michael and Letty lie still, looking into each others eyes
'  -    - osters of Harry Houdini and Doug Henning
Handcuffs and card decks all over
Your Honor,  feel  should be released
'm sufficiently able to look after
Michael stops
His eyes glaze over
His head darts toward the corner of the room
(to the corner) What
What
Nothing's there
Nothing at all
But Michael keeps staring
on the door
Michael's eyes refocus
He opens the door to find Letty
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you
Oh, right
'm ready
How do look
(straightening his tie) Great
came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck
Letty hands him the Cracker Jack ring
80
- Michael sits near the front of the courtroom with half a dozen other patients from various institutions
Nurse Gates sits a few rows back near '  and Michael's family--Mr
and Mrs
Santucci and Grandma Rosa
, 60s, questions John, who's on the stand
Why have you petitioned to leave the institution
haven't had an episode in more than a month, Sir
How do you plan to support yourself
My family's helping me out, Your Honor
Where will you live upon release
Live
John's mother nods encouragingly at him
Where do you plan to reside, Mr
Lockyer
With my mother
Is your mother here today
John points to her
John's mother waves at the judge
That's the bitch
That cock- sucking bitch
She put me here
She did
She's the Satan that did this all
81
As bailiffs remove John from the stand, Michael offers a wan smile to his family
- Michael, outwardly poised and collected, sits on the stand
His hands are clenched in tight fists
The records indicate no major episodes in the past four months
And it seems you have the support of the staff
Yes, Sir
But  see you've been in and out of the hospital more than ten times
Eleven, Your Honor
But 'm on a new medication now
Do you feel ready to re-enter the world
Yes, Sir
My family is    prepared to support me until  find   a job
They've already located   an apartment for me that's   very near them
Very well, then
By order of the court, you are released
wish you good luck
Michael's shoulders relax
He opens his fist
Inside is the Cracker Jack ring, and the magenta circle it has imprinted on his palm
- Michael walks to the car with his mother, father and grandmother, who keeps tousling his hair with pride
82
-    - Letty stands awkwardly in front of Paul, who sits in a wingback chair
What's so urgent
You've got me worried
need to tell you something, and 'm not sure how
Paul stands
You can tell me anything
(beat) Do you want to postpone the wedding
Is it too much pressure
No
That's a load off my mind
Paul,  want to break off the engagement
You what
don't mean to hurt you
know this is a terrible thing
And have really loved you
Whoa
Whoa
Have really loved me
Letty, it's natural to be nervous
But we're going to work through our problems
've met someone else
Who
It doesn't matter who
83
Have you been seeing another teacher
No
It's a doctor, isn't it
That's unethical
'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin
He's a patient here
Paul considers this a moment
Of all the crazy things understood when you dropped out of law school
And during this whole mess, 've tried to be supportive
But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking
love him
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love
Here's the ring
No way
You keep the ring
You'll come to your senses
've made my decision, Paul
You keep it, Letty
This is not over
Our life is not over
- Paul walks out the door and down the steps past Michael, who runs up them two at a time
84
How's it hanging, Paul
Paul turns to watch Michael as Michael swings open the door and sails into the institute
- Letty waits as a  opens the door to the ward
Letty is about to step through, when Michael enters
Visitor for Ms
Mayer
Letty whirls around
Well Home free
Letty and Michael hug
Letty, Michael, you have about five minutes until visiting hours end
The nurse retreats
Tell me all
was brilliant, or at least boringly sane
So there were no problems
Not a one
And did you go to the mission
No, you goof,  came to see you
Just checking
85
saw Paul leaving
Did you do the dirty deed
Yeah
So, it's over
All over
(beat) Did you see your new apartment
One bedroom, second floor, no view
Furnished
No,  need some serious household advice
First off, you'll need to go to Target
And, let's see, what should you buy
better make a list
List schmist
You'll remember
-    - Letty sits in the corridor opposite Marie and Thomas
They are playing
Letty deals
Hit me
Letty hands one over
Thomas flips over his cards
'm over
Letty looks to Marie, who waves her off
Marie is fine with her cards
They look down the hall
Nurse Gates walks beside , a man in his late 20s, who wears the same dazed expression Letty did the morning after she was admitted
86
(to Jamie) Dr
Stone will ask you some questions, and then we'll get you settled
Nurse Gates and Jamie come upon the gang
(to Letty/Bill) Lights out in 15, Guys
Nurse Gates continues down the hall, hand firmly planted under Jamie's elbow as he weaves unsteadily beside her
Wow, that first night is hard
It's going to be a difficult few weeks for him
It really makes you think
It really does
They look down the hall at the retreating figures
They look at each other
'll put in 5 that it's a straight diagnosis of depressive personality
Are you kidding
With those glazed eyes
'm willing to bet 10 there was some break with reality going on there
Psychosis
Without a doubt, psychosis
'  - Letty is curled up in a chair opposite Dr
Emlee
But what  really can't believe is that 'm starting to actually miss work
87
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job
thought about calling, but  want to wait until  know when 'll be out
Then, you should call
What
think it's about that time, Letty
The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well
Are you saying 'm through with therapy
Let's not be hasty
(beat) 'm saying we should plan a release date for early next week
Off Letty's excited face, we : - Crowds, crowds and more crowds
Michael pulls unsuccessfully at a shopping cart that is stuck to another
walks up, nudges Michael out of the way and yanks the cart out of its row
She rolls it toward Michael, grabs one for herself and is on her way into the store
ichael takes several deep breaths
With trepidation in his step, he heads into the great unknown of the crowded store
- 30 88
Michael emerges from the store, quite pleased with himself that he made it out alive
He commands a cart heaped full of useless gadgets and trinkets, a half dozen picture frames and about 20 decorative pillows
-    - Letty and her mother walk briskly through the gardens
Must you walk so quickly
It's good exercise, Mom
've got 26 years on you
If we could just slow down, we could talk so much easier
Letty slackens her pace
'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week
If you want me to pick you up,  will
've already made arrangements
Ruthie mentioned that Michael might be coming for you
Letty stops and wags her finger at her mother
Mom, we agreed
You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael
Not even if it's something positive
Nyet
That's the condition
Mother and daughter keep walking in silence
Have you spoken to Paul at all
89
One more and you're out
Honestly, Letty
deal's a deal
The two walk on in silence
Silence
More silence
Have you heard the figure on how much Queen Elizabeth's going to pay in taxes this year
Letty stops walking
She turns a sunny smile on her mother, then hugs her knew you had it in you
'  -    - Letty neatly folds garments and lays them in a suitcase
Dr
Emlee looks on
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday
And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me
, good
That's good
Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off
It was just a little going-away gesture
have a going-away gesture for you, too
Oh
90
Letty puts her hand in her suitcase and rummages through the clothes, creating a jumbled mess
She snaps the luggage closed
Bits of clothing hang out
They
'  -    - Letty sets her duffel bag down next to two suitcases
She hugs Marie, John, Thomas, then walks over to Mrs
Hallstrom, who hangs back from the group
Letty embraces her
'll miss you, Mrs
Hallstrom
There's no response
Letty goes to Nurse Gates and hugs her
Take care, Letty
And, let me know if you need help with any spiders
You know  will
Thanks for everything
Letty walks toward Michael, who gathers up her bags
See you later, guys
Michael and Letty walk through the
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something
Aren't you ever quiet
They walk out the doors onto the
Michael grabs Letty's hand as they hurry down the steps
Where to
've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go
- In the background, the Spanish-style mission blends into the hillside
Letty and Michael sit on a bluff, holding hands
They look out at the ocean, where the sun heads toward the waves in a fiery red glow
91
- '   - Michael and Letty walk down the hall
Michael stops at a door and showcases it
He jingles the keys
This is it -- 3B
Check it out
Open up
want to see
Close your eyes
Letty claps her hands over her eyes
Michael opens the door and guides her into his castle
'  - Open them
Letty surveys the territory
Forget tables, chairs and couches
Throw pillows are strewn everywhere
Wow
You like it
Letty picks up a pillow and runs her hand over the fabric
She pauses a moment before speaking
love the pillows
Throw pillows, Letty
The sales lady said they're the latest thing
Very trendy
Let's see the rest
Michael leads Letty to the bedroom
- futon bed, draped with a mosquito net, rests in the corner
Two TVs take center stage
It's  heaven
92
was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch
Now we can watch two shows at once
Let's try out the bed
Michael grabs her hand and pulls her toward the door
You've got to see the kitchen first
- Do you like it
love your apartment
Really
You'll never get rid of me
Michael kisses Letty on the lips
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate
Out
Are you kidding
've got all the fixings here
Off Letty's look of surprise, we watch Michael open a cupboard door
The shelves are filled from top to bottom with cans of Spaghetti-'s
Letty squeezes Michael in a bear hug
- '  - Letty, in a -shirt, and Michael, in boxers, lounge on the futon
They watch both TVs -- one tuned-in to Jay Leno, the other to David Letterman
Michael eats from a can of Spaghetti-'s
Letty reaches over with her fork and snags a mouthful from Michael's can
93
How can you not like the Top 10 List
like it
But Headlines are better
You're so wrong
Letty takes her remote and increases the volume on her
As Letterman gets louder, Michael zaps his volume
It's a war
Letterman then Leno get  and  and until Letty makes a might lunge
She wrests Michael's remote from him
Letty  both TVs
Hey
It's sex time
Michael mockingly checks his watch
Letty climbs on top of him
Michael rolls on top of her
think it's my turn
on their faces as Michael gently licks the side of Letty's mouth
Did  get spaghetti sauce on my face
No
Michael licks Letty's nose
Michael
Shhhh
Michael and Letty look into each other's eyes, bathed in the blue light thrown off by the twin televisions
Michael places a pillow gently beneath Letty's head
He caresses her face
94
Letty's eyes are alive to every look, every touch
Michael kisses her slowly on the forehead, the nose, and the lips
on Letty's hands as she reaches up to stroke Michael's forehead and caress his temple
on her hands as Letty runs them through Michael's hair, then twists a curly lock around her finger
as we : - '  - on Letty's hand, resting on the comforter on Michael's bed
The alarm clock
Letty's hand slaps it into submission
- '  - Letty's still in bed, a look of bliss across her face
Letty
Rise and shine
' : Michael's face fills her vision
: Letty's eyes close
Not yet
'll be forced to tickle you
Letty opens one eye and glares at him
Go away
How about this
It's 10:30
Letty bolts upright
'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour
95
'll see you tonight
Michael gives her a kiss and walks into the
Michael adjusts his tie
Letty, naked, runs into the room and throws her arms around his neck
Good luck
You, too
Kick ass today
Michael walks out the door
Letty thinks for a minute
She flings open the door and yells to Michael's retreating back
- My apartment tonight
You can meet Beast
Michael swings around
Sounds good
Oh, and Letty
Yeah
(yelling) You've got one hell of a great body
The door across the hall opens
stares at Letty's naked figure
She slams Michael's apartment door
- '  - Letty collapses in
'  -    - Letty sits across from the principal
didn't have any choice but to include the parents' letters in your file
96
Well,  understand
know my behavior was poor
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, don't think  can put you back in the classroom just yet
Look, Gail, 've been a good teacher
know, Letty
But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children
(beat) Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on
Believe me,  wish 'd understood what was going on
've worked really hard to get better
'm glad you're doing well
've already thought about how to tell the kids where  was
Letty hands the principal a letter
And 'd like to send the parents this letter of explanation
With your support,  think they can accept me
The principal reads the letter
It's a very nice letter
But have to go with what's best for the students
What does that mean
97
need someone to work on budget projections
Office work
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year
- Michael sits at a back desk with
, who wears a three-piece pin-striped suit and taps a pencil on his knee
It's not that we're doubting your intelligence, Mr
Santucci
But your work history shows so many interruptions
know, but as  said
appreciate your candor about your illness, but my bosses are concerned
can do the job
Between you and me, my uncle, he has some mental problems, and know what you're going through
If it were up to me, 'd hire you
Michael's already standing
Right
Thanks for your help
He shakes Mr
Smythe's hand, and, downcast, gets out of the bank as quickly as he can
- '  - Letty sits on the floor
She gulps down some aspirin, then hauls Beast into her lap
The doorbell
98
It's open
Michael walks in, and looks around
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place
Thanks
He kisses her, and lies down on the floor to stroke the cat
This must be Beast
That's Mr
Beast to you
How was your day
bombed
It's either work in the office or nothing
Sounds grim
Yeah
How was the job search
Michael makes a thumbs-down gesture
Who ever said sanity was fun
It doesn't matter
It'll work out
Promise
Promise
(beat) As long as we have steak
Steak
99
It's a well-known fact that a red- meat dinner can cure the blues
(beat) You and Beast wait here
'll be back in a jiff
Letty gives Michael a tired smile
Michael jumps up and leaves
moment passes
The door opens again
While 'm gone why don't you slip into something a little more naked
- Michael walks out of the grocery store, loaded down with bags
He carries a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers
He passes two ladies who gossip outside the store
can't believe he did that
What a weirdo
Michael stops abruptly
He turns back and looks at the women
They
Michael starts toward the car
He hears more  from the women
He turns back and walks up to them
Don't ever talk about me again, you hear me
The women pull back in fright
- '  - Letty, in a skimpy negligee, lights candles on the table
Michael enters with the groceries and wine
thought maybe you got lost
The store was busy
You got wine
That's great
100
Would you mind if we just called it an early night
You go ahead and relax
'll cook
think  should go home
Are you
Big restaurant interview tomorrow
But what about the red meat-blues thing
You know, we've got that dinner with my parents tomorrow, too should really get some rest tonight
Michael gives Letty a kiss good night
He leaves
She stares after him
Reluctantly, she blows out the candles and starts putting the groceries away
(to Beast) How's filet sound
- The coffee shop hasn't opened for business yet
Michael and six people in their early 20s fill out applications
ichael stares blankly at his application
He fills out his name
He can't get any further
glance toward him
Michael tries to write
He can't
(under his breath) No, no, no
Not now
No
The other applicants look toward Michael and quickly avert their eyes
The   walks up to the group
101
Michael grabs his briefcase and walks out of the restaurant
His application, incomplete, remains on the table
-   - This kitchen is the heart of the home--copper pots, two pasta makers and every size wooden spoon made
Letty, lightly dusted with flour, mixes fresh pasta with her hands
Mrs
Santucci peers into the bowl
More water
It's too pasty
Letty pours in more water
'll never Mget the hang of this
All the Santucci women go through this
Letty smiles at her and kneads harder
Mr
Santucci enters and kisses his wife
Hi there, Letty
Hi, Frank
Mr
Santucci looks in the pasta bowl
It needs more water
He dumps some in
Letty looks sadly at the gloppy mess
(to Mrs
Santucci) Maybe we should make lamb next week
Michael walks in
Hi, Sweetheart
How'd it go

Michael takes his tie, holds it up like a noose and lets his tongue loll out of his mouth
What happened
Four interviews
Four no-gos
The restaurant, too
couldn't even face that one
Mr
and Mrs
Santucci look at each other
That's
We can call and reschedule in the morning
You don't have to take care of me, you know
An uneasy silence falls in the room
Maybe we should save the job talk for after dinner
Michael looks in the bowl of pasta dough that Letty continues to labor over
He reaches in to help with the mixing
(to Letty) Just promise you'll love me even if end up in a job where  have to wear a blue polyester cap
think you know 'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap
- '  - Michael finishes brushing his teeth
He opens the medicine cabinet, pulls out a prescription bottle and pours a pill into his hand
() You're going to miss the Top Ten
103
Coming
He raises the pill to his mouth, then opens his hand and lets it drop in the sink
Michael runs the water and watches the pill swirl slowly down the drain
() Michael, hurry
Michael stuffs the pill bottle in a bottom drawer
He opens the door, sprints into the bedroom and leaps onto Letty, who lies on the futon
Letty  and
'  - Michael sits in a booth drinking coffee
He bows over an application, pen in hand
About a third is filled out
'  - Letty and Superintendent Johansen sit on the floor, which is covered with math games, posters and charts
think  could get the program up and running in the next two weeks
From what  understand the principal has removed you from student activities
She's worried that 'm unstable
Johansen studies her
But  wouldn't push for the program if  wasn't ready
What about the office work
'd have to do that, too
But 've gotten better at pacing myself
Are you sure
104
'll call you if  have problems
Scout's honor
have to say 'm inclined to give it another try
Letty hugs Johansen
But, Letty, why don't you give yourself three weeks to set it up this time
'  - Michael sits in the same booth, eating a hamburger
About half of the application is now completed
- Letty and her mother sit in silence
Letty smiles at her mother
Her mother gives her a very tiny smile back
Michael hurries in
Hey, Letty
Mrs
Mayer
got worried
Are you
Michael pulls a blue polyester hat out of his pocket and puts it on How may  help you
Congratulations
Michael, the shop's about to close
Maybe you could try on your tux
Michael heads to the dressing room in the back of the store
(to Mrs
Mayer) Michael just got a job
Couldn't you congratulate him
105
will, Dear
promise
(beat) Why McDonald's
He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom
It's not that easy after you've been locked away
Letty looks toward the back of the store
Her mother looks at her
Letty ignores her mother
've read that lots of people my age are supplementing their incomes these days by working at McDonald's and Burger King
Letty looks at her mother, tries to read her
'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded
Don't be fresh
Just remember that  love him
Michael walks out of the dressing room and advances toward the two women, bowing in Cary Grant fashion as he nears
Letty's mother turns to her daughter, who beams brightly at the dashing Michael
(to Letty) 'll say this, Dear
He looks damn good in a tuxedo
- Letty and Michael jog
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin
No, that's Aunt Connie
Lily is the one who looks like a hooker
106
Oh
And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic
You don't have to know all this by Saturday
It took me years
- Every inch of every pew in the Baroque church is stuffed with guests
Michael sits in the second row
He cranes his head around as "Pachelbel's Canon"   and the advances
Letty, in the first part of the bride's maids' procession, heads down the aisle next
The bride is nowhere in sight
But even so, as soon as Michael spots Letty, he stands
Everyone else remains seated
They look at him
Michael doesn't notice
He has eyes only for Letty
Letty's mother looks at Michael with more than annoyance
Begrudgingly, she also stands
Following the lead, the entire church stands for Letty
She smiles at Michael
-   - parade of guests pass through the receiving line to greet Mr
Mayer, Monica, Letty, Mrs
Mayer, Ruth and Jake
Michael hovers close to Letty
, with fluorescent red hair and a silver lame miniskirt, spots him
(to Michael) What a beautiful wedding
As she passes out of earshot, (to Letty) Aunt Lily
Bingo
Mrs
Mayer talks to her brother
107
Oh, and have you met Michael
He's Letty's boyfriend
Letty and Ruth overhear this
They make eye contact
Ruth raises her eyebrows toward Letty
Letty smiles back
- Ruth and Letty talk while Michael twirls across the dance floor with Monica
The worst was when  stammered Jake's name
don't think people even noticed
thought the ceremony was perfect
That's thanks to all your help
Cort, overweight and red from drink, approaches Ruth and Letty
Uh oh, Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock
Sorry to do this to you
But  am the bride
Ruth turns and flees
pounces on Letty and plants the wettest kiss ever on her mouth
(to Letty) don't think 've seen you in two or three years
Has it been that long
You were with that lawyer
'm dating Michael now
Met him in the receiving line
What is it that he does for a living
108
Michael walks up to Letty and Cort as they speak
Well, he just got a job
In the restaurant business
Letty looks at Michael, surprised
Speak of the devil
(beat) How did you guys meet again
At the psych hospital
would've sent a card, but your aunt and , we weren't sure if that was the thing to do
That's fine, Uncle Cort
(to Michael) So you were a volunteer over at the hospital
Something like that
When he could get time off from the restaurant business
(to Letty) How about a dance
You two go ahead
'm going to go bother that pretty sister of yours for a dance
Cort gives Letty another big, wet kiss
Bye, Uncle Cort
(to Michael) What's with the lie
109
It wasn't exactly a lie
Pretty close
People at weddings don't want the truth
Michael grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter
It's not good to drink so much with the medication you're on
What's with this music
'll go talk to the
and see if we can't get something good going
Michael heads toward the
and confers with him
Mr
Mayer walks up to Letty
It's good to see you so happy
Thanks, dad
Michael then walks back to Letty and pulls her out onto the dance floor as "Twist and Shout"   from the speakers
Letty's mother departs the dance floor, grimacing
Ruth shoots Michael a look of pure pleasure
And everyone begins twisting, as we : - '  - Completely dark
Silent
Letty, in a nightshirt, wanders in, and stumbles through the room
She fumbles for the switch on the floor lamp
The light comes on, illuminating a small circle
Just outside of it sits Michael
e stares straight ahead
Letty kneels down in front of him
110
Michael
(beat) Michael
You should come to bed
Michael remains focused on the space directly in front of him
Did you take the aspirin and water
You don't want to feel awful in the morning
(beat) 'll get you some
Letty begins to stand up
The movement breaks Michael's trance
He pulls her back down
What is it
Are you
(strangely calm) Always the drugs
What
saw you talking to my Mom
We both talked to her, Michael
And your dad
Why'd you tell her  wasn't taking my meds
What do you mean not taking your meds
Why'd you tell
didn't talk to her about medications, Michael
Don't be silly
Michael beats his hand on the floor
111
Silly
Silly am
Michael, take it easy
Silly, silly, silly
think  should call someone
Michael reaches out, grabs the floor lamp, and pushes it over
He lurches to his feet and pulls Letty to a standing position
(screaming) Don't upset my Mom
Don't you upset my Mom
Michael, calm down
Please
It's Michael knocks some flowers over, then rips apart a pillow
Letty hovers in back of him
He pauses
She puts her hand on his back
Michael whirls around
He slaps Letty's hand away
She stumbles backward
Michael, stop
He stares in her direction, but he doesn't respond
Letty can't make a connection
Michael shoves his fist through a window
Letty grabs the phone
Not my Mom
Not my silly silly Mom
Letty runs with the phone
Michael follows her
Letty trips
She rights herself
She locks herself in the bathroom
, '  - ichael  on the bathroom door
Letty dials 9-1-1
112
've got an emergency
'm at
Michael  -- a long, piercing inhuman sound
1450 North Jenkins
Apartment 2
My boyfriend's out of control
On the other side of the door, Michael
Another window
() What's going on in there
(into phone) Please, please, send someone
(beat) No, he's having an attack
He's schizophrenic
- '  - Letty, wearing Michael's tux jacket, is curled up on the floor in a fetal position
She stares
at the upset flowers, at the ripped-up pillows, at a fist-sized hole ripped through an unsturdy wall
Her gaze stops on a Spaghetti-'s can, lying empty on the floor
on the door
Letty rises slowly, padding to the door like an old woman
The  grow urgent
Letty opens the door to Ruth
Letty throws herself into Ruth's waiting embrace
Immediately, Letty cries
After a moment, Letty steps back
'm sorry, so sorry
never should have called
Ruth looks into Letty's eyes
You did the right thing
ruined your wedding night
113
'm glad you called
Now, not another word about it
Ruth pulls Letty into the apartment and shuts the door behind them
It is only then that she sees the destruction in the living room
Horror flashes across her face
Oh my God
Tears stream down Letty's face
Ruth starts to cry
Did he hurt you
Letty shakes her head "no
" Her sobbing intensifies
Ruth puts her arm around Letty, and together, they sit on the floor
Ruth holds Letty until the crying eases
Oh, Ruthie, what am  going to do
You don't have to make any decisions tonight
But what am  going to do
Do you want to go see him
'll take you if you want to go
can't
can't see him there
Ruth holds her close again
was so sure
really thought it would work
(beat) We have plans, Ruth
know
know
114
- Letty sits on the same bluff she once shared with Michael
She smokes a cigarette, and stares out at the ocean
- Letty remains on the bluff, crying
priest, passing in the background looks over at her, and continues on his way
- In the darkness, Letty lies on her back
She stares up at the moon and stars, bright against the night sky
- Letty walks along a pathway with Paul
'm glad you agreed to see me
'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings
Oh, none
None
completely understand what was going on
Oh
How's work going
Are you back at school
start on Monday
So things are back on track
Getting back
heard about your friend
What
115
heard your friend was back in the hospital
Michael
Yes
just wondered, well, if this meant there was a chance for us
Because  think about you a lot, and  still feel
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul
But it's over
(beat) And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things
think 've heard this speech before
'm really sorry
Letty reaches up to hug him
He quickly disengages himself
've got a deposition that  really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind
Sure,  understand
Paul starts down the path
Wait
Wait
Letty runs up to Paul
need to give you this
Letty hands Paul the engagement ring
He takes it and continues walking as she stares after him
116
- Letty walks up the steps to the imposing facility
We follow her journey through the  , past families conversing with patients, to the '
Letty walks up to Nurse Gates, who gives her a quick hug
John and Bill watch as Letty signs the visitors' register
He's in Jamie's old room
Letty walks down the  and pauses outside Michael's door
She
() Come in
'  -    - Michael is in the middle of taping up the same Houdini poster we saw in his last room when Letty enters
Hi
Hey
Letty and Michael kiss awkwardly
Dead silence
/ () How are you
They smile nervously
guess we need to talk
guess so
It's hard to know where to start
Pretend like 'm your shrink
Letty rolls her eyes
Sorry
'll be quiet
117
think about you all the time
sure know what that feels like
And all the plans we have
Yeah, the plans
Letty looks out the window
've been thinking  could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see
Letty, please
What
Like 've told you before  don't want you taking care of me
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael
You tore up the apartment
You stopped taking your medications
But that wasn't me
didn't mean to do that
Well then why'd it happen
don't know
don't fucking know
Letty and Michael glare at each other
Letty looks away
'm sorry
didn't come here to blame you
118
didn't mean for any of this to happen
Oh, God, Michael,  know
(softly) Why does everything have to be so hard
Michael shakes his head
What are we going to do
What do you want to do
know  don't want to lose you don't think  could stand it
Yeah, but can you stand to be with me like this
Letty waits
She looks away
She turns back and stares into Michael's eyes
Finally, she says it
No
can't, Michael
'm so sorry, but  just can't handle all this right now
Letty starts to cry
Tears well up in Michael's eyes
know
can't either
Michael sits down on the bed and they hold each other
love you so much
love you too, Letty
love you, too
Letty and Michael grip each other
Finally, they pull apart
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach
119
That's the best idea 've heard in a long time
Letty wipes a tear from Michael's cheek
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier
How about something better
Like a kiss
he couple kisses more tenderly than ever before
can still come visit you, you know
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us
Just promise me you'll be ,
will
And you make sure you take care of yourself
Michael puts his hand under Letty's chin and draws her head up so he can look into her eyes
Promise you won't fall for any guys pretending to be doctors
Letty shakes her head "no" as tears stream down her face
guess  should go now
You should go
Letty stands up and walks toward the door
She comes back and embraces Michael again
Slowly, they separate, and Letty leaves the room
Michael stares out the window
120
- Letty walks out the door, down the steps and along the front walkway -- until, finally, the hospital recedes in the distance
-    - Letty sits on top of a desk
Children of all ages stare her down
few familiar faces--Bobby and Jenny--grace the room
Principal Gail passes outside the window and glances in
First of all,  want to welcome you to MathShop
have lots of fun games planned for us
(beat) Let's see, Bobby, can you help me pass out these cards
Bobby doesn't move
Is something wrong, Bobby
Why were you gone so long
My mom said you went crazy
had what some people call a nervous breakdown
wasn't dealing with life so well so went
To a place for psychos
To a psychiatric institution
What's that
It's a place where you figure out what you want, and what things in your life aren't working
You learn to look out for yourself and not get
121
Letty trails off
She sees that she's lost the class
Bobby launches a spit wad that hits the boy in front of him
Let me show you the best thing learned
She walks up to Bobby
He twists around in his seat, trying to hide the rest of his supply of spit wads
Letty waves her hand around Bobby's head
The children, stare, delighted
She pulls a bright coin out of his ear, and hands it to him
() Wow
/ Neat
/ Do it again, Miss Mayer
Letty puts her hands behind her back and produces a bouquet of paper flowers
Now, she's got the class hooked
