- It is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of  go to pick up - or be picked up
Lesser-known actors, agents and executives of all ages
Into this bar comes Ben
Ben is in his thirties
He is wearing an Armani suit that could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's
He hasn't shaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has any of the actors in the bar)
He is a good-looking man but is clearly in trouble of some kind
Although still in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the following scene that he is much the worse for wear with drink
He looks around the room until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples are seated
The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time
The camera follows Ben over to the table
One of the execs looks up as Ben gets close
He recognizes him but delays his recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben is not looking at him
Peter Ben
how are you, man
They shake hands
Ben is not invited to take a seat and Peter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him to the table
Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum, Sheila, Debbie
Nice to meet you
think spoke to you on the phone a couple of years ago
Weren't you both at  with Laddie
That's right
Are you still at
No, 'm at Tri-Star now
That's great
Say hello to Mike for me
That's a beautiful dress, Debbie, and those are fabulous earrings, Sheila
There is an awkward silence
Ben does not make a move and is not invited to join them
The girls smile
gotta tell you, 'm a big fan of your writing
loved Bay of Pigs
Thanks a lot
didn't actually write it,  just got the credit
was fired
(to Peter) Can  talk to you for a moment
Peter gets up and he and Ben walk to the door together
Peter speaks very quietly
Listen, Ben,  can't help you any more
Do you understand
This is the last time
Promise
just need some cash tonight
lost my credit cards
The money'll be on your desk first thing tomorrow morning, Scout's honor
How's the new one coming along
here you got Richard Gere
The two men look at each other for a while
Peter's friends are looking at them, as are other people in the room
Peter takes out his wallet and extracts some notes
This is all  have in cash
Please don't drink it here
Yes, that's fine
'll messenger it over to you tomorrow
don't want it
Ben think it would be best if you didn't contact me again
And he turns and walks away, back to his table

- Las Vegas
blaze of color in the middle of a desert
Credit sequence begins
: 3
- mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense of activity and superficial excitement
Music wafts across the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense texture of thousands of slot machines, creating an insane New Age symphony
Credit sequence ends
Into the lobby from the street comes Sera
It's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between twenty-five and thirty-five
She is a beautiful American girl
Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears catalogue
She is dressed simply in a short black skirt and matching jacket
High heels complete the picture
Heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's clear they find her very sexy
She acknowledges their glance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator
She could be a secretary, or a  to one of the many execs here in Las Vegas at a convention
The body language is a bit different, though
4
- view of night-time Las Vegas through a window
Traffic up and down The Strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking
We hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls focus and we see reflected in the glass
a group of people
On the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and sandwiches
The  is on at a sports channel and two boxers pound the shit out of each other
: 5
- Sera looks at herself in the gold-tinted mirror in the elevator
She takes out a lipstick and freshens her lips
Some people get out and the elevator climbs higher
We see from the indicator that she has punched the Penthouse button
Camera moves in tighter and we see that she is nervous but concealing it well
The elevator stops, the doors open and she steps right into the Penthouse
6
- bottle of Scotch is almost empty
The man talking is Yuri
He is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, a big man wearing a blue silk suit
His thick black hair is greased and combed back
He wears a lot of jewelry, all gold
Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex
Two men in business suits and a weird stoned woman in her late thirties listen to him
but please, my friends, call me Yuri
It is my American name
picked it myself
The three people laugh
There is a hint of contempt in the way that they speak to Yuri
Where are you from, Yuri mean, you sure don't talk like you're from this neck of the woods
Yuri smiles at them
(silky voice) No
you are right, my friend
How very observant you are
am from Latvia
Tough place
Yes,  hear this too
But am not a tough man
am a simple man who is here to learn from my new American friends
The door opens and Sera comes in
Everybody stares at her
(turned on) Is this your friend, Yuri
Ah, yes
Sera
The second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from his inside pocket
(cont'd) Sera is my gift to you, my friends from New York City
You may do with her as you wish in this beautiful room, which is also my gift for the night to my friends
You will find her a very willing girl, for all of you
just as we arranged
Yuri smiles again as the Second Businessman hands him the envelope
The rest of them just stare at Sera, aroused by the idea of her
Of course, Yuri
think you'll find this just as we discussed
Yuri gets up
So, my friends
have other business to attend
Enjoy
He heads for the door, passing Sera
She holds out his arm as he passes
(whispering) Yuri
please
Can  talk to you for a moment
Still smiling, he takes Sera's arm and leads her into the bedroom
My friends
excuse me for just one moment
7
- Mirrors reflect mirrors
don't want this
Yuri, please
really don't want this
You know  don't like to do groups
(playful) want this, Sera
need this
Please, Yuri
He holds put his arms
Sera goes to him
He hugs her with one arm
He pulls up her skirt so that her panties are exposed
(seductive) These are pretty
Sera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal her buttocks
He strokes her there gently with his other hand
We see that there are two fine scars there
He speaks gently, like a father to a daughter
(cont'd) Is this how you would repay me for coming all this way to find you again
Driving through the desert to protect my little Sera
: -- 8
- Yuri and Sera - different time, different place
Sera looking frightened, backing away from Yuri, who pulls a switchblade from his jacket and opens it
: 9
- Yuri enters from the bedroom
The weird woman is doing a line of coke
(cheerful) Sera wanted me to ask if she might undress at once for you
She has a very beautiful undergarment witch she would like you to see
Sera comes into the room
She smiles and begins unbuttoning her jacket
She takes it off and drops it on the floor, and then unzips her skirt and steps out of it
Sera is now in control and playing the room
In the background
Yuri leaves the room
(strange voice) Come here
Sera walks over and something strange takes place between them
: 10
'
- The bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is a very bright sunny day outside
The bartender reads the Los Angeles Times
The bar surface is red vinyl
There are five customers, all single men
One of them is Ben and he is sitting at the bar watching
game show is in progress and the  sound is loud
Ben finishes his drink and grimaces before indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat
Barman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves in closer to Ben, ending in a close-up
Ben takes a big hit from the drink and concentrates on the
We hear from the sound that it is a word game with a big prize
Ben smiles to himself
' The talk show hostess, an American  beauty, is showing the audience the prizes available in today's game show
As he finishes that drink and asks for another
The camera moves in close on his eyes
' She turns from the prizes and looks straight into the camera, which starts zooming into her
At first, what she is saying makes complete sense, but then things change
(smoky, sexy voice) Just look at this studio, Ben, filled with glamorous merchandise, including an extra special prize chosen just for You
big, bad, motorcycle, complete with saddle bags stuffed with thousands of  dollars
"There are oohs" from the audience
So, Ben, (tosses her hair) Let's find a bar, get drunk and go for a ride
The studio lights dim
Then we can get a suite somewhere and order up a case of champagne while we fuck ourselves silly
Close-up on males in the audience doing the grunt
This is it, just for You, Ben
She unbuttons her top, licks her fingers and makes her nipples hard
Because You've been so patient, and because  want to fuck you, take care of You, and because there's nothing else in the world worth doing
Section of the audience clapping - some women dabbing their eyes
Tell you what, Ben, let's go to Las Vegas
The bars stay open twenty four hours night and day
Just you, just me, Ben, think about it, all right
Lost in his fantasy 'll think about it
He looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to what is known as "normal"
He finishes his drink and then an attack of nausea hit him
He takes a deep breath and rolls his neck and his head
The barman puts down a fresh drink
Ben looks at his own hands
which are steady
You should go on that show
: 11
- Ben sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup of black coffee on the desk
The walls are covered with framed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed with scripts
He nods from time to time and sometimes says 'yes' or '', but it becomes clear that there is no one on the other end
He drinks from the coffee cup
woman comes up to his desk, a business colleague
She puts a wad of messages down on the desk
Yeah, but what's the back end like
By the time we're through with  and , the above-the line is going to take it to about fifteen and with something like this don't know if Disney will go for it
can  call you back on this
chow for now
(to the woman) Good morning
(cautious) Ben
Mr
Simpson was looking for you
said that you had a doctor's appointment
He said for you to go in as soon as
are you
(pulling himself together) 'm fantastic, but  gotta go out now
very important meeting, could make a coupla million for the company
Ben gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a few steps
It is clear that she likes Ben, but when his face gets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and she turns away
Ben stops dancing and smiles sadly
(tender) Ben
What
You should go now
She leaves the room and Ben goes through some routine at the desk
He opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his whole arm, looking for something at the very back
He pulls out a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the contents into his coffee cup
With cup in hand he leaves the room
: 12
- Ben is sitting opposite his boss, Mr
Simpson, who is very upset
He hands Ben an envelope
Ben opens it and pulls out a check
He looks at the amount
(genuinely moved) This is to generous Peter
(close to tears) Well
we liked having you around, Ben, but you know how it is
(ashamed) Sure thing
and 'm sorry
Ben takes a swig from his coffee cup
(trying to cheer things along) Well
what are you going to do now
thought  might move out to Las Vegas
Simpson looks puzzled
The bars never close
: 13
' Ben drives though Beverly Hills
He pours the content of a small bottle of vodka into an empty Coke can, puts the empty bottle under the seat and then drinks from the can
He slips a tape into the player and we hear "Lonely Teardrops", by Michael McDonald, one of Ben's favorite songs
At a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and Ben takes a pull from the Coke can and smiles, mouths the word "hot"
The cop nods back at him, the light changes and they both pull away
: 14 Ben carries a brown paper bag which clinks
Camera follows him as he walks down the street
He looks at
' girl walking ahead of him in the same direction
She is walking her dog
She is attractive from behind
We hear Ben's thoughts
(voice-over) Beautiful, no just the shape which is nice, but the whole walk, the feeling, the movement
This girl is pleased with herself
Maybe this is the only art  can appreciate
don't know if this is good or bad, but right now she is really beautiful
When  was a boy it would have been really important that she have a pretty face, to go with this body,  mean
still would like to see her face, but her beauty is no dependent on her face
The dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she bends down to pull at its collar
(voice-over) wonder what kind of panties she's wearing
Shit, that's too specific, but
on the other hand, you can never be too specific
but then, the infinitesimal must be, by definition, as infinite as the infinite
Suddenly the girl stops
Ben catches up with her and cannot resist looking into her face
(voice-over) God, she's so young
The girl sees Ben and smiles an innocent smile, Hi
Hi
: 15
'     - Ben walks up to his house still carrying the paper bag young boy of about thirteen years of age is fixing a beat-up bike
Ben greets him
Hey, Brad
how's it going
Hey Ben
There were a couple of guys looking for you
What did they look like
Suits
didn't tell them anything
You know anything about gears
Ben takes a look
The gear mechanism is all bent out of shape
He bends down to have a look
It is clear from the way he deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his hands
He doesn't try to force anything but he moves the chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem
How'd this happen
was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up
The news is not good, kid
This bit here
see there
it's broken
You need a new  one
(upset) How much, do you think
don't know
'll find out though
Ben gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house
He looks back and Brad is sitting still by the bike, looking totally dejected
This really seems to upset Ben
: 16
'  - Ben is naked and the shower can be heard in the background
The house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing
He pours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops up the glass
He turns on the stereo, selects a record - Miles Davis, Kind of Blue - and puts it on the turntable
He turns on the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape
He puts the machine into the record mode
He kneels down next to the deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the second track without any problem
The music starts and continues through the next sequence
17
- Ben is in the shower with the glass in his hand
18
- Ben shaving with the glass in his hand
He does the area around his mouth first so that he can drink while he does the rest
19
- Showered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, Ben looks handsome and normal
He selects another record and again sets up the cassette machine to record
He turns the stereo up full and dances by himself while watching  silent
He tries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance
In slow motion we see him fall
Ben lies still on the floor
He smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a while
: : 20
'
- Sera wakes up in bed next to Yuri
(The camera is high above the bed looking down
) She is completely drenched in sweat thin shaft o light comes from the crack in the drapes and falls across their bodies
Other than that, the room is in darkness
To get out of bed she would have to climb over him
She lies still
Yuri speaks without opening his eyes
missed you, Sera
You have been lonely
Sera blinks and turns her head towards him
'm older now, Yuri
He puts his hand between her legs, over the sheets and grasps her there
You have been lonely
(tensing a little) 've been all right
will keep you safe
We are both older
He climbs on to her and mounts her
Familiarity
You have been lonely
(flat voice) am lonely, Yuri
He begins thrusting into her
Yes
so am
Camera move slowly into a tight portrait of Sear
(voice-over) had a new dress
we were at the fair, Daddy bought me an ice-cream and  spilt it on my dress
: 21
'  - Sera is sitting on a sofa talking to an unseen person
(Although it is no entirely clear when this is taking place, the sense of it is that we are in present, i
e
all the events in the film are in the past tense
) Mom was with Helen, and Dad looked around first to see if she was watching and then he scraped it all off and threw it on the grass and then he kissed me and hugged me and told me it was all right
22
' Yuri is tucking into a hearty breakfast
Sera plays with her food
(planning his day) This is such a small apartment, Sera
cannot stay here
We will find a big apartment
You know how much money  can bring you belong in
(laughs) wealth and luxury
He suddenly looks up from his food and smiles at her
Why did you run away from me in Los Angeles
Sera says nothing
Because you are sly
Mmm
You knew all along that there was more money in Las Vegas
Didn't you
Sera nervously plays with her food
You have nothing to fear from me
You know why
Because we belong together, Sera
Don't we
Sera forces a smile
(quietly) Yes
: : 23
- Grainy black-and-white image
Sera on a bed, pinned down by Yuri, who has a knife
: 24
'  - 'm pleased with you, Sera
how you have moved up in the world
showed you a glamorous world when  took you off the streets
(shaking his head) and how you repay me
Where have you been staying
With an old friend
He drops his fork
But that is none of your affair
You will call this morning and book me into a hotel suite where  will make new contacts for us
The mood has changed and Sera does her best to move out of these dangerous waters
You'll need some money, then
Yuri nods
Sera rises goes to a kitchen drawers and finds money
(becoming angry) It is, after all, Sera, my money
(calmly) Yes, of course
How much do you need
(shaking his head) All of it
need to buy many things
all of it
Yuri is very angry and as Sera hands him the money, he hits her, hard, knocking her back into the refrigerator
His ring cuts her cheek
(shouting) Don't look at me like that
And then his anger goes and he becomes quite tender with her
He takes her face in his hands to look at the cut
It's not so bad
It is nothing
(whispers) need money, Sera
need it fast
You must go on the street tonight
For me
He sits down with shaking hands
He suddenly seems more vulnerable than she is
He goes to the window and looks out, left and then right, as if he expects to see something
need money fast, Sera want you back on the street
Tonight
: -  : 25
'  - Ben opens his eyes
The only light comes from the
The miles Davis record has got caught on a scratch and is repeating the sane phrase over and over again
He looks at his gold Rolex and then fingers the wedding band on his finger
: 26
'
- Ben is sitting at the bar
He drinks a large glass of something very quickly and then immediately orders another
He drinks this a little slower but still too quick, finishes it and then orders another
He looks around the bar and sees a woman sitting by herself, thirtyish, pretty and receptive
She looks and sees Ben, and he smiles at her
She smiles right back
Ben talks across the bar
(charming) Good evening
(pleased) Hi
'm Benjamin
Ben
'm Teri
Ben walks over to where she is
She is pleased that this good-looking man has come over to make a play
She makes a noise with her straw to indicate that her glass is empty
'll get you another one
and me too
Mind if join you
She watches him walk to the bar
He gets the drink and walks back to her
He sets the drinks down on the table and sits down
As he does so, his face gets close to hers and she smells the booze on him
Wow
been drinking all day
But of course
She looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face
She is no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this much is clear to Ben
Why don't we finish these and go to my apartment on the beach
She doesn't respond
We can watch a movie and 'll mix you up a gooey blender drink
Ben winces at his own words
He shakes his head
have to get up pretty early tomorrow
'll just finish this and go
Thanks anyway
They drink in silence for a while
Ben takes a deep breath
0 (pathetic) really wish that you'd come home with me
You're so cute and 'm really good in bed
believe me
you smell good too
He stops and frowns as he stares into his empty glass
No,
Ben tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the bar
It's a strange thing with drunks like Ben
when they're up they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all falls apart
She starts to speak but then doesn't
look of great sadness comes over her
have to go now
Thanks anyway
She stands to go
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much
She walks to the door and Ben turns to the bar, watched by he Barman, who is a little concerned
(to himself) Maybe  shouldn't breathe so much, Teri
Ha
ha
(sever voice) Time to go, buddy
We're closing up
Ben gets out his wallet but his hands are shaking so much that he cannot extract any bills
He is very embarrassed and tries again, but to no avail
Would you
The barman shakes his head in disgust as he goes into the wallet and takes some money
: 27
- Ben is cruising in his car, listening to music on his stereo
: 28
- Ben comes into the club and sits down next to the stage, where a dancer is doing her thing accompanied by a live blue trio
swimsuited waitress comes to the table
There's a one-drink minimum per show,  hope you saw the sign when you came in
Anyway, they're supposed to tell you
Yes,  heard, and it's not a problem
What do you want
What are my choices
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol
No alcohol
No alcohol
You gotta get something else
Everything's ten dollars
What do you want
What do you think  should get
Non-alcoholic malt beverage
Noooo
Orange soda
No
Coffee
No
Sparkling apple cider
No
Water
Water
One drink minimum per show
Everything's ten dollars
Now
tell me what you want or 'll eighty-six you
(decides) Water
She writes down
and walks away
Ben calls her back
Just how much would it cost for you to eighty-six me
tough black girl dances in a world of her own, impervious to the men who stare at her
The trio grinds out a dirty blues
man opposite Ben places a dollar bill on the stage and as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between her legs an winks
The Waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and a bottle of water in front of Ben but refuses to look at him
(hostile) Three-fifty
Ben puts down a hundred on to her tray
(polite) Could  have fives please
Keep one for yourself
This throws the Waitress for a loop
: 29
- Ben drinks all of a fifth of bourbon
Other guys come and go, pissing against the urinal
Ben offers one of the guys a drink, the pianist from the trio
He takes a shot
: 30
- Ben sits next to another man watching the show
On stage a tall blonde dances with her own reflection in a mirror
Ben turns to his neighbor
To me nothing is more beautiful than the relationship between the reflection of a woman and the woman who has created it
(completely uninterested) No shit
30A
- Ben drives in his car
: 31
- Ben is cruising in his car, listening to 'Lonely Teardrops' again
He's looking for a prostitute
He sees a girl, but when he slows down she ducks into a doorway
He looks in his rear-view mirror and sees a cop car coming up fast
Ben panics for a second
There is a bottle between his legs
The cop car draws level and cruises alongside him for a while, but then puts its lights and siren on and speeds off, doing a -turn
Ben continues and then sees an Hispanic girl and stops
He winds down the window
He is by now almost incoherent
Good evening
32
- The girl looks up and down the street and then walks over to the car and bends down to the window
You wanna date
You wanna date me
The girl's eyes shift constantly from Ben to the street and then back again
(cut to the chase) 'll give you a hundred dollars for a straight forty- five minutes
You get the room
Ben shows her the money
(trying to take him) The room is twenty
You pay for it
Ben laughs
but only because  think that the concept of surrender fits in with the big picture right now
How about over there
He gives her a twenty and indicates a motel across the street
She sets off and he gets out of the car
As he does, a wave of nausea hits him
He shakes his head violently and then lurches across the street, causing two cars to hit their brakes
The camera follows him into the dark parking lot of the motel, where the Hispanic girl is waiting
(slurring badly) canremember
if mywifeleffme
or Illeff her
bufuckittanyway
The girl laughs at Ben and says something in Spanish
Slowly the picture gets darker, until all that can be seen is the headlights from the passing cars on Sunset
and then
33
'  - Ben wakes up on the kitchen floor
The fridge door is open and its light is what lights Ben
Inside the fridge are one green pepper and four bottles of vodka
Without too much effort Ben feels for his wallet and sees that it is still there, as are his car keys
He closes the fridge door and in the green light from the window he lies still
The first birds start singing
(the birdsong continues through the following sequence, which does not have sync sound
) : 34
-  - At the rear of the motel
Next to some garbage hoppers, the Hispanic girl hugging him and kissing his neck
He tries to kiss her on the mouth, but she turns her face away
: 35
'  - Ben lying on the floor, thinking
: 36
-  - The Hispanic girl kneeling in front of him, unzipping his trousers
Through a gap in the fence, we see traffic going up and down Sunset
: 37
'  - Ben lying on the floor, thinking
: 38
-  - The girl takes his hand and kisses it
She begins sucking the fingers, taking the whole hand into her mouth
: 39
'  - Ben suddenly sits up and looks at his hand
His wedding ring has gone
He thinks about this for a long time
: 40
- Ben waiting in line to cash a check
He looks unwell and is having difficulty standing straight
At last it is his turn
He goes to the counter and hands over a check to the girl
four thousand, six hundred dollars
one moment, sir
She looks at her computer read-out
That'll leave five dollars in your account
Would you sign the back of the check, please
(surprised) You couldn't cash it just like it is
(puzzled) 'm sorry, sir
Is there a problem
Ben picks up a pen and tries to sign, but his hands are shaking so much that he cannot do it
(embarrassed) Well
to tell you the truth, 'm a little shaky right now
just had a brain surgery
Why don't  come back after lunch, when 'm feeling a little better
We can take care of it then
: 41
'
- Ben seated at the bar, a pile of bills in front of him
The Barman sets down a vodka, picks up the empty glass and takes some bills, shaking his head in disapproval
The  is on, some game show as before, and Ben watches carefully, looking for a sign from the girl, but the show proceeds in its 'normal' fashion
The only difference is that the hostess is played by the girl in the bank
Ben grabs the Barman's attention
think, when 'm done with this, 'll have gin and tonic
Bombay gin and tonic
The Barman loses it (angry) You should be having coffee
Do you know what time it is
You're a young man
(calmer) It's none of my business, but if you could see what  see, you wouldn't do this to yourself
Ben is taken aback by the emotion in his voice
In his mind, cynicism and the desire to cry fight it out
He holds the emotion back, and looks down at the bar
understand what you're saying
appreciate your concern
Its not my intention to make you uncomfortable
Please
serve me today and will never come in here again
(cheerful) If  do, you can eighty-six me
Sure, sure,  can eighty-six you now if  want to
Stop fucking with me
don't give a fuck what you do
He picks up a bottle of gin, fills a glass, slams it on the counter in front of Ben and knocks twice with his knuckles on the bar
On the house, son
Ben looks at the  for a sign
None is forthcoming
: 42
- Ben waiting in line again
The same Bank girl is there and she is dealing with her customers in the same inanely cheerful way that the game-show Hostess dealt with her prize- winners
She notices Ben waiting and an irritated look flashes over across her face
Ben studies her
She is pretty in an ordinary kind of way
We hear Ben's thoughts as voice- over (or maybe he says them out loud to himself)
(voice over) Are you desirable
Are you irresistible
Maybe if you drank bourbon with me, it would help
Maybe if you kissed me and  could taste the sting in your mouth, it would help
Close-up on the Bank Girl as she does her thing, efficiently counting money, smiling, perfect teeth framed by a Cupid mouth
She is wearing a white blouse through which frilly lingerie can just be made out
If you drank bourbon with me naked
if you smelled of bourbon as you fucked me, it would help
it would increase my esteem for you
If you poured bourbon on to your naked body and said to me
drink this
Camera moves in tighter on her face as she chats with a customer about the weather
if you spread your legs and had bourbon dripping from your breasts and you vagina and said drink here
then could fall in love with you, because then  would have a purpose, to clean you up, and that would prove that 'm worth something
Id lick you clean so you could go away and fuck someone else
Next
Ben takes a moment to come out of his reverie
He smiles and comes to the counter, completely in control of himself
'm back, 've got my check
and baby
'm ready to sign
He flips the check over, makes sure she is watching and signs with a flourish
There
Steady as a fucking rock, excuse my French
(serious) Wanna have dinner with me
She counts the money out and glares at him as she hands it over
'm glad you're feeling better
Do you need a validation
Ben looks at her and smiles

- Ben throws items into a trolley
Garbage bags, firelighters and charcoal lighter fluid
: 44
'  - Ben putting all the kitchen utensils into a large garbage bag
Three other bags are already filled and the kitchen is looking empty
: 45
'  - Ben is stuffing all the bedding into a garbage bag
Next he opens a drawer on the dresser and begins taking out clothes and stuffing them into another bag
He pauses for a moment to take a drink from a tall glass
: 46
'   - All the books from the bookcase go into another bag
Then all the records
But he selects certain favorites and as this sequence progresses we can see that Ben is making tapes of these tracks
As soon as he is done with the recording, he throws the album into a garbage bag
: 47
'  - Ben pours lighter fluid on to a pile of photographs and then throws a match on to it
It bursts into flames
He throws more stuff on and the fire blazes
curious neighbor watches from a safe distance, not wanting too get involved
watercolor, a poem to his wife, photograph of him and his wife, a Polaroid of a naked woman, his medical records, his birth and marriage certificates, divorce papers, strips of photographs from booths, postcards from Hawaii
Two small children (his
)
Now the flames are high and Ben has to stand back as he throws things on to the fire
his camera, an engraved box, his wife's 'left behind' clothing , a clock
: 48
'  - Fifteen neatly tied garbage bags and Ben's furniture are stacked up on the sidewalk
Ben comes out of his front door carrying a racing bike
He walks to the neighbors' house and places the bike on the porch
We see a label saying 'To Brad from Ben'
He walks to his black car with a small suitcase, gets in and drives off
: 49
- high wide shot shows a small black car making its way across the frame
: 50
- Through the window we see a dead straight road stretching to infinity
The sunlight is painfully bright
On the soundtrack we hear one of Ben's chosen tapes, which continues through into the next shot
: 51
- Ben is filling his car
Town Car drives in and stops next to the
Three men get out
They look like Russian Mobsters
Ben nods at them and they nod back
: 52
- Same angle through the window but this time we see Las Vegas at night as Ben drives down the main drag
An overdose of neon
52A
- Ahead we see the light changing, but Ben doesn't notice until it's almost to late
The car stops and we see Sera crossing in front of the car
She gives Ben a look of real attitude because he is over the line and she has to change course to cross in front
: 53
- Sera is talking to Yuri
middle-aged man gets out of a cab and Yuri shakes him by the hand and introduces him to Sera
He hands Yuri an envelope and then Sera and he go into the hotel together
Yuri looks around thoughtfully before getting into a cab and driving off

'  - Improvised scene
(1) - Ben waits to check in while the manager explains the house rules to a family of large people from the Midwest
All rooms to be paid a week in advance, maid service is optional, use of the pool is at your own risk, there is no lifeguard on duty
Above the manager's head is the name of the motel, The Whole Year Inn
Ben stares at it and then smiles
' The sign has changed to The Hole You're In
: 56
- Ben has almost filled a trolley with bottles of various brands
He is whistling and seems happy
57
'  - Improvised scene
(2) : 58
- Ben driving
He sees Sera and follows her, then drives up on the sidewalk
She sees him
Hello
Hello
Are you working
(tough) Working
What do you mean, working
'm walking
And she walks a few steps to prove it, stopping on the passenger side of his car
They pause for a moment and Ben is confused
He is quite taken with her beauty, but this is not going according to plan
He reaches into the car quickly and picks an open can of bee, draining it before tossing the empty back on to the rear seat
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive
(laughs) That's funny
(seriously) wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me
Sera doesn't say anything
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour,  will give you five hundred dollars
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that
You're pretty drunk
He bites his lips as he waits for her to respond
(softer) You're pretty drunk
(factual) Not really
My room's not far
The Whole Year Inn
You can drive with me if you want
She makes no response
or we can walk
or 'll give you cab fare
Takes out his money
Whatever you want
She touches the door handle
Why don't you give me the money when 'm in the car, and 'll drive you
It takes a moment or two to register that she is saying yes
He comes around the car to open the door for her
'm Ben
They shake hands
'm Sera
She gets in
Ben gets in
: 59
- Ben hands her the money
Sarah - with an
No -
They grin at each other
You wanna start the engine
They drive off
60
- They sit in the car for a while before speaking
'm sort of curious
if you're willing to pay me two- fifty
not that  mind mean, 'm  with that - why aren't you staying in a hotel
We can go to one if you'd prefer
No, this is fine
was just wondering
Ben switches off the engine but makes no move to get out of the car
Well
'm here because 'm a drunk who tends to pass out at odd hours for unpredictable stretches
'm going to a hotel soon
room with a balcony to pass out on
or off
He falls silent
Umm
We can stay in the car for an hour if you want
But really have to go then
It's your time
Right, 'll get your door tend to fade in and out lately
guess  do too
You what
sometimes fade out
Oh
well, maybe we better synchronize our spells
or stagger them
(gently) You were going to get my door
He gets out and she waits for him to open the door
She gets out and he offers her his arm
She takes it and they walk into the motel
: 61
'  - As Ben closes the door
Sera surveys the room
(amused) What this room needs
is more booze
' There are bottles everywhere
Ben has gone to a lot of troble to lay them out in a pleasing way
Do you think so
She turns and looks at him, appraising him
Suddenly she's all business, in control, and Ben likes it
Mind if  use the bathroom
Of course
She goes into the bathroom
Want a drink
'm having one
(off-screen) shot of tequila, if you can spare it
Of course
Ben smiles, happier than we've ever seen him
He gets her order ready and then he takes a big swig from a bourbon bottle
He sits on the edge of the bed
The bathroom door opens and Sera comes in wearing a black bra and panties
She's acting the hooker now, tough and sexy
For two-fifty we can do pretty much what you want
You've been drinking, so it might be better if  got on top, but the other way's fine too
have some jelly in case you want to fuck my ass, that's up to you
If you want to come in my face, that's too, just try to keep it out of my hair,  just washed it
and my eyes, it stings
She walks to the table and downs her tequila in one
Then comes to the bed, where Ben is sitting
She kneels, unzips his fly and begins sucking him
Ben watches her, looks at her reflection in the closet mirror, reaches for the bottle and drinks some, being careful not to disturb Sera
After a while Sera comes up
Do you want to fuck now
(confused) Maybe another drink first
More tequila
whatever
She takes the bottle and drinks
She goes down again
Ben stops her
What's the story
Are you too drunk to come
(sincere) don't care about that
There's time left
You can have more money
You can drink all you want
You can talk or listen
Just stay, that's all   want
She looks at him, confused
She sees a strange look on his face
It throws her
This is a turning point
Both of them are momentarily exposed
Ben lifts the sheet and moves to one side, indicating that she should come into the bed
She's as confused as he is
She gets in with him and he hands her the bottle
: 62
- Yuri is losing at one of the tables
He continues to bet though, putting half of what he has left on one number
He lose again
He mops his face with a red silk handkerchief and places another bet
63
- The three Russian Mobsters we saw in the desert are walking through the casino, looking for someone
: 64
'  - They are both in bed, drinking
So, Ben, what brings you to Las Vegas
Business convention
They both laugh and Ben hands her the bottle
No,  came here to drink
myself
you know
To death
Yes, that's right
He looks at her, she at him, not sure whether to believe him or not
cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death
think about four weeks, and 've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day
Yes
that should do it
What am
luxury
Yeah
And your meter just ran out
Ben looks at his watch
It's
nice watch
Go on
Talk some more
Ben yawns, suddenly deeply tired
In   kept running out of booze and the store would be closed because 'd forget to look at my watch
so decided to move here because nothing ever closes and because  got tired of getting funny looks when would walk into a bar at six o'clock
even the bartenders started preaching
(yawns again) Here, everyone's from out of town so no one cares, no one is overtly fucking up : Sera is in focus, Ben is asleep
(voice-over) guess  was intrigued by him
There was a lot of stuff that  wanted to ask him about but didn't because didn't want to sound too interested in a trick
But felt as if a relationship was being forged very quickly
65
'  - Improvised scene
(3) : 65A
'   - Sera gets out of a cab and makes her way towards her apartment, changing out of her high heels as she walks
66
'  - Sera lets herself in
Yuri is standing in the shadows
She gets a fright when she sees him
Where have you been
It was a slow night
went to a hotel for a few drinks
Yuri holds out his hand for her bag
She gives it to him
He finds the money and counts it
full night on the street and this is all
Like  said
it was a slow night
'm sorry
It was hard to score
Yuri slaps her
Don't hit me
What do you think
you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard
Yuri talks in Russian, becoming angrier, and slaps her again
He spits on the floor
Sera falls against the kitchen table and picks up a lethal- looking knife
Yuri stops
Maybe nobody wants to fuck a chick with a cut on her cheek
She throws the knife to Yuri, who catches it
She bends over the table and pulls up her skirt
There, go ahead
She mimics him
shower of Russian comes out of Yuri, but he doesn't touch her
He tries to regain his dignity by putting on a coat
could kill you
You know that
He goes to the door
Work, tonight, bring me money, no matter the hour
And he exits
Sera is still on the table
will Yuri
will
: 67
- The proprietor is handling over some cash to Yuri, whose jewelry is on the counter
He pockets it and as he turns to leave, Ben comes in
They pass without taking much notice of each other
Ben removes his Rolex and shows it to the man
: 68
,   - Yuri is walking in the hot sun, sweating
We see him through long-lens heat haze
The camera wanders into the traffic and we see the black Town Car crawling along behind him, three men inside

'  - Improvised scene
(4) : 70
,  - lounge singer belts out a fair rendition of a Tony Orlando number
Sera sits at the bar, an empty seat on either side of her
She watches a younger hooker in the final moments of pulling a dangerous-looking man
The girl is aware of Sera without even looking at her
The guy she is with looks around and sees Sera
The girl shoots an icy look
man sits next to Sera: a conventioneer
About ready for another drink
Yes, that would be great
Are you her for the convention
Do  look that obvious
My name's Paul
They shake hands
No, of course not, just a wild guess
'm Sera and that's a margarita
The barman is already pouring
The young hooker leaves with her dangerous guy
She pauses long enough to give Sera a nasty smile
The conventioneer pays for the drink and is a little lost for words
Sera tries to help
So
are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous
(laughs nervously) Alone
Alone
'm here alone
(friendly) Where are you staying
(suspicious) Right here at the hotel
Why
(moving a little closer) Well
thought you might be looking for a date
(shocked) date
What, are you a hooker
(voice getting louder) What do you mean a date
(and louder) 've got a wife back home just came over to talk for a few minutes
(quietly) 'm sorry,  guess misunderstood
She looks around
Please don't raise your voice
won't bother you about it again
(calmer) Sorry
Look
you seem like a nice girl
'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money
He gets up
Here, have another drink gotta go
He leaves
Sera is uncomfortable
People are watching her, aware that something has been going on
The Barman comes over to where Sera is sitting
Maybe you should give it a miss for this evening
He walks away
Sera finishes her drink and leaves
: 71
- Sera at work is looking more carefully than usual, hoping to see Ben
huge silver limo pulls up and, after some negotiation, she gets in
: 72
- Long-lens shot of Ben, very drunk on the street
He falls and lies still for quite a long time before getting up
He falls into the road and tries to hail a cab, but none stops
cop car cruises to a halt and Ben more or less imitates a normal person as he walks out of shot
73
,  - Ben dives in and swims a length under water
He pulls himself out and sits next to the large Midwestern family
The father says hello and introduces his family to Ben
They are all very friendly
It's a nice atmosphere around this pool and for a moment Ben even looks healthy
: 74
- limo pulls up and Sera gets out
She sees something
' Ben sitting at a bus stop, drinking out of a cocktail glass
When he sees her he gets up, a little unsteadily
couldn't remember what happened last time
was afraid that  might have been rude, or mean to you
He looks at her
If  was 'm sorry
No, just drunk
but that's Where's your car
sold it this morning
'm going to take cabs from now on in
Sera looks up and down the strip
Don't run away
(defensive) Why should
know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight
Another two-fifty to watch you sleep
Ben sits down, a little hurt
What's up
was looking for you tonight
don't know if you have a boyfriend
He thinks
or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time
maybe we could have dinner
(tough again, but pleased) Are you serious
(deadly serious) think you know 'm serious
'll pay you if you like
but 'd like to see you
No,  can't have dinner with you
And she hails a taxi, which stops immediately and she gets in
The Mojave Hotel, please
Ben watches the cab drive off
: 75
- Sera walks along, checking numbers on the doors
She finds the right one and knocks firmly
(v
o) Yes
What
It's me, Yuri
The door opens a crack and Yuri peers out
Sera
It's
He looks around for a clock
it's late
76
'  - Sera comes into the room, takes her purse out and counts out seven hundred dollars
Sorry, Yuri
good night
lots of tricks think things are picking up
Yuri sits on the bed
He looks unwell and disoriented
His face is covered with a thin film of sweat
He seems to be listening for something, because he stops her talking by putting his fingers to his lips
He looks at her and then beckons her to the bed
Sera is nervous
As she walks to the bed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse
Yuri stops her with a wave of his hand
Sera is puzzled and frightened now
Yuri seems to be deranged
Have you told anyone that 'm here
No
Yuri suddenly hears something
He grabs Sera's hand and takes her to the wall
He presses her head to the wall
Do you here that
He looks at her
They're talking about me
He pulls himself together
Go, Sera
(whispers) Go
Stay at home
will call you tomorrow
Yuri
are you
(patiently) Sera
please go
He indicates the wall
This is very important
and must listen
Now go
They face each other for a moment and then Yuri does an almost comic gesture to tell her to go
He hustles her to the door and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her blouse
He slams the door
(through the door) Goodbye, Sera
Don't come back here
will not see you again
Sera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she begins to walk
The camera follows her as she makes her way down the endless corridor of doors
Ahead of her, three men are walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they make their way
Sera doesn't take them in
They pass and turn a corner
We recognize them as the men from the black Town Car
The men have stopped outside Yuri's room
The camera pans and we see Sera down the other corridor getting into the elevator
: 77
'     - Ben is lying on the bed watching a game show, drinking
coughing fit hits him
He is very short of breath
We see how ill he really is
There is a tap at the door
No thanks
'm fine
The tapping persists and eventually Ben gets off the bed and unlocks it, but keeps the chain on
It is Sera
Still want to have dinner
Ben stares at her for a while
Yes
have to change and take a shower first
If you want to come home and wait
Ben opens the door
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way
owe you one
You do
: 78
'  - Sera is finishing in the shower and Ben is sitting at the kitchen table
He gets up and walks around the house, trying to get a sense of her
The furniture is very plain and there is spartan quality about the hose
He looks with interest at the bookshelf, which has a good selection of literature
(to himself) This is the home of an angel
(off-screen) You  out there
Yes
Take your time
'm fine
He pours himself another drink
(off-screen) Pour yourself another drink
He sots down and she comes in, toweling her hair
You
Of course
Wow
you look extremely beautiful
Thank you
What time is it
Don't know
My watch went the way of the car
He holds up his empty wrist for her to see
Then looks up and sees her watching him
'm rambling
really like you
You make me want to talk
don't know what time it is
like hearing you talk
(businesslike) If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner
All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter
How does that sound to you
Do they have drinks
: 79
- Ben and Sera walk and talk
80
- Ben and Sera are eating
He plays with his food, eating very little of it
Finally he pushes it away and orders another drink
'm from the East
went to college, did an arts course
now live in Vegas
think of it as home
came here deliberately to carve out a life
was in  before, but 'll come back to that later
(pause) The tough times are behind me now
can deal with the bad things that happen
There will always be dark characters
But my life is good
It is as  would want it to be
So, why are you a drunk
Is that really what you want to ask me
Yes
(worried) Well, then  guess this is our first date
or our last
Until now,  wasn't sure it was either
Very clever
Sera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on this
First
It's our first
'm just concerned
So
why are you killing yourself
Interesting choice of words
don't remember
just know that  want to
Want to kill yourself
Are you saying  that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself
And she leans across the table to be close to him, listening intently
Ben becomes uncomfortable and tries to joke it off
Or killing myself as a way to drink
Sera continues to stare at him, wanting to know the real answer
He takes a slug from his drink
She sits back
We'll talk about it some other time maybe
Sera relaxes and continues with her food
We hear her thoughts for a moment
(v
o) It wasn't so important to me
mean, he never asked me why was a hooker, sand that was impressive
really liked him
So  decided to just play my part
mean
it's good to help someone once in a while
, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan
to stay alive suddenly came to a decision
What are you thinking
Are you angry with me
(decides something) Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight
mean
look, you're so drunk
like you
trust you
That's astonishing
Sera, look
hate to think of you in that cheesy motel
mean
And she folds her arms and grins at him
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas
(overwhelmed by her) 'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better
(looks at her) Let's talk about tomorrow
Wanna do something
(warmly) Sure
tonight
Then please stay at my place
Sera
you know 'm not much good in the sack
It's not about sex, Ben
'll make you up a bed on the sofa
Do it for me
We can talk till late and then sleep till late
As you know,  am my own boss
Ben laughs loud, the most animated we've seen him, and his laugh as infectious, and Sera join in
Other diners turn to stare at them
They seem like a couple
: 81
- Ben and Sera walk and talk, holding hands
82
- wide shot
The black Town Car makes its way across frame
Left to right
: 83
' house - day Ben is asleep on the sofa
As he wakes up, he becomes aware that Sera is watching him from across the room
They smile at each other
How long have  been her
Three nights, two days
When is your rent coming up at the motel
don't know
(sits up) 'll go and sort it out today
Why don't you come
We'll find a real room for me
You can pick it out, a tower on the strip
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room
What do you mean
What  mean is that you should bring your stuff over here
We're spending all this time together
what the fuck
Sera
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here
've never done so much talking in my life
Me neither
So
Let's dispense with the formalities
want you here
now
Sera you are crazy
So
'm not too concerned with long term plans
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk
That is what  want
Why don't you go and get your stuff
You haven't seen the worst of it
These last few days 've been very controlled
knock things over
throw up all the time
(looks at her) Now  feel really good
You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever
You'll get tired of it really quickly
Believe me
They sit in silence for a while
, you go back to your hotel and 'll go back to my glamorous life of being alone
She walks out of the room, and into the bathroom, where she sits on the toilet to pee
(to herself) The only thing  have to come home to is a bottle of Listerine to wash the taste of come out of my mouth
'm tired of being alone
that's what 'm tired of
She finishes, wipes herself and flushes the toilet
Pulling up her panties, she walks back into the bedroom, where Ben is putting on his shoes
Don't you like me, Ben
(devastated) Don't be silly
Ben is unable to deal with the fact that he is absolutely in love with her
He walks out of the room
She foolows
We gotta decide this
right now
Before we go any further
You either stay here with me or
Ben turns to look at her
we can't see each other any more
Ben and Sera look at each other for a long time
Sera
what you don't understand is
What
Ben is deeply troubled
He comes to a decision
You can never
never
ask me to stop drinking
Do you understand
(dead serious) do
really do
(smiles) have to do some shopping alone
You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things
Don't hurry and 'll be back before you to let you in
Sera grabs him in a big embrace that knocks him off balance and into the wall
She kisses him all over his face and squeezes his skinny frame
: 84
'     - Ben is packing his liquor into his suitcase
The almost-empty bottles he pours into a large cup, which he drinks from
The suitcase is now full and Ben suddenly realizes that he hasn't packed any clothes
They are all in a pile on the bed
He talks to himself
Maybe this isn't a good idea after all
He tries to put clothes in with the bottles, but the lid won't close
He sits on the bed and has an imaginary conversation with Sera
Listen, angel
the thing is that 'm nuts about you and this is a bad thing
because my real plan is to die here and you were never even part of my plan
but like  said, 'm nuts about you
wait a minute,  have an idea, angel
And he opens the closet and finds some plastic laundry bags, which he puts his clothes in
85
: 86
'  - Sera's neighbors, a husband and wife, are standing outside her house
They stop her
They are also her landlord
We didn't know whether to call the police or not
And they indicate the sleeping figure of Ben, in the doorway, clutching a bottle of bourbon, using hi suitcase as a pillow
He's been there for about half an hour
My husband thought he'd seen you two together, but  thought it best to wait until you got home
Yes, he's my friend
guess he just had a little too much to drink
(smiling uncomfortably) 'll help him inside
(puts down her packages) Thanks for the concern
Sorry to trouble you
(gallantly) Well, call me if there's anything  can do
They go to their own house
Sera opens the front door, kneels down next to Ben and shakes him gently
Can you wake up
Ben opens his eyes and looks around with a pleasant, cheerful expression
Hi
Why don't you go in and sit down
have some gifts for you
Right
Ben stands and almost loses his balance
He picks up his suitcase and attempts to pick up her packages as well, but she stop him
Don't worry
got'em
Ben staggers in with his case
As Sera enters, she looks around and sees Husband and Wife at the window, still watching
(off-screen) Want a drink
Great nap
Wanna go out tonight
Seriously, Ben
need to keep pretty low-key around here
Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door
That was the landlord
Of course
She reaches into her purse
Gift number one
And she gives him a newly cut key
He takes it and tries it in the lock, then drops it into his pocket
used to carry a lot of keys, but one by one they all fell victim to the great condensation
Now  have just this one
which is
And he tails off and stares at the floor
She waits for him to continue and then comes to him and touches him on the arm
87
'  - Ben
Sorry
He shakes his head
was miles away
He sees the parcels
Ah
more gifts
have to sit down for this
He strides into the living room and flops on to the sofa
She follows
Sera,  love that name
Before we proceed onwards, there is something  need to say
've come this far
here am, in your house
want you to let me pay the rent for this month
All right
And he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen until this matter is resolved
Why
Because
it's better for me that way
Well
She is uncomfortable
They sit in silence for a while
Sera
hope that you understand how  feel about this
First of all, you're welcome to my money
We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest
But  don't think you're talking to me right now about money
(smiling) No
No
think you're talking about you
'll tell you right now that 'm in love with you
but, be that as it may, 'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul
know that
and 'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life
We know 'm a drunk
but that seems to be all right with you
And  know that you're a hooker
hope you understand that 'm a person who is totally at ease with this
which is not to say that 'm indifferent or that don't care
do
it simply means that  trust and accept your judgement
What 'm saying is
that  hope you understand that understand
Thanks,  do understand was worried about how that would be
but now 'm not
And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job
Ah, yes
suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck
Whatever that means
Open your presents
She hands him the larger of the two parcels
Open this one first
Ben awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt genuine smile comes on to his face
Very nice
He holds the shirt against himself
This should work very nicely with my suit, which, by the way, is the only item of clothing  brought over from the motel with me
Sera raise an eyebrow
Right
the suitcase was clinking
So what did you do with your clothes
(laughing) threw them into the garbage
, which was perhaps immoral, but  wanted to come to you clean, so to speak thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty-five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day
(smiling) Nice talk, Ben
Keep drinking
In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth
She hands him the last present
Now, try this one
Ben unwraps the smallest gift
It is a silver hip flask
He is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek
Well
looks like 'm with the right girl
He turns it in his hands
must say that 'm very impressed that you would buy this for me
know you wouldn't do this without thinking about it
Funny
you did just what would have done
Ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit
It is fine
He walks to the door
'm going to fill it right now
Do you want to go gambling tonight
We could go out and play for a few hours
Ben comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit pocket and has a drink
hadn't planned to gamble
but if you would keep the bulk of my money here, then  could safely blow a couple of hundred bucks
He takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and then gives her the rest
Giving you money makes me want to come
Then come
(pause) 'm going to change
Watch 'll be half an hour
And she leaves
There is a slight edge to her voice and Ben is not sure if he offended her or not
He watches through the small angle of the door as she changes
am planning to go out and do some work
When
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact
88
- Ben and Sera walking
The camera follows them
He is wearing his new shirt and looks good in it
She is wearing a green dress and mismatched earrings and looks great
They walk and talk
like your earrings
He changes sides
like women who wear mismatched earrings
Well, then
hope we don't run into any tonight
(laughs) What do you mean
expect some kind of loyalty here
Just because  fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly
And she stops and looks at him, smiling but serious
And  only have eyes for you
And we both know that you would never become romantically involved with a trick, right
89
- They walk around the huge space, which is full of people and energy, and suddenly Ben grabs Sera and pushes her against a slot machine and kisses her deeply
At first she resists and then she gives in to him and responds
They knock over some change, which falls to the floor, and Ben pulls from her a beat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to the bemused player, before returning to Sera's mouth or more
They break for air and then Ben leads her towards the bar
As he waves to attract the barman's attention, she squeezes his arm
(quietly) love you
But he doesn't hear her
On long lens we see Ben and Sera at the bar
Suddenly Ben seems to fall asleep
Sera tries to wake him and then he goes crazy and falls backwards off his stool, knocking a waitress and her drinks over
Security Guards appear and begin arguing with Sera
: 90
'  - Ben wakes up on the sofa, fully dressed
night-light gives a soft glow
He rolls off the sofa, landing on all fours on the floor
He crawls to the kitchen , opens the fridge door and takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice
With difficulty he gets to his feet, finds a glass and pour s a drink
He swallows the mix and then stands over the sink just in case he has to vomit
91
'  - Sera wakes and Ben comes in and gets into bed with her
How are you doing
Very well
umm
never expected to have to ask you this again
but how did our evening go
remember getting to the casino remember kissing you
that was really nice but everything after that is a blank
Well -  was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad
We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack
You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and  put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress
You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess
You kept yelling and yelling
Oh, and what did you do
tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me - not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away
Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling
They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but  talked them into letting me walk you out
That's impressive
How did you do that
told them you were an alcoholic and  would take you home
also promised that we would never come in there again
We
Yes, we
(holds her hand) What happened then
You were  for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but think even you knew that wasn't going to happen
We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though  told you that we had plenty at home
In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change
asked you if you knew it was a hundred
You said you did, so  let you do it
We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and covered you up and came to bed
warned you
(kisses her hand) but 'm sorry
Here's my speech
(kisses his hand) know this shouldn't be acceptable to m, but it is
Don't ask me why
sense that your trouble is very big
and 'm scared for you
and so 'm doing what think you need me to do
Falling down in casinos is little stuff
It doesn't bother me
It has nothing to do with us
That's amazing
What are you
Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies
How can you be so good
She turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl
don't know what you're saying
'm just using you need you
Can we not talk about it any more, please
Not another word
He thinks about this
He gently pushes her until she is lying on her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes her naked back
He kisses her in the small of her back
Why don't you go back to sleep
'll go out and buy us some breakfast
Be careful
He stands and goes to the door
Don't worry
As he leaves the room, she calls after him
Ben, 'm  working tonight
He opens the door and smiles at her
know
: 92
- Ben gets out of his  cab and walks up to the doorway of a grocery store
It is locked
Ben looks at his wrist and then remembers that he no longer has a watch
He looks around, sees something and exits frame
: 93
- Ben enters and makes his way to the bar
This is a dirty, dark place
An ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing by herself at the jukebox
very drunk Biker Couple argue noisily in a corner, slurring their words
There ins not much gambling taking place at the eight slot machines
Ben sits at the bar and the Bartender slaps down a paper napkin
beer and a double kamikaze please
Sure thing
Anything to eat
Not quite yet
First  have to drink myself sober, then
a few crackers, maybe an egg and toast
The Bartender walks away to get Ben's drinks, Ben continues anyway
then 'll go home with the groceries and we'll have breakfast together, and that'll make her feel better about my condition
Ben is interrupted by the arrival of the Biker Girl
She is young tough and pretty
She puts an arm around him and presses against him
Who the fuck are you talking to, Mr
(laughing) Why are you all dressed up, honey
My, don't you look fine
She runs her tongue around her mouth
am very bored with my date
Would you like to buy me a drink
Ben looks around and sees the Biker staring at the two of them
(loudly) Do you mind if  buy her a drink
Fuck her
don't care what the fuck you do with her
Maybe  could buy you both a drink
Fuck you
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker
Fuck off
Go to it, she's waiting for her drink
The Biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping in quarters, never taking his eyes off Ben and the Girl
See what an asshole he is
(big smile) 'll have a rum and Coke
Barman
rum and Coke, please
The Girl leans with her back to the bar, closer to Ben , who is facing the bar on a stool
She brings her face closer to his
Can  stay with you for a while
You mean move in with me
Isn't this a bit sudden
Oh,  don't have a lot of stuff
(smiling) don't think my wife would dig it too much
She moves to his ear to whisper
Maybe we could just go find a room and fuck all day
You wouldn't have to tell your wife about that, would you could suck you like this
And she begins sucking on his lobe
Behind them
At the slot machine the Biker is still watching
His face fills with a drunken rage
See, the thing is
fucking you would be wonderful, but am deeply in love with Sera
The Biker throws down his beer can and walks towards the bar
and it's almost impossible for me to imagine being with someone else
The Biker arrives at the bar and grabs Ben
Now listen, asshole, 'm not gonna just sit around and watch her suck on your ear
The Biker is about to hit Ben then holds back
He leans in and puts his face next to Ben's
Now,  know that she came over to you, like she does, so 'm gonna pretend that you're innocent and give you one chance to walk out of this place
right now
(to biker) Get lost, jerk
The Biker slaps her and then grabs Ben by the collar
What do you say
Ben shakes his arm free from the Biker's grip
He thinks about it for a couple of beats and then decides
'm sorry
but she and have decided to spend a few hours together in a mo - The Biker headbutts Ben in the face, sending him crashing off his stool to the floor
His head cracks against the tiled floor
The Biker walks over to him, picks him up by his shirt front and punches him in the nose
Blood sprays on to his face
The Biker walks out of the bar
The Girl follows him quickly
The Bartender takes a wet towel and walks over to where Ben is struggling to get up, holding his face
You're quite a fighter
He gives him the towel
This may sound silly, but 'm going to have to ask you to leave
It's what we do around here  when there's a fight
Men's room is around the back
: 94
'  - Ben lets himself in with his key
He is carrying a big bag of groceries
His clothes are bloodstained
The Landlady watches from poolside
'm back
He walks into the living room and finds Sera reading on the couch
She looks up and sees his face and his bloodstained shirt
Oh, no
Oh, fuck, Ben, look at your face
You get in a fight
thought you didn't fight
Goddammit
How do you feel
Wait here
Sit down
She goes to the bathroom and we hear her rummaging in the medicine cabinet
(off-screen) Did you stop at the bar
She comes back into the room, armed with bottles and cotton wool
Did you say something stupid to someone stupid
She goes to work on his face, dabbing an open cut with some mercurochrome
Absolutely not
ow
was defending the honor of some poor wayward maiden
She thinks about this for a moment and then kisses him on the forehead
Why don't you go and finish this in the bathroom
Take a shower and put on your other shirt
'll fix breakfast and then we'll go shopping and get some new clothes
think this suit must be unlucky
: 95
- Ben and Sera come out of a clothing store
Ben is wearing black jeans, red socks and a white dress shirt
They go up the 'up' escalator
Very creative
Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers
, but remember that they wear it because they have to
wear it because  want to
That'll make me look different
Let's get a drink
Ben somehow gets on the 'down' escalator, leaving Sera on the higher level
Ben
: 96 Ben needs a drink badly but this is not the best place
Mothers with children, old people and a Waitress with attitude
Ben tries to order but becomes angry when she doesn't bring it straight away
People begin staring
At the next table a dignified older man sits alone
Ben hands Sera a small package
There was no time for me to write a card, with you breathing down my neck all day
, so you'll just have to wing it, baby
He laughs and this induces a coughing fit
He downs his drink and holds up the empty glass to let the waitress know she should bring another
Open it
She does so
It is a pair of onyx earrings
Black onyx set in white gold
(pleased) Your color
think you should wear one at a time
One of these
and one of your others
In fact, was going to buy just one, but  didn't think it would fly
as a gift,  mean
His new drink arrives and he takes a swallow straight away
'll wear them tonight
one of them
She looks at him, aware of what she has said, wondering how he is reacting
She smiles and Ben takes a deep swallow, finishing his drink
His mood suddenly changes
Yes
tonight
Put it on
She does so
Ben helps her, bringing his face down close to hers
You'll be able to feel it, sharp and hot under your ear, as one of the brothers is driving your head, face down into one of the penthouse pillows
They are both suddenly deeply shocked by what he has said
They sit in silence for a while
Sera is close to tears
Ben gets up suddenly, puts down a couple of bills and walks away from the table
When he is almost at the door Sera gets up and quickly tries together up all of the packages
Ben, wait
please wait for me
The dignified older Man stands in Ben's path and places his hands on Ben's shoulders
Maybe you should wait for her, sir
Why
Because
you can hear in her voice that she really wants you to
Sera catches up and the Man lets go of Ben
Ben takes the packages from Sera and the two of them step out into the mall
97
- They walk together
What was that all about
Can we just forget it
don't understand any of that
Can we just ignore it
They stop and look at each other
The  system gives an inane message
Please
Yes
'll give you that
Thank you, Sera
Do you want me not to go tonight
No
we already talked about that
: 98
'  - Sera is preparing for work
In the background we can hear the next door
She dresses carefully
Black underwear, stockings, heels, a tight black skirt
99
- Ben is watching  and drinking
100
'  - Sera at the mirror, putting on her make-up
Her make-up is more pronounced than we have seen it before
Everything is more extreme
101
- Sera comes into the room
Ben looks up at her and sucks in his breath
Wow
She walks over to him and takes his head and places it between her breasts and kisses the top of his head
Maybe  should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you
They wouldn't know
She comes on to him
Maybe you should ask me sometime
'd be happy to show you
She goes to the door
'll be back home around three
If you're back by then we can watch  or something
guess what 'm saying is
that  hope you are back when  get home
Please be careful
You be careful to
'm going to miss you
Shall we go away for a couple of days
Yeah
'd like that
: 102
- Sera walks through the lobby, looking for business
103
- Ben lying down with people walking past and over him
' big smile appears on his face
He starts to laugh
: : 104
- blue car drives across frame
The sun is bright
105
,  - Sera is a very good swimmer and we see that Ben must have been quite an athlete
They look at each other under water
They're under water for a long time
Ben exhales
Sera pushes him towards the surface
Ben and Sera come to the surface
Ben has swallowed water and has a coughing fit
Sera hugs him until the fit passes
The camera moves in tighter on them and music gives the moment a strange chill
Don't do that to me
Don't frighten me like that
: 106
- Ben and Sera are watching the  next to the poll
They are sitting in reclining chairs
Inn the distance a coyote howls
Years ago, in ,  turned a trick on Sunset and Western
The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price
He parked his car and  took him to a house that  had an arrangement with
fat Mexican woman was watching a and  told him to give her the twenty for the room
There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room
The room had a bed and a dresser
He lay on his back on the bed and  put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then  eased on to him
About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up
felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and  offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing
When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and
hugged me and kissed me on the cheek
He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car
remember being relieved that  wouldn't have to work again that evening
Last spring  happened to walk past a house that  had once patronized
There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window could see a bare leg
The girl must have been taking a break between customers
It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that  was late for something already  just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and
the reason 'm telling you  this epilogue is that  felt that 'd come full circle
Where was that house
The one in ,  mean
Fifth and Mayflower
You know it
Yes
One of my friends was there
wonder if you ever clipped her
They watch the  in silence for a while
Sera holds his hand
like it here with you
Let's stay for a while
: 107
- Ben mixes a cocktail for himself, then one for Sera
The camera follows him as he goes
108
- - to the side of the pool, where Sera is sunbathing
He lowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling a drop of the drinks, which he puts down on to a glass-topped table
He is pretty loaded
Sera turns over and moves out of his shadow
've missed the best sun
Why did you have to pawn your watch
didn't know 'd ever need it again
Sera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving board
As she takes a position at the end, she pulls the bathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive into the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out near Ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends down and kisses Ben for a long time
Ben responds and kisses back
There is no one else around the pool
The kiss becomes heated and urgent and Sera sits on Ben, making him wet from her
He pushes the top of her suit down and kisses her breasts
She picks up the glass and drinks, letting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts
Ben drinks from her
Take this off
He tries to pull her swimsuit down
Maybe we should go inside
Come on
She stands up, covering herself
Ben stands up, laughing, loses his balance and slips on the wet concrete
He falls backwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on to the glass table
The table goes over and it and the glasses all shatter on the concrete
Ben falls on the broken glass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms
Glass goes into the pool
Blood mingles with the water on the steaming cement
Whoops
Sera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him
She kneels and helps him up, trying to pullout the little bits of glass sticking to him
Ben stands unsteadily
'll go and clean up
Perhaps you could take care of this
He indicates the mess, then walks to their room
Sera begins carefully picking up the broken glass
The desk clerc appears with a broom and a dustpan
- (cheerfully) Everybody
Yes, fine
Don't worry
We'll pay for the chair, and 'll clean all this up, the pool too
- Don't worry
He begins sweeping the broken glass into the pan, cheerfully ignoring Sera
You seem prepared for accidents
- (still smiling) Yeah
we get a lot of screw- ups here
He looks directly at Sera
- Now, you two keep you loud talk and your liquor to your room
Check out first thing tomorrow and after that don't want to see either of you here again
don't need you paying for the chair or cutting your pretty hands on the glass
Let's leave it at that
Nodding firmly, he goes back to the mess, indicating that the conversation is over
- See ya in the morning
: 109
- Sera comes into the room
Ben
She sees that he is already asleep on the bed, his half-naked body covered with countless bits of bloodstained tissue
The image has an almost religious feel to it
The  is on and a sitcom is playing
Something funny catches Sera's attention
She laughs and sits on the bed next to Ben
(voice-over) think we realized that we didn't have long and accepted it
My charm, for him, was that  accepted him exactly as he was and didn't expect him to change
think we both realized that about each other
Ben needed me and liked his drama
loved him
: 110
- We see Las Vegas lighting up
The blue rental car passes through frame and drives towards the town
: : 111
' ,   - Ben wakes from a dream
He is fully clothed and very agitated
Sera
112
- Sera is cooking
'm in here
You probably don't want to hear about it right now, but  bought some plain rice
thought it might be something you could eat
So if you get hungry later on, just let me know
Ben comes in from the kitchen and takes vodka bottles from the fridge
113 scene cut
114 scene cut
115
- Ben's hands are sweating and it's difficult for him to keep hold of the bottle as he drinks
He gets most of it down and then he hunches over the sink and immediately vomits
He takes the second bottle and tries again
: 116
- Still holding the bottle, Ben stands in the shower
He drinks some more and closes his eyes
: 117
- Ben enters, smartly dressed and smiling
think 'm ready for the rice
: 118
- Ben and Sera sitting opposite each other
He has a bowl of rice, which he is pretending to eat in between sips of vodka
She has a bowl of vegetables and rice
She sits, silently for a while, and then puts down her chopsticks
You're pretty sick
Ben looks away
What are you going to do
She folds her arms
want you to go see a doctor
He thinks for a while and then turns to meet her gaze
They look right into each other's eyes
Sera
'm not going to see a doctor
Sera continues to look at him almost defiantly
Maybe it's time  moved to a hotel
And do what
rot away in a room
(becoming angry) We're not going to talk about that
Fuck you
will not talk about that
You're staying here
You are not moving to a hotel
Will you lighten up, please
(close to tears) One thing
one thing
this is one thing you can do for me
've given you gallons of free will here
You can do this for me
She leans right forward
Let's face it
Sick as you are, 'm probably the only thing that's keeping you alive
She stands up have to go to work now
Ben doesn't say anything
He just stares a hole in his bowl of rice
: 119
- Ben walks by himself
He is deep in thought
: 120
- Ben recklessly bets two hundred dollars at the craps table
and wins
As he leans forward to collect his winnings, he sees
: a Blonde in a very low-cut outfit
She smiles at Ben and walks around the table to pick him up
Ben puts all of his winnings on one bet and wins again
This pattern repeats a few times and drinks are on the house
Hey
that was quite a play
You in for the convention
Ben gets to the point
'd like to fuck you
few people hear Ben and the Blonde is almost put off, but he does have about eight thousand dollars in winnings and so she leans in very close so that she can talk quietly
'm very expensive
How much to lick your pussy
The Blonde picks up a sizeable stack of chips and looks at Ben
: 121
'  - Sera lets herself in, looks around and opens the bedroom door
: In one fluid movement the naked blonde gets off the semi- conscious Ben, pulls her dress over her head and walks past Sera
Moments later we hear the front door slam
Ben comes to and looks at Sera
He is more or less unaware of what has just happened
Hello
Her eyes are wet
There are limits
(remembering) Yes
guess  knew that
Ben gets out of the bed
He picks up the bottle on the bedside table and stands
Perhaps  could crash on the couch for a few hours
and then 'll leave
He walks out of the room and closes his the door
Camera moves in on Sera
She covers her face with her hands
She drops her purse and slides down the wall to the floor, weeping quietly
(v
o) heard the door slam a couple of hours later and he was gone
: : 122
- Ben coming out of a liquor store with a large brown bag
: 123
- Sera getting out of a car
The car drives off
Sera examines her face in a pocket mirror
Puts on more lipstick
: 124
- Ben is on all fours in the bathroom trying to vomit
His thin frame is heaving
Bottles everywhere
: 125
- Three college boys with beer bottles walk the The Strip
They are all wearing the same numbered jersey
Nice middle-class boys looking for an adventure
They see Sera and go into a huddle before walking over to her
How much will it cost us to fuck you
The other two College Boys titter
Sera starts to walk away and then hesitates
Sorry, guys, but  don't know what you mean
Anyway, never date more than one guy at a time
Come on
we got money
show her the money
The other College Boy gets out his wallet and opens it to show her
Sera hesitates, not somehow comfortable with the situation, then goes ahead
How much of that money did you guys want to spend
How much you want
How about two hundred for an hour
(becoming annoyed with them) Don't your friends talk
(no answer) Try three-hundred for a half hour
(nervous) Three hundred for the hour
three
and we'll see how it goes
Where are you staying
The Yukon, room twenty-four
'll see you there in fifteen minutes
You can pay me then
Why don't you all take a shower while you're waiting
shower
In fifteen minutes
Look
'll only need one of you at a time
So
the other two can shower while 'm there
They walk off in a huddle, giggling - three small boys
: 126
- Sera drinks from a beer bottle as she approaches their room
She talks to herself
Where are the boys this weekend, Frank
Why, hell, Charlie,  sent 'em off to learn the one thing couldn't teach 'em
She looks at the numbers and finds the room
She knocks and a moment later the Tallest College Boy opens the door in his jockey shorts
127
- Sera steps in
One boy is coming out of the bathroom wearing a towel and the third is sitting in a chair smoking a cigarette, which he passes to the boy in the towel
The other boy is fooling around with a video camera
The atmosphere is weird and Sera is suddenly alert
The Tallest College Boy hands her the money
He is very well built, a football player
Sera hesitates, holding the money
The Tallest College Boy closes the door and then leans against it
They are all staring at her now
No one says anything
Sera smiles suddenly and puts the money in her purse
All business
where's the bedroom, and who's first
They all look at each other
want to fuck her in the butt
He looks at the other
you too, right
Forget that
No one's doing that
You'll all go one at a time
f you want 'll suck you instead, but that's all
Then 'm out of here
(looking at tallest) You said  could fuck her in the butt
Shut up
(shouting) It's my fucking money) That's it
Take your money back
'm leaving
The Smallest College Boy gets off the bed and comes over to Sera
No
don't go
The Tallest Boy is still standing in front of the door and things are getting strange
The Other Boy turns on the video camera
Sera loses her cool
(to the Smallest Boy) Maybe you'd like to fuck one of your friends in the butt instead
The room goes very quiet
The kid tears up
Sera tries to back-pedal
Hey
'm sorry
The kid punches her hard in the stomach, knocking her to the ground
: : Close-up on Sera's face pushed into a bloodstained pillow, her body being pounded from behind
The naked legs of two of the boys behind her
We hear voices, filtered, from a long way off
Go on
fuck her ass
Look at me
look at me
look at me
hand comes into frame and pulls her head up by the hair pair of legs moves in
There is the sound of a punch
: : Sera's body on the floor
In the background trousers being hastily pulled on to legs
The boys exit with sport bags
The last one turns out the lights and closes the door
: 128
- In the half-light Sera gets up and walks with difficulty to the bathroom
129
- She clicks on the mirror light
Her face is awful
One eye is swollen almost shut
Her top lip is cut
: 130
- Sera gets into the cab with considerable difficulty
The cab driver is a cynic
What's the matter, honey, get a back-door delivery you weren't expecting
You gonna be able to pay the fare
Without speaking she takes out a twenty, leans forward and drops it on the front passenger seat
He drives
Looks at her in the mirror
Oh, don't wanna talk to me, unh
Well, don't take it out on me, 'm just covering my ass
What the hell do you expect, stuttin' around like that
dressed like that
You oughta be glad the creep didn't nail ya
: 131
'  - As the cab drives off, Sera walks slowly to the door
Her Landlord's wife passes and takes in her face
: 132
'  - Sera is slumped on the floor of the shower, her arms hugging her legs, the water pounding down on her
: 133
'  - Sera opens the door and we see the Landlord
Behind him, on the sidewalk, we can see his wife
He is embarrassed
Sera, wearing dark glasses
She looks terrible
Her mouth is swollen and some of the bruising around her eye is visible
'm sorry
but we'd like you out by the end of the week
: 134
- Sera gets out of a cab and goes into reception
She is wearing huge dark glasses to hide the black eye and the bruising
: 135
- The desk clerk is wearing a shirt of Ben's that we recognize from an earlier scene
'm sorry, ma'am
He never checked back in
: 136
- Sera walks alone
She's dejected as she looks for Ben
137
- Sera comes to an elevator and waits
She is wearing a thin black top without a bra
Her bruised face makes her suddenly very conspicuous and vulnerable
big man in a white stetson stands next to her
He looks at her and grins
She smiles, coldly
He takes from his pocket two black, hundred dollar chips, places one in each hand and deliberately places each one against her nipples
Other people see this and stop and watch
Sera looks down at his hands and stares until the man becomes uncomfortable
What's the problem, honey
You on strike
And he walks away laughing
: 138
7- - Sera is sitting on a freshly-painted red kerb
She smokes a cigarette and doesn't give a damn that her short skirt is somewhat revealing
Opposite her a bum is sleeping on the pavement
For a moment it looks like Ben
The camera comes in tight on to her face
She looks more lost that we've ever seen her
She drinks coffee from a styrofoam cup
The sun is bright and hot and traffic is noisy
139
'  - Improvised scene
(5) 140
- Sera comes in and the camera follows her as she makes her way to the bar
She has covered up much of the bruising with make-up but it is still pretty obvious
In wide shot we see her strike up a conversation with the man next to her at the bar
- hand comes in to shot and grips her arm firmly
We see that it is a casino security guard
Let go
What's the problem
We don't want you in here, that's the problem
Let's go
And he jerks her arm
People are watching now
Don't worry
If you don't want me in here, then  don't want to be in here
Just let go of my arm and 'll walk out of here
Yeah
we'll both walk out now
He steers her firmly across the floor
: 141 They reach the sidewalk and, without relaxing his grip, he grabs her between the legs with his free hand and says in her ear: Next time it won't be so fucking easy
And he pushes her towards the street and walks back into the Casino
Sera is shocked
She looks around and the group of people who have stopped to watch the event move away
142
'  - Sera is throwing clothes into a suitcase
The phone rings
She thinks about it for a long time and then it stops
She carries on packing and then the phone rings again
She pick it up
Hello
hello
(suddenly alert) Ben
Where the fuck are you
Give me the address
: 143
- The driver is black and friendly
The radio drones quietly  - a religious program
The Rev
Ike is taking listeners' calls
What in the hell happened to you, Miss
Oh
it was an argument
Leave him, Miss
Pretty girl like You could get any man that You wanted
144
'   - The door opens
Ben is naked
His body looks bad
Leaving the door open, he retreats to the bed
145
'   - Sera comes in, closing the door behind her
The shades are drawn and the room is gloomy
Ben has got back into bed
She comes to the bed and sits
Ben
've been looking for You
Have You been here since You left
It smells bad in here
It's so dark
She clicks on the bedside light and is truly shocked by his face
wanted to see you
Oh, Ben
you look so very sick
my love
you're so pale
She goes to the bathroom and returns with a wet face-cloth
She wipes his face
wanted to see you
you're my angel
He sits up painfully and finds a bottle, summoning up some last strength to drink
His entire body shudders as he drains the bottle
He puts it down and focuses on her for the first time
sees her damaged face, touches her face, looks at her questioningly
Something went wrong
'm Ben begins to cry and that sets her off
'm sorry  put us asunder
She shakes her head, unable to speak for the moment
She gets into bed with him, kissing his face
She caresses his whole body, which is shaking, possessed by an uncontrollable fever
See how hard You make me angel
She excites him with her hand, kissing his face gently
When he is about to come, she straddles him and brings him inside
As he comes, he opens his eyes wide and looks at her
You know  love you
yeah
(she comes) Yes
: : Sera is sleeping
sudden gasp wakes her
Ben is having a spasm
Suddenly his body relaxes
He turns his head, opens his eyes wide and looks straight at her
Oh
'm so sorry
He smiles and turns his head away
He is very still
Ben
Ben
Ben
: 146
'   - In the darkened room we can just make out Sera sitting on the bed, looking at the still form of Ben
: 147
- Sera walking
paramedic van goes past with its lights flashing
The soundtrack is empty - silent
We slowly fade in theme music and titles start to roll
