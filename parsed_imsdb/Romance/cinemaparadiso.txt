by Giuseppe Tornatore by Giuseppe Tornatore Shooting Script 1
' '
/ The October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the shadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the city of Giancaldo have been built up
Bright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white walls in an almost blinding reflection
, a woman a little over sixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone
Salvatore, that's right, Salvatore
Di Vita Salvatore But, miss, what do you mean you don't know him
Yes
(She gives a nervous sigh
She has dialed her way through endless numbers but still hasn't managed to speak to Mr
Di Vita
She finally heaves a sigh of relief
) That's right, good for you
Oh
yes
And 'm his mother
'm calling from Sicily
Been trying all day
Ah, he's not there
But would you be so kind as to give me
Yes
(She nods at another woman around forty sitting nearby: it is , her daughter, who jots down the numbers her mother dictates:) Six, five, six, two, two, oh, six
Thanks ever so much
Goodbye
Goodbye
She hangs up, takes the number  has jotted down, determined to have still another try
speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing
Look, Ma
It's useless calling him
He'll be terribly busy, God knows where he is
Besides he might not even remember
Do as  say, forget it
He hasn't been here for thirty years
You know how he is
pauses to think it over
The decision she has to make is important
Then, stubbornly
He'll remember
He'll remember
(She puts on her glasses and starts dialing the number
) 'm positive
know him better than you do
If he were to find out we hadn't told him, he'd be angry
know
(She takes off her glasses
) Hello
Good morning
Could please speak to Mr
Salvatore Di Vita
'm his mother

/ It's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown
Inside a high-powered car, a man  around fifty is driving
It is Dl
Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face creased by deep wrinkles
His weary expression hides the determined, sell-assured manner of the successful self-made man
He must be a heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his cigarette
He stops at a red light
He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the window, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside
rock tune plays full blast on the radio
turns instinctively to have a look at the man at the wheel  a  with a brush cut standing straight in the latest fashion
He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated attention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly
The  sitting beside him, lots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns '5 look, provocatively
The  notices, turns to  in a surly voice: Hey
What the fuck you looking at
Green light
The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake
3 The apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished
There is no one waiting for Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen slumbering in the night
gets undressed on his way to the bedroom
He moves quietly, as if to make no noise
He doesn't even turn on the light, finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window
rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up
Salvatore
But what time is it
She turns on the bedside light
It is , a young woman around thirty
climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a whisper
It's late, Clara
Sorry, but  wasn't able to let you know  wouldn't be corning
(He fondles her, but he is tired, feels like sleeping
) Go to sleep now
Sleep
He turns over on the other side
shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, but whispers
Your mother phoned
She took me for somebody else
(Surprised) And what'd you tell her
played dumb, so as not to disappoint her
We had a nice little talk
She says you never go see her, and when she wants to see you she has to come to Rome
Is it true
doesn't answer
God only knows how often he's heard that question before
She phoned just to say that
She reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow
She said a certain Alfredo had died
And the funeral's taking place tomorrow afternoon
( strange look suddenly comes into ' eyes
The idea of going to sleep has clearly left him
It's a piece of news he didn't expect
That's taken him off-guard would like to carry on the conversation, but sleepiness makes it almost impossible
An she can manage is one last question in a faint little voice:) Who is it
relative of yours
No
Sleep
Go to sleep
She falls asleep in the dead silence of the night
is seized by a sort of chill a deep, troubled feeling
He gazes through the window al the city, with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a heavy curtain of rain
But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the dark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless memories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he thought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to life, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of his face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is formed, an ancient, remote image
4 An image from over forty years before
In the baroque church of Giancaldo
is nine years old
Dressed as an altar boy, he is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands
The congregation is also kneeling
The  is consecrating the Host
Little  has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns and doesn't notice that the  is standing there with the Host in the air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something
Pss
Pssst
finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the withering look of the
He gets the message at once and rings the bell
Now the  can carry on, lifts the chalice and the bell is heard again
Cut to: The service is over
The  is in the sacristy removing his vestments
And  is also there, removing his altar-boy tunic
But how can  make you understand
Without the bell  just can't go on
Always half asleep, you are
What do you do at night anyway
Eat instead of sleep
Father, at my house we don't even eat at noon
That's why 'm always sleepy
That's what the vet says
The  has finished disrobing
He takes the bell was holding during the service and turns to leave
All right, Toto, get moving, 've got things to do
Say hello to your mother
Can
(Interrupting him) And don't ask if you can come
Because you can't
Shoo, shoo, off with you
gives a shrug and leaves
The  goes down a corridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door leading to an outside courtyard
He cuts across it and disappears into another door
5 The  enters a movie house
Not very big  200 seats on the main floor and another seventy in the balcony
Along the walls, posters of films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures
In one corner, a statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers
The   has finished work and is leaving
Up in the balcony, over the last row of seats, are the holes of the projection booth
The middle hole is camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth
there are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be made out, appearing and disappearing
It is , the projectionist
He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough peasant face
He has finished loading the projector and is checking the carbons in the arc lamp
Then he removes the glass from one of the holes and looks down into the theatre, at the  who waves his hand
, Alfredo, you can start
He sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre
Up in the booth,  lights the arc lamp and sets the projector going
Down in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen
String music, sweet and ominous, spreads through the theatre
On the screen appear the credit titles of an American film of the 1940s
The screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on the arm of his seat
At the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves, opens a crack and ' gaunt little face appears
He has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a word, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen
The credit titles have long come and gone
The story is at a turning-point
Up above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion, watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the , who is now drumming the bell with his fingers
On the screen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in close-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic
, carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen
The love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss
Instinctively, the raises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud ring
Up in the booth  hears the bell; it's the signal he's been waiting for
He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that specific scene as it winds on to the reel
The projection continues
And also the kiss of the two actors
The ' nervous look lingers on those black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last declaration of love before separating
is wide-eyed, he's probably never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin
The screen is now filled with the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders
stares in open-mouthed wonder
The , in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth
From the sound of the bell to another sound
6 The tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the square
It is noon
The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people noisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water
Peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries
People come and go in front of the town hall
The working men's club is deserted
The entrance of the Cinema Paradiso is shut
Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been seen on screen
Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open
The hum of the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of ' '
Then dead silence
The showing is over
7 Despite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel, created by the slips of paper  has inserted into the loops
He is rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder
When he's not talking,  usually sings to himself
stands beside him, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his (Harshly, shouting) You must not come here
How many times do  have to tell you
(And he slows down the reels with his hand
The slips of paper are about to arrive
Here's the first
) If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame
whoosh
And turn into a piece of
(Overlapping him) and turn into a piece of charcoal
He's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention
Not even his grim look scares him
Anyway,  catches the joke, starts to give him a slap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors
(Angrily) Christ, that's a sassy little tongue you've got
Watch out, or someday 'll snip it off
And he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the handle
picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look
He sees a series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman
Can  have it
snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string
He shouts
No
Are you deaf or something
've got to put this back in when we wind up the film again
You're a real pain in the neck
reaches into a basket full of strips of film
He takes out a handful: all kisses that have been cut
Then why didn't you put these back when you wound up the films again
is caught out
He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck in and cuts the scene: 'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so
well, actually
they stay here
(Finding an excuse) Besides, there are more kisses than you can count
(Excited) So  can have these
( explodes, flies off the handle
He grabs by the shoulders and shakes him
) Look, Toto
Before  kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal
These strips here are yours,  give them to you
However
One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more
Two  'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose
Oh
And now scram
He takes him and turns him towards the stairs
For him the matter is closed
He returns to the film-winder
sneaks back and while 's attention is elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, stuffs them into his pocket and
What sort of deal is this
The strips are mine
So why can't  come see them
And he stares at  with a sly, saucy look
clutches his hand, darts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass
He shrieks: Get out
And don't show your face here again
And before the kick reaches its destination,  has already dashed off down the spiral staircase
8
' That was not the first theft of film strips
's hand reaches into a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film
He takes out a few frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp
Gazes at the figures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a whisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the musical climaxes
Bang
Bang
Bang
Shoot first, think later
This is no job for weaklings
Treacherous dog
The house has no lights, is gloomy and cold
's mother, , is leaning on the table in front of him
She is young, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by all the sacrifices
She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress
, his four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner
The kerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on the wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs
's voice changes, turns even tougher
Hey there, you lousy bastard, take your hands off that gold, You black- hearted pig, stay away from me, or 'll smash your face in
'Ntantatah
(In the heap of movie frames there are also several photographs
picks them up
Family keepsakes
man in an army uniform
Then the same man with a girl beside him whose smiling face can be recognized as takes a closer look at the man's face, then whispers to his mother:) Ma, if the war's over, how come Daddy's never come back
looks up at him with a sweet smile
He'll be back, he'll be back
You'll see
One of these days
But there is not much conviction written on her face
She looks back down at her sewing
goes on looking at the photos
don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia
It takes years to get there
And years to come back
Now go to bed, Toto, it's late
puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box under 's cot near the charcoal burner
9 noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue bows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm trees
The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one
The Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter
Here and there, parents and relatives accompany the younger ones
Beneath one of the palms,  pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the khaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it on, as one of his schoolmates passes by
It is , and he's crying desperately because he doesn't want to go to school
His  drags him along, yelling: ' You can fool your mother but not me
Get yourself a damn diploma and become a policeman
You good-for- nothing
don't want to go to school' (The sound of the bell
The black lines move up the steps towards the school
) 1O is sitting at the front-row desk next to , a little freckle-faced boy
His attention, like that of the whole class, is concentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard
The  is standing there, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure multiplication  it is  , known as ''
He is red in the face, has one purple ear and one white one
He stares in terror at that '255 x 15' written on the blackboard
The  yells, waving a birch rod in her hand
Well then
Five times five equals
stops to think a moment, then
Thirty
The  grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers on the blackboard
large thud echoes through the room, followed by a roar of laughter
The  slams her rod on the desk
Silence
(Then to ) The five times table
Dunce
One times five, five
(The class repeats with the , in a sing- song chorus:) and Two times five, ten
Three times five, fifteen
Four times five, twenty
(With a wave of the rod, the  silences the class, and finishes the sing-song with the fateful question
) Five times five
(Timidly) Forty
Another blow of the head on the blackboard
Hubbub
Slapping of the rod on the desk
secretly shows the picture of a Christmas tree on one page of the book, and mouths the word 'twenty-five'
smiles, he has finally caught on
'm asking you for the last time, blockhead
Five times five equals
( turns to her with smiling eyes and answers blissfully:) Christmas
clutches his head in anger, watches the flogging  on the back with the rod
screams at every blow, and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder
stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically
But he is not thinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling, but is drawn, rather, by that strange regular beat, finds it similar to another regular beat, that of
11 the rolling pin  uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just been unloaded
carefully watches  5 every move
He is not in the projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of seats
He peers through the hole next to the lion's head
His bright little eyes fix in his mind the things  does, as he loads the film into the projector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the carbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre and finds himself face to face with
(Sternly) What are you doing here
bought a ticket
've come to see the film
(Meanwhile the  comes up behind him and grabs him by the collar, and he almost jumps out of his skin
laughs
) (Yelling) Go sit downstairs
You good-for- nothing sponger
(To the audience) Worse than rabbits they are
has run downstairs
The main floor is more crowded than the balcony, like every Sunday, and there is a greatdin
The selling ice-cream, soda pop and candy shouts and runs around like a chicken with its head off
Now the lights dim, the hubbub dies down and the performance starts
Before the film there is a preview for Stagecoach
The screen fills with images ofJohn Wayne, the pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile Indians etc
is sitting in the front rows, right under the screen, next to , , ,  and  , all with their noses in the air
, the biggest show off of the group, is smoking a cigarette
An appears through the entrance curtain, takes a couple of steps and shouts:) Hello, everybody
(At once) Ssssssh
Ssssssh
Silence
Can't  say hello
It's a double-feature today
couldn't care less
come here to sleep
All at once, a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre
Up on the screen, a globe of the world appears, spinning among the stars, the logo announcing the newsreel
(Hooting and whistling) For Christ's sake
Cut it, Alfredoooo
The  in the front rows also yell, but  goes on being alert
He turns and looks up at the holes of the projection booth, as if it were an impregnable fortress
He watches the crazy dancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a cone
And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome, emphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies
In his dreamy eyes, that lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar
has a frightened look
Another lion roaring
But up on the screen
The  lion
The throng of children imitate the famous growl all together, shaking their heads in unison
Grrrr
Grrrrr
The film starts: it is Visconti's La terra trema
is in bliss
His wide eyes looking up at the magic square of light
The title music
Another enters at the back of the theatre, but before sitting down, says hello in a loud voice
Greetings to one and all
' Drop dead
Silence
Hey, kids, we're here to see the film
Now there is an important sequence
The audience is silent
Concentrated on the screen
passes the lighted cigarette to
He takes a puff and hands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen
The beautiful star of the film appears on screen
different kind of attention takes hold of the excited audience
and the others stare at her with open mouths
She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their profiles touch
But all at once, just at the best part, there is a sudden jolt
The kiss isn't seen
(Disappointed) Ahhh
What a shame
've been going to the movies for twenty years and never saw a kiss
is the only one to laugh to himself
He knows what has happened
And when will we see one
Up in the balcony, the audience is more sedate
The tickets cost more and the people are richer, more refined
Among them, a  with a moustache, the look of a public notary, is sitting right in front of the railing
Seriously, without batting an eye, he spits down below with contempt
Right on the dot, a voice is heard, followed by a chorus of protests
and Bugger
Ssssh
Silence
12 The bell-tower rings midnight
The square is nearly deserted
Except for a landowner near the refreshment stand, with a moustache and a hat,   by name, who is picking out from a group of labourers the men he'll be needing in the country at dawn
He chooses, points his finger, calls
People come out of the movie house after the last showing
The  locks the front door as  climbs down from the projection booth
Among the crowd there is only one kid,
Tired, half-asleep
He's seen all the showings
He starts to walk away when he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner, wrapped in an old coat
She's waiting for him, in a temper
drops his eyes to the ground, mortified
He knows what's coming
He goes over to her timidly, uncertain, gives her a questioning look
've been looking for you all day
Did you buy the milk
No
Then where's the money
Somebody stole it
gives him a slap
holds back the sobs, but his eyes brim with tears
and the  are nearby, have heard everything
What'd you do with the money
Go to the movies
nods his head and the sobs increase
, in despair, flies off the handle, slaps him again, but looks as if she doesn't really want to, as if deep down she forgives her son's escapade
catches on, speaks up on behalf of Signora Maria, don't do that
He's just a kid
(To ) And why are you telling fibs
(To ) We let him in free
He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre
( stares at him in amazement, goes on listening to him
) How much did you have
Fifty lire
( wipes away his tears
) (To the ) What you find tonight on the floor between the seats
(The  reaches into- his pockets, pulls out some odds and ends
) comb, two heel-savers, a box of tobacco
( very skillfully reaches out with fifty lire he has taken from his pocket
And like a magician he draws the money out of the ' hand
) and fifty lire
(To ) See
(He hands over the money under the ' astonished eyes
) Thanks, Uncle Alfredo
Thanks
Good- night
She walks away, dragging  by the hand gives him a wink
smiles and winks back, but he's not very good at it; he can't manage to shut only one eye
Everybody leaves and the square empties, as the comes up to the group of labourers, beside  , motioning them all to get moving
It's midnight
've got to shut down the square
Go away
The square's mine
The square's mine
13 , dressed as an altar boy, walks alongside the who is wearing the ceremonial vestments
They are tired, have walked a long way
Behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little white coffin and a bunch of flowers
Behind that a little procession  the parents and relatives of the dead child
The road is very wide, covered with white earth
The spring sun is dazzling
The funeral procession kicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a dream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea
The procession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery
, working in the fields, takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by
Cut to: The funeral is over
The  and  are walking back to the village
appears out of the countryside on e bicycle with a hoe and other farm tools in the basket
He comes pedaling up beside them
Good morning, father
It's hard on the feet, huh
(Breathless) Yeah
Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you
But coming back
The saints stand there watching you, that's all
God's will be done
is about to open his mouth, wants to say something to , but he doesn't have time
pedals harder and rides off
is crestfallen
He looks et the , then at the bicycle riding away
His eyes light up  an idea
He suddenly yells: Ouch
Ouch
My foot
can't walk
He limps
Throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him
The leans over in alarm
Up ahead in the distance,  turns around to look
Cut to: There is a smile on ' face
He is riding on the crossbar of 's bicycle
On their way back lo the village
Alfredo, did you know my father
Of course  knew your father
He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine
Always smiling
He looked like Clark Gable
There's something  wants to talk about, but he doesn't know how to start
He has a try with an innocent stratagem
Alfredo, now that 'm older, 'm not saying  can start coming to the projection booth, to the movie house
But
maybe, why don't we become friends
knows exactly what the little rascal is up to, and answers in a strange, theatrical tone, as if he were repeating something he knows by heart, a remark taken from some old film
' choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains
' (Laughs) You're too smart to be my friend
Besides, as  always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends
(Surprised) But you don't have any kids
(Spluttering) All right, all right
When 've got kids that's what 'm telling them
(The outlying houses of Giancaldo finally heave into sight
) 14 , ' kid sister, is crying outside the front door, terror stricken
Her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half scorched and soaking wet
is distraught, damp with sweat, and tries to console her, hugging her in her arms
Stop crying
The fire is out
'm here
That'll do, that'll do
( and come up behind them
has barely leapt off the bicycle when his mother sails into him like a fury, shrieking:) Miserable boy
You're the ruin of me
Your sister would have been burnt alive if  hadn't been there
And all your fault
darts off, chased by his mother, swift as a deer
doesn't understand what has happened, leans over , who goes on bawling her eyes out, and sees on the ground, in the middle of the water, a flowery box all charred and still smoking, and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and several singed photographs, the photos of  s father
gets the message now, looks up at , who has caught  and is dragging him home, hitting and slapping him all the way
covers his head with his hands to stave off the blows
turns to , in a stern, indignant voice
But aren't you ashamed of yourself, Uncle Alfredo, playing with a little boy at your age
(Cowed) But
what's it got to do with me
And who gave him all those films
Promise you won't give him any more of this trash
Don't let him set foot any more in the movie house
The boy's crazy
Crazy
All he talks about is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo and movies
is crestfallen, didn't think that ' craziness, his morbid passion for movies, could go this far
give you my word, Donna Maria
( now turns one last time to her son
) God's got to grant me one wish
Send your father back home
And he'll see you get what's coming to you
( lowers his hands, looks at her and with the dreadful sincerity of children:) Daddy's not coming back
He's dead
(An icy flash runs through ' eyes
) It's not true
No
It's not true
'll show you he's coming back
And she beats him desperately, as if to enforce her stubborn hope, slap after slap
This time  doesn't step in, lets  give vent to her rage and fury, but ' cries make him feel guilty
15:
/ Another Sunday
crowd of men has gathered in the square around the cafe where there is a loudspeaker
They are listening to the running commentary of the soccer games
They check their Sisal pools coupons
' We're at the seventh minute of the second half
Turin is leading one to zero
The goal was scored by
(The scene is seen from above, by  who peers out of the window of the projection booth
' voice drowns out the soundtrack of the film being shown
is bored
He goes over to the projector, looks through the hole
It's the last sequence of the film
The music swells to a climax as ' ' appears on the screen
Swift as ever, turns on the lights in the theatre' stops the projector
Looks back through the hole, to see
) 16:
/ the house packed to the rafters
Voices and laughter of the children
Smoke, ice-cream, soft drinks
The  has opened the emergency exits to let in air
He fights off the gate-crashers who are trying to get in free
The sound of the sports commentary fills the theatre
The village  is sleeping in his seat, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open
The  blow up the empty ice-cream sacks and pop them next to his ears
Bang
The  wakes up with a start, in a sea of laughter
He yells: Ah
'll wring all your necks
Or my good name means nothing
Lousy brats
doesn't laugh
He is sad
He turns and looks up at the projection booth
He sees  through the lion's mouth
also catches sight of him
gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come up a moment
The look on ' face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0
' not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over
Yet there must be some way
But what is it
As usual,  is smart as the devil when he's out to get something
Through the emergency exit he sees a woman pass by with a packet in her hand
It is 's , and the packet is his supper
leaps to his feet and runs out to her
Signora Anna

/ starts up the projector
It's time for the documentaries and cartoons
peers in from the top of the stairs
He's scared of ' reaction, but pricks up his courage and shows him the packet
sees him, is about to pounce on him
(On the defensive) Your wife told me to bring you this
His expression betrays the 'put on'
sighs, realizes it's another one of his little games
(Sternly) Give it to me
He takes the packet, unwraps it and lifts the lid, shuts it again and puts the container inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm
hasn't missed a single gesture, but speaks with his eyes to the poor
told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films
That it wasn't your fault
But  thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me
Now that  know,  won't steal any more from you
That's all wanted to say
'm going
(He turns to leave but takes him by the shoulder and stops him
) Toto, come here
All things considered, there is something in that little boy, maybe his feverish passion, that strikes him
He'll talk to him seriously, without resorting to terrorism, try to convince him
He lowers the volume of the monitor, sits down on the stool
raises his eyes from the floor and looks at him at last
Now listen to what 've got to say took up this profession when was ten years old
In those days there weren't these modern machines
The films were silent
The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank
And you wound the crank all day long
It was really rough going
If you got tired and slowed down' boom
Everything would go up in flames
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too
Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier
(Firmly) Because  don't want to, Toto
This is not a job for you
It's like being a slave
You're always alone
You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do
And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut
You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter
Only on Good Friday are you free
But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross
You'd work Good Fridays too
Then why don't you change jobs
( sighs, irritated
He reaches out to turn the knob of the carbon rods
He gazes at  as if he were a grown-up, somebody who's making things hard for him
) Because 'm an idiot
How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist
None
Only a jerk like me could do it
Besides  wasn't lucky
When  was a kid there was the war
When  grew up, another war
Now it's all different
Times have changed
And you want to be a dope like me
Huh
Answer me
No
Good for you, Toto
Good for you
'm only saying this for your own good
(He gets up and, speaking all the while, goes into a closet with a bucket in it, the toilet of the booth
He turns his back and pees
) Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter
You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing
( listens to him, but taking advantage of the fact he can't be seen, he turns the knob of the carbon rods, just as he had seen done a moment before
) (In a loud voice) But don't you like anything about what you do
( gazes at the photos on the wall: Keaton, Garbo, Snow White smiles to himself
Sure, there's something about that damn job he likes:) With time
you get used to it
Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun
Then you're happy too
( is lost in thought, doesn't notice that the documentaries and cartoons have finished
The screen is blank
And down in the theatre laughter is not heard but an uproar of whistling and swearing
' eyes sparkle, he seizes the opportunity
He turns on the lights and stops the projector, just as would have done
At which buttons up his pants in a hurry and rushes over alarmed, but sees that everything is in order
looks at him all smiles, as if he expected a medal for civil bravery
Instead, reacts like a wild animal
) So 've been wasting my breath
You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want
(He gives  a kick in the ass, shrieking:) Get out of here
don't want to lay eyes on you again
This is the last straw
Your mother's right, you're crazy
(He pushes him towards the stairs
suddenly vanishes, scared out of his wits
talks to himself, in a fury:) But how'd he do it
The little bastard
By watching, he's learned
It's incredible
(He peers out of the window, yelling, as he sees running through the square
) 'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre
There are no more tickets for you
And 'm also talking to Father Adelfio
You won't be an altar boy any more either
You little runt
( looks at him
Hates him
Yells something offensive:) Alfredo, go fuck yourself
(But his words are drowned out by the sudden shouting of the people outside the cafe
) Goal
Holy Mother of God
(  in the crowd crumples to the ground
The others swarm around him, alarmed
They hold up his head
His face is pale
They check the coupon he is clutching in his hand
voice rises like a siren from the crowd
) Ciccio Spaccafico's won the Sisal
(The yell can be heard
) I8 inside the movie house
The audience murmurs
Somebody opens an emergency exit
' The Neapolitan's won the lottery
Let's go see, kids
Northerners are always lucky
(The whole audience leaps up and heads for the exit
Pushing
Shouting
Laughing and Joking
) 19 Summer has come
The village has a different look
The peddlers sing their monotonous refrains in the village streets
In one street, women are busy canning tomatoes
In one corner of the square, the  has finished clipping the donkey and is now shaving the hair of a row of bare-chested  with nothing on but their underwear
Then another  disinfects them by spraying them with the hand pumps used to spray trees in the country
The laugh
The - is hanging up the posters of a new film, ' 20 The fifth-grade exams
In the vast dining hall all the children are seated, one for each desk, under the watchful eyes of the teachers
, , ,  and  have taken places here and there, as nervous as everybody else
The    is dictating the text of the arithmetic problem
merchant owns two stores
In the first he sells fruit and vegetables
In the second he sells nails and cement
(The  comes in, interrupts the dictation
) Excuse me, professor
Here are the men taking the exam for the elementary school certificate
(Turning to the door) Come in, please
(All the children turn to look
around thirty enters, ill at ease
The children recognize him and laugh mischievously
The second is the , the one who falls asleep at the movies
The third is a twenty-year-old-boy, The fourth is , embarrassed and red in the face is speechless
Gives a slightly ironic laugh
There is a look of revenge in his shrewd little eyes
) Cut to: The assignment is now being carried out
There is dead silence in the hall
and the  moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes being handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'
The four outsiders are having a hard time
It can be seen on their faces
is also in trouble, doesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult
He looks at the desk next to him, where  is sitting
is about to look up at him, but  immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be seen
The exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical meanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly
can't stand it any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat
He's sorry he ever showed up
laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand
tries sneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something
But turns his back, hiding it from sight
tries sneaking a look at somebody else's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it
It looks like a conspiracy against him
has no way out
He has to accept the idea of eating humble pie
He looks at , motions him with his eyes in a conversation of glances
He asks for help, but  stands firm, implacable
tries to put it into words in a low voice
jerk
Tell me how to solve this fucking problem
Ssssh
Silence back there
insists with his eyes
makes him understand with gestures that he could help him maybe, but
on one condition
He imitates the gesture of winding the crank of the projector
gets the message
It's pure blackmail
He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the ceiling as if he were swearing
Then he surrenders, accepts the condition
is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy
He takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the problem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the  passes by, takes aim and flicks it to him
' hand catches the precious and dearly bought message in mid-air
Their quarrel is over
2I
/ bright, lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick, blurred images, as in a dance, the images of  teaching  all the secrets of the projectionist trade
slips the reel on to the projector, unrolls the trailer and hands it to
mounts the film on the sprockets
Now  sets the projector into motion, opens the shutter and stands on tip-toe to see the screen from the hole
shot from In nome della legge
The main-floor audience applauds a line spoken by Massimo Gironi
And from the balcony, the same little with the face of a public notary spits below
Bastard
Pencil-pusher
shows  the running of the film
He points to a place on the projector
Pay attention
This is where it can easily catch fire
If it happens, the first thing you've got to do is break it off, here and here, so the whole reel doesn't go up in fames
On the screen, a shot from Riso amaro
kiss
Unrelenting, the  rings his bell
licks the film on one side, then on the other
He laughs
You understand which side the gelatin's on
It tastes wonderful
shot of Amedeo Nazzari in La figlia del capitano
jump, an out-of-rack frame
The audience whistles
Fraaaame
Wake up, Alfredo
( tries to do a hand-binding winds the film, hangs a slip on a nail in the wall
) These are the shipping invoices for the film
They are always to be kept
You see
, Alfredo
Down on the main floor, a scene from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
Everyone screams and hides their faces when Hyde looks at the camera
Holy Mother
What a face
So ugly
One young man, , doesn't hide his face
He looks up at a young woman, , in the balcony, who turns and smiles at him
gives  a wooden stool
He's had it made especially for him, so he can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp
climbs up on it
He laughs, all excited
Now you can run it by yourself
gives another smile
He is posing in a photographer's studio
He is all dressed up for first communion, holding a white lily
The flash goes off like lightning during a storm
Now  is posing next to his mother and little sister
They smile without hugging
Another flash of light
Click
22 Another click
The transparency of Rita Hayworth in her black gown from Gilda
is pasting it inside a minute pair of plastic field glasses
Other pupils crowd around him in excitement
(In a whisper) Christ, what a piece of ass
But there is not a cheerful atmosphere in the class - on the contrary, a strange silence
The pupils are all standing around the teacher's desk, having received their end-of-the-year report cards
, who shared  s desk, is saying goodbye to his schoolmates
, , the others
They have serious, sad expressions
He and  kiss like grown-ups
The is standing among them
One of the schoolmates does not respond lo 's goodbye gesture
He takes a few steps back, serious, scared, his eyes lowered
Di Francesco, aren't you saying goodbye to your schoolmate
(  gives his head a little shake
The leans over to him
) But why
(  whispers, almost into her ear
) My father says he's a Communist
23     ,
/ Another farewell scene in the square
to his grandparents
His father and mother are also there, saying goodbye to the old folks
There are tears
The cardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the black car
The scene is watched by  and , up in the window of the projection booth
They look like old friends
On the sound monitor, the strains of some American musical comedy tune
Will they really find work in Germany
Who knows
It's like an adventure
(In a theatrical voice) Hope springs eternal
( from the distance gives one last wave at the window of the projection booth
waves back
) Peppinoooo
Come back sooon
(The black car drives off, leaving a cloud of dust that envelops the suppressed sobs of the grandparents standing there waving handkerchiefs watches the car drive off
He mumbles:) Good thing Germany's closer than Russia
rubs his hand through his hair
24 The lion's head with the beam of light, seen from the balcony
' face appears in the hole beside it, as he peers down at the images of the Settimana Incom newsreel
The audience is distracted
The snoring of a man sleeping can be heard
pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands, tip-toe down the aisle
The sleeping man is the same old , with his head thrown back
little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth
The  take to their heels
The  squirms, wake up with a start
Spits, while everybody laughs
The newsreel is now about missing soldiers in Russia
The Defense Minister has announced a new listof names of Italian soldiers, so far considered missing and now confirmed as dead
Families concerned will be notified directly by military authorities
pays careful attention, sees the black-and-white shots of the last war
The Russian campaign
The troops in the snow
Now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the corpses
Documents, clothing, glasses, photographs
One quick detail catches 's eye  among those photographs, for one instant he sees one he thinks he recognizes
He quickly sticks a slip of paper into the take-up reel, as when marking the kisses to be cut
25 The hands of an  tear off several forms and give them to who is sitting in front of the desk
She is dressed in black
stands beside her, holding her hand
They have black bands on their arms
An empty stare in their eyes
is pale, a cold look in her sunken eyes
Her heart is bursting in her breast
And a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking
She looks at her husband's belongings, identifies them  a gold chain, an card and the photograph, the one  saw in the newsreel
strokes it with her fingers
comes up and looks, as the  concludes: Unfortunately we don't know what war cemetery he's buried in
This is the form for the pension
If you'd like to sign it
26 walks through the city
She holds  by the hand
looks up, trying to catch her eye
He sees her crying, in silence
The heartbroken tears of someone who has lost the one last hope, but held back, so as not to be seen by the child
presses close and puts his arm around her waist
They turn the corner, and walk off in the noisy city, disfigured by the ruins of war
poster for Gone with the Wind catches 's eye
He smiles

/ Winter has returned
On the screen, a sequence from  pompieri di Viggiu
The theatre is jam full
The sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes of Toto
Some people have climbed up on the window-sills
The aisles are crammed, an the way down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their noses in the air
Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from home
Almost everybody is smoking
woman laughs, holding the baby she is nursing
In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people standing, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of deep pleasure
Her body moves slightly
Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat
They are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and goes on laughing
In the balcony  is holding hands with
The curtain over the entrance is open
People are also standing there, seeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen through the forest of heads
But the line continues on outside
All the way to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square
There are crowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk provoking incidents
The , Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to calm them down
Don't shove
There's no room
For heaven's sake
can't give another showing, it's late
Father Adelfio, we've been here for an hour
There are people inside who've seen it twice
Move on
Ouch
My foot
It has just stopped raining, the bell-tower rings eleven o'clock
On the poster of the film a '  ' sticker
The , the -, the  and   push the crowd back, close the front door
The protest grows louder
Fists pound the door
Open up
Father Adelfio
(The audience in the theatre hears the uproar
Reacts:) Ssssh
Sssssh
Be quiet out there
What the hell
(From the window of the projection booth, and  look at the crowd down below, yelling and complaining
Some of the people look up at them
) Alfredooo
We want to get in
Tomorrow you're taking it off
( spreads his arms out as if to say there s nothing he can do
) Why can't we show the same film tomorrow
It's got to be sent to another town
And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off
Too bad
The crowd sways nervously
The  give order
(Exasperated) Stop
Go home, all of you
Otherwise somebody's going to end up in jail
' That's enough
(Dramatically) 'Joe
mob doesn't think, doesn't know what it's doing
' ( gives him a curious, inquisitive look
smiles
) Spencer Tracy said it in Fury
(Mischievously) What'd you say if we let these poor devils see the film, Toto
( stares at him in amazement, all excited
) Wonderful
But how can it be done
turns away from the window
He gives a smirk, imitates the tough American movie stars
You don't believe my words, but you'll have to believe your own eyes
And now get your ass off that damn stool, boy
laughs, eagerly, as if he were about to see a whole new movie
He climbs off the stool
Both of them move towards the projector
28
/ Trying not to put his hand in front of the lens,  removes the frame with the glass that protects the projection
He wheels it around and motions  to look
On the wall behind the projector: the film picture appears gradually, reflected by the glass, moves as the glass moves all the way over to the window looking out over the square
There it disappears
can barely believe his eyes, as if it were a piece of magic
He takes a quick look through the hole to see if the film is still showing on the screen
It is
(Mysteriously) Go to the window, boy, and have a look
goes over to the window
Looks out
The reflected beam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the square
It's like another screen
Except the images are backwards, like when you look in a mirror
And here and there are the windows of the houses
For , it's a wonderful spectacle, like a dream, ravishing
Alfredo, it's beautiful
( voice is heard in the crowd of people jammed around the entrance to the movie house
) (Shouting) Hey, look there
The movie
(All heeds turn to look at the house behind them
) Oh, praise the Lord
It's true
Look
The movie
There's Toto
Hurry
Hurry
, ALFRED0000
And everybody runs over to the other side of the square, in front of the strange new screen
and  watch with glittering eyes
lays his hand on the shoulder of his great pal
Good for you, Alfredo
close-up of Toto projected on the houses, and one of the windows opens appears, in his pajamas
Dazzled by the light, he shades his eyes with his hand
He sees all those people looking at him and laughing together
Shut the window
Shut the window
Go to bed
The  is dazed
Doesn't now what's going on
Looks around, and sees the black-and-white figures of the film dancing around him
He pops back inside, slams the window shut, almost cared
(To ) Sound
Sound
Alfredooooo
What do you say, should we make them happy
(Smiling) Sure, sure
takes the loudspeaker of the monitor, rings it over to the window, turns it around towards the square
He turns up he volume and the sound-track fills the square
chorus of approval
Aaaaaaaa
At last
(Looking at ) Do you want to go down there
( gives a contented nod
) Go on
runs on
looks wistfully towards the huge image in the square
Down in the square  heads for the crowd, his eyes trained on the house-front screen
Behind him, the door of the movie house opens
The , Father Adelfio, sees the film being projected on the house front, the people standing or sitting on the ground, laughing
His eyes nearly pop out of his head
Then he motions over the -, whispers something into his ear
The - strides over to the shivering spectators, pulls the pad of tickets out of his pocket
- Ladies and gentlemen
You have to buy tickets
Reduced rate
An irresistible chorus of Bronx cheers washes over him
looks around, highly amused
Fuck off
The square belongs to everybody
(The   peers Out Of the crowd, all worked up
) No
The square's mine
Come on, kids, no joking around here
Otherwise
The crowd roars with laughter
laughs too, as if carried away by it all
And over the general merriment looms the shadow of , standing in the window of the projection booth
All at once, on the house-front screen, the image of Toto slows down for an instant, a white blister appears and spreads until it fills the whole screen
The crowd gives a start of bewilderment and fear
jerks his head around to look at the booth
29 The film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the projector
is taken off-guard
He breaks the film running into the take- up reel, but is unable to do it for the delivery reel
He grabs the film which is catching fire and pulls it out quickly, tries to stop the flames from reaching the reel in the f reproof housing
desperate race against the speed of the fire
The flames on the floor burn his legs
gives a jump, slows down the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run ahead, reach the upper housing
It's like an explosion
The flames leap out, striking him full in the face
doesn't have time to scream, struggles desperately and falls to the floor
Meanwhile the flames envelop everything
30 The flash of the flames flares up in the windows of the projection booth
is appalled, elbows his way through the moving crowd
Inside the movie house the murmuring of the audience can be heard, growing louder and louder
scream
3I: violent spurt of flames leaps out of the mouth of the plaster lion's head, into the darkness broken by the screams of people rushing for the exits
32 The crowd streaks out of the movie house, enveloped in a cloud of black smoke
Heeeelp
Run for your lives
In the general panic,  tries in vain to get inside, elbows his way towards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth
The audience clashes against him, knocks him to the ground, almost trampling him underfoot
He is suddenly seized by a superhuman force; gets up, claws his way desperately ahead, with people falling on top of him and to the floor
He finally succeeds, starts up the stairs
33 The place is filled with smoke
The air is suffocating
streaks up the stairs, gasping for breath
The projection booth is enveloped inflames
's body on the floor, burning
moves quickly, throws a blanket over his shoulders, drags him by the feet over to the stairs, as boxes and other objects fall on him
Using the same blanket, he stamps out the flames that have seared ' clothes
With the force of desperation, he drags him further down the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames
doesn't move, his face is burnt
looks at him and only now is panic-stricken, lets out a terrified shriek, like a wounded colt
Alfredo
Heeeelp
Help
34 The plaster lion looks like a dragon spitting fire and smoke
The statue of the Virgin Mary is also in flames
And the movie screen
35 The fire has been put out
Nothing remains of the movie house but the skeleton
Everything has gone up in smoke
People stand around, dismayed
They gather around the , who is at once grieved and shocked, to express their solidarity and comfort
What a pity
Poor Alfredo
What a terrible thing
Cheer up, Father, is there something we can do
' (Laughing) Burnt up
Burnt up
What'll we do now
The town will have to get along without movies
Who's got the money to rebuild it
, the man who won the Sisal pools, comes up, dressed in style
He looks up at the charred cinema
It looks like a battlefield after an enemy attack
From the smoke and ashes to
36 The great lighted sign of the
The movie house has been rebuilt
New facade
New billboards
There are people moving about the entrance
It is the evening of the inauguration
37 The lobby is crowded with people, authorities, special guests
There is the ,   and the new owner,  , dressed to the teeth
The  cuts the ribbon
Flashbulbs pop
Clapping
Cheers' Congratulations, Don Ciccio
The procession advances towards the stairs leading into the theatre , with a nostalgic sigh, blesses the lobby, then the corridor
Lastly, the new auditorium, which resounds with toasts and cheers
To the Cinema Paradiso
The  sprinkles the new seats, the walls, the screen with holy water
38 Now   is blessing the brand-new projection booth
He also blesses the new projectionist:
He is very nervous, but serious, self- possessed
His worried-looking mother is also there for the occasion
The turns to
How'd you solve his being under age
took out a license as projectionist, thanks to friends down at the guild offices
But  don't know a thing about it
Officially, do the job
(Smiling at Salvatore) but Toto earns the money
Fine
(To ) Always be careful, my boy
Don't ever go to sleep
Be sure another accident doesn't happen
Do everything poor Alfredo taught you
And may God bless you
nods his head seriously, assuming a responsible expression
His mother kisses the 's hand
Thanks, Father
Thanks
And now enough of this gloomy atmosphere
Life goes on
want to see you happy and smiling
39 Laughter
The laughter of the large audience at the first showing of the inauguration film
Among the spectators, ' mother, , and his kid sister, El
Up on the screen, a man and a woman kiss
The first time a kiss has been seen at the Cinema Paradiso
The audience murmurs, surprised and excited
Ooooooh
They're kissing
Look at that
Christ, that's news
An   sitting next to the , crosses herself, flabbergasted chuckles
Rubs his hands: these are going to be golden times for him
gets up and stalks out of the theatre, indignant; he'll never set foot in the place again
The love theme gets louder and louder
40 The same music spreads through the booth from the monitor
is by himself
He is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough, the story doesn't absorb him
' absence makes him nervous, he gazes at the stool he used to sit on
Il has been repainted
voice from the rear of the cabin: ' Toto
turns and at the top of the stairs sees and behind her, , her husband
He is wearing a pair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane
He has lost his sight, but not his spirit
He smiles: Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso
( runs over and embraces him
) Come in, Alfredo
(to ) Toto, will you bring him home when you close down
Yes
Signora Anna
(To ) 'm glad you came
Cut to: is now sitting there immobile
He listens to the soundtrack of the film
studies the way he stares into empty space, and the idea of darkness frightens him
There is something new in ' manner, as if having grazed death and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men and life
How's school
But now that 've got a job, '11 probably stop going
Don't do that
Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed
Why
What do you mean
Toto, this isn't for you
For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso
But it won't last
Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things
(He reaches out and touches ' face to 'feel' his expression
) That's right, more important
know it
Now that 've lost my sight  see more
see everything  didn't see before
(As  moves his hand from 's face, we see that he is now a young man, and that  is older, grayer
) And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life
And 'll never forget it
( doesn't understand his strange words
can 'feel' he is troubled
) And don't put on that look
haven't gone off my head yet
You want proof
And he gives a joking smile
is curious, expects one of his fiendish tricks
(Smiling) Yes
want proof
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus
Go see
stands up in disbelief
He looks through the hole, and indeed the film is out of focus
He puts it back into focus, flabbergasted
(Smiling) It's hard to explain, Toto
41
/ As the - attaches to the cafe door a poster of Catene - the coming attraction at the Cinema Paradiso -   is speaking on the phone in the phone booth
He is clearly peeved
Only two days
Are you joking
What do  care if all the copies are reserved
Catene for only two days in a place like this
Why, people will eat me alive
(Standing beside him listening is
He is carrying school books under his ann
In the cafe, several curious laugh as through the cafe window they watch some unemployed dancing together at the club listens nervously, then shrieks as if he were about to eat the phone
) know,  know
But even if start showing at eight in the morning it wouldn't be enough
This is a big town now and you people at the Titanus know it perfectly well
'm your sole agent and if  get pissed off 'll write straight to Lombardo, in Rome
'll give you guys a good run-around
If  get my dander up,  can let fly, if my name's Spaccafico
Cut to: are now outside the cafe, head towards the square
In front of the movie house, the  is at work
is so nervous he lights two cigarettes without noticing it
is turning something over in his mind
Don Ciccio, 've got an idea
You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses
So what's that got to do with it
The projector's all rusty, but could fix it in two or three days
Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses
(Shrieking) What the fuck you talking about
You getting into the act too, Toto
Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and  have to say thanks
If ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it
shrewd look glitters in  s eyes
He smiles
Who says we need two copies
42 The house is jammed with people
Almost bursting at the seams
The last scenes of Catene move across the screen
Tears stream down the faces of the men and women
The children are unusually silent
Even the  is awake, indeed whispers ahead of time all the lines of Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson, knows them by heart
Among the crowd in the balcony there is  and his wife, the , the landowner, the schoolteachers
Now the music is loud, heart- rending

Tied to the parcel-rack is the sack containing the second part of Catene
He now turns off the main street and takes a short-cut down a country road
He pedals as fast as he can
Until he disappears into the distance, beyond the trees

yells in excitement
Here you are
Quick, quick
People are waiting
46 In fact, inside the old freezing cold movie house, the audience is grumbling
Everyone is wrapped in overcoats and woollen scarves and are sitting on chairs they've brought from home and wooden benches
The hum of the projector is heard at last
The lights go down
The grumbling subsides
The words ' ' appear on screen and then the images of the film

To carry out another exchange of sacks containing the reels of film
Another race back to Cinema Paradiso
starts looking tired, his breath is short
And daylight starts fading into the colours of sundown
The last fading light of sundown
- is pedalling once more back to the old movie house
With the same sack tied to the parcel-rack
He is exhausted
On his last legs
He slows down, then stops
48 The lights are still on
In the thick blanket of smoke, the crowd stirs nervously
Shouting
Whistling
Hey, when's it starting
We've got ploughing to do in the morning
Toto, get a move on
Heeey
49
/ In the booth, the projector is turned off
looks nervously out of the window
at the square
But not a sign of peers in through one of the holes
What are we going to do, Toto
The whole place here is up in arms
They've been waiting more than a half hour
What can  do
50 Here too the audience is up in arms
They're waiting for Part Two tostart
tears his hair with rage
Where's the fucking bastard got to
Let's get one thing straight, Don Ciccio
'm waiting ten minutes more, and if you haven't started
you're giving me my money back
(In chorus) Well said
Well said
We want our money back
Easy
Easy
What about my showing you the first part again
Huh
People shout, whistle, give Bronx cheers
No
First part, my foot
We want to see how the story ends
Down in the front row, , the man who sells black market cigarettes, stands up

You want me to tell you how it ends

Nooo
No
Shut up, you jerk
5I has got himself a bicycle and is going off to look for He pedals fast, turns into the country short cut
Looks around  not a sign of Boccia
By now it is dark
He sees a  in the window of a farmhouse, calls out to him
Boccia
Boccia
rides on
Now he's in the open country
All of a sudden he seems to hear something
He stops
Pricks up his ears
It's a sort of moan - he can't figure out if it's an animal or a man
He turns on the flashlight he has brought along
Takes a closer look around
Catches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush
That's where the moan is coming from
He creeps over in alarm
Next to the bicycle he now catches sight of the sack with the film
And the moaning gets louder
(Alarmed) Boccia, what's wrong
(He runs over to help his friend
Behind the bush he discovers  humped up between the legs of , a prostitute
He moves with all the fury of his young years
has never seen people making love before and is speechless
) Damn you, what are you doing
(Shouting) Oh, Christ, it's so good
(And he goes on ramming it home
) Hey, cut it out
Go away
Shoo
With a confused look on his face,  picks up the sack and walks away, looking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more frantically
lets out a shriek of pleasure that rings through the countryside, as pedals off like a madman and disappears into the trees

Rounds of machine-gunfire in the night

Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a real pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner , who slumps down in his seat without anybody noticing

But this time the main floor takes its revenge and a blob of shit hits him square in the face
53 In the morning the theatre is empty
All the doors are shut
Light filters in through the open windows up above, illuminates the posters of coming attractions and the yellowish screen
Off-screen, a woman's voice and a boy's voice are heard

Slow pan along the walls of the theatre, the empty aisles, discovers  on the floor between the seats with , the prostitute who has already been seen
is making love for the first time in his life
He is awkward and clumsy
There is an uncertain look in his eyes, his livid face is dripping with sweat
There you are
That's right, that's right
Keep going
( is quicker, has learned the lesson goads him on
) Ah
There, now you're a real man man

cry of pain
calf falls like a dead weight to the ground

As well as the faces of the who now bleed and skin it quickly
In the vast slaughter-house, the voices of the men and animals mingle together
' eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary people
His movie camera is always ready, like a hunter's rifle
Now he is shooting
meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a speaker who flails his arms around
At school: the old  sitting at her desk, sunk in God knows what dreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale, unhappy face, and the unknowing  carry out their assignments
At the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the platforms
pans his camera on to   fighting
But an arriving train comes in between
Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars
The train stops
- door opens and the passengers climb out
Several , a , a group of commuting , the -, a distinguished looking and lastly, a  who stops in the middle of the viewfinder is immediately attracted by her face
He goes on shooting without leaving it a moment
He follows her through the lens
She is very beautiful, must be around sixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes
She is certainly the daughter of the distinguished looking  who got off just before she did
The little family moves off down the platform
Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if hypnotized
Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if trying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget smiles at her, entranced
55 The  is ringing the bell
In the courtyard, on the other side of the gate, the  prepare to enter
is with a group of schoolmates, including
And they all stare, wide-eyed, at the  from the station
She has her books under her arm and is walking by herself
You know that one there
She's new
Not bad though
Nice- looking
( has the look of somebody seeking for an idea, some way of picking up a conversation with her
) Her father s the new bank director
Loaded, luxury and easy living
People who jerk off with a shirt so they won't get their hands dirty
(Laughs
) All at once,  and  notice that the  drops her lunch without noticing as she is about to enter the school
They fly off, swift as arrows
It's a chance not to be missed
is the quicker, is already in the lead
gives an angry gesture
flash come into his eyes, the same flash he had as a little boy when he finds the right way to hit home
He picks up his step, trips  and brings him to the ground
He pounces on him and lets go with his fist
He starts running again
Picks the bundle off the ground
Catches up with the  from the station, nervous and inexperienced, but polite
Look, you dropped this
And he hands her her lunch with a smile
She recognizes him
Oh, thanks
hadn't noticed
She takes the bundle as  touches her hand delicately
My name's Salvatore
And yours
(Smiling) Elena
My name's Elena
is very flustered
He feels as if all his blood were throbbing in his head
He tries to say something else, but the words catch in his throat
The other time at the station
suddenly grabs him by the collar and yanks him away
is frightened, puts her hand over her eyes so as not to see
56: has a black eye, swollen shut
He is setting up a little 8mm projector on a stool
is sitting in one corner
He has come to keep him company
He listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown
Chaplin's Modern Times
Right, Toto
That's right, Modern Times
've shown it so many times  know it by heart
The first time  showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died
They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house
only found out that night, after the last show
Those are things you never forget
(Changing his tone
) So, Toto, how are these home movies going
( has switched on the little projector and a square of light appears on the wall beside , with the scenes shot in town
) Yes
(The shots of the slaughter-house have appeared
) (Whispering) What is it, what is it
What's the picture
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf
There's blood all over the floor, like a lake
And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die
is concentrated, as if ' description transmitted the real image to him, the colours, the forms
The railway station has appeared on the wall, and the sequence of
does not move, does not say a word, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera
senses something funny in the boy's s11ence
Now what can you see
Nothing, there's nothing
It's all out of focus
(Smiling) Is there a woman
Tell me the truth
( is shamed, uncertain, doesn't know whet to say
tender look filters through 's dark glasses
He has obviously caught on and whispers:) There is a woman
is forced to admit it, with a sigh
Yes, it's a girl  saw at the station
What's she like
What's she like
And as other shots of  appear on the screen,  describes her
As only somebody in love could
She's nice
My age
Slender, with long hair, brunette
She had big blue eyes, a simple expression and a little beauty mark on her lip, but really tiny
You can only see it close-up
And when she smiles
She makes you feel
He stops
Only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by passion, by the desire to talk about her
smiles, spellbound
Eh
Love
what a mystery
( turns off the projector and heaves a deep sigh, almost of liberation
' sympathy does him a lot of good
It's nice to be understood
He moves over closer to him runs his hand through his hair, whispers:) understand you, Toto
The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful
Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them
( is comforted by the way he talks
He didn't think it was possible to put into words the things he has felt since meeting He nods his head
sighs
) Eh, there's nothing to be done about it
The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints
And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street
Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants
( is touched by his sensitivity, by his intense, passionate, sweet way of speaking
) What you say is wonderful
But sad
(Smiling) They're not my words
John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills
suddenly changes expression, as if discovering he was being made fun of
Stinking two-timer
(And they burst out laughing
) 57: grey, windy day
It is opening-time and the shutters of the movie house are being rolled up
is about to enter through the small door of the spiral staircase, when in the distance he catches sight of
crossing a street with her books under her arm
She is alone
doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets full of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her
He looks around in all directions  there she is
He starts running again
And finally catches up with her, all out of breath, practically speechless with emotion
Hi, Elena
Hi
Why are you running
No particular reason
(He is entranced by her eyes
He wants to tell her all sorts of things, say all the words he has memorized a thousand times
But now he can't get them out
His knees tremble
He does his best to overcome his confusion, but all that comes out is:) Nice day, huh
( gust of wind envelops them in a cloud of dust and a clap of thunder rends the air
laughs, amused by the blunder
) Yes, nice day
( laughs too
He gazes at her long hair tossed by the wind
She turns to leave
) 've got to go now
Bye-bye
Bye-bye, Elena
( walks away
And also turns to leave
Only now is he seized by disappointment, regret at not having made the best of the opportunity
He talks to himself
) What an idiot
What an idiot
'Nice day'
Christ
58:' projects images of  on his wall
He lies across his bed gazing at her image
You probably don't believe me, but 'm going to become the leading man in your life
Sure,  don't look like Marlon Brando, but look at me, really look at me
Am  really so ugly
So should  try once more
Maybe It'll succeed
What do you say
seems to be saying, Yes
As  kisses , her image disappears
He is left with his face against the wall in the white light from the projector
59:PHONEB00TH  ' is in a phone booth
The telephone will certainly help him feel less nervous
Hello, can  speak to Elena, please
Yes
( recognizes 's voice, changes his tone, turns sweeter, more personal
) Is that you, Elena
' Yes
Oh, 'm sorry,  didn't recognize your voice
This is Salvatore, remember
' Yes
finally speaks, says everything all in one breath, without stopping, without hesitating, in order to leave no room for shyness
Listen,  know that every time we see each other  make a fool of myself, but 'm not like that,  swear
It's just that when  see you,  feel shy, the right words don't come to me, don't have the courage to say that all  do is think about you
(He has finally got it out
He's dripping with sweat, but happy at having succeeded
He continues
) That's right, Elena, you're the last thing  think of when  go to sleep and the first when  wake up in the morning
And at night  always dream of you
know, it's not good on the phone
But please, don't get me wrong
Because  love you very much
' (Interrupting him) If you don't stop phoning her, 'm calling the police
(Stunned) But excuse me, who's speaking
At ' house, a  who is visibly in a state is speaking on the phone
' 'm Elena's mother, you filthy pig
feels like dropping through the floor, tries to get a word in to explain, to apologize, but the flood of insults overwhelms him
'm sorry, Signora, maybe there's a misunderstanding
' And don't call my daughter any more
Never

He's so mad he starts slapping himself
60:' Good Friday
comes out of his house, leaning on 's shoulder
They go off down the street, towards the church
has finished recounting his misadventure
told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult
But why
There must be some way to make her understand
Don't think about it, Toto
Don't even try
With feelings, there's nothing to understand
gives an angry gesture
This time ' words do not quiet his frenzy, don't help him
He moves away from him a few steps
stands there motionless in the middle of the road
Stop it
've had enough of your sermons
You act as if you created the world
( bicycle streaks by , who gives a startled jump, as if it were about to run into him
He raises his voice, panic- stricken
) Heeey
Totooooo
Don't get pissed off with me now
Come here
don't know where the fuck  have to go
(  on a bicycle almost collides with
fumes, goes over to him listlessly puts his hand back on his shoulder and they start walking again
has calmed down, but his voice is determined
) And the next time be careful how you talk
Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if  had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better
But unfortunately such was not the case
(Laughing) You see, it s like  say
You always have an answer for everything
want to make you happy, Toto
'm going to tell you a story
(And he squeezes ' shoulder
It's the signal for taking a rest
They sit in a doorway
starts telling his story, and his way of speaking is hypnotic, magical
With those eyes lost in empty space, it's as if his thoughts and his words came in from some other dimension, mysterious, hidden
) Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm
Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all
And he immediately fell in love with her
But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter
One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her
The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end 'll be yours
' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited
One day, two days, ten, twenty
Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged
Come rain, wind, snow, never budged
The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive
After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back
He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more
The princess kept watch
And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left
No
You mean right at the end
( is amazed, dumbfounded; that ending has made a deep impression
They start walking again
) That's right, Toto, right at the end
And don't ask me what it means
If you figure it out, let me know
'll be damned' 6I: Before the high altar, the Virgin Mary in tears clutches three spikes inher hand
And beside her is another statue  Christ descended from the cross

Many people are sitting between the pews

She kneels down on one side, just as   comes out of the middle booth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan
' eyes light up
He has had a brainstorm
He leans over and whispers something into 's ear
nods his head
is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress
Then he hurries over to the
Says something in a low voice, gesticulates with some agitation, points to the pew where  is sitting
The  tries to say he can't now, but  insists, and wins
The  goes over to , leans over
What is it, Alfredo
Right now, of all times
(In a grave voice) Father Adelfio,  have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul
And you've got to help me, because 've lost all peace of mind
watches from a distance
He sees the  put on an alarmed expression and then sit down beside
Everything's ready
He creeps over to the confessional
is there, kneeling down waiting for the  to arrive
In an instant, without anyone noticing,  pops inside the confessional
He shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain
On the other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake all night
Father,  have sinned
(In a low voice) We'll talk about that later
(Surprised) But
who
(Interrupting her) Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal
'm Salvatore
' eyes pop in amazement
What are you doing here
Meanwhile  and the  continue their unusual and animated discussion
The  is appalled, crosses himself
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying

But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example think about it a lot
How is it possible for
In the confessional, the whispered conversation between  and continues
(Annoyed) There was a terrible rumpus at home
My mother told my father
And how could you have mistaken my voice
is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on  and the through a crack in the curtain
Forgive me, Elena
It was stupid of me
But  had to talk to you
She looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight
This time  finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with determination
That grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being seen
You're so beautiful, Elena
That's what  wanted to tell you
When meet you,  can't put two words together because
you give me the shivers
don't know what you do in these situations, what you're supposed to say
It's the first time
But  think 'm in love with you
gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes
She is bewildered by that flood of passion
At that moment, an   kneels down on the other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille
Father,  have sinned
( turns lo her, instinctively
) absolve you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost
Go in peace, my daughter
(And he slams the panel shut in her face
is barely able to control her laughter
) When you laugh, you're even more beautiful
She pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look
Salvatore, it's awfully sweet of you
And even though  don't know you, like you
But
'm not in love with you
For , it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart
He sits there gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving
Then through the crack sees  and the  conversing nervously, God knows what they're saying
And he turns back to her
don't care
'll wait
For what
For you to fall in love with me too
Listen carefully
Every night, when get off work, 'll come and wait beneath your window
Every night
When you change your mind, open your window
That's all
'll understand
He smiles at her
She is upset by those exaggerated words, but also intrigued
The  has meanwhile solved the problem that  has made up as an excuse
(Exhausted) You understand now
You see it clearly
(Hypocritically) Oh yes, father
Now everything's clear
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy
You survived the fire at the movie house
But no one can save you from the fire of Hell

warm early summer night
The last spectators wander off into the streets
The   makes his rounds of the square
is beneath her window
He waits
The shutters are open, but not the windows with the curtains
peers at him through a dark crack
Fade to: rainy night
is back there again
Determined, headstrong
dog keeps him company, taking shelter under an overhanging roof
The window is shut
Fade to: ' hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on the calendar
check a day
Fade to: Another night
Wind
The window is still shut
's eyes are the eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles, just to win, just to conquer his loved one
She peeks at him through the crack, but he can't see her
Fade to: The paces of the calendar are covered with checks
Several months have gone by
adds a check on the last page, on 30 December
Tomorrow night will be
New Year's Eve
The streets are empty
Loud merry voices can be heard coming from the houses
Old discarded objects hail down from balconies
Firecrackers explode here and there
is there in the same old place, as usual
The shutters are open, but not the windows, and all is darkness inside
is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep warm
63: Toasts are being prepared in 's house
is there with her daughter, , then  with his wife,
is the only one missing for the "family" to be complete
The bottle of spumante and the Christmas cake are ready
The radio is on with the New Year's Eve programme
(Nervously) But why hasn't Toto shown up
The movie house is closed at this hour
has a know-all look
He tries to put her mind at rest
He had to do something for me
Over the radio, music and merrymaking 64:' More sounds of merrymaking, coming from 's house
listens to it, sees the shadows of her parents and relatives, maybe even hers, ready to celebrate, welcome in the New Year
But further on, that window remains dark and shut
gazes at it again
There is a new look in his eyes, like a gleam of hope
Maybe it's the specialness of that night, maybe it's the fire crackers, the festive atmosphere, but something tells him that's going to be the right night
The night when she'll open her window
In fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room
' eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory
The window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum
The music reaches its climax
Two hands come out
shuts his eyes for a moment, to hold back the flood of feeling
He opens them again and sees
The hands reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut
The light goes out
It is midnight
An echoing voice does the countdown
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
And a roar of voices, shouts, explosions, fills the air
has remained standing there immobile, speechless
Disappointed
Defeated
65 At his house, glasses are about to be raised
There is a strange, tense merriment
is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment
She glances at the door, hoping to see  appear
(To Maria) There's nothing to worry about
He's probably with his friends
(To all) Let's toast
(Toasting) Here's to you
Here's to you
Happy New Year
For Toto too, here's to you
Happy New Year
Everybody echoes ' toast
66 But  is not happy in these first few minutes of the New Year
He feels hurt, humiliated, rejected
He walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying down from the terraces
That was his last night
He's not showing up beneath that balcony any more
67 Outside there is a violent thunderstorm
The pounding of the rain and the rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown
Two buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof is alone
For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into
He is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces of his grief
He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room
And now stands there watching him in silence
The thunder is deafening
That someone is
She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking about her
Whispers
Salvatore
Loud passionate music is heard on the monitor
turns and sees her as if in a dream
It is a sudden blow to the heart
The look on her face is wonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and who now realizes at last that she is in love too
For  it is an overwhelming, almost unbearable moment
long passionate embrace that is never-ending
They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other again
They spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the first-part endings and the trailers
Another intense look, their eyes locked
And it is their first kiss
kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost clumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant
Amidst the film strips dangling around and touching their young faces
Meanwhile the film has finished, the projector turns uselessly
Down below the screen is blank, the audience whistles
But  hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless whirring of the reels in the projector
All he hears is her breathing, an he feels is the warmth of her skin

In the projection booth

And then a kiss
69 is driving an old beaten-up Balilla he bought from a car-wrecker
sits beside him, having the time of her life
They roar with laughter
The car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the holes in the road, and besides  is not such a hot driver
She fondles him
(Ironically) You have a great future as a driver
If they don't arrest you first
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in
He has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a sudden violent shudder
sharp report
cloud of white smoke issues from the motor
And the Balilla stops dead in its tracks
and  cannot smother their wild laughter
They embrace
now how do we get home
Cut to: The two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have already been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon
When all at once a car comes around the bend, heading for town
and  flag it down
The  slows down
The back door opens, a  gets out
An alarmed and startled look comes over 's face  that man is her
She sees him stride over in a rage
He has almost reached , who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the situation
Hello, Dr Mendola
Hem

He got himself a good thrashing, and then some
The house is jammed, as on the great occasions
Curiosity is written all over the faces of the audience
But what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of Double or Nothing

It is a machine that makes it possible to project television show on the screen
is sitting beside him
(In a low voice) Toto, are you pulling my leg or something
How is it possible to see this television without film
Just so, Alfredo
There isn't any
And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss
(Sceptically) Could be
But  don't like this business
It smells fishy to me

Sitting beside her  is the owner of the movie house, , who thanks him
(In a low voice) You see what a bright idea, Dr Mendola
But without the bank loan how could  have bought the machine

From the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well
He gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should figure out some way

Inside the toilet,  is standing on the toilet seat whispering to , who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet
Their eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have uncovered

Could it be your father doesn't like the work  do
That my family's too poor
Is that it
She gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his vulnerability
sighs
' (Off-screen) Elena
All right
(To Salvatore, in a whisper) For the moment it's impossible to see each other
As soon as school is out, we're going to go stay with friends in Tuscany
We'll be there all summer
Maybe if you came up, we could meet in secret
(Crestfallen) But we're opening the outdoor movie theatre this summer
What will  do all this time without seeing you
'll write to you every day
Don't worry
love you
The summer'll be over and 'll be back
They reach out to kiss each other
Who knows when they'll be able to see each other again

climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving  standing there on the toilet seat
Summer has come
bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the carters' families to the beach to go swimming
, helped by the , has finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry it to the outdoor movie house
The  has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso to the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs into the wagon
The horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever
And he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the wheels
cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the wagon
There are the  from the slaughter-house
They recognize
- Well, look who's here
Cecil
De Mille
Hey, Toto
When are you coming to shoot another film
And they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths
doesn't feel like joking, not even like answering
He looks away, so as not to see their leers
He wants to be by himself
73 The beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers
The carts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the Imperia Arena, where some are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening
The wagon arrives and  and the  unload the projector
74 sultry evening
The jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the dark horizon
The sound-track of a comic film reverberates over the sea, the laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves breaking on the rocks
group of   in a boat pulls away from shore
They join some more boats standing still in the water, all of them crammed with   all looking in the same direction
towards the screen of the open-air movie at the water's edge
There is a funny scene
All seats are sold out
Free entrance and payment on the way out
Sssssh
And they guffaw noisily
Their laughter is echoed by more laughter, in the distance
the laughter of the Arena audience, scattered among the metal chairs
By dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows of chairs tip over backwards
Screams, laughs, whistles
The projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading down to the rocks
is sitting on the ground, bare chested, tired and sticky with sweat
He is reading a letter from He is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his face
' (Off-screen) Salvatore, my darling, here the days never end
find your name everywhere if  read a book, do a crossword puzzle, thumb through a newspaper
You're always before my eyes
Today 've got some rather bad news
At the end of October we're moving to the city where 'll attend the University
It'll be hard to see each other every day
But don't worry, whenever  can get away 'll always come running to you, to the Cinema Paradiso
On the Arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a very funny scene is being shown
The audience again bursts into wild laughter
And the audience of   in the boats also laugh
One of them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls into the water
The others howl with laughter
voice rises up out of the carousel of boats
Fuck me
've caught an octopus
An oooooctopus
75
/ The August sun is blazing hot
People are forced to stay inside when the sirocco blows
The streets are empty
And there is a strange silence
Nothing can be heard except far in the distance, from somewhere in the country, the love song of some carter
hears it too, stretched out on the floor of his room, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously
The comes down the street on his bicycle, rides up to  and hands him a letter
Sitting in the shade of a white wall,  reads the letter
Next to him, the dog that kept him company at night, beneath 's window
He gazes up at him as if looking for news of her
76:
/ The Arena is crowded with sun-burnt faces
On screen, scenes from Ulysses
On a shelf in the projection booth, there is an enormous pack of letters
is worn out
The waiting has destroyed him
He looks like a madman
As he winds up one of the parts of the film, he repeats her name obsessively, under his breath
Elena
Elena
Elena
Now he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the sea
There is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and the boats of 'gate-crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling fitfully but not dangerously
stretches out, gazes up at the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman, whispering
When will this shitty summer be over
(Half shutting his eyes) In a film it'd already be finished
(Smiling) Fade-out and cut to a nice thunderstorm
Huh
that'd be perfect
clap of thunder explodes in the air
Loud, rumbling
' eyes pop open
The Arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky
The 'gate-crashers' in the boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of thunder
One of those storms is building up that ruins late summer nights
gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down violently, suddenly
The Arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries over to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go on watching the film despite the rain
The   in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their heads
But  does not get up
He lets the rain fall on him, goes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had taken place
And as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to catch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of joy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is
opens his eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination created by the rain
Instead no, it is really her
Elena
But when
got back today
You can't imagine the excuses  had to make up to be here
's lips interrupt her
It is an intense, a stupendous kiss
They've probably never been so happy as they are at that moment
They cling to each other as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with his, binding them ever closer
77 Autumn has arrived
In the streets, the  prepare the barrels for preserving the grape must

It is a quiet moment, they chat, while the humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard through the window of the booth
The  stops and hands  a folded sheet of paper
Don Ciccio, this is for Toto
Give it him
(And he pedals off on his bicycle
) What is it

Holy blood of Judas
Now what am going to do

She paces nervously back and forth
Glances at her watch
He's late
She looks around in all directions and sees him at last
He comes running up to her
They embrace
So what'd they say
The army says that, as a war orphan, don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done
It's a bureaucratic error

Day after tomorrow morning
They're sending me to Rome
But they'll discharge me ten days later
Let's go
He takes her hand, turns to go to a cafe
holds back
She has caught sight of her 's car approaching
turns to look and in a faint voice reveals the reason for her nervousness
No, Salvatore
You'd better go
It's my father
Good, this way we can finally talk
'll convince him this time
He won't be convinced, Salvatore
He has other plans for me
Who
The son of one of his colleagues
Don't act that way
We'll talk about it later
Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso
'll be coming with the five o'clock bus
looks with longing as  drives away with her father
gives him a meaningful look through the window
returns the look, but stands there motionless, with a grim expression, like someone who knows how to take the treacherous blows of life
The car drives off and with it Their eyes hang on the same thread
The thread of hope and now of fear
79 The poster of Il Grido hangs on the billboard outside the theatre
replaces '' with a '' sticker
The is washing the floor of the lobby
shouts up to , who is in the projectionist's booth says that tomorrow he'll be leaving and today is his last day on the job, and he's sorry
Toto, this is no film for the common herd
One day'll be more than enough
So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready
understands 's sadness
Cheer up, Toto
'll be here waiting for you
No one's taking your job away from you
Don't worry

It's already five-thirty and she hasn't come
He checks the projector
The first part has just begun and the reel is full of film
The first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and  still isn't there
is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting with her
He sees 's face pulling away in the car
Thinks back over her terrible confession
He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell, thinking up solutions
The stair light finally goes on; there she is dashes over and down the stairs to meet her
He comes down the final turn of the spiral staircase and finds himself face to face with , who is slowly making his way up with the help of his cane
freezes to the spot
senses his disappointment
You weren't expecting me
(Nervously) No, Alfredo,  was coming to help you
(Smiling) You were expecting her
Huh
( doesn't answer
He's too worried, too upset
climbs another step, whispering
) It's a nasty business waiting by yourself
In company it's better
No
Then 'll leave
As usual ' sweetness comforts , indeed suddenly gives him a bold idea, one that quiets his nervousness
He puts a hand on ' shoulder
Alfredo,  need your help
8I The Balilla speeds as fast as it can down the road to the city, where  s family has gone to live
drives along in a state of agitation
The idea of having to leave without seeing  is his obsession
An obsession he refuses to accept
82 The second part has begun, the reel is full
For the first time in many years,  is alone in the booth, sitting in front of the projector, and he feels helpless
Not only because he's blind, but also because there is nothing he can do for
strange agitation comes over him, as if he were experiencing the same anxiety troubling his 'Toto' at that moment
Meanwhile, the film roll on and with it, time, minutes
83 has already reached the city
He slows down at the bus terminus
Looks at the people waiting, but she is not there
He asks several girls in front of the University
But they haven't seen her
He phones from a phone booth
But nobody answers
His self-control is about to give way to desperation
84 On the reel there is less film
Like an hourglass with the sand trickling through
85:
/ comes streaking up in front of her house
He screeches to a stop, dashes out like greased lightning
His nerves are tense, a slight tremor runs through his whole body
He rings the bell, but nobody answers
who lives in the building opens the front door and comes out
seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor
He pounds on the door furiously, almost cracking his knuckles
But all to no avail; there is nobody at home
He shrieks, panic stricken
Open up
Open up
Elenaaa
And in fact, there is somebody inside: 's
She sits there immobile, without a word
The pounding on the door reverberates in the room, but she does not budge, determined to ignore that desperate message
86: The reel spins faster
The film is almost ended
By now there is very little time
87 And  is on his way home, defeated
Be drives as fast as he can
Be is in a terrible state, can't figure out what's happened
Can't explain it
And that's what hurts
88 The words ' ' appear on the screen
and the film runs out, leaving the projector turning uselessly
is alarmed
He can hear that the film is finished, but doesn't know where to begin
He gropes around
He's scared
Like a little boy calls his mother when he's lost in a crowd, so old  calls TotooooO
TotooooO
The few people down in the audience start whistling and complaining about the film they haven't understood
Lights
Christ, what a piece of crap
We want  money back
Heeeeey
Bandits
Others are shouting that they like the film
89 The Balilla screeches to a stop in front of the theatre
darts out and runs to the stairs
90 turns the lights on in the theatre and turns off the projector, trying to calm down , who has got to his feet, frightened
But where'd you go, Toto
'm here
Take it easy
Take it easy
(And he folds him into his arms, like calming down a little boy who has had a nightmare
Be whispers, still out of breath:) Sit down, sit down
( quiets down as lowers him into a chair, and asks him the only question upon which his last hope depends
) Did she come
No, nobody came
(And he embraces him, almost as if to comfort him in his great disappointment
) For  it's really the end: she's not coming
Tomorrow he'll be leaving without having seen her again
' hands remove the photographs of Amedeo Nazzari and of  from the wall, slip them into one of his pockets
Now the hands open the metal containers of tomorrow's film, take
out the reels to set them up, pick up the receipt - his last before leaving - and with the same mechanical gesture, hang it on a nail, as usual

One, two, one, two

On one of the public phones in a square of Rome,  is phoning
Nobody answers
He slams down the receiver, as the line of  waits its turn

His nerves start to give way
He bows his head in despair

He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and repeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself

comes up
) Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your discharge has come through
registers this information with his eyes and nods absently
92 The bus disappears around the corner leaving  standing there alone
It is a blazing hot day
The sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions
The square is empty, the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces a Western
puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around
Everything exactly the same, immobile
Only one new feature  in the cafe there's a jukebox playing 'Estate' sung by Milva
turns towards the Cinema Paradiso
The projectionist is at the window of the booth, smoking a cigarette
Who knows who he is, where he came from
hot flurry of dust
turns and sees a dog leaping around kim, wagging its tail
It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath the window
gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to stroke him
Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend
93  ' goes to see
He is still in bed, has just woken up
He is glad to hear his 'Toto'
He feels his forehead, his eyes and cheeks, as if to 'see' him
You 're thinner
You can tell you've not been treated well
(As usual, you can't hide anything from
senses something different in him that he can't figure out, like same wild restlessness within)
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody
Why
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing
So it's better to shut up
(Changing his lone) It's hot in here
Toto, take me to the beach
94 The sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry, easier to breathe
and  walk slowly along the waterfront
totters slightly, holds on to , who is telling him something very funny
At the Christmas party the lieutenant pinches a girl's ass
The girl turns around: it's the daughter of the commanding officer
The lieutenant is scared to death and says: 'Miss, if your heart is as hard as what  have just touched, 'm done for
And they roar with laughter
They look like two old school buddies telling each other dirty jokes
They stop beside a low wall
knows that those laughs are simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are troubling
And he breaks the ice, while  is still laughing
(Seriously) Did you ever see her again
(' laughter dies away, taken off-guard as he is
Then he lights a cigarette
) No
And nobody knows where she is
It was probably meant to be like this
Each of us has a star to follow
So now what are you thinking of doing
It's a terrible question, and  has no answer to it
In fact, would rather not even talk about it
He changes his tone, as if he hadn't heard it, laughs, trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military service
Listen to this one
The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there
' 'Yes, sir,  remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there
' (And he bursts into nervous laughter
But this time  remains cold, unmoved, does not laugh with him gradually falls silent
He doesn't know what to say
For the first time in his life, he doesn't know what goal to aim for, doesn't know what to do
The cloud of smoke wreaths his nervous face, now he seems to relax, whispers:) You remember the story of the soldier and the princess
( nods his head
) Now  understand why the soldier went away just before the end
That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his
But she, also, could not have kept her promise
And
that would have been terrible, he would have died from it
So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him
(This time  is the one to explain something to
And realizes how bitter his story is and, above all, that the boy standing there is no longer a boy
) Do like the soldier, Toto
Go away
This land is cursed
(They are now leaning against a boat on the beach
goes on whispering his words
) When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes
Then you go away, one year, two
And when you come back, everything's different
The thread has broken
You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist
Isn't that the case
You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born
But not now, it's impossible
Now you're blinder than am
(Intense words, straight from the heart, and is spellbound
He whispers with a smile:) Who said that
Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda
Huh
( also gives a gentle smile) No, Toto, nobody said it
say it
Life's not like you saw it in the movies
Life
is harder
(He lays his hand on ' shoulder, gives it a hard squeeze
) Get out
Go back to Rome
You 're young, the world is yours
And 'm old
don't want to hear you talk any more,  want to hear talk about you
gives a shudder that runs through his very soul
The setting sun lies colorless on the horizon
95
/ Night
The square is empty
is sitting on the church steps
His head in his hands
He has to make a decision leave or stay
And why
'What decision will he make
' is the question that keeps  awake, in his hot dark bedroom
, his mother, also can't get to sleep
She knows, senses, that her son is on the verge of an important turning-point
But what will he decide
What will happen
Also , his sister, feels a strange, heavy tension in the air
And doesn't sleep
She's probably wondering where  is at that hour
He's sitting on the ground
But even if he were to go to bed he wouldn't sleep
He rubs his face with his hand
The church bell chimes four a
m
, another distant bell is chiming four a
m
And is once again wide awake
He is thinking, with his hand on his face, just like then
And the same decision to make: what to do
Stretched out beside a sleeping , he goes on staring at the window
Outside, the storm has passed
The long memory has almost faded, only the sound of a train surfaces in his mind
96 It's the train that    had pulled into the station of his home town before leaving for Rome
hugs his and
The moment has come to say goodbye to The old man is deeply moved
heart-rending trembling comes into his husky voice
Don't come back any more, don't think about us, don't turn round, don't write, don't give in to nostalgia
Forget us all
If you can't hear it and come back, don't come looking for me,  won't let you into the house, you understand
They clasp each other tightly, as if they knew they wouldn't be meeting again
Thanks for all you've done for me
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little
(The train moves now
Hands wave in the air, drawing further and further away
The has arrived at the last moment and waves goodbye from the distance
) (Shouting) Goodbye, TotooooooO
got here too late
What a shame
The figure of  and the others can no longer be distinguished
Only a distant blur at the end of the track
97 , a plane flies over Sicily
It lands on the runway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of the dark mountains
Salvatore's face appears among the clouds reflected in one of the plane windows
He has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home after the adventure of life has carried him afar, wandering the world, where he has forgotten everything
From the plane window to another window
98
/ the window of the taxi-cab driving  to his home town
The scenery moving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories
lot of things have changed, but the colors are still the same
The yellow running through the entire landscape is unmistakable
And all those black birds perched in a row on the guard-rail are crows
The cab now approaches the outskirts of Giancaldo
But if the sign, hadn't been there with the name on it, it could be an entirely different place
99  ' '
/ The house where '  lives is also new, nearer the sea
The old lady is sitting alone in an armchair in the parlor, knitting a white sweater
Her hands move very swiftly, almost mechanically
The hands of a woman who is waiting
The front doorbell rings twice
stops short
That is what she has been waiting for
She mumbles in excitement
It's Toto
knew it
And she scrambles to her feet, dropping her knitting in the chair, one needle dangling over the edge
She hurries off, forgetting that she still has the ball of white yarn in her apron pocket
And the yarn runs off the needles and the knitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house, goes down the stairs to the front door
There the yam stops and ' s excited voice is heard
' (Off-screen) Toto
'  (Off-screen) How are you, Mamma
The camera now moves, discovering them through the parlor window, hugging each other outside the front door
Under the curious eyes of an old bored dog

Mother and son are sitting side by side at the kitchen table
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see
And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now
(Smiling) They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome
looks around; It's a place he's never seen before, and yet it's his mother's house
) See how pretty the house is
We did everything over
(Smiling) If it hadn't been for you
(Getting up) Come,  have a surprise
(She takes him by the hand and leads him out to the hallway
looks at her and feels a pang
She seems smaller, age withers the body, she is slightly stooped, her hair is gathered into a knot at the back other head
) You must be tired
If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral
(Interrupting her) No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know
(Smiling, ironically) You shouldn't tell me that now
After all these years
( gets the message, feels guilty
Thinking about it, it seems incredible that he has never come before
opens a door, steps aside to let her son in, whispers:) put all your things in here
Go in, go in
lakes a few steps, is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room perfectly reconstructed and preserved
It looks like a museum, the museum of the past
Despite the bed, the clothes in the cupboard, the books on the shelves, it is perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in it
senses his perturbation, remains standing in the doorway as if to leave him alone
goes over to the bed, looks around  the old 8mm movie camera, the projector, his documentaries, the bicycle hanging on the wall, the photographs of his favorite movie stars
But what mostly catches his eye is a tiny framed photograph:  as a little boy and , standing smiling in front of the Cinema Paradiso
Strange, at that time  was younger than he is now
It's as if he were standing there before him one last time
That impressive figure, his good-natured bur firm look, touches his heart
From ' smiling face to
101 the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever
The funeral procession winds its way down the main street
At the intersections, , cars stop to let the black hearse pass by
People cross themselves
The old men remove their hats
Store shutters are lowered
Then, when the procession has passed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the shutters are pulled up

says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin
He would have been happy you came, Toto
He always talked about you
Always
Right to the end
He was terribly fond of you
(Tears come to her, she is unable to say any more
gives her a hug, deeply touched by her words
) He left two things for you
Come see me before you leave
nods his head
He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers and is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had been like a father to him
But why had he forgotten him
Up in front, leading the procession, he sees a young  with an altar boy beside him, and these figures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old feelings to light again
The procession reaches the square
The dark column stands etched in the dazzling early-afternoon light
motions the driver and the procession comes to a halt
It is ' last farewell to the place where he had spent the best years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso
Everyone turns to look and also turns, taken by surprise
It has fallen to pieces: doors and windows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds and mildew in the cracks and on the roof
The square has changed completely, is unrecognizable
Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a snail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns
And the central square has turned motorcycles
turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small crowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at once, despite the many years that have gone by:  the     , the who also served as bill-poster, the , the  , and further on behind  and , the lovebirds who had met in the movie house and then got married
They all have white hair
And they too have recognized him, give little hello nods and gestures
Another face he seems to recognize: why sure, it's , the owner
How old he's become
He also looks up and his eyes meet '
hello nod
makes his way over to him through the crowd
They shake hands heartily, without a word, both touched
The procession starts up again
(Under his breath) How long's it been shut
Six years ago this May
No one came any more
You "know better than me, Mr
Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos
By now the movie business is only a dream
The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot
Next Saturday they're tearing it down
pity
is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr
Di Vita'
Besides, finding out that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a piece of his life
And all those curious faces staring at him
But why do you call me 'Mr
Di Vita'
It didn't used to be that way
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name
But if it really matters to you, '11 call you
(Smiling) Toto
smiles at that
Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church
excuses himself and goes over to the hearse
Old  watches him go, then says, almost to himself) Bless you, Toto
The coffin is unloaded
has asked to be one of the bearers into the church
As he moves off slowly with that weight on his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk
An old woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand
She crosses herself quickly
recognizes her  she was the one he made love with for the first time
, the prostitute
The coffin is carried into the church, followed by the little procession
102  '  '
/ The little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor windows are lit up
The rustling of the sea can be heard
The family is having supper
The table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been brought out
is also there with her husband, , and their two children
, fifteen, and , thirteen
The television is on, but the sound has been turned practically all the way down
' presence arouses a special excitement
The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they don't really know him
(Playfully) Uncle, the next time Granny comes to Rome,  want to come along too want to see what you do when you work
(Smiling) Fine
But  warn you, there isn't much to see
sell much more smoke than fire
The  laugh
At the sight of them, ,  and  also smile
(To ) Watch out, don't get too familiar with those two (indicating the children) they're worse than cannibals
They'll take advantage
Everybody laughs again
Even  laughs a lot
looks at her; he had never seen her laugh like that, amused, at peace
You leaving tomorrow, Uncle
doesn't know what to say
He feels drunk
It has been a day of violent upheavals, a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing  on the one hand, he' d like to stay, let himself drift on the sweet tide of family life, be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past: on the other, he wishes he had never come
He forces himself to smile again
don't know, Filippo
don't know
They go on eating, but  isn't very hungry
Re peers at  eating out of the comer of his eye, feels deeply bound to her  she has a few white hairs and light wrinkles line her face
Then he looks at her husband, , he's going bald but he tries to hide it by combing over the little hair left
Who knows what their marriage is like, he wonders
He looks back at , and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up, guesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a blush colors her cheeks and she smiles
returns a conniving smile
The ringing of a phone
starts to get up to go and answer it, hut stops her with a glance of the eye
(To ) It must be for you
They've been calling all afternoon
They wanted to know if you're leaving this evening or tomorrow
Everyone turns to  with questioning looks, making him feel even more restless and undecided
The phone goes on ringing
103
The  cops are trying to break the front door down with their shoulders
Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech, kicking up a cloud of dust
enters by himself
104 ' silhouette stands out against the light in the open door
lowly he makes his way into the empty theatre
thick layer of dust lends everything a gray, rarefied look
The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with strange mates of dust, like a haze
Cobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling
walks down the middle aisle
The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has warped from the dampness
He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the album of his memories
The screen dangles from its frame
The emergency exits are boarded and nailed shut
Observing the emptiness of the theatre, has the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the
audience, as he remembers it
But only for one brief moment, then the silence returns
mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust
is attracted by that little gray mass
He goes over as the mouse scampers off, takes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with dust
He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, repeating the same gesture of bygone years
But the lion's head is no longer there, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of the booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering as a little boy
now climbs up the spiral staircase
Each step kicks up a little cloud of dust
The little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again
Now it looks like some big, empty cave
The projector is no longer there, nor the equipment
Who knows where they junked them
The only thing left is a clump of film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One endings, etc
There he had kissed  for the first time, and strips of film like those had grazed their faces
Now they are caught up in the coils of cobwebs
And where the film-winder once stood, the nails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts
Of all the films shown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace
And three more boxfuls of them are on the floor
And the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass broken
peers out of one of the cracks in the window and sees the village
which is now a city
different world he no longer knows
105
/ The cafe in the square has been completely renovated
The  and have young, unfamiliar faces
holds out the receipt with a tip
double whisky, please
Several  are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls
Others stand playing 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic tune
man comes up to  and asks for his autograph
Then  turns to the plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once was
And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot
Two steps away from him, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills his blood: there before him is
But she is still young, young as she was then
Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at the station
She is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her arm
Have the passing years had no effect on her
Or is she an hallucination
No
It's a dream
Or is he dead too, like
doesn't know how to explain it
And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic
His glass drops to the floor
As the  walks off
106 At the age of fifty-five,  feels no scruples about wandering the streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old girl
There's nothing he can do about it
He stares at her with the amazement of someone who discovers that miracles exist
Now he is nearer to her
How lovely she is
It's her, no doubt about it
Exactly the same
Except she has a different hair-do and is wearing different clothes:   didn't wear slacks
The  goes up to a parked motorcycle
She removes the padlock and fastens her books to the rack
is standing there a few steps away, and without stopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely
Excuse me, Miss
(She turns to look at him, indifferent, but friendly
He looks at her wonderful blue eyes
) 'm so sorry,  thought you were someone else
(Shrugging) Well
She has already started the motor of her bike
flip of the accelerator and off she goes, her hair flying in the wind
follows her with his eyes until she disappears around the corner
107  ' ' The old shots of  getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious look at the camera
is watching her again, projected on the white wall of his room
He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days the picnic,
she at the beach, smiling, joyful
And again  doesn't understand, or doesn't want to understand
But these scenes could have been shot yesterday, so identical to  is the girl he saw on the street
And the wound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again
The lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever knowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his young mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots slipping again through an old 8mm projector
Through the crack of the door,  sees those images on the wall, rocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he cried
She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks away without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, empty
And  sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which his camera never set down on film, only his memory
108 The    are coming out after school
Happy young faces
That 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror
is at the wheel of the car  has lent him
He has obviously followed that motorcycle before
He waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to understand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the same time overwhelms him hopelessly
And here she comes
She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off starts the motor and follows her a short distance away
The  heads for the new residential district on the outskirts
109  ' ' is setting the table
and her family are eating at her house today
is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, gazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the rolling sea
The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a heaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face
glances at him
What are you thinking, Toto
looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile
on his lips
There was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of silence, of unconfessed complicity
And now he feels that rule has to be broken
He speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt
was thinking
that we've never talked, Mamma
When  was little saw you as if you were already old
That's probably true with all kids
Who knows
(She nods, then sits down before him
He strokes her old, skinny, heavily veined hands
) But only now do  realize you were young, you were beautiful, had a whole life before you
But how
(Sighing) how could you have lived alone all that time, with no one to look after you
You could have remarried
Why not
At the time probably wouldn't have understood, but  would have later
doesn't answer, but she is not troubled
An inner peace lends her a sweet, quiet expression
Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence
never had anybody
If that's what you think
didn't want anybody always remained faithful
First to your father, then to you, to Lia
(With a shrug) That's the way 'm made, there's nothing  can do about it
(Smiling) And you're like me, you're too honest and too attached to the things you love
But  don't know if that's a good thing
Faithfulness is a bad business
If you're faithful, you're always alone
( is immersed in the profound truth of those words
And he says nothing
The silence is broken by the ringing of the phone
menacing sound, which cannot bear
He knows they are calling him from Rome, gives a nervous gesture, stands up and pulls out the plug
The silence returns, the whistling of the wind
lowers her eyes
) It's my fault
It would have been better if  hadn't called you
sits down again, leaning closer to her
He stubs out his cigarette in the already overflowing ashtray
(Whispering) No
It's nothing to do with you
It's just that  was scared of coming back
Now, after all these years, thought  was strong, that  had forgotten lots of things
Instead, find it's quite the opposite, as if had never left
And yet,  look at Lia and feel as if  didn't know her, and you, Mamma
abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation
(Interrupting him) And  never asked for one
You have nothing to explain
always thought that what you did was right, and that was that
With no beating around the bush
(Smiling, playing it down) Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night
You never used to do that
She smiles like a little girl who is about to confess the fibs she has told
No, no
When you used to work at the movies,  could never get to sleep at night until you came home
Then when you arrived,  pretended to be asleep, but  heard all your movements
Then when you fell asleep, 'd get up and bolt the door
Then, when you left, every time  did it, felt as if  had left somebody outside the door, far away
( listens to his ' words, surprised and entranced by the poetry of her way of speaking
) But you were right to leave
You succeeded in doing what you wanted to do
(Sighing) When  call you, a different, woman always answers
pretend  know them so they won't have to go through the embarrassment of introducing themselves
(Smiling) 'm sure they take me for a crazy old woman
But so far 've never heard one voice that really loves you would have known
And yet, 'd like to see you
settled down
fall in love
(Gazing into his eyes) But your life's there
Here there are nothing but ghosts, Toto
Let it go
She has said this with a subtle allusiveness in her voice
And realizes she has always known everything
But he doesn't' answer her
They look at each other a Long time without speaking
Their rule of conniving silence has come back into play, as before, forever
It is her expression that tells him to leave, to take the plane and fly away
110
/ But  has not taken his ' advice
Re has not left
Something holds him there still, leads him to go on looking
The ' motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small house
He is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small square, near a cafe
Re has been there some while, but is not nervous, waits there with determination
Several windows in the house are lit, but no one can be seen through the curtains
Nothing but shadows pass by every now and then
Now the light in one of the windows goes out, and the light on the stair goes on
The front door opens and the  comes out with a tall, sturdy- looking, elegantly dressed around fifty
They converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard watches them come out the gate and climb into a car
They look like father and daughter
The car now drives off and passes right by him
gleam of light, the reflection from the headlights, falls on the ' face
He recognizes him at once, from the birthmark on his temple
(To himself) Boccia
His eyes flash, he's afraid he's understood
And now the craze to get to the bottom of it all gnaws away at him
There is no turning back
111
/ ' hands rifle through a phone directory
He is in the cafe, on the other side of the glass door leading to the little square
His finger runs down the column of names
(Mumbling) His last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo
He has already put the token into the slot and dials the number, looking at the two lit upstairs windows of that house, where the mystery of his life may be hiding
hears the first ring, his heart in his throat
shadow appears in one of the windows
And a voice answers
Hello
(It's a woman's voice
shuts his eyes, is about to speak, but the lump in his throat silences him
) Hello
Hello
He still hesitates, can' t get a word out, as if he had lost his voice or didn't know what to say
He hangs up
The shadow at the window also hangs up, then disappears
is at a loss, sits down at one of the rabies near the phone in the almost empty cafe
At the far end, a group of five people watching television
You want something
And he turns back to the television
lights a cigarette
He is uncertain
Once again he has to lake an important decision  redial the number and seek a face behind that shadow
Or forget the whole thing, the , , the shadow, and go away
Yes, best go away
He gets up and leaves
He can be seen through the window turning the comer
pack of cigarettes and a lighter lie on the table, he has forgotten them
And the lighted cigarette bums down in the ashtray
few moments have gone by
Footsteps, and a hand picks up the lighter and the cigarettes
It is  who now, on a sudden urge, slips another token into the slot
The shadow reappears at the window
The same voice as before
Hello, who's speaking
answers at last, keeping his eyes shut, whispering: 'd like to speak to Signora Elena
Speaking
Who is it, please
feels a terrible pang, continues: Salvatore
Silence, charged with tension
Then the voice continues weakly, as if puzzled
Salvatore
who
He runs his hand over his forehead, his eyes, as if to soothe the turmoil he feels inside
Di Vita
Salvatore Di Vita
Do you remember
(Another pause chilly, heavy
opens his eyes, looks at the window
Her shadow is motionless, as if cut out of cardboard
) Elena, 'm here, in the bar, across the street from your house
The shadow moves slowly, a hand pulls aside the curtain
It's a moment of heart- rending emotion
She appears
And they see each other from a distance, after thirty years, each of them with a phone receiver to their ear
But she is somewhat in the dark, against the light, it's impossible to make out her features
Her voice gives a sudden start, instantly controlled
Certainly,  remember
' eyes glisten, try to pierce the distance and the darkness to get a better look, but in vain
Elena
'd like to see you
Let's meet
lets the curtain drop and goes back to being a shadow
She whispers the words
It's been so long
Why should we meet
What good would it do
Please, don't say no
But her voice is firm, unshakeable, even if quivering with emotion
'm old, Salvatore
And you too
It's best not to meet
Goodbye
The shadow hangs up, disappears
The light goes off
112
/ The wind is stronger now, the streets and the square are empty is at the wheel of the car, driving aimlessly around the town
He has rediscovered the woman who conditioned his whole life and they hadn't had the courage to meet
An obsessive musical heat, fraught with rage, pours out of the car radio
113  ' ' phone ringing drowns out the sound of the television and the wind whistling outside
In the half-darkened room,  picks up the receiver
Hello
No one answers, but she can sense the presence of someone who now hangs up
is alarmed
Who could it be at this hour
And where is Toto
114
/ stands motionless on the pier, facing the storm-tossed sea
He feels relieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, but does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes
flashing light seems to approach behind his back
turns and is blinded by the headlights of a car parked at the beginning of the pier
The splattering waves lend the scene a hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights
Now the lights move towards him
And  also lakes a few timid steps forward
They are close
The car has almost stopped
But it is impossible to make out the person at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door
voice can be barely heard over the raging sea
It is 's voice
Salvatore
approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the door
The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open sea and the harbor with its rocking boats
Inside the car, not a word
Two dark figures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to further delay that meeting
The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the others now lights up their faces
was right, they are no longer the faces of teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a truth
The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but and  /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the endless gaze that envelops them
He is the first to break the silence in a faint voice
How'd you know 'd be here
don't know how many years have gone by, but some things about you  do remember
There weren't many, places you could have gone
looked around
turns on the light of the rear-view mirror
Finally they can see better
They look at each other a little ill at ease, making the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces
carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined with wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip
You're still beautiful
Don't be silly
'm old
(She looks down troubled by the way he has of gazing into her eyes, speaks almost mumbling her words
) Don't look at me like that, please
(And she switches off the light
But this time it is less dark, things can be seen
) Why'd you come back
Alfredo died
Do you remember him
Of course  remember him
'm sorry
You were terribly fond of him
moment of silence
It's hard to find something to say
saw your daughter
She's beautiful
Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her
(Smiling) One or two
Bur there're not all that many Salvatores
( also smiles, but a puzzled smile as if what she has said had thrown him off-guard
) 've got a son, too
he's older
And you, do you have children
No
And 'm not married
( sits there in silence
veil of sadness clouds her eyes
' too
) Are you happy
All things considered, yes
Even if it wasn't what  dreamt of then
Again  is thrown off-guard, as if the round key of his enquiry had met with only square locks
She continues
My husband
you know him
Sure, sure
Boccia
(With a bitter smile) What's he do
Politics
He's the district representative
We met at the University in Pisa
Then instinctively, in a shy voice,  asks the question that he probably wouldn't have asked a moment later
And
how come you never married that guy from Tuscany
The white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier, dashing against the car windows
The shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on the agony of their faces
hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but haughty smile
didn't want to
had to fight tooth and nail
But in the end won
( is unable to smile
It's as if the void were growing and swelling within
Thunder and lightning shatter the roaring of the wind and sea, hut it does not rain
Now her smile Jades away
) At that time
was waiting for you
There is no resentment in her words
She has said them fondly
With the serenity of someone who has suffered greatly and then found a strong convincing way of suffering no more
For , it's as if one of those thunderbolts had pierced his heart
He leans over, gazing into her shining eyes
But 've never forgotten you, Elena
(Whispering) Nor have
Even though you disappeared
( is staggered, feels as if he were plunging into the void
What she has said strikes him as grotesque strokes his hair, as if to restrain his sinking heart, gives a sweet smile
) But what's the point of talking about it
We risk being pathetic and ridiculous
(And she tries to change the subject
) You still live in Rome
But  ignores the question
He doesn't want to change the subject
He feels that everything is crumbling inside him, the alibis and excuses he had had to give himself in order to accept the end of their romance
And instead, now the tables seem to have completely turned
Without realizing, he shouts desperately, staring wildly at her and shaking her by the shoulders
What do you mean, you were waiting for me
What are you saying
(He controls himself at once, continues, breathing heavily
) The last time we saw each other, we made a date to meet at the Cinema Paradiso
You remember
And you didn't come, you disappeared without leaving a trace, nothing
'll tell you how many years have gone by: more than thirty
Quiet rears stream down Elena's face, glisten with the reflections of the lightning and the waves
kept that date
( laughs at the absurdity of it nervous, heartbroken laugh, which slowly melts away as she goes on to say:) But  was late
(Tears continue to stream out of her blue eyes, but she tells her story in a calm voice
) had a fight with my family
tried to convince them again that they couldn't separate us
But it was futile
They had decided to leave Sicily once and for all
Which is what we did
didn't know what to do any more, what to say
And  said yes, 'd do whatever they wanted
In return, my father promised to let me see you one last time, to say goodbye
But  hoped that by seeing each other we could take advantage of it and make a decision
thought we would run away together
(She holds back her sobs
Dries her tears with the back of her hand, and continues:) My father drove me to the movie theatre
But you weren't in the projection booth
Only Alfredo
Her voice continues over the scene of same thirty years before
115
Flashback
' (Off-screen) And  didn't have time to wait for you to comeback
From the bottom of the spiral staircase, '  is waiting nervously, yells up at the projection booth
' Elena
Hurry up
All right, Daddy
In the projection booth,  is sitting on a stool, near the projector
Seen from the rear, the   is leaning over beside him, she is excited, her eyes are red and swollen with tears
' (Off-screen) So  told Alfredo how things stood and fiat  was leaving the same evening, and  asked him to tell you everything
He was very kind, he listened carefully, then
answers  , stroking her hair
Easy, easy
(Sighing) Listen carefully to what  have to say
If you want me to tell Toto what you've told me,  will
But if you want my advice, forget it
It's better for both of you if you don't see each other
(  gives a start of resentment, listens with surprise
) Dear girl, fire always turns into ashes
Even the deepest love ends sooner or later
And after that other loves appear, lots of them
Toto, he can't understand fiat now
If  tell him he won't believe it, he' d be capable of killing me
But you can understand, you've got to understand
Do it for him
116 sits there without moving, pale as a sheet, looks as if he had grown even older
As if the whole world has fallen in on him
For , it was a painful but liberating story
She dries her last tears
It's the first time 've had to chance to tell the story
never mentioned it to anybody
(In a daze) Alfredo, damn him
He cast his spell on you too
told him 'd take his advice
But before  went away  left you that note
( gives her a quick look, a questioning look
He listens
) was on my way down the stairs
(Her voice continues, laid over the
) 117
Flashback has already said goodbye to , is on her way down the stairs, but stops short
' (Off-screen) thought Alfredo couldn't see me
So snuck back up
(She tip-toes back without making any noise
Goes over to the film-winder
Takes out a pen, looks for a scrap of paper, but doesn't see any
Her eyes fall on the film receipts hanging on the nail
She tears off the top one, turns it over and scribbles a message on the back
) wrote you where you could find me, and that 'd wait for you
She hangs the scrap of paper back on the nail, well in sight
She creeps out, glancing at , who hasn't noticed a thing
118
/ finishes telling her story
She heaves a Jeep sigh
But you disappeared all the same
There is a haunted look in 's eyes, he is searching his memory for something he can't find, then suddenly sees, as if in a dream
his hand thirty years before going through the routine gesture of hanging a receipt on the nail, over the others, mechanically, without even looking
and he shuts his eyes as if fearing the truth
Her last words have wounded him
He shakes his head, then in a faint voice: Oh, how  looked for you, Elena
You'll never know
wrote, telephoned, nothing
Nobody ever answered
But  dreamt of you for years
That's why  went away
and never came back here
(And his anguish breaks free, dissolving into quiet, almost childish tears
is startled by his reaction
She caresses him, passionately
They embrace and remain like that, she with her face buried in his shoulder, he leaning on hers with his tear- filled eyes
) Even as the years passed, in all the women  met,  was only looking for you
had success it's true, but there was always something missing
(She is deeply moved, goes on caressing him gently until he calms down
The car windows are steamed up
The sea, the harbor, the waves have disappeared
Nothing remains but the sound of the storm
takes her face between his hands
They gaze at each other, their faces practically touching
He murmurs:) 'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me
crazy lunatic
(She gives a faint smile
) He wasn't crazy
In the beginning was upset
think  really hated him
But then, with time, understood what he said
and your silence too
whispers one last dreadful revelation
And it's as if he had got a terrible weight off his chest
But  never saw that note
(He squints, as if to stress the absurdity of the idea
) must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation
(But strangely enough, is not surprised
) What difference does it make to find an explanation
That's the way it went
But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you
Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films
And that would have been a pity
Because they're wonderful, 've seen them all
(Her eyes glitter with joy, then she smiles, almost ironically
) But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name
You should have kept your own
Tears stream down Salvatore's cheeks
He gives her a look of longing, of desire
embraces him
They kiss with heartrending tenderness, with the same passion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces, so many years ago
And they make love, clasped in the cramped quarters of the car, like two teenagers
Passionate kisses, embraces, deep sighs
Their hair damp with sweat, their hands clasping, their fingers interweaving
Then the frenzy subsides into a deep, tumultuous pleasure, of immense loving and immense grief
As outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which seems suspended in empty space
) 119  ' ' ' hands place an old wooden stool and a rusty round metal can on the table
These are the things he left to you
is sitting by the table
He has finished the cup of coffee has prepared for him
He picks up the stool, recognizes it at once: it's the one  had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put the reels on the projector
When they showed your films on television, he was happy
He'd plop himself down there and all his ailments were forgotten
He knew all the words by heart, every one, and 'd describe what was going on
And when the papers talked about you,  had to read them two or three times
examines the can, wonders what it can be
He opens it: inside is a reel of film, wrapped in a plastic bag, well preserved
Those objects bring a pang to his heart, and the things that  said, but he feels disappointed, as if he expected to find something else
Did he ever think of meeting me
No, never
One time your mother said that if he wanted, you'd have surely come
He got furious and said  'No, Toto mustn't come back to Giancaldo, never
' He didn't say it to be mean
He was a decent man
Who knows what he could have been thinking
Towards the end he'd say such strange things
And a moment before he shut his eyes, he told your mother not to let you know
120 cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly to the ground another handful is flung up
is in the projection booth, looking through the countless yellowed receipts, stuffed away in boxes
He looks at them one by one, then throws them into the air
desperate search, almost a defiance of the passing of time
He continues with greater determination, flings piles of receipts into the air, glances at a few dates, a film title, tries to discover the oldest dates at the bottom
He moves swiftly, his hands plunge in, then fling up a nimbus of paper and dust
But to no avail
He stops, short of breath
His eyes go over to the nails in the wall, where other stacks of receipts are hanging
He gets up and goes to look at them, thumbs " it through them hastily, in anger
He yanks off two or three packs, which come off, nail and all
Only then does he notice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more sheets, much older, almost brown
His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of paper
He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately, because they crumble in his fingers
And then all of a sudden, some film titles he recognizes from that time
He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once an astonished look appears on his face  in his hands is a receipt that has been turned over
It's the one
The message scribbled on it can still be seen
He reads it
' (Off-screen) Salvatore, forgive me
'll explain later what happened
Not finding you here was terrible
Unfortunately, this evening, my mother and  are leaving for Tuscany
We're moving there
But you' re the only one love, 'll never be with anybody else,  promise
Here's the address of a girlfriend of mine where you can write to me
Don't abandon me
Love and kisses, Elena
He clasps the scrap of paper, and his brimming eyes darken with regret

/ stands near the window overlooking the little square, listening on the phone to ' voice
She can see him through the transparent curtain speaking on the phone down below in the cafe
When are you leaving
opens his eyes, tosses away his cigarette
This afternoon
Elena, in the future maybe we could
interrupts him, speaks softly, tenderly
No, Salvatore
there is no future
There's only the past
Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream
(Smiling) We never did it when we were kids, remember
(Down in the cafe, nods his head slowly, desperately
) Now that it's happened,  don't think there could have been a better ending
(It's farewell glances one last time at that window
) 'll never agree with you
Never, Elena
122 The square, unusually empty
There is no one, and no cars and motorcycles are parked in the middle
The stores are shut
And there is an unreal silence
The houses on the two streets on either side of the theatre are covered by enormous pieces of gray canvas
Only now does the camera discover in the distance, a crowd of curious onlookers waiting in front of the movie house, kept at a safe distance by firemen and policemen
Old  is in the crowd
is also there
Be gazes at the front of the old movie theatre
123 The inside of the theatre, completely empty
All of a sudden, a blinding flash and
124 a deafening roar rends the air, accompanied by a surge of amazement in the crowd
And the Cinema Paradiso suddenly collapses, folds inward and disappears for ever in a gigantic cloud of white smoke that rises into the air, carried by the wind towards the crowd
125  ' The echo of the explosion is also heard in ' house
She is alone
And the bang distresses her, as if something had burst inside her
From her face to
126 's face, stiff, unmoving, his eyes fixed on those falling ruins, on that season of his life turning into smoke and dust
Enveloped in the white cloud,  stands crying in silence
Mice dart out of the ruins in terror, scamper nervously into the square
group of youngsters scream, amused and excited
Among them, ' , smiling
sees her joking with friends and pointing to some boys chasing the mice across the square, hooting and laughing
As a white-haired , filthy and covered in rags, makes his way through the crowd
There is an empty look in his eyes and he repeats obsessively in a low voice: The square's mine, the square's mine, the square's mine
recognizes him, it's the  , the one who used to close down the square at night
Be watches him walk off, raving, with nobody even noticing
The crowd now moves over to the huge empty space where the movie house once stood
The murmuring voices are drowned out by the deafening roar of an airplane
From the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso, fade to

Now the lights go down
The beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth and the screen lights up
number trailer goes by and then  sees the first shots
start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him, astounds him, delights him
It's the best piece of film he has ever seen
It consists of all the kisses  cut out of the films and kept for him, when he was a little boy
They have been spliced together, one , after the other, at random, same of them even upside down
And yet it looks like a first- rate editing job
In rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses, names famous and names unknown in the history of movies

whole movie season summed up in a few fragments, a few seconds
bizarre, poignant, melancholy parade
is overwhelmed, moved to tears
It is the most profound act of love he has ever seen
He laughs as tears shine in his eyes
Up on the screen, another kiss, the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film
And the age-old words appear ' '
