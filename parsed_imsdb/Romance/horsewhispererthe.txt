his eyes
He shakes his head and stamps his feet
He seems confined
Eager to run
- Pilgrim bursts through the stall and runs out the stables into a blinding white morning
- Whiteness
Snow and sky without any discernible line between
Camera is , as if on the horse, riding through the whiteness
Snow kicks up from the side
We hear the breathing of the horse
As we travel on hills, through trees, we experience of sense of wild, exhilarating freedom
We hear the giggles of a  () on the horse
An occasional line; (
) Yeah, fly boy
that's it
go
go
go
as we  : '  - Grace awakens, calmly
Takes a breath
Slides out of bed and stands before a window, overlooking a beautiful Connecticut country house
We see a snow-covered field and distant woods
Grace presses her faces against the cold, frosted window eager to get out
- Alarm rings,   awakens
She shuts the alarm and scoots up in bed
She waits
Seconds later the television across the foot of her bed turns on from a timer -- to a 24  channel
/ & '  - Grace, fully dressed except for her boots, tiptoes past a partially opened bedroom door
Her father  is asleep, alone, on his huge king size bed
- Grace is putting on her boots on a bench beside a back door
She is wearing her mother's outfit
As she slides the boot on, we see behind her a row of framed photos -- Robert, Grace and Annie in happy times
She slaps a note on the refrigerator, with a magnet -- "Gone riding
Back around 10
Love,
" ,   - Grace slips on her jacket and hat as she comes down the steps, her feet hitting the walk
- Annie's feet hit the ground, running -- her breath showing in the cold air
She passes other joggers with ease
She crosses the street and heads for an elegant  building
'    - Dressed in running clothes, Annie opens the door and picks up several newspapers that were delivered
She carries them into the kitchen and sets them beside a huge stack of publications, magazines, papers, etc
Knowing she must read all of them at some point, she breathes a disgusted sign
She thumbs through the  as she pours herself a cup of coffee
Something catches her eyes and she snarls: That little shit
She dials a portable phone and moves through the apartment as she talks: Hi Lucy
Did  wake you
Have you read the Post
They've got a little item about me and Fiske
He's saying  fired him and that  faked the new circulation figures
Ha, ha
Oh, please
It's the last act of a desperate gnome
Set up a phone call with Don Farlow for 9:30
Throughout the phone call, Annie is selecting clothes, turning on the shower, undressing
- The snow has stopped falling
Grace walks along a hill, hands in pocket
Spread out on the landscape are horses, on a horse farm, standing like statues in the white covered fields
As Grace comes along the hill, we see another  () coming from the opposite direction
She doesn't have Grace's lean elegance but her warm, friendly smile brightens her face
Upon reaching her, Grace returns the smile with a hug
It's warmer than  thought
You want to go to a movie tonight
thought your mom's coming up
(prickly) So
Judith immediately senses a problem so she continues casually, as they begin walking away from Camera
My parents are having friends from college over
They're really nice
They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger
Can  come
'll start a fire
Judith laughs as they continue talking, their voices trailing off, as the girls head for the stables
,     - There are several horses in their stalls
Grace and Judith enter, talking, carrying their English saddles
Judith stops at a stall, disappearing into it as she says "Hello
"
, Grace continues to the end stall
Pilgrim (the horse from the dream) stands looking at her
Hello, beautiful boy
He's a massive figure beside her but she shows no inhibition
She enters, touching his muzzle
He plays with her by nudging her back
Stop
Will you stop
- They lead their horses, now saddled and ready, from the barn
Pilgrim tosses his head, prancing, playing with the snow
Show-off
The girls mount the horses and ride off together
'   - - Annie, casually dressed, enters the empty offices of her magazine
She turns on the light, revealing a large row of stalls and glassed in private offices
Everywhere we look, we see indications of the kind of magazine she edits
She strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by windows
The office walls are covered with photos, most of which are
(One photo is of Annie's father with his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately around his neck
Her mother stands right behind them, posing like a member of the royal family
) Annie sits and takes a breath
The only photo on her desk is a family portrait, taken when Annie was given the Crystal Award -- Robert, Grace, herself and the Award
She checks her watch -- it is almost 9:30
,  / - - -  of the master bedroom; one side is Annie's, one side is Robert's
Robert stands before his bureau in the closet -- he has just showered and is putting on his watch and ring which lay beside his cologne assortment in India -- younger, vibrant, in love
when they first met
Robert enters into the bedroom to pick up
Hello
: They speak in dulled, emotionless voices: It's me
Hi
Hi
Awkward pause
So, what, uh, what train are you taking
should be in by two
Okay
You want me to pick you up
Sure
What's Grace up to
Riding with Judith
Beat
'm sorry about last night
shouldn't have brought it up over the phone
That's okay
We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place so
just have to get used to it
(beat) What do you want to do about dinner
don't know
We'll figure it out
Pause
There is a lot unspoken but understood between them
Annie's other phone line rings
Robert hears it as well
Okay
We'll see you later then
Yeah
Bye
Annie picks up the other line and her manner brightens, her energy boosts
My love, how are you
Did you hear about Fiske
No, suing is too civilized
Can't we get your friend at Le Cirque to serve him a fatal piece of poached salmon
Ha, ha
That's even better
- Long Shot of the girls riding at an easy pacing, talking all the time
Grace is an elegant rider, quite self-assured for a 13-year-old
We come into the scene at the moment the girls have just shared a secret or a fantasy
Judith is giggling uncontrollably
Grace laughs as she says: Oh, come on
You think the same thing
just could never say it
They stop at the end of the field, facing the woods
Do you want to go around by the old road
Why don't we just cut through the woods
Grace nods
They ride into the woods, continuing their talk
- The girls ride down, along a stand of hickories and poplars to a
They stop the horses and their conversation, to listen to the sound of the water
Below them, off in the distance, they can just make out a two-lane country road
You want to go down or stay along the river
We already did the river
Let's go down and across the old bridge
We can circle back
They begin to make their way
'  - Annie's office is now crowded with a dozen or so employees; sitting on the couch, on the window sills, on the arms of chairs, against the walls
Paper bag emptied of bagels, cream cheese, orange juice, paper plates
Hand Held Camera captures the energy of the room as it follows overlapping lines, laughter, etc
yet, no matter how casual it all seems, Annie is very much at the center of control
We enter the scene of , as Annie asks , a feature writer: So what did you say to her
said, thank you very much
(,  ) really should do the interview
But perhaps if you'd like to have dinner
Everyone starts Ad Libbing
Dinner
He's so cute
Why don't get those kind of interviews
Look, he has husband number eight written on his forehead
All right, all right, all right
Kevin, good job
Write the interview
If  don't like it, you may have to sleep with her for a follow-up
(laughter) Now
'm thinking about another fashion designer spread
Who's news out there
Characters shout out designer names and comments as the phone rings and  picks up
speaking amdist the talking
Hold on
(presses hold) Gottschalk
The room goes dead quiet, instantly
Then erupts in laughter as everyone realizes it
Annie, however, waves her hand as she takes the phone
Quiet
Quiet
Everyone obeys
Annie presses
David
() Who's there
Everyone
Working overtime
Just for you
() Did you speak to Farlow
Yes
We're suing
() Is that absolutely necessary
It'll just make it a bigger story
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying  faked the figures
You're not going soft on me, are you
Silence
Gottschalk doesn't immediately respond
Everyone waits
Covert looks between characters suggest this is interesting -- has Annie over-stepped her bounds with the magazine's owner
Annie waits without a shred of anxiety -- even though she might have some
Finally: () Well,  suppose we could use another good public feud
Exactly
Everyone silently acknowledges Annie guts and influence
- It's perfectly still
We are looking down an empty - covered with fresh snow
We see the girls slowly riding out of the woods, talking
They cross the road and start up into the woods on the other side
They are trying to sing a song, "" / (singing) " met him at a party and he told me how he like to drive me home
He said he liked to do it backwards
" (singing) "
said it--" (singing) "
and  said that"
(stops singing) No, wait, it just goes
"he said he liked to do-"
Suddenly there's the      ' scraping on some sheer ice hidden under the soft snow
Judith notices first
What was -- The horse staggers
Judith looks to Grace -- Grace
The horse tries to find tracing with his hindfeet, kicking up sprays of snow and ice shards
The horse suddenly falls on the ice and goes down hard on its knees
The horse stumbles to get back on its feet, slipping again
Frightened, it rears and Judith, caught off balance, is thrown, her foot catching in the stirrup
Her horse, unable to find its balance, starts to slide backward down the incline
,
Grace, directly behind Judith, tries to turn Pilgrim to avoid being hit by the errant horse
What follows, we see from Grace's perspective
The details that form the images and sounds of Grace's mind are fast, disembodies, almost surreal as -- Judith's horse bulldozes into Pilgrim, taking his legs out from under him, sending both horses careening down the icy slope
Grace hangs onto Pilgrim's neck
Judith, her leg helplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head bouncing on the frozen ground
They slide all the way back down to the
Pilgrim is the first to find his legs and stand
Grace manages to sit up in the saddle
She sees Judith's horse stumbling back onto its feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in confused circles, dragging Judith -- her face bleeding, her leg hanging from the stirrup
(frightened) Jude, you okay
(softly, crying) 'm okay
'm okay
She tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup
Grace sees it before she hears it
off of steel
We then hear the rumbling  of a  coming around the bend
The Girls on their horses in the middle of the road
The Truck, an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment, comes around the turn
Grace grabs the bridle, trying to get Judith's horse out of the road
The driver, seeing them, lays on the air horn
The Horses bolt at the sound, the bridle slipping out of Grace's hand
The horses turn apart
The Driver starts furiously downshifting, trying to brake
He seems to get it under control when suddenly    on some ice
It begins to slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack- knifing
The truck literally plows over the helpless Judith and her horse -- the horse going down on the pavement, Judith disappearing under him
The truck's cab, like a mythic monster, heads right for Grace and Pilgrim
Grace looks right into the Driver's helpless, frightened eyes
Suddenly, Pilgrim rears up at the truck, sending Grace flying, bouncing her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck
Pilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his hooves caught between the rear-view mirrors like some grotesque ornament
His head and chest slams into the window, shattering through the glass
And then it is still
The truck has stopped halfway in the road
Judith's horse lies in the road, motionless
Pilgrim, on the truck's hood, his legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding
He shrieks, struggling to get to his feet
He manages to free his legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off, wounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods
The Driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in shock
He sits on the ground
All we hear is the sound of the river and the wind in the trees
Grace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the beautiful morning sky
/ - '  on the refrigerator as Robert enters from the outside with two bags of groceries
He places them on the counter near the
He sees   is there
He presses  as he puts away the groceries
the   and he picks up, with the machine still playing
(on phone) Hello
Paul, hi -- are you guys back
How was it
Oh that sounds great
Oh Paul
hold on
(on machine) Robert
Are you there
Robert
It's Liz
Look, there's
there's been an accident
Uh
Jesus
uh
As Robert listens, the voice of Liz's on the machine from inside, pulls his attention
On hearing "accident," Robert lowers the receiver, frozen, as he listens to Liz
(on machine) Robert, just call me on my call phone
1-917-449-7805
- Pilgrim is hiding in the shadows under an old railroad bridge, standing up to his knees in the river
His chest is cut open, bleeding
His face cut, contorted and swollen
, the local veterinarian, hides a hypodermic needle in her jacket, quietly walking into the water
Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim, whose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water
He watches Liz
She is almost to him when suddenly he bolts, running upstream
The Policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm
Frightened, Pilgrim wheels back toward Liz, who manages to stick the hypo in his neck
He rears, knocking her down, then runs out of the river, the hypo still in his neck
He runs for the sanctuary of the woods
- Annie sits on a train -- her laptop out, notes beside her, her cellular phone, ever-ready
The train passes through beautiful countryside but Annie is focused on an editorial she's writing
The train pulls into a station and stops, causing Annie to take a break and stretch her arms and neck
She looks out the window for the first time and sees: , his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform
She watches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young children, who are getting off the train
He picks them up as his wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm around his waist
The children talk a mile a minute and the father listens to every word
Annie doesn't even realize she is staring
As they leave the platform, she turns back to her laptop
As the train begins to move again, Annie returns to work
She answers
Yeah
Hi
made the 1:00 so
The expression on her face sinks into a stunned panic
,  - Annie is running through the corridors, her bags in tow
She sees Robert standing in the corridor talking to a
She runs for them
When she appears, Robert and the Doctor stop their conversation
Robert looks to Annie, who is waiting for news
Robert is teary eyed, beaten down
Judith's dead
Annie's horrified, waiting for news of Grace
What about Grace
She was in pretty bad shape
They've done a
Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging
But nothing we can't handle
(impatient) Where is she now
Surgery
Surgery
For what-
(interrupting) Annie, her leg was shattered -- what they call the distal epi
epi
Distal epicondyle of the femur
(quietly, crying) They have to take the leg off
Annie responds without tears and cries but with a quiet shock
We can tell her mind is racing, trying to process the information, until finally she asks: Which leg
The Doctor and Robert are surprised by the question
What difference does it make
Annie stares for a beat, then nods apologetically
- Pilgrim is sedated, lying in his own blood in the snow, surrounded by Police and trackers
He is being attended to by , who is dictating to her assistant: His skull, cheek, and nose are severely fractured
He has a deep chest wound
'm not even sure it can be closed
(deadpan, local accent) Animal should be put down -- anybody can see that
Liz looks up to him, resentfully, but knows he's right
'   - Camera moves from Grace's face down her body to Robert's hand, which rubs her good leg
He looks at her lovingly, pushing the hair from her forehead
Annie, needing to do something, tenderly straightens Grace's blankets
It is plain to see where her leg had once been
Robert can't look
Annie, one to face her fears, bravely looks at it head on
She notices the
Bag and rises on: That bag's almost empty
(looking) No, it's got a little left
They'll be in to change it
(as she exits) Robert, you leave it up these people
Robert is about to respond but Annie is already out the door
We hear the
as Robert listens
(
) Excuse me, my daughter needs a new (
) We have her down, we'll be right in
(
) 'd like it taken care of now please
Annie enters first
You have to keep on top of these people or else they just sit on their -- But Robert is ignoring her
Facing Grace, smoothing away her hair
He's giving her the silent treatment
Annie knows this means Robert doesn't approve of her dictatorial behavior
Annoyed, she turns away as well
The Nurse enters with a new bag and begins to replace the old one as Robert backs away
'm sorry
Tch
What are you -- Annie, about to respond to his inappropriate politeness, is stopped by Robert, who finally looks at her
It's a powerful look that tells her to calm down and shut up
It's a look that, for all of Robert's sensitivity, affects Annie
She gets the message and stays calm
As the nurse leaves, Annie is about to say thank you, but Robert beats her to it
Thank you
Annie and Robert stand facing each other, when the
Annie picks up
- on a cellular, walking away from the crowd
Annie, it's Liz
How's Grace
(journalistic) Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh
remove it
She had some bleeding but it's under control
Oh God, Annie, 'm so sorry know you're being hit with a low now, don't want to take too much of your time but  have to talk to you about Pilgrim
Annie hears the name as if it's some distant echo she can't quite identify; Liz speaks quickly as Annie watches Grace breathing in her sleep -- It's not good
've never seen an animal with these injuries still breathing know this is difficult to hear right now 'd like your permission to put him down
It's the really best thing we can do for -- That was too much information for Annie; Wait, uh, ,  don't understand
Start again -- He's alive
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain
Well, of course, right
What is it
(overlapping) We really shouldn't wait
(overlapping) Hold on, Liz
(to Robert) Something about Pilgrim
The Doctor pokes his head in
(overlapping) Mr
and Mrs
MacLean
(overlapping) -- put him down
She says
(overlapping, to Doctor) Yes
Hi
(to Annie) Tell her you'll call her back
He exits with the Doctor
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and just can't, uh
talk now
so -- (interrupting) understand, but Annie, please
(overlapping) - See, what you can do for him --
(overlapping) Annie, no matter what  do, this horse will never be the same
just don't know right now
Do whatever you can and when Grace is -- It isn't right to make him suffer
And  can say the same thing about my daughter
But she is suffering
Can you solve that problem
(Liz is quiet) can't deal with this now, Liz
If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it
Not until  know Grace is all right
Now, please
Just do what you can
Okay
(softer) Please
Liz is stopped by Annie's almost pleading tone
All right
They hang up
Annie takes a breath
Robert re-enters
What did he say
Nothing new
He's just going off duty
Beat
Silence
'm going to get all the nurses' names
It's good to know all their names
Robert nods
But neither of them moves
They stand motionless for a beat, then Annie begins to break down and eases herself into Robert's arms
Robert embraces her, kissing her head, with an almost fatherly comfort
His expression tells us it's the moment he's been expecting
and wanting
Now she'll be all right, in his arms
Whatever distance between them, whatever problems felt insurmountable last night on the phone, are now, for the moment -- for Robert -- gone
But Annie's expression tells us something different
Her instinct to hold him was honest
but the effect isn't the same anymore
Something doesn't feel right
Something isn't working anymore about his comforting embrace
should go get some of her things
No, let me go
(gently pushing away) No, 'll go
You stay
In case she wakes up
,   - line of recovery stalls with various sick and hurt animals
Liz, exhausted asleep, on a chair outside a stall
There's a slight scratching sound
hoof against the stall
It gets louder, awakening Liz
She gets up and looks inside the paddled stall: Pilgrim is lying in the stall, heavily bandaged
He is waking up
His first instinct is to kick at the paddled stall walls
He looks at Liz, his eyes filled with madness -- enraged to still be alive
'    - Annie opens the door and enters, flicking on the light
Camera is on her back, as she places a small suitcase on the bed and opens it
She begins her task with cool efficiency
Opening drawers and closets, assessing what should be taken, what isn't necessary
Suddenly, she stops
She feels disoriented for a moment
She can't remember the last time she was inside this room
She takes a moment to pause and actually look around
In the light, we now see more of Grace's inner sanctum
Horse riding prize ribbons in various colors adorn the walls
Books
girl's bureau cluttered with teenage possession ranging from childhood toys to items that suggest a reaching towards adulthood
Annie examines some items, affectionately
from India sits among her things
Annie takes it to pack in the suitcase
She notices a framed 8X10 of Grace sitting proudly atop Pilgrim with Judith at her heel
She then notices the edge of another picture behind this one, in the frame
She pulls the Pilgrim photo out to reveal: An old 8X10 of Annie hugging Grace as a toddler
With her back to Camera, Annie remembers: : '  - Annie is playing with toddler Grace
Chasing her around the room
Picking her and tossing her onto a small, toddler bed
Blowing into her stomach
Grace is laughing uncontrollably
Annie slides the Pilgrim picture back into the frame, then returns to her task of packing
'   - Annie enters
No one else is there
She places the suitcase on a chair and opens it
She takes out the and some horse books, and places them on her bedside table
She takes care to prop up the Lucky Charm
She wets a cloth with some water from a pitcher and gently wipes Grace's sweaty brow
, instead of in Country House
Annie then continues unpacking the suitcase
She opens Grace's closet and sees a hospital bag filled with Grace's clothes at the time of the accident
Annie examines them and discovers they are hers
Annie shoves the clothes into a bag and starts unpacking
- - The Clock is ticking on the wall
The cafeteria is empty except for one tired Intern, drinking coffee on a break
Robert and Annie are having a cup of coffee
In the silence, they search for things to say
Until: saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment
(Annie listens) wanted to say something
(beat) But
was so relieved that Grace was still
that it wasn't our daughter
We're very lucky
(nods) The funeral's on Friday
He rises and crosses to the self-help coffee dispenser as he continues
Oh, uh,  meant to tell you
Alex brought that fabric over
Okay
It's on the table by the phone
didn't know what to tell him
(returns to table, sits) Whether or not we were
(beat) if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch
Annie just nods
She senses Robert is looking for some kind of reassurance, but she can't give it to him
He continues; And uh
Mario called about moving the wisteria
Oh
Right
'll call him
Pause
Annie looks at her husband as he stares off to the side, deep in his thoughts
She can sense he's sinking as he fidgets with the napkins
She remembers: : ,  - younger Annie stands in a bathrobe, noticeably pregnant, cooking at a stove -- reading instructions from a propped up cookbook
as she sings along, in full voice, without inhibitions; "' '
" younger Robert, wearing a suit, arrives home from work
Seeing her, he smiles affectionately
He puts down his briefcase and bursts into his own playful Sinatra impersonation: "She loves the free
" Startled, Annie turns around and smiles: (sexily undoing his tie) "
, ' ' ''
(a la fan) Sing it to me, Frankie
(a la Sinatra cool) How's my pregnant chick
She moves to him and they embrace
He wraps his arms around her
They kiss
Annie laughs
You can hardly get your arms around me
How depressing
You're so early
had to excuse myself from a meeting
It's ridiculous
kept thinking about the baby
you
and,  swear,  was going to start bawling right into my briefs
(loving it) Aw
that's so sweet
love you
Do you
Do you really
They turn to each other and kiss
- - Annie and Robert sit silently at the table in an empty hospital cafeteria, a lifetime later
'   - The room's lights are dimmed
Dawn is being to break through
Grace, slowly, opens her eyes coming out of sedation
She takes a moment to figure out where she is
to remember
She uses her hands to hoist herself up, but she's unsteady and knocks into her bedside table -- knocking the Good Luck Charm from India off the table
It rolls under the bed, with a water tumbler
Grace never sees the Charm
Grace looks where her leg once was
She feels the blanket, the empty space where her leg once was
just like her mother did (did her father couldn't)
Instead of self-pity, she's oddly fascinated
: '   - Daylight pours in
Robert and Annie enter
Robert, loaded with gifts, immediately crosses to Grace, on the side of her good leg
Annie takes her position beside the lost leg
Robert kisses his daughter; Hi, sweetheart
Annie's hand finds Grace's hand, and holds one of her fingers tightly
Grace responds by wrapping her hand around her mother's
They exchange a look of respect and gratitude
Have you heard from Judith's parents
No, not yet
How's Pilgrim doing
Liz is taking care of him
(to change the subject) The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can -- can't even get out of bed yet
You're already putting me in therapy
Annie, slightly hurt, drops it as Robert takes over: The doctor said whenever you're ready
Take your time
You tell us
But he thinks it'll only be a few months, then -- As Robert continues talking, Annie drifts to the Nurse
Needing to manage something, she asks: Did you get her fresh towels
: - limousine drives up as the Doorman gets the car door
The weather is slightly warmer
People's clothing looks as if spring is coming nearer
Annie exits first, carrying a jacket for Grace
She is followed by Robert, who immediately turns to help Grace
We hear her
(
) Dad
can do it,
,
Annie shoots him a disapproving look
We see Grace's good leg exit first
then two crutches, followed by
a
Grace scoots into view, and takes a breath
You all go ahead
'll be up by Christmas
- The three sit at a dinner table, eating dinner
Grace picks at her food
Robert can't help staring at her
Annie eats, watching them both
Do you want something else, honey
We order something else
No, 'm just not that hungry
Why don't you go lie down
don't want to lie down
've been lying down enough
You want to watch some television
(edgy) Maybe
look -- just
Robert and Annie wait
She doesn't continue
She rises, reaching for her crutches
Robert moves to help
got it
got it
She exits into her room
Annie looks at him disapprovingly
' / - Annie and Robert stand before their separate sinks, talking to each other through their separate mirrors, as they wash up for bed
You've got to stop doing that
Doing what
Helping all the time
Running to her every time she trips or falls
Anticipating her all the time
Robert shuts off his sink and dries his face, without a word
He exits into the bedroom, and gets into bed
For a beat, he stares up at the ceiling -- then says quite plainly
You know, Annie, this didn't just happen to you
Annie is applying moisturizer when she hears this
As it sinks in, she doesn't like it
'  - Grace stands by her door and can hear her parents muffled, tense voices
Annie is angry at his complacency
Robert just wants what's best for Grace
She closes the door
Silence
She puts her crutches against the wall and tries to walk towards her bureau without them
It is a struggle, but she does
almost falling, but grabbing the bureau just in time
The 8X10 of her and Pilgrim, falls face down
She props it up and looks at it -- focusing on her horse, then on Judith
Suddenly, she lashes out, knocking the photograph onto the floor
(
) Honey, you all right
Did something fall
(angrily shouts) '   - Annie pulls up in a Range Rover and stops
Grace moves for the door
Annie asks respectfully; Do you want any help
Grace doesn't even bother to answer
She manages to get onto the pavements, then turns for her bag
Annie notices other kids looking at Grace from behind, as they enter the school
Dad'll pick you up today, all right
Okay
Grace looks up to her mother
What is unspoken between them is the understanding that today will be difficult and there's nothing either one can do about it
You'll be fine
Grace nods and turns to the school
Annie watches her go
'  - Grace makes her way through the hall
It is the first time she has had to maneuver through a crowd
Some of the younger children are especially unconscious
Grace sweats her way through, trying to maintain her balance and her sanity
As Grace slowly moves along, whatever small faith she had that she could get through this day, begins to diminish
'  - Annie moves about the office, hands in pocket, in front of her wall of windows
and her staff sitting around the office
Annie is speaking to a   staff member; don't care what he told you
The man's a liar
The man's an actor, for Christ's sake
They're all liars
They'll say anything to get a cover
The Young Woman looks insulted
comes in to give Annie a note; '  - Annie is crossing an empty school yard
Grace is sitting on the ground, her back against a wall, her "legs" in front of her
She has been crying
She looks up to her mother
It's too hard
Annie kneels before her sympathetically brushing her hair away: Oh, honey
What happened
Doesn't matter
don't want to come back, that's all
(softly) Oh
Well, what are you going to do
You have to go to school, honey
mean, what -- (snaps) 'm not coming back
That's it
want to go home
Grace, listen to me
Your body is just healing
You have to give the rest of you time as well
Is that your version of a pep talk
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself
You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out
(snotty) Fine
It's still early
What's your next class
With secret delight, Grace viciously utters the word: Gym
'  - Annie is at her desk studying Grace's book on Horse Whisperers
Robert is on his bed with briefs laid out before him
'  - The door is closed
blares on her stereo
Grace is in her bed watching a video of her and Pilgrim
riding at a horse show
There's a shot of Annie standing proudly, watching her ride
Another shot of her and Judith, both of them on their horses, waving to camera
- Grace enters
Dad
Both Robert and Annie look up
What, sweetheart
(beat) want to see Pilgrim
Robert and Annie exchange an anxious look
,  - It's raining
The MacLean car is parked by the barn
They are walking towards the stables under their umbrellas as Liz runs to greet them
Hello
(to Grace) It's so good to see you
How ya doing
She's doing just grea
Aren't you kiddo
'm fine
Well, come on
He's out back now
(leads them) Mind how you go
It's pretty muddy back there
Why is he in the back
Why isn't he in the barn with the other horses
Liz stops, causing everyone to stop
She turns to face Grace, realizing she doesn't know
She looks at Robert and Annie, accusingly
She tries to explain: Well, Grace, you see
Pilgrim just
isn't the same horse he used to be
(to the parents) As a matter of fact, maybe now's not the best time to -- really want to see him
Liz looks at Annie
Annie nods
Liz leads them on
They reach a row of empty old stalls
They cross to one of the stalls -- its doors are closed
Liz draws back the bolt on top half of the door
There is an immediate explosion of sound inside the stall, the sound of fear, startling them
Then it's still
Liz slowly opens the door
Grace, with the aide of her cane, walks to the stall
She hesitates, then looks in
It takes a moment for her eyes to grow accustomed to the dark
She sees Pilgrim with his head down in the shadows
Hello, beautiful boy
He lifts his head at the sound of her voice
Grace, and the audience, see him for the first time -- His mad eyes, his terrible disfigurement
Grace cries out, stepping backwards, nearly stumbling in the mud
What is left of her horse are gone
Annie realizes what's happened and, together with Robert, rush to her
They too see the monster Pilgrim has become and are horrified
Grace angrily pushes away from them and "runs" off
Robert goes after her
Annie is standing in the rain with Liz -- her eyes unable to move away from the sight of Pilgrim
(
) You should have told her, Annie tried to explain to you how bad it was
guess you had to see it
But, there's nothing to be done
This animal's beyond help
Annie, can  have your permission now to put him down
Annie stands in the rain, hands in pocket, fixed on Pilgrim and more determined than ever; No
- Alone in her study, Annie sits before her computer searching the Internet for information on  -- Veterinarian Journals, Therapies, Accidents, Eistories
We sense she's been at it a while
She locates an   --
Interested, she brings it up on the screen
- Annie sits in the huge reading room, books spread out before her, under a green reading lamp
Her voice tells us what she's reading: (
) "It was in America that horses first roamed
" In the books, we see pictures, lithographs, paintings and drawings
(
) " million years before the birth of man, they grazed the vast empty plains of grass and crossed to other continents over bridges of rocks
They first knew man as the hunted knows the hunter, for long before man saw horses as a means to killing other beasts, man killed them for meat
" '
; '  - (
) "
The alliance with man would forever be fragile -- for the fear he'd struck into their hearts was too deep to be dislodged
Since that Neolithic moment when a horse was first haltered, there were those among men who understood this
" '  - Grace sits alone in her darkened room, staring out the window but not looking at anything
There's a discomforting distance in her expression
(
) "
They could see into the creature's soul and soothe the wounds they found there
" : ,  - hot, dusty fairgrounds horse arena
The worn wooden bleachers, crowded
Lines of cars and pick-up trucks
(
) "
For secrets uttered softly into troubled ears, these men were known as The Whisperers
" One particular pick-up truck has its back door opened '  is sticking out, putting on a pair of boots
moment later the Man gets out of the car
Holding a cowboy hat, he has a certain quality, a self-respect, that men who know themselves seem to have
weathered redheaded woman named  -- late forties, strong, wiry horsewoman's build -- is walking towards him
Hey, darlin'
Hey, Rona
Sorry 'm late
wouldn't know what to do if you were on time
They walk together towards the fairgrounds
You're looking fit
Fit
You want to check my teeth
(Tom laughs) Good crowd today
think you'll have some fun
You going to stay for dinner
If it's not too much trouble,  thought might
(playful) Kind of trouble 'm in the mood for
Oh-oh
Maybe  better get back in the truck
Rona lets out a hearty laugh as they enter the horse arena
,  - Inside the corral, a small black thoroughbred is being worked by Tom
As he rides and narrates into a radio microphone to the crowd, we sense this is a man of good humor and great skill --  guileless, sensible, of the earth
It's always kind of interesting to hear the horse's side of the story
The crowd laughs warmly
He directs his comments to a wearing an expensive Ralph Lauren western outfit, standing outside the corral
Now if he was cranky or lazy, like you say he is, we'd be seeing his tail twitching there and his ears back, maybe
But this isn't a cranky horse, it's a scared horse
You see how braced he is up around the neck back there
He just doesn't know which way to turn
The Woman nods
Tom turns the horse on a dime so that he always stays facing the circling thoroughbred
You see how he keeps pointing his hindquarters in at me
Well, 'd guess the reason he seems reluctant to move out is because when he does, he gets in trouble for it
He's not good at transitions, you know
When  want him to move from a trot to a lope, say
(smiles) Well, 'm sure that's what you think but that's not what 'm seeing
You may think you're asking for a lope, but your body may be saying something else altogether
You might be putting too many conditions on him
For instance, you might be saying ", but, hey, don't go too fast
" He can tell that from the way you feel
Your body can't lie
You ever give him a kick to make him move out
He won't go unless  do
And then he goes and you feel like he's going too fast, so you yank him back
(she nods) And next thing you know, he's bucking
(she nods again) Well, if someone told you to go, stop, go, stop -- you'd buck too
The people laugh
The Woman smiles self-consciously
It's a dance, see
Somebody has to lead and somebody has to follow
Tom gracefully moves his horse around the ring, "dancing"
He then takes up a long coiled rope and throws it so that the coils slap against the black horse's flank, making it burst into a lope
And again
Making the animal go from a trot to a lope, letting it slow, then up to a lope again
want him to get so he can leave real soft
He's getting the idea now
He's not all braced up and tense like he was at the start
He's finding out it's okay
He throws the rope again and this time the transition to the lope is a smooth one
You see that
He's getting better already
Pretty soon, if you work at it, you'll be able to make all these transitions easy on a loose rein
(sotto voce, wry) Yeah, and pigs'll fly
(to Woman) He's going to be okay -- so long as you don't go yanking on him
She nods, but he can see she's upset, feeling foolish
He walks the horse over to her, turns off the microphone and speaks sympathetically: Look, the truth is it's all about self- preservation
These animals
(with great affection) well, they just have such big hearts, you know
There's nothing they want more than to do what you want them to do
But when the messages get all confused, the only thing they know to do is try and save themselves
Now, why don't you go saddle up and see what happens
Feeling better, and not a little attracted to his heartfelt man's man, the Woman smiles and reaches for his hand to climb over the rail
Her horse lets her come right up to him and stroke his neck
Tom comments; They won't ever hold a thing against you
They're the most forgiving creatures God ever made
Turning on his mike and turning back to the crowd, he says: Okay, who's next
Young Boy leads a mule into the ring
Tom smiles: Now God has another idea entirely with the mule
- Tom has finished his "show
" People are shaking his hand, thanking him, as he walks away from the corral, towards a trailer
The Woman in the Ralph Lauren approaches: Excuse me
He faces the Woman: Hi
'm Dale
just wanted to --  can't get over the way he felt under me after you'd finish with him
Everything had just,  don't know, freed up or something
The Woman is flirting
Tom shrugs, uncomfortably; Well, that'll happen
Where did you learn all this stuff
What stuff is that
About horses
'd love to learn more about it myself
Do you offer any private lessons for riders
(getting the message) Well
Dale
you know, a lot of this stuff
it just
nuts and bolts
What do you mean
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts
(smiles) That's the whole lesson right there
You have a good day now
Just
keep on freeing yourself up
He leaves her, entering the trailer
'  - small, well-used trailer
Tom and Rona are finishing dinner like comfortable old friends
Rona rises, taking the plates into the kitchen and starts rinsing them: Oh  clear forget
You had a call from some woman in New York
She sounded pretty wound up
don't any woman in New York
But from what  hear, most of them are wound up
The number's by the phone
He nods but doesn't move
He just looks at Rona and smiles
She's a good woman
But Tom hopes she doesn't want anymore than what they have together
Rona notices him looking and smiles: What are you looking at, young man
How long were you married
Long enough
You ever miss it
Does a horse miss a saddle
Sometimes
She chuckles, shuts the water off and crosses back to him, sitting beside him
Well as a matter of fact,  don't
most of the time
She starts unbuttoning his shirt
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together
Honey
was always good
Tom smiles as Rona leans in
They kiss
' ,
- Annie is looking over a magazine cover with Lucy and her staffers
She is unhappy
You know it's perfectly shot, it's perfectly cropped, it's perfectly laid out and 'm so bloody bored, 'd rather buy a Motor Racing magazine -- Start over
Some general whines and groans as her assistant hands her a note
Uh, would you all excuse me a moment
She waits for them to leave as she sits before the phone
One of her lines is lit: - An endless sky
An empty ribbon of two-lane highway in Utah
small roadside station
Tom's pick-up truck, his horse trailer hitched to it, getting gas
Tom is on the pay phone
We hear Annie's voice: (
) This is Annie MacLean
Yeah
Hello
This is Tom Booker
got a message you called
in her office: (efficient, expeditiously) Oh
Yes
Thank you for calling back
Uh, all right, let me try to explain my situation as briefly as possible
You see, my daughter had an accident with her horse
They were both injured and she, my daughter, she hasn't been able to
fully
uh
It was an extremely traumatic experience
and uh
Tom, sensing her turmoil, listening compassionately
went on the Internet and found this article about you
It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you
you help people with horse problems
And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized -- Well, see, truth is, ma'am,  help horses with people's problems
Well, you know, however you want to put it --  got your information from the publisher of the article
called Montana and your sister-in-law,  think, gave me this number
(trying to be charming) 'm been hot on your trail you could say because  was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly -- Ma'am, 'm very sorry about your problems and  appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but 'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read don't do that sort of thing
Well, if you could just come for the day
New York's only a few hours by plane, 'd have you home by dinner
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what  do
give clinics
And 'm not even doing them for a while
'm heading back to Montana right now
got a ranch to take care of
(interrupts, abruptly) 'll pay you for your fare
'll send you to Montana first class
(getting impatient) Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money
Now, am  being too polite here or when  say  in Utah, does that mean  in New York City
Annie is taken aback
Tom feels badly
,  don't mean to sound insensitive understand your situation
But there's nothing  can do
You just called the wrong person, that's all
hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York
Maybe you should call one of them
Mr
Booker, if  could just ex -- am very sorry, ma'am
Goodbye now
He hangs up before Annie can continue
'  - Annie reaches for Grace's bedroom door, then pauses
She realizes she should knock
She does and whispers: Grace
(knocks again) Grace, it's mom
Annie slowly opens the door
She finds Grace's bed empty
She looks over to the window to find Grace sitting in a chair, in the dark, looking out the window
Grace
What are you doing
Not looking up, Grace speaks in a hollow voice
can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India
brought it to you in the hospital
No, you didn't
Grace,  put it on the table near your -- (apathetic) Doesn't matter
Beat
Have you decided about Pilgrim
What about him
Well
how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down
think we should
It's not fair to let him suffer
He's not much use anymore
He'd hate living like that
think that's
very compassionate and
mature way of looking at it
Mom
Yeah
Maybe they should put me down too
What
mean, 'm not much use anymore
Why can't they be compassionate to me
What frightens Annie most is the calm and apathy in Grace's voice
She's surrendering
Annie, for the first time in a long time, feels she's losing control
- Annie sits alone at the kitchen table, nursing a glass of wine
Robert enters and sits opposite her, wearing a tuxedo -- his tie and collar undone
How was the dinner
(wry) All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects
thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody
We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with
Why did you go
(surprised) They're still our friends, Annie
It's nothing serious
You kid about them all the time
And  could tell Paul really appreciated me being there
He drinks Annie's wine as she looks at him
Did you get a hold of that horse guy
Yeah
What did he say
No
Robert nods
Accepting
Silence
Annie sips her wine
Then: was thinking
Maybe we should think about the three of us going someplace warm
Remember that house we rented in Bermuda
The pink one with the -- His arm accidentally spills the wine
Shit
As he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin, Annie watches Robert clean the spill
Something about his movements, his posture -- a sense of weakness, of surrendering, of not having the inclination to fight, of just accepting and smoothing over the rough sports -- strikes her hard
Annie realizes the love she feels for Robert isn't fading
It's gone
He finishes cleaning and sits
What was  saying
About us going someplace warm
Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses
Robert looks at her and realizes it's a bad idea
He nods, again, getting the message
Silence
In that silence, Annie looks at him
and makes a decision: Robert,  want to take Pilgrim out to Mr
Booker
Drive him out to Montana
With Grace
Robert is confused
and a little worried
don't understand
You just said he said no
He did, but
think  can change his mind
That's the craziest thing  ever heard
Absolutely not
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school
And she can't sit in this apartment all day
think it would be good for her
(at a loss) What are you -- you're serious about this
've called Liz
They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim
thought we'd stay at motels along the way
(overlapping) You've already made arrangements
No
was just researching
Calm down
come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana can't just pick up and leave
'm not asking you to
'll do it
You want to do this by yourself
How
You can't take care of Pilgrim all the -- He'll be sedated
know horses, Robert
'm the one who taught Grace how to ride
(overlapping) What
Bo-
What about the magazine
'm in charge
went back very soon after the accident
They didn't expect me for a couple of months
'll just take that time now
can still oversee things from Montana
Take my fax
My computer
Beat
Robert fears this is about the marriage
Yet -- No
It's, uh
No,  really don't think it's a good idea Why
(searching) Her psychiatrist
said
she needs security now
stability
can't say he's been all that effective with her
Are you a psychiatrist
He said it takes time
don't care what he says
We have to do something, Robert
can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will
'm not pretending anything
Beat
Robert just stares at her
He looks concerned
almost worried
Annie gets uncomfortable
What
It is very difficult for Robert to say; thought
well, ever since the accident,  just thought we
He stops
Annie knows where he headed and prays to God he doesn't continue
He doesn't
thick silence hangs between them
really wish  could understand why you think this is so necessary
(frustrated) Robert, we're losing her
We're losing her
(he listens) don't care what the doctors say
The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace
This may not sound sensible or
logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better
can't explain it, Robert
just have this feeling
this annoying
bloody feeling that if
if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right
then so can Grace
just know it
Robert can feel the strength of her will
He can find no way around it
What if she doesn't want to go
She will if you think she should
And you think it's best if  don't come
(hesitates) No, that's not what  said
'm not a dictator
If you feel you should come, then come
Just do whatever you think is right
At some moment, they realize Grace is standing at the entrance to the kitchen
They are surprised
'm not going
don't care what she says
Annie lowers her head
Robert stares at Grace as she walks to him
Daddy
don't want to go
Grace stands next to Robert
He holds her hands
Annie looks at him, without sympathy
Robert looks back
In his face is the total acceptance of what must be
As well as the sadness of it's inevitability
He looks back at his daughter, whose eyes have never left him
- Pilgrim is being loaded into the trailer by four strong stable men, violently kicking and pulling all the way
Annie watches with anxiety -- an almost giddy Liz by her side
Maybe we should give him another sedative
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers
He's already had enough to sink a battleship
You have a pin, just in case
Of course not
Probably best
You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio
In the back seat of '  sits Grace -- her back to the action
Hearing Pilgrim's struggle
Putting her walkman on her ears and raising the volume
We hear -- ' ,   , bringing us to: ,   - Annie's Suburban drives along Route 80, pulling the horse trailer behind
- Grace, in the back seat, wearing her headphones, listening to her music (maybe     )
Detached
Non- committal
As trucks pass by, their time slapping the pavement, she reacts and turns to the other window
Annie, in sunglasses, shifts her attention between the road and her rear-view mirror -- checking on Grace
- The Suburban drives as the sun begins to set
- The Suburban and Horse Trailer are parked in the lot
,  - small furnished motel room with two twin beds
Grace sits up in bed watching , with no expression
sitcom with canned laughter serves as a hypnotic drug
Annie enters from the bathroom, after showering, drying her hair
Grace doesn't bother to look up
You want to take your bath
(Grace shakes her head) We have to get up early tomorrow
You may not have enough time to -- Fine -- 'll take my bath
She begins moving off the bed
No,  don't mean you have to
It's just that we may not have enough -- -- enough time tomorrow
know
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine
(interrupts on "fine") don't care
Annie realizes she may have pushed too hard, but she also realizes there's no talking to Grace now
So, she achieves her goal -- Take it now
Grace hobbles off the bed, enters the bathroom and shuts the door
- The lights are off
Annie lays in bed, wide awake
It is the middle of the night
Grace, asleep in the other bed, begins whimpering
She's having a bad dream
Annie rises -- considering whether or not to intercede
Finally, Grace begins to cry out
softly at first, but with increasing intensity until she awakens in fear
Annie appears right by her side
What, sweetheart
What
Shaken, Grace cannot fight how much she needs her mother at that moment
She wraps her arms around her, tightly, and tries to catch her breath
It's sleeping in a strange bed, that's all
Happens sometimes
It's Ok
It's
, - - The Suburban continues its journey
Once again -- Annie, in the front, and Grace, in the rear, drive without a word between them
- Grace and Annie occupy their same positions
Annie is on the car phone with her office
Okay, listen -- let's do this
When get to the next motel, 'll see if they have a fax
If not, 'll call you tomorrow to -- Annie continues
when we hear a shifting, a rocking in the trailer behind them
As if Pilgrim made a sudden move
Grace quickly turns her head
Annie looks in the rear view at Grace
Uh Lucy, look,  have to go
Later
Annie hangs up and smiles at Grace through the mirror
Grace reaches for her walkman and headphones
Annie offers; Grace
Grace lowers one side of her headphones; Would you like to put your music on up here
Grace shrugs
Annie shrugs it off as well
Grace replaces the headphone
Annie turns on the radio -- nothing but country or gospel or religious talk shows
She shuts it off
Frustrated, Annie looks up ahead and sees: Annie yells to be heard through the headphones; ' (shrugs) Whatever you want
Fine
Fine
Annoyed, Annie pulls onto the gravel and stops, talking to herself -- Fine
She exits the car, banging the door
As she walks acrund the car to help Grace, she talks to herself in a sarcastic whisper: "Whatever you want
" Well, this is what want
want to eat lunch and  want to smoke a cigarette and  want to keep talking to myself for the next two thousand fucking miles
"
She opens Grace's door
Grace senses her mother's anger
- Annie and Grace enter
They look around: Formica floors, truckers in caps and beer bellies stuffed into booths or at the counter
There is not a single space available
Annie and Grace stand near the entrance
Another Trucker enters and they step aside, huddled together in this foreign land
- Grace and Annie enter the room to find    instead of two twins
Neither comments
Annie exits
, carrying the bags inside, as she says: : You should call your dad before it gets too late
already did
(Annie's surprised) This morning
When you went running
Oh
You didn't tell me
didn't know  had to
(stares angrily, speaks softly) You don't
Silence
Annie exits past her to the car
: Grace is asleep in her twin bed
Once again, Annie is wide awake
The clock reads: 4:55
But Annie can not sleep
Camera moves away from Annie, past her side of the bed, to the other side of the room
coming towards the bed
She comes in camera angle and we follow to her back to the bed, which has now transformed into -- ,    -- The Woman gently shakes little Annie awaken
Annie
Annie, sweetheart
wake up
The little girl, with sleep in her eyes, turns and sees her
Bad news 'm afraid
Your Daddy's gone
Annie, in present time next to Grace, thinks of this as she stays awake
Putting her jogging parka on over her nightgown, she goes outside
- She crosses the motel parking lot to the horse trailer
She looks in through the siding at Pilgrim, checking on him
She sees he is caught his halter on the side of the van
She crosses to the trailer door, hesitates, then opens it
Pilgrim looks at her
Gathering her courage, she climbs inside
He is still, looking at her
She carefully frees his halter
And suddenly he bares his teeth, biting at her
She stumbles back out of the trailer, slamming the door shut
She stands leaning against the trailer -- wondering if she's out of her mind for attempting this
: - Annie is returning from her jog, sweating
As she crosses to her motel room, she stops by the window, looking in to see: Grace, on the floor, straining to do her exercises
Annie fills with compassion for her girl -- reminded of the struggle she faces everyday
- In the distance, the Suburban and horse trailer look like a dot on the horizon, moving across the Badlands
-  , Grace leans against the window in the back, in one of her darker moods
Annie switches radio stations, from Bible thumping to Farm reports
She shuts it off
Silence
She sees a  : "   "
Grace, look
Grace reads the sign
Would you like to see that
don't care
(overlapping) don't care
Annie's comic mimicking, throws Grace off center
Annie turns off onto the exit
They drive by a massive casino -- it's neon sign flickering
They drive up a hill past a cafe, two Indians in high crowned Cowboy hats standing outside of the cafe
She drives up a hill towards the parking lot of the Monument
This'll be nice
We haven't seen any of the sights yet
It's history
When was thirteen  used to love seeing things like this
You were never thirteen, Mom
Annie laughs, taking it as a joke
Grace almost smiles
But, Annie drives up to sign only to find a
The park was closed at six
Annie stops the car
She's hit a brick wall once more
Silence
Finally, Grace speaks with her usual sarcasm; Great idea
So now what
Beat
Annie's patience snaps; How long is this going to go on
What
You know what  mean
(turns to the back seat) Is this it now
Is this the way we're going to be from now on
Ignoring her, Grace edges to the passenger side and exits the car
Annie gets out of the driver's side and walks around as she speaks: Do you want us to turn around and go back home
Do you
What are you asking me for
You didn't ask me if  wanted to come in the first place -- now  get to decide
Forget it
She begins to turn away
Annie grabs her arm
Who do you think 'm doing this for
'm doing this for you
Bullshit
It's about you
About you deciding
About you always being right
You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something
don't believe this
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it
That's not true
Whatever problems your father and  are having, have nothing to do with this
You're amazing
You act like  don't live in that house
Don't you think hear the two of you
Don't you think can tell what's going on
'm not five years old, Mom
(Annie is stopped) You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to
Did he tell you that
He doesn't have to
It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him
That's not true
Then why do you want to leave
It's
it's not that simple to explain
know you think it is, but it's not
The truth is,  don't really know what want to do
don't have all the answers
No, you just act like you do
Annie is choked with fury
She doesn't know whether to scream, cry or strangle Grace
She turns away and begins walking quickly, blindly, up past a grove of trees
She comes to a  enclosed by a black railing
At the crest of the hill there's a stone monument "The Little Bighorn Cemetery
" In the growing darkness, she sees, scattered on the hillsides below her, white tombstones
place of sorrow
cool breeze ruffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets
Frustrated, alone, at a complete loss as to what to do, what action to take -- Annie, for the first time in frozen, standing still -- and with her, comes a rush of emotion
She sits with her back against the monument and begins to weep
For Grace, for Robert, herself, for the tombstones, for everyone
shines on her face
It is a
You okay, ma'am
(wipes face) Yes
Fine
That young lady is getting a little worried
Annie realizes she left Grace alone as it got darker
'm sorry
'm sorry
Annie rises and is escorted back to the Suburban by the Ranger
She sees: Grace is sitting in the front seat now, waiting for her -- like a little girl lost
- Annie gets into the driver's seat
Buckles up
Grace holds back tears
You buckled up
(Grace nods) You cold
Little
Annie reaches into the back seat and pulls a blanket out, handing it to Grace, making sure it covers her
Grace turns towards the window and closes her eyes
Annie starts the car
,   - on Pilgrim's head in the trailer as we   to reveal the Suburban coming down an empty, seemingly infinite stretch of two-lane road in Montana
- Annie and Grace, both in front seats, eating doughnuts and coffee
They stop
-- Through the windshield is an endless sky and a rolling sea of land
Gee, this looks like a fun place
Don't they believe in signs here
What would they say
"Ten miles to big rock
" "Twenty miles to bigger rock
" There was supposed to be a turn off
Did  miss it
didn't see it
Their Suburban is the only vehicle on what seems like miles of road
Annie sighs and puts the Suburban in drive
'  & ,    - The Suburban and the horse trailer, pulls into Peterson's -- a collection of motel cottage adjacent to an expanse of land that includes stable, corral, a main house and various riding trails into the mountains
Mr
Peterson runs out from the main house to greet Annie as she gets out of the car
,      - Annie, showered and changed, is trying to follow Mr
Peterson's directions to Tom's ranch -- written on Peterson motel stationary
She is lost once again
(reading) after left, stay on main road until rise, then
(frustrated) What bloody rise
What main road
She stops the Suburban (no longer carrying the trailer)
- From outside the Suburban, we see, but cannot hear, Annie hitting the steering and cursing in frustration
- Annie, panting, looks ahead and sees nothing but empty space, above and below -- as if the earth and sky met with nothing in between
She sighs and starts the car again
As she moves forward, she senses an almost indistinguishable rise in the road -- as we follow her  up the road through the windshield to reveal: --    just beyond the rise, hidden from view only a few yards before sits nestled in the valley, a few miles away
Annie is impressed
- Men are working in the corral, saddle horses standing nearby, trying to get a sick calf to suckle a cow
One of the men is Tom Booker, working along side his brother , and his nephew,
Frank is a good man -- solid work ethic, Christian fearing, wry sense of humor
With the build of a football player, his strength never overwhelms his boyish, good-natured heart
Joe is eleven, wearing his cowboy hat like a badge of honor
The three men seem as inseparable to each other, as they are to the land
As they work: Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad
Sure
As long as she don't mind
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him
Tom and Frank don't say anything
Just nod, knowingly
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on
That's what some folks say
There was this thing on the  about a guy who does it with geese
He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow
(to Tom) You hear 'bout that, Uncle
Yeah,  hear about that
Well, what do you think about that stuff
Well, Joe, 'll tell ya --  don't know a whole lot about geese
Maybe it's okay for them to grow up thinking they're airplanes
But horses, as far as  can tell, can't fly
Frank laughs
Joe smirks as Tom messes his hat up
There's the sound of a car
They turn
The Suburban is coming over the ridge, heading down the driveway in a cloud of dust
We expecting company
Frank shakes his head
As the Suburban slows down, Tom recognizes the driver
don't believe it
You know her
Annie, out of her element, hiding behind sunglasses, gets out as Tom approaches her by himself
Annie girds herself for the confrontation
Hello, Mr
Booker
Annie MacLean
From New York
We talked on the phone
She extends her hand
shakes it, nodding, staring at her curiously
It's, uh
beautiful country
had a little bit of a hard time finding the place
There are no signs
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed
Who do  get the idea you're not just passing through
Well
here it is
Uh
'd like you to take a look at my horse
Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East
Oh no
She's here
brought him along
And my daughter, too
We're staying at Peterson's
You mean you hauled him all the way out here
Just like that
(slightly taken aback) Well
yes
had a trailer
It's not like  made him run along side of the car
All by yourself
She nods
Tom cannot help be impressed by her guts and fortitude
Camera cuts away for a moment to a window in the ranch house, through which  -- Frank's fiery, loyal pioneer wife -- looks at the duo with suspicion
uh
ha, ha
don't think  ever met a lady quite like yourself and appreciate all the pains you've gone through to -- Look
Please
Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again
(Tom, surprised, listens) 've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time
've brought him here -- to your neck of the
(seeing no woods) -- mountains
Just take a look at him
If you still feel the same way, 'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again
Deal
Tom tries to hide a smile of respect
Annie, thinking she may have him, starts backing away towards her car -- as one would a dangerous animal they think they might have tamed
We're at Peterson's
Whenever you're free
You don't even have to call
She gets into the Suburban
Tom watches her drive off
'  - Tom walks up some wooden steps to a door and knocks
He hears a  on inside
And Grace's Voice: (
) The door
He hears Annie's muffled reply from
He hears some banging as Grace fumbles for her crutch and comes to the door
She opens it only so far as to reveal her upper body: Yeah
Uh, 'm Tom Booker
Your mother around
Grace hops to the side as Tom walks by her, into the room
Grace is closing the door as he turns to see, for the first time, that Grace is one leg
She'll be right out
She's on the phone
Grace hops back to the bed in front of the
Tom nods and puts his hat down -- noticing the prosthetic leaning against the window, near her bed
He hears Annie on the phone and looks to the other room, the door ajar -- seeing only her legs, seated on the edge of her bed, as she talks
Her foot taps impatiently
First time in Montana
Grace, rudely nods, still looking at the
Beat
Tom doesn't like her manner, but can easily see through it
He sits
She gonna be long
Probably
She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day
What does she do
She's an editor
Mmm
An editor
Not like books or literature or anything
Just a magazine
Just in case she hasn't told you -- which 'm sure she hasn't --  don't want to be a part of this,
Tom just sort of nods
beat or two later, Annie enters
Sorry about that
Hi
Grace, this is Mr
Booker
Have you looked at Pilgrim
Tom sees Grace turn away, just as Annie enters
He takes a moment
He could say no right there, but something stops him
Uh, no
was gonna take a look now
You want us to come with you
just have to run to the main house and give Mr
Peterson a check
Doesn't matter
Grace
Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim
Grace keeps looking at the
No reply
Tom is half way out the door when he says to Annie -- making sure Grace can hear -- Probably best she stays behind, anyway
He disappears
Annie gives Grace a final look and exits, closing the door
Alone, Grace flings her body across the bed, reaching for her prosthetic -- putting it on feverishly
She is completely intrigued by Tom
'  - Tom stands alone at the stable
Opening the bottom door, ducking under the stall, he goes inside
Okay now
Okay now
Walking towards him, Tom raises his hand, showing Pilgrim a sign of respect, of trust
He quietly makes his way along Pilgrim's side, along his flank, prompting Pilgrim to move out from the shadows, into the light
Tom moves to look at him
And Pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him
Tom, not cowed, stands his ground
He bends, looking at Pilgrim's withered legs
He looks up at his scarred head
He looks into the pools of the horse's tortured eyes
Pilgrim stands still -- allowing Tom this brief intimacy
As Grace walks towards the stable, she realizes that the door is open and Tom must be inside
She is amazed
Annie, appearing behind her, is also impressed
Tom exits the stable and sees them, as he closes the doors
Well
You're closest anyone's gotten
He walks straight towards them -- veering more to Grace
He stops in front of her and they look into each other's eyes -- in a way that reminds us of how Tom looked at Pilgrim
Except, Grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy
She turns away and walks to the corral, to lean on a post -- as if she doesn't care
Tom turns to Annie
have to be honest
still feel you made a long trip for nothing
He looks at Annie
Annie has no more words -- just an ever- present pleading in her face
Tom watches as Grace makes a small, naked movement -- putting her hand on her cheek, like a hurt child
He can't help but see these three being connected by one wound
But before  even think about it, need to know something here and now
It's a question for Grace here
Grace stiffens
When  work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it
It doesn't work that way
The owner needs to be involved too
Well, that'll be a little complicated -- You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like
But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am  right
So here's the deal
'm not sure  can do anything, but 'm prepared to give it a go -- (to Grace) -- if you'll help
(Grace gives a bitter laugh) You have a problem with that
Isn't it like, obvious
Not to me
Either you want to or you don't
Look, 'll talk to Grace and call you later-- Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours
And don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine
Grace reacts anew to Tom's remark
She likes her mother being dis-empowered
Annie keenly understands the importance of Tom putting it this way to Grace
Grace has all eyes on her -- just what she wants
All waiting for her response
She turns away, flicks her head and says: Well, there's nothing else to do around here
Annie smiles in relief
But Tom isn't satisfied
Not good enough
can't help you
He starts walking away
Annie doesn't know what to do
Grace mumbles
What do  have to do
Tom keeps walking out
Grace says it louder
said, what do  have to do
Tom stops and looks at her
Annie holds her breath
,   - Frank, Tom, Joe and   , 6 years old, sit at a dining table eating dinner, as Diane serves
We parachute into the middle of the conversation: well,  just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here
Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way
(    ) You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen
(the boy cowers) Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve
Oh hell,  don't know
According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman
Must've thought it was worth it
(sits down) guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long
don't believe they'll expect that
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger
Mixed salad
What
(slyly) believe women from New York eat mixed salads
Ain't that right, Tom
Tom hides a grin -- he knows Frank into teasing her now
believe so
Saw it on a television show, once
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York
Everyone eats
Beat
When you figure on branding
Weekend after next
If the weather holds
Frank nods
Silence again
Everyone eats
Beat
What's an editor do anyway
(playing) We're not sure, sweetheart, but they eat like rabbits
Tom and Frank chuckle
Diane smiles -- in on the joke with them
The children are curiously confused
'   - Camera moves to reveal Annie on the phone in front of her computer and fax
plugging in extension cords as she talks: the phone company's putting in extra lines
'll call back with the numbers
Oh, and  want you to get in touch with this lady in town here -- they say she's sort of a physical therapist for the rodeo boys but keep the one at the hospital we already contacted on call
Grace sits alone in the living room
Watching , but anxious and disturbed about what she's committed herself to
-  - Diane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table, as she listens to a
Her hand on her forehead, her other hand writing
Tom enters to take his hat off the sideboard
He moves to the table and reaches over for a cookie from a plate of cookies
Without looking up, Diane slaps his hand
Tom then pours himself a cup of coffee
then swiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie
Diane smiles
Tom exits
It is only then that Diane looks up after him
- Camera follows Tom towards his bedroom --  passing the others
Perhaps we see Frank sprawled out asleep already in his underwear
We might see the Twins in their bunks
One of the Twins' lower torso is laying outside of the blanket
He casually flips the blanket over the kid's bare feet and continues to his room
'  - Tom enters and closes the door
Turns on a stereo which plays a cello piece by Yo-Yo Ma
Books fills his room
He sits at his desk, puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork
Suddenly he stops, looking over the paperwork, into space thought passes by
We don't know what
: ,   - First light of day
Pilgrim stands stock still in the middle of the corral
Tom, motionless, is crouched on his haunches in the corral -- watching him
' : As Pilgrim moves, he can see that the horse is stove up
He softly tosses a handful of dirt at Pilgrim's withered legs
Pilgrim, sensitive to the slightest provocation, bucks, wheeling away from him
Then stops
Tom sits on his haunches again
and watches him
Frank appears, exiting from the barn (perhaps)
Tom
Yeah
Tom leaves Pilgrim, hooking up with Frank -- the two brothers go off, discussing the ranch work that is ahead of them
: - Annie and Grace arrive in the Suburban
They exit
As they head towards the ranch, they see in the distance: Pilgrim standing along the fence of a round pen
Tom stands in the pen, holding a rope, looking at Pilgrim
- Tom stands in the pen with Pilgrim
He looks to see Annie and Grace approaching but makes no acknowledgement
He turns his focus back to Pilgrim
Annie and Grace appear
Grace takes a position (that is to become her regular spot) a distance away from the pen
Annie moves in closer, beside  (a ranch hand) with one leg up on the pen fence
Howdy
(sees Grace) Howdy
He and Annie watch as Tom stands before Pilgrim -- turning sideways
then standing
What's he doing
Trying to get his eye
How's it going
Smokey doesn't respond -- how it's going is exactly how it looks
Tom takes a few steps, stops and stands still again
We sense the process is long and requires great patience
: - Two hours later
Grace is in the same spot
Smokey is gone, doing his work
Annie has taken a different position, looking over     on her lap
Tom is still standing in the pen trying to get Pilgrim's eyes
Joe has joined the proceedings, sitting on the pen rail
Tom deftly throws a hoolihan, gently lassoing Pilgrim around the neck
And Pilgrim, at the touch of the rope, crazed, resists, pulling back, striking at the rope
The rope cutting into Tom's hands
Tom gives him some slack, giving his head, letting him relax
then gently heads him by the rope, walking him around the pen, getting his feet to moving
Grace's eyes never leave Tom
: - Tom, off in the distance -- against a sky that seems to be touching the land -- is riding along a creek
Closer up, we see he's rustling the bushes with a stick
Some stray cows run out of the bushes
Tom races after them
His horse shepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside
At the top of the hill, with the ranch spread out endlessly before him, Tom sees Frank on his horse, chasing strays
Tom whistles
Frank waves back
In the near distance, a pickup truck is parked on the range
Joe and the  are throwing food pellets out of the back of the truck
Cattle come from across the range for the food
What begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens, then hundreds -- the truck virtually disappearing among them
Tom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch
Far off in the distance, he sees Annie's Suburban coming along the road to the ranch
He watches as Annie's distant figure gets out of the car with Grace
Annie instinctively turns and looks across the land
Even though there is such a distance, there's a sense Tom and Annie are looking at each other
Tom senses Joe driving Frank's truck, slowly moving off the range -- the Twins in the back, the cattle following
Tom sits on his horse atop the hill
- Pilgrim, his scarred head above water, legs moving in odd sycopation, swimming
We discover he is in a pond, tethered to a pole
Except for the sound of his legs in the water, everything is quiet and focused on Pilgrim
, holds the pole, walking on the outside of the pond, leading Pilgrim back and forth as he swims
Tom, crouched by the pond, silently concentrating on Pilgrim
Grace watches, off by herself
Annie stands beside Joe
She can't help but be intrigued by the sight
She asks Joe; though horses were afraid of water
Joe doesn't answer her
Grace likes that
Annie, frustrated, feels she has the right to simple shout out to Tom
Is that to get his strength back
Tom pays her no mind -- concentrating on Pilgrim
Suddenly, Annie's   rings, jarring the proceedings
Tom turns to Annie
She hides her embarrassment by answering it, walking away
Tom gives her a look
Grace is loving this
Tom turns back to Pilgrim
After a few moments -- Tom, taking the rope tether, unhooks it from the pole
He starts to lead Pilgrim out of the water
Pilgrim, fearful, fights him
He rears, splashing Tom, not wanting to come out of the water
Grace is worried
She looks to Joe and sees he is concerned too, though he stands quietly
Annie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes her call to return to the pond
Tom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab Pilgrim's rope
Pilgrim rises up, rearing at him
Joe and Smokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond
Annie appears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope again
Pilgrim rears again
Tom stumbles backwards from his hooves
Annie gasps
Grace turns to walk away from the pond
She can't watch -- it brings back too much
But as she does, she is stopped by the sight of -- Tom, righting himself, unphased, calmly walks back to Pilgrim
The horse, baffled by this man's lack of fear, lets him take the rope and walk him out of the pond
Grace can't help but be impressed
Joe nods
Annie is shaken
Mr
Booker, 'm not at all comfortable with you taking those kinds of chances
As Tom leads Pilgrim out, the horse suddenly whirls, bolting, knocking Tom down
Oh, God
Pilgrim runs off, pulling the wet rope behind him
Joe runs over and grabs for the rope
Joe obeys
Pilgrim runs past the corral and down into a hill out onto a pasture, He keeps on running into the distance -- running across the pasture, not knowing where he is going
Tom, arms folded across his chest, watches him run concerned Annie approaches
She's running away
How are you going to get him back
Tom doesn't respond
He walks off down the hill out onto the pasture, stops, arms folded and watches Pilgrim
Annie turns when she hears Smokey, who appears behind her: He don't really want to run
Don't know where he's going
All this open space scares the daylight out of him
Confused, Pilgrim stops running and walks, in no particular direction
My guess is he's spent his life in a six-by-eight stall
He's forgot what it's like to be a horse
Smokey ambles off and she turns back to see Tom crouching on his haunches, sitting in the grass, just waiting
Pilgrim walks back towards the ranch, stops a distance from Tom, looks at him
Annie, needing to know exactly what's going on, crosses down the hill to him
So what now
Should we leave
Tom continues watching Pilgrim
Annie looks at him, sitting there motionless and feels like an idiot
Clearly she doesn't understand all this and clearly no one thinks this is the time to explain to her
Well, we're going to go then
Without looking at her, Tom just nods
Annie, awkwardly, walks back up the hill to where Grace is
, Grace is watching the scene by herself as Joe appears, staring at her leg
It makes her uncomfortable
She turns to him with a curt, impatient tone; What
Their eyes meet
Joe is so guileless, Grace is taken off guard when he asks in such a compassionate voice; Does that hurt you
Grace tries to think of an answer -- and of how to say it: Only when  kick somebody
Her gentle delivery makes him smile
She smiles, then: Don't you go to school
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch
He tips his hat down as he looks out to Pilgrim with respect; Look at him out in the pasture -- Yeah, he must've been a big, beautiful looking horse
How was he to ride
Grace is uncomfortable again
She looks away, just struggling
Joe senses she's done talking; Excuse me
got chores to look after
He tips his hat and walks off, passing Annie as she arrives
You ready to go
Grace hesitates
Then mother and daughter take one more look -- -- Pilgrim standing in the pasture with Tom crouching in the grass waiting for him
: - Tom is still sitting in the grass, just where we left him -- waiting patiently
Pilgrim is still out in the pasture
: - Afternoon shadows cross the ranch
Tom is in the exact same spot and position
Pilgrim is somewhat closer -- but still at a distance -- watching him
Frank rides back from work
As he passes Tom, the two nod as if nothing usually is going on
Frank rides up to the barn
'  - Grace is flicking the television -- repeating the only three channels over and over
Annie works at her computer, surrounded by work
She notices the time, gets a thought and dials the phone
Hello, Mr
Booker
Oh, hello, Frank
This is Annie MacLean
was wondering, has-
(listens) Uh-huh
And Pilgrim
(listens) Still
Uh-huh
(politely cheery) Okay then
Thank you
She hangs up, pauses, then speaks to the window out loud enough for Grace to hear -- He's still sitting in that damn field
(w/o looking at her) think they call it a pasture
Annie looks at her as if to say the last thing  need to know is a lesson on the local lingo
Let's go see what's going on, then get something to eat
- The sky is changing colors, the temperature has dropped
Tom is still sitting in the grass, although someone has brought him a blanket for his shoulders
Pilgrim is in the pasture, but now -- he too is motionless, looking back at Tom
The sound of a car makes Tom turn to see Annie driving up
She gets out, stands by the car with a proprietary air, watching Tom and Pilgrim
Grace remains in the car
There's a sound
She turns to see Diane coming out of the house
There's coffee inside
was just bringing this to Tom
Would you mind if  did
'd like to talk to him
Diane, knowing full well Tom ain't in a talking mood, hands her a cup
Sure
(seeing Grace in car) Does your daughter want to come inside
Uh, no, we're going to dinner
Is this the way to the pasture
Pasture
Oh, that stretch of field near the hill
Yeah
She's gone
Annie grimaces, then crosses the hillside to where Tom is squatting down
She appears to his side and, without speaking, tries to indicates she has his coffee by leaning it toward him
Tom sees her and accepts it with a grateful nod
Annie waits
Nothing happens
Feeling foolish, she begins to walk back
At some point, she turns to see Pilgrim moving across the pasture toward Tom
He stops in front of him, just a few feet away
Tom says something to him
Annie is intrigued -- and she knows enough to stay quiet now
She watches Pilgrim walk over to him
She watches as Tom gets up and pats Pilgrim's scarred head
In spite of herself, Annie is somewhat moved by this act
Only we see Grace, peering out from the car, seeing this act of communion as well
Only we see her reaction to it
As Tom turns and walks back to the ranch, Pilgrim follows him
As he passes Annie, all he says is
From now on, leave your phone somewhere else
As he moves past her, Annie responds; But  have business calls  have to -- Tom keeps heading for the barn as he suggests, without turning back; Then drop off Grace in the morning, go on back and do your business
Come pick her up around dinner
Standing there, Annie has the impulse to respond to this suggestion, but has no idea what to say and saying it wouldn't make much sense since Tom is already out of ear shot
Diane appears from the house and calls out: Mrs
MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner
Oh uh, thank you
No, we don't want to impose
No imposition
Plenty of food
Gonna get pretty dark soon
Hard to find a place
Annie looks up to the alien sky and realizes she's right
She looks to Grace, who doesn't seem to oppose the idea
/ - Everyone sits around the kitchen table
Joe, still wearing his hat, eyes Annie and Grace with acute curiosity
Joe, take off the hat -- 'm not going to say it again
Joe obeys
Diane puts the last of the serving plates on the table -- pork chops, potatoes, gravy, peas, bread
And a big bowl of mixed salad
The boy can't help eyeing how the "vegetarians" will act
Annie and Grace eye the food
Annie reaches out for a serving ladle, picking up Grace's plate to serve her as Grace reaches for a piece of bread, when: Dear Lord, we are humbly thankful for
Annie and Grace freeze as Frank continues his prayer -- they notice everyone's head bowed slightly
(continues) these gifts
For the blessings on our home, our family and our guests
Bless those that aren't as fortunate
Bless all God's creatures
Amen
Everyone begins eating
Annie and Grace breath a sigh of relief
Silence
Utensils hitting plates, the only sound
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle
We should be fine, then
Beat
Annie and Grace listen
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords
Tell her they suit the weather better
Their udders are black, 'stead of pink
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow
And they're good mother
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords
Silence
Eating
Annie tries her hand at conversation: You know, that's interesting
always wondered when  went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak
couldn't taste any difference although  could swear one was more tender
didn't know there was that big a difference between cows
(silence) 've never been on a cow farm before must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it
Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to
(uncomfortable) do their
work
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger
On a balance reckon 'd choose being a cow
(to Grace) Would you mind passing that salad young lady
How's Peterson's holding up for you
(lying) It's fine
Comfortable
still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though
When we leave the ranch, always hold my breath until  can see the motel
(innocently) You know, Tom, while you're working on that horse of theirs, Annie and Grace should move into the old Creek house
Diane and Tom react accordingly; Diane hiding her annoyance, Tom hiding his surprise and pleasure
Nobody's using it
Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well
Oh,  don't know
Well,  know Peterson's
Old place is as good as falling down around your ears
(overlapping) They're already all settled in, Frank
Anyway, 'm sure Annie wants her privacy
It's got doors, Diane
Private as can be
Tom
don't have a problem with that
It's up to Annie
Well, it's worth it, really
mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim
That's up to Pilgrim
Everyone waits on Annie's answer as she considers this
- Grace is on the phone with Robert
Annie is packing things up
Grace is telling him about the day; (listens) know
Me, too
Why don't you come one weekend
Annie reacts to this
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch
They have this empty house near this creek
It's actually pretty
love you
(to Annie) Dad wants to talk to you
(takes the phone) Hi
- Robert is burning the midnight oil in the study with files all around him
Hey
She sounds like she's doing all right
How is she
Grace exits into the bathroom
Annie talks softly; (cautious) Yeah
She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why said yes to this move
But, whenever it's just the two of us,  don't know
Anyway
what's happening with the Delco lawsuit
Taking forever
just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday
don't know how 'm going to do it
Well, it's good that you're there
Robert didn't mean to validate his separation from them
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country
Is the magazine complaining at all
Yeah, but nothing  can't handle
Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new
When are you coming home
You know,  just asked that myself tonight
He doesn't know
Well then
maybe  will take some time
come visit
Okay
Beat
Annie knows Robert needed an invitation from her
But she can't do it
Robert tries again
miss you, Annie
know
We miss you too
Good night
Night
Awkwardly, they hang up
Grace exits the bathroom
Did you ask him to come visit
You already did
Did he mention it
(resumes packing) Yeah, he's going to think about it
You want me to pack for you
Grace looks at her disapprovingly as she passes to go to the bathroom
Annie registers this
- Diane is washing windows while listening to an audio book on her tape player
Through the windows, she sees: Joe and the Twins helping Annie and Grace move into the Creek House
Diane has conflicting feelings about this
She continues her work
- of ,     , ,
Grace is in the other room, as she was in the motel
Alone
With no television, she is just listening to her music laying on the couch
The two women remain separate no matter where they are
But we see a small difference
Grace rises and walks to the window
She looks out; : She sees people working about the ranch
Maybe Joe is among them -- riding his horse as he works
Or maybe it's just a vision of people with tasks to complete -- who do so with pride, discipline and clarity
Grace looks out the window longingly
- cloud of dust
dozen or so horses are running in an arena by the stables
Tom is riding among them, holding a long stick with an orange flag at the end of it, waving it at the young horses, making them run away from him
The colts stay close together
One of the horses, , stays at a distance, off to himself
Grace watches from along the railing
She alternates her attention from the horses
to Tom
What we're doing here, Grace, is trying to get him to learn how to be a horse again
He cracks the flag, the horses move together
The others already know, see
That's how they are in the wild -- herd animals
(cracks the flag) When they've got a problem, like they have now with me and this flag, they look to each other
But old Pilgrim there has forgotten
'm the rock and they're the hard place
He thinks he hasn't got a friend in the whole wild world
on , who clearly feels the same way
but wants desperately not to
She watches him ride off towards Pilgrim who has stopped like all the others at the far end of the ring
He stands by himself, tossing his head, snorting, not wanting to be around other horses
Tom cracks the flag, keeping them moving
Pilgrim does his own private dance
Tom rides by Grace and hands her the stick; Hold this for a minute
Grace stiffens
She doesn't want to, but she's afraid to say "No" to Tom
He just insists by tossing it to her
Hold onto it, go on
She's forced to catch it
He turns and rides away, chasing down Pilgrim, trying to edge him toward the herd
For a moment, he has him breaking to the left with the horses
But as soon as he's clear of Tom, he separates himself and comes to stop on his own
Tom rides back to Grace, taking back the flag
We'll get there, Grace
As he says this, he flashes a small, reassuring smile and a little wink
Grace melts just a little
As he rides away
Annie appears, having come from the Creek House
She calls: Grace
The clinic just called
They had to change your physical therapy appointment
We have to leave now
Grace frowns a little -- her mother's "perfect timing
" Annie approaches the arena, watching Tom riding
As he passes her; Hello, Annie
Annie notices how he says her name
Mr
Booker
He flashes a smile in her direction and Annie's expression comically matches her daughter's reaction
She quickly covers it, however
Her eyes follow him as he glides around the arena
It's like watching a great ballet -- his control of the horses, his effortlessness, his grace, his strength
She smiles to herself in appreciation
Then catches herself: (to Grace) You got everything you need
If  had everything  need,  wouldn't be going to physical therapy
Tom approaches as he overhears Grace respond; (trying to cheer her) Honey, come on
Would you like to stay in town for dinner
Maybe see what movie's playing tonight
Why
There's no food in the house
No
just thought
forget it
He's getting a clearer view of their relationship
You know, we're branding here tomorrow
If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome
(laughs) Branding
(sarcastic) haven't branded in years
Tom chuckles
'll come
Uh,  don't, honey
Branding
Oooh
think we'd just be in Mr
Booker's way
As long as you don't get in the way of the branding iron, it doesn't matter too much
Annie smiles
She turns to Grace, questioningly
Grace says matter-of-factly, to prove her point
watched Margo Neuberger get a tattoo
Tom squints
Annie shrugs and nods
Okay
As Grace and Annie walk to the car, Tom says: Hey, Grace -- maybe we can get your mom to put me and you branding on the cover of her magazine
Start a whole new fashion craze
They continue walking as Grace smiles, enjoying being singled out for his joke
Annie responds, almost flirtatiously
Try not to fall off your high horse, Mr
Booker
Tom tips his hat and rides away
Annie smiles and nods
Grace doesn't like their sudden familiarity
Or her mother's coy manner
As they enter the Suburban, Grace asks point blank; Did you call Dad today
Annie is caught off guard
Tom, riding in the arena, catches himself looking after them
then goes riding after Pilgrim
- The air smells of scorched flesh
There is nothing but
Calves, separated from their mothers, "cry
" They are moved out through a series of connected pens into a narrow chute, and then one by one into a holding pen
They're clamped and lowered sideways onto a table and given a shot, a yellow insect tag in one ear, branded, then sent back to their mother's
The bulls, in a pen by themselves, stand haughty, paying no attention
Frank helps "doctor" the calves
Joe brands
Annie and Grace are standing by the railing, watching with a mixture of fascination and disgust
Tom moves in the feeder pen, waist deep in calves, moving them through the chute
He looks to Annie
Hey, over there, you want to make yourself useful
It isn't a question
Hank,  got you a volunteer
Annie and Grace realize they have no choice
-- : -- ,   , --
--       "
"
--          , , ,     '
--       ""
,    , --          '
That's good
firm but gentle
(Grace opens her eyes) It hurts but he'll get over it
Grace smiles proudly
You handled that pretty well
Think it's time you earn your keep around here
So, when we're not working and when you don't have your therapy, 'd like you to help out with the horses
Rubbing them, cleaning up the stalls
You think you can handle that
Grace knows him well enough to know; That's not a question, is it
You're catching on
Grace smiles
-- Annie turns and, not looking where she's doing, trips over a calf, falling down
And calves, coming down the chute, start to run towards her
Suddenly, Tom grabs her by the leg and pulls her to safety
He helps her up and dusts her off
(not wanting to smile, but
) You okay
It is cocktail hour yet
Tom laughs
She takes a big breath
- The ranch is colored in amber light
Near the house, two long tables pushed together to make one long one
gentle breeze ruffles the tablecloth
Everyone is seated for a meal
We hear laughter and conversation
We parachute into the middle of the moments; -- Hank helping with his wife get to their three children to sit still for dinner
-- Diane organizing the women and their various plates of side dishes
-- The Ranch Hand piling up their plates and kidding each other
-- Joe is instructing Grace on the various sauces for the ribs
The Twins are making fun of him behind his back
-- Tom and Smokey are barbecuing, the last one to sit
-- Frank assists his frail mother,  , at the table, filling her plate with all the things she can't reach for
: The faces are beautiful
Laughing
Eating
Everyone is tanned and exhausted after a long day, but filled with life and eager to live it
The tables are covered with heavy food
The communion at this table is as much a part of the ritual as the branding itself
Annie and Grace look different to us
Tanned from the sun, their bodies sore -- they feel softened, yet more vital
As if the artifice had been worn off
the armor of urban life
As the table thrives with conversations, we focus on: Annie and Ellen Booker
Annie looks calmer than we've seen her -- and more naturally beautiful
She is seated beside Ellen Booker
We sense they have been talking for a while
Annie is so sincerely interested in listening to her, she's hardly touched her own plate
he was a blacksmith by trade, my father
My grandson Joe was named for him
But he always dreamed of having his own place and raising horses
We see Tom a few places down and across from Annie and his mother -- but fully aware of their conversation
He'd heard of some land
What's Stockett now
Rode out there
Got off his horse and walked about as far as he could in one way
Then he walked as far as he could another way and another until he got back to where he started and that's where he put his roots down
That's where my husband and  ranched and raised Frank and Tommy
She motions proudly to Tom who looks up
Annie smiles to him
He looks to her with gratitude for the respect she's showing his mother
Quite a different life from what you know,  expect
Which place to you call home
Well,  was born in London, but my father was an ambassador and we moved constantly
've lived in a lot of places but  don't really know what 'd call home
Tom listens to this
An ambassador
My
That's very important
He was a wonderful man
She looks to Tom and he can sense a sadness around this in her eyes
(to Grace) sure hope you're gonna eat more than that, young lady
You're a growing girl
've never eaten this much in my life
Probably never worked so hard, neither
Those arms of yours are gonna be pretty sore tomorrow
'll give you a little bit of ointment make
It's a magic recipe my Mama gave me
We used to call Diane's mother Medicine Woman
None of us never went to the doctor when she was alive
Annie and Grace listen in
Too bad she wasn't here for old Henry Vanoker
Not much would have helped him
never got that whole story, what happened
Old Henry was changing a flat tire on his truck over on 118 when that
(laughs) two-hundred-year-old jack he has gives way and the side of that truck come slamming down on that rock he calls head
There's laughter -- everyone knows Old Henry
Except: What happened
Knocked him out for a while
He woke up, finished putting on the tire and drove himself to the hospital
Old Fool
Darling, pass down those peas for me, thank you
Annie and Grace don't know how to respond
But everyone else takes it their stride as they continue eating
Grace notices Joe is whispering something to Frank, who nods his head and speaks to the table
Huh, Joe here has something to say
Joe stands, somewhat formally, with his hat on
wrote this for you Grandma
Mrs
Booker, and Diane, beam
Annie and Grace don't know what to expect
Joe stands straight as an arrow and recites a poem from memory
At first, Annie and Grace appear to be embarrassed for the boy but soon they can't help but be won over by his guilessness
He finishes and everyone applauds
Hank's wife asks: ' That was lovely
Who wrote that, Joe
wrote it myself, ma'am
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from
Be honest,  can't say  did it all myself
My grandma helped me get the words right
OOoo's and aah's and smiles and conversations erupting over each other
Only we see, Grace looking over to Joe who gives her kickass, shy grin
(raising his beer) Well, 'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves
'll drink to that
Everyone toasts and drinks
Annie and Tom exchange a look
She smiles, but not in a alluring way -- rather, in a grateful way
Grateful for this brief moment of community and good feeling
And somehow, Tom knows what she's feeling
No one notices this silent exchange -- except for Diane, who sees everything that's going on
,   - The Women are bringing in dishes and plates and food from the tables through the house and into the kitchen
Annie is among them, feeling apart of the group
She enters carrying a large bowl, that held the corn
Diane is replacing newly-cleaned forks and knives in her dining room drawers, above which are several
(referring to clean bowl) Where does this go, Diane
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table
have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow
Annie complies
She notices the framed pictures on the wall in the dining room
Is this Mr
Booker
Tom's grandfather
Diane looks at a faded photo circa late 1800's
Mm-mm
never knew him
He died before Frank and  met
This here's
(another photo) Frank and Tom's mother and father
there's little Frank and Tom
She calls him Tommy
Always did
think she favored him a little
You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same
She studies the old faces of Tom's Parents -- although 20th Century people, there is still a pioneering strength in their visage
a stoicism and power
(putting away forks) Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off
They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion
She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise
got a little confused though
The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one
Diane is sorting silverware throughout the following: No
See, Frank and Tom were raised near the Clark's Fork River, right between the Pryor and Beartooth Mountains
Beautiful piece of land
But they had this uncle Ned -- useless man, never interested in ranching
And when the grandparents died, he left for the city and sent word through lawyers he wanted his claim to the land so he could sell it
Three years of legation broke their father
Frank took it all in stride, but Tom
Tom loved that land
don't think he ever got over it -- His home being sold out from under him
Seeing his father like that
Once he and Frank got their folks set up in a new place, Tom left
went off
We didn't see him for years
Annie is intrigued by what she's learning about Tom
Something outside the window catches her eyes
She watches: ; Tom and Frank, on either side to Ellen, are escorting her to a car that will drive her home
- Annie wanders out, passing Grace and Joe on her way out
The two are sitting in a glider
As Annie exits
, we hear them; Why do you always wear that hat
Because it fits my head
You want to try it on
Grace doesn't know if she should
Annie continues towards Tom who's sitting in a rocker playing with the twins
Show us again
Come on
One more time
It's my turn now
All right, al right
Hold out your finger
Annie takes a seat nearby and watches as Tom holds out the first finger of his right hand
The Twins holds out his
Tom splits his focus between Annie and the Twins as he takes a small piece of rope out of his back pocket
He ties the ends together making a loop
He puts the loop over the Twin's finger
And holding the other end of the loop taut with his left hand, he draws one side of the cord over the other with the middle finger of his right hand
Then he rolls his hand over so it's under the loop, and back over it again, so that his finger is tip to tip with the Twin's
The loop seemingly knotted around their touching fingertips, and can only be removed if their touch is broken
The loop's knotted, right
(Twins nod) Looks like the only way to take it off, is if we break our touch
(they nod) Watch now
Annie and the Twins look down at the touching fingers as Tom gently pulls the rope away, revealing they are still knotted, and without even breaking their touch
Again
Again
One more time
Oh, no
No, no
only fall for that once
Go inside now before your mother starts hunting you down
Go on
The Twins exit
Annie and Tom make eye contact
(smiles, relaxes back) So how was your first and last day of branding
Don't be so sure it's my last
There are a few people back home 'd like to put under a red hot iron
Tom looks at her with a sly expression, and notices she's shivering
You got too much sun today
Here
He takes his jacket and puts it around her shoulders
Thank you
He sits back down
Annie crosses her arms over her chest, looks around, unconsciously swinging her foot
Tom watches her leg
Annie notices him watching; What
You ever just stand still for a minute
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger
(smiles wryly) You know, sometimes,  get the feeling, Mr
Booker, that you're laughing at me
Why is that
Tom shrugs
Annie waits a beat, then: That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me
Oh,  see, you write both sides of the conversation
It's a man's world, Mr
Booker
Most women have to
Well, maybe  am laughing a bit just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little
(understanding) Well
It's beautiful country, 'll give you that
And  could see having some kind of vacation place
Retreat
But don't know how you do it full time
Don't you miss the rest of the world
What's that to miss
Ha
if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh
god, a million things, then it's something  can't explain
(thinks, teasing a bit) Does Chicago count
(surprised) You lived in Chicago
When  was first married
(stunned) You were married to a woman in Chicago
Tom likes disturbing her picture of him as the predictable cowboy
He smiles; once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra
He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34
No
14
It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music  ever heard
actually forgot where  was for a time
(Annie is floored) You seem surprised
(not wanting to insult) Well, , uh
you didn't
Just who's been laughing at who here
Tom says this with a wry smile
Annie returns with a smile -- as an understanding is reached between them: they've both stereotyped the other
They are both pleased -- and attracted -- by what they don't know
- Grace is fast asleep, exhausted
She does not stir when the phone rings
Annie picks up from her own bed, awakened, still dressed in her branding clothes, having just passed out on the bed
Hello
- : Robert, alone, in the vast apartment
thought you guys were going to call me
Oh, Robert, 'm sorry
We were so tired from the branding
Grace barely made it to her bed and  didn't have the energy to take my clothes off
Oh well
branding will do that to you
Everything all right
Huh-huh
You
Fine
Actually, today was a good day
You should have seen her
wish  did
The sound of self-pity was so obvious for both of them, so Robert quickly re-groups, resorting to something he knows is important to her; Well, uh the real reason  called, actually, was to tell you  saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried
About what
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors
Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names
She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon
Oh
didn't look at my faxes today
We left before sunrise
Honey,  hope you're not endangering your position
Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, 'll work it out mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you
After a day of hard work and simple pleasures, Annie begins to succumb to old anxieties and pressures
- Annie is awake reading the faxes Lucy sent
One after other
As she flips through them, one falls to the floor near the bed
She gets down on all fours to retrieve and sees something under the bed
,
She pulls it out to find the initials
carved on the top
She opens it to find papers, receipts, bills -- all from Tom's married life
- Tom rides a young colt along the creek
He hears footsteps
He turns and sees Annie running along the creek on the other side
He stops to watch
When his horse , Annie looks up to see him
She stops
He tips his hat to her
've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat
jogger, huh
don't jog, Mr
Booker
run
Lucky for you
The grizzlies around here only go for joggers
If  can survive rush hour,  figure can handle grizzlies
(smiles) You sleeping all right in that house
don't sleep all right anywhere
But the house is fine
Tom walks his horse across the creek to her, comfortable in the silence
Annie moves about, uncomfortable in the waiting
Who's
Tom is finding Annie's blunt curiosity more endearing
found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts
Sorry about that
thought everything got cleared out
is my wife
ex-wife
Rachel
We used to live in that house together
thought you lived in Chicago
thought you were an editor, not a reporter
Annie smiles and nods, realizing she's asking too many questions
She tries to casually reach out to touch the horse's head, but it's too abrupt and the horse tosses his head away, taking a couple of steps back
Annie is embarrassed
have a way with animals
It's all right
He's young
Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you
Oh yes
forgot
She does and the horse sniffs at her hand
He's beautiful
Why don't you ride anymore
Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger
She did
Annie is somewhat moved by her daughter telling him that
don't know, really
No time mostly
cold wind blows
She folds her arms across her breasts
thought it was supposed to be spring
Tom can't help but notice her nipples are hard from the cold
He looks away
She laughs
Are you shy, Mr
Booker
Just polite
Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home
Annie is struck by the words "before you go home
" Tom ambles off on his horse
Enjoy the day
You too
Annie steps across the rocks at the ford, crossing the creek
Her foot slips, one of her shoes goes into the water
Shit
Need a lift
can handle it
She crosses the creek
She turns, giving him a small wave
He touches his hat
She runs off
Tom watches her go, head down, concentrating
- tense Annie is having a difficult phone with  ; David, we've been behind a day or two before
But Lucy just Fedexed me all the material and it'll be approved by the end of the day
(
) If nothing goes wrong
If the faxes don't go down
If the phone lines are opened
can't have this magazine hitting the streets by the skin of its ass, Annie
During David's lines, Diane has entered, carrying fresh towels -- she crosses into the bathroom
Oh, come on
This is such bullshit
The work is getting done, David
Lucky keeps me on top of everything
(
) Lucy isn't you
We're losing something without you being here
Now,  know this is a rough time for you, but  think we should make another arrangement
Without Annie's awareness, Diane re-enters and takes her time leaving, so she can take in all of Annie's things; her business "office," books, etc
What the hell does that mean
How much more do  have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me
(
) If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana
Diane can't help but notice a slight vulnerability in Annie
(
) Look, this is what we're going to do
Finish up this issue
'll set up a conference call in a few weeks
Just you, me and your lawyer and we'll just work this out so that everyone will be taken care of
Fair enough
Annie is now aware of Diane's presence and chooses to play it cool
It's not the moment
Uh, yes
Sure, David
(
) All right
Speak to you then
He hangs up
Annie forces a smile to Diane
Thank you
You're all doing too much
Oh, it's
wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you
have to go in once a week for shopping anyway
Annie doesn't know whether or not to accept
Oh
Well
thank you very much don't -- Before she finishes her line, the Phone Rings again
Sorry
(to phone) Hello
Hi, yeah,  just spoke to him
Oh, you know David, Mr
Strong Arm
Diane feels out of place and exits
Annie doesn't notice until she hears the door close
She pushes back her hair and takes a deep breath
She looks out through the side window and sees: Grace and Joe doing chores
Grace looks involved and not at all self-conscious
moment of gratitude and calm for Annie
- Pilgrim bursts out of a chute and into the riding arena
He runs to the far end and abruptly stops
Tom is holding the orange flagstick, and coiled rope, coming through a gate into the arena, crossing to the middle of the ring
Something in his demeanor tells us that fun and game are over
Pilgrim and Tom stand there, motionless, eyeing each other
Pilgrim snorts and takes a few, small steps backward
Tom takes a beat, then starts slowly towards Pilgrim, lifting the flag and "cracking" it
At the sound, Pilgrim whirls away from him and runs, around the arena
He starts to slow, looking at Tom
Again, Tom cracks the flag and Pilgrim runs, round and round the arena
like a ringmaster, Tom keeps Pilgrim moving, cracking the flag
Something about Tom's demeanor tells us it isn't going well
- Tom, carrying a saddle, comes around the side of the barn
Through the slats, he sees Grace working in the barn, watering a horse
She has stopped and is looking through the cracks of Pilgrim's stall at him
She turns and sees Tom through the slats
She goes back to work as Tom comes to the barn door
Come and take a ride with me
- They walk towards his pick-up truck
Can you drive
Drive
'm not old enough yet
It's never too soon to start
He enters the passenger side
can't
don't have all day
She hesitates and gets into the truck
-  - Grace doesn't know what to do
Put the key in and turn it
(Grace obeys) The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake
don't know if  can with my leg
Well, there's only one way to find out
(puts truck in gear) Give it a little gas
She awkwardly puts her prosthetic foot on the gas pedal
Too much
It lurches forward
She takes her foot off
Well, we know you can
Now you just got to feel how much
Try it again
She does
They slowly, very slowly, move along the dirt road
Nice, real nice
There's a little road down at the end here, turn onto it
Grace badly oversteers, but makes the turn
She drives along the road, across a pasture, heading toward distant mountains
Just follow this
Nothing to it
'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while
Just keep going till you run out of road
(afraid) don't know if  can
Not a question of if you can -- you are
Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself
Folding his arms over his chest, shutting his eyes, Tom relaxes back
Grace locks her hand on the steering wheel and her eyes straight ahead
- The truck is parked at the foot of a mountain
Grace, very pleased with herself, sits beside Tom on the cab's roof, looking around them at the great Montana
After a beat; Where did you get Pilgrim from
We bought him in Kentucky
My mother and  took a trip down there to see him
That must have been pretty special
Grace nods
It is a pleasant memory
He motions for her to be quiet
An old  with a prodigious rack of antlers, has come down out of the mountains
Seeing them, he stops in his tracks, dead still
They watch each other
Then the elk turns and runs back up into the mountains
Tom smiles at Grace who smiles back -- partly because of the elk, partly because she's alone with Tom
Are you afraid of anything
(thinks) Getting old
Not being of much use, guess
(beat) What went on out there, Grace
With Pilgrim
Grace doesn't say anything
Tom nods then; You see, Grace, 've got a problem
When 'm working with a horse,  like to know its history
Now, most times, the horse can tell you pretty much the whole story, but sometimes he can be so messed up in his head that you need more to go on
You need to know exactly what went wrong
Often times, it's the obvious thing, but something that went wrong just before that, maybe even some little thing
Grace is quiet
She doesn't want to think about that
It's like if 'm driving and run into a tree
When somebody asks me, "Well, what happened
",  don't say, "Well, plowed into a tree
" 'd say, "The sun was in my eyes
" or " skidded
" or " took my mind off the road for a second
" See what  mean
(Grace nods) don't know how you feel about talking about it and  can understand you might not want to
But if 'm going to figure out what's going on in his head, it'd sure help if  knew exactly what happened that day
Grace looks away
Tom smiles and gently puts his arm around her shoulders, which has a soothing effect on Grace -- making her feel safe
Not today -- whenever you feel like it
leave it up to you
Grace looks into Tom's eyes, wanting so much to unburden herself to him and have him make everything all right
She nods
- Tom is making his way to the house at the end of the day, when he stops and looks over to the Creek house -- -- the lights are on
And he can see Annie, exhausted
approving pages, talking on the phone and faxing all simultaneously
He gets an idea
- Annie sits on the porch of the creek house, with a guilt over herself, sipping coffee and deep in thought
She looks up to see: Tom riding towards the house on his horse, leading another horse behind him
He looks to her and smiles
(murmurs) Oh-oh
Tom reaches the house as Annie rises
The answer's no
You haven't heard the question yet
Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor
got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out
Poor thing
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill
No, ma'am, 'm afraid that's extra
She gives him a crooked smile
,  - Annie, in Levis and a jacket, rides Rimrock beside Tom across the pasture
We overhear them in the midst of talking
Relax our center
It's just sitting in a bucket
Yeah, it's been a while, but remember the basic ideas
'll stop talking then
He rides a few steps ahead as Annie realizes she doesn't remember
She just went into automatic " don't have to be told anything" mode
Actually,  never rode Western
'm sorry
Go ahead
Well, he don't know that
Just sit the horse
(watches her ride) Good
You have a nice seat
Thanks
Feel good
Yeah
You look all right
You want to pick it up a little
Tom urges his horse into a center
Annie canters alongside
Watch your reins, he'll go with you, give him some room, let him do the work
Relax, don't grab him with your thighs, just so long as he can feel your body
Annie responds to every suggestion without resistance
And she experiences this sense of pleasure -- this great animal beneath her, the physicality and the surrender of letting someone else lead
You want to let it go some more
She begins to let herself go, losing herself in the experience
She just nods
Tom breaks into a full gallop
Annie follows suit
She lets everything go -- her job, her marriage, motherhood, guilt, anxiety
all of it
Her only focus is the horse beneath her, and the man on the horse leading her
: - They ride along the creek, crossing at a ford
They ride up towards the mountains
: - They ride through a narrow pass with sheer rock walls, riding by a waterfall
: They ride across a meadow, cattle stepping lazily aside to let them pass
And as they ride alongside each other, appreciating the silence
: They ride up along a sloping ridge covered with pine trees
They come to the rim of a high bluff
They stop
They look out at the twin valleys that gave the ranch its name
And they can just see the old   hidden in the shade of some trees along the creek
Tom looks over at Annie, who is looking out over this beautiful vista
It's a whole other world you have going on here
It just goes along, doing what it has to
And you're a part of it, you just wake up and, and there you are
And everything that seems like life or death some place else -- doesn't affect any of this one bit
Tom is impressed by her feelings
He sees her saddle cinch needs fixing and gets off his horse
Lift your leg
Annie complies once she realizes what he's doing
How long did you live here with your wife
Five years
My son was born here
(opens her eyes) Son
Yeah
haven't seen him in a while
He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so
Good boy
Hal
Lives in New York near his mom
How did you meet her
College
In Illinois
She was playing the cello
hadn't heard cello music growing up
She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes
When she played, it was
Tom can't find a beautiful enough word
But Annie understands
She was the most beautiful thing 'd ever seen
Annie sees Tom as if with new eyes -- his love for this woman he lost
Why didn't it work out
She was never really happy here
She did the best she could
Annie looks at him and for the first time senses a kinship -- an understanding they both have of being torn between two worlds
a desire for home
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut
Sounds like a beautiful place
It is
It's lovely
Ever think of moving there full time
We did at one point
When we thought we'd have more children
And we after tried
We tried everything, but
wasn't meant to be
There is an awkward silent beat for a moment
Annie is momentarily self-conscious
Tom helps by speaking of himself; hear that
See,  knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but  wanted to try --  thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals
My son would grow up here
Maybe have one or two more
'd teach 'em what  could
They'd play with my brother's kids
All grow up together
And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em
That's very important to you, isn't it
Home
Yeah,  think it is
And  don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens
Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here
How did you find out all that
Tom looks right into her eyes and confesses without a shred of self-consciousness
got lost
They smiles
- The world is in silhouette
Off in the distance, we see Tom standing by his horse, offering his hand to Annie, helping her off
There's an awkward moment, neither of them wanting the day, or the moment, to end
- Grace is standing by the window, looking out at them
Their movements indicate an intimacy that upsets her
- After a beat; Tom gets back on his colt
He takes Rimrock's reins and leads him off
Annie stops for a moment, watching him ride away
She watches her mother walk towards the house; - ' Grace watches her mother stand there a moment, then turn and walk towards the house
Grace moves away from the window, her emotions churning -- jealousy, anger -- and enters her bedroom, shutting the door
: - Joe, hat tipped low, is riding his horse, leading some young horses, exercising them in the morning pasture
He sees Grace, walking with her cane, coming across the pasture
(shy) Hi
She stops
After a beat; Would you let me ride your horse
(hesitates) Have you talked to Tom about it
Of course  have
(beat, then:) don't know
You sure Tom said it's all right
She nods
He hesitates
Are you going to give me a hand or aren't you
He gets off his horse and holds it
She puts down her cane, then puts her hand on the saddle horn
She puts her prosthetic leg into a stirrup
Frightened, she starts to shake; You sure
Angry, determined, Grace tries to swing her leg onto the horse
She can't do it
Tears of frustration on her face
She tries again
She manages to pull herself halfway on, her prosthetic leg buckles and she falls
Frightened, Joe runs to her
You okay
She gasps to catch her breath
He reaches to help her up
She pulls her hand away
Embarrassed, she "runs" off
Joe remains still
He hears a little
He turns and sees the having been watching the whole thing from a small hill
As they run off, he yells, threateningly
You better not say anything
- We follow Joe running towards the creek house, fastening a good shirt
He's dressed and cleaned for dinner
He's late
- Annie is in the midst of making a spaghetti dinner
She's a little frazzled but she's on top of it
Grace enters wearing a lovely dress -- it is the first time we have seen her in a dress
Annie hears her enter before she sees her, asking; Honey, would you see if anybody wants -- Annie notices Grace standing there, in her dress
She stops
You look really pretty
Grace is a little self-conscious but grateful
She begins taking forks out of her dress pocket
thought there were too many forks on the table
Well, one was for salad
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork
(thinks, then;) You're right
Good
Grace puts them away
Does anybody out there want something to drink
'll take care of it
Thanks, honey
Grace nods and exits to the living room
: The room is silent because every Booker is '
Frank covertly glimpses at the scantily-clad models
The Twins sharing a magazine, doing the same thing as their father, but keeping an eye out for mom
Diane is looking at pictorial exposes on the kind of lives she only hears about on audio tapes
Tom sits off to the side, amused by the sight
Grace enters as Joe enters
They nod across the room to each other with a little smile
Would anyone like something to drink
We hear a  in the kitchen, then: (
) Everybody looks up for a minute
The Twins giggle
Diane gives them a dirty look
'll give your mom a hand
Diane watches him enter the kitchen, then returns to her magazine
- Annie has dropped a hot pot into the sink, after pouring the tomato out of it, and into a terrine
Everything under control
(laughs) Not really
'd forgotten how long it's been since 've done this
And couldn't get any Parmesan cheese
Just make yourself comfortable
am comfortable
Ha, ha
all right, well, uh  guess you can bring out the pasta
She undoes her apron and crosses towards the bowl
Tom's eyes never leave her
It's the first time he's seen her in her dress, sans apron
As she lifts the bowl to hand to him, she realizes he's been looking at her
There's a silent moment, then; You missed a button
Huh
She looks for it
Tom crosses to her and buttons it, then takes the bowl
Thank you
They're quiet for a beat as they exchange a look
Suddenly, Grace enters -- she clearly doesn't like the two of them being alone, Annie quickly covers; Oh, good, Grace, would you bring in the bread
'll get the salad and then we're all set
Tom has already exited by the time Annie finishes, and Grace grabs the bread basket
- We parachute into the middle of the meal
The spaghetti is a hit
We cut to different conversations and reactions around the table
Frank is in the middle of saying; It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month
don't think Warren would go for that
Grace is talking to Joe and the Twins
like, for instance, you can go on the Internet and access this thing called The Visible Man -- who was this murderer they caught in Texas that was executed and donated his body to science and you can call him up on the screen and dissect him, like in Three-
Grace eats as she talks
Joe and the Twins are fascinated
Annie asks Tom, Frank and Diane; Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager
We have a business manager
The best around
Ha
Diane takes care of the books
don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny
Ain't brain surgery
It's pretty impressive
Where  come from, you'd be a gold mine
Diane doesn't know how to accept that, but inside she's bursting with pride
She focuses on the Twins who fight; This is  fork
That's  fork, ya idiot
Hey
You stop that kind of talk at the table
'll have another round of that spaghetti if may
Absolutely
made enough for an army
uh
like the sauce very much
Maybe get the recipe
Annie is so pleased and is about to reply, but Grace, noticing Tom smiling at Annie: It's from a jar
There's an odd silence as a deflated Annie serves Frank
Thank you
Finally, Diane saves it
Well,  tried jar sauce once -- wasn't this good
Ya gotta know which brand to buy
'd like to get the name of this one
Annie is grateful
Grace feels foolish
() Can we see the dead body on the screen
What
It's just my computer
Oh,  don't -- It's okay
Grace, show them
'm going to put the coffee on
made an apple tart for dessert
The Twins excitedly move to the computer
Joe waits for Grace
'll help you with the coffee
Well
know  should reject that offer, but 'm not going to
(jovial) No reason you should, no reason you should
They exit into the kitchen
Frank continues eating
Tom looks around -- Grace showing the boys the computer
Annie and Diane in the kitchen
For a second, we see Tom realize an image of the life he once thought he could
- As Diane and Annie prepare coffee and dessert; was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids
Were you ever in Egypt
was there for that shot, actually
What was it like
Oh, God --  think it was the fourth or fifth time 'd been there, so all remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was
She laughs as she directs this last line to Diane, who just smiles
And Annie realizes that's not what she meant at all
This woman is starving for glimpses into this other life
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else
It's like going back in time
(Diane listens) remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me
and  felt, connected to
to time itself, almost
Ha,  never realized how hard it was to describe
'd love to go there one time
You and Frank ever take a vacation
Soon
We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married
Frank loves in there
Annie can sense the disappointment in her voice, and at the same time, the comfortable resignation
Suddenly, from inside, they hear    as the children fight
() () : Diane and Annie enter to find Joe and Scott fighting, as Tom tries to break them up
Boys
Settle down
() You never let me have a turn
Don't be such a baby
() You just showing off for her
You shut up, stupid
() You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse
Everyone goes quiet, except for the computer screen
You little shit
() saw 'em
In the pasture
Her trying to get on Gonzo
saw 'em
What does he mean
Nothing
Did you go riding
Little shit
Joe lunges for Scott and the two start rolling in a fight
Frank and Tom work to pull them apart as Diane yells
Annie, 'm so sorry, but they're just tired
We'll have dessert another time
Frank, get them out of here
(to other Twin) Come on
Say good night and thank you
Voices everywhere
Yelling
"Thank you's
" During which, Grace quickly turns and exits
Annie eyes follow her out of the room, but with her guests and the chaos, she doesn't know whether or not to leave
Dinner was delicious
Thank you
(to Twins) Say thank you
Diane and Frank usher the kids out
Tom holds onto Joe until they're gone, then lets him go
Sorry, ma'am,  thank you for dinner
It was very good
Did Grace try to ride, Joe
(hesitates) expect you should talk to Grace about that, ma'am
And if  did anything wrong, then  am sorry
Ever the gentlemen, Joe exits
Annie looks to Tom
He's about to leave, when he stops and says: Don't let her turn you away
Tom exits
Annie stands and faces Grace's closed door
Slowly, she lowers herself to her knees and sits on them, thinking
reminiscent of Tom, waiting for his moment with Pilgrim, in the field
, '  - We don't know how long Annie waited, but she knocks gently, then enters to find Grace, in her nightgown, on her bed, with the night stand light on
Her prosthesis is against the wall
Grace
Is everything all right
(no answer) Can we talk
About what
Well
(nervous) So you tried riding again
(snotty) Yeah
Does that mean 'm cured
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you -- You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home
What are you talking about
You
not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much
Grace,  don't hate your father
can't remember the last time you made him dinner
was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and -- Tom
Annie sits by the bed, Grace moves away a little
Look,  just wanted to say,  think it's great you're riding again
And
and  think  know why you, you needed to do it alone
without anyone knowing
Yeah, you know everything
Why can't  talk to you
,
Stop pretending like you care
Like this really isn't about you and Tom
(angry) How can you -- (at a loss) 'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but  happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what  say, it's wrong and no matter what  do, it's wrong
'm sorry 'm such a disappointment to you
Well, now you know what it feels like
Beat
don't deserve that
have never looked at you as a disappointment
If 'm on your back to do better, if push you to try harder it's because want you to be the best you can be
Because 'm your daughter which means you're the best mother
Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family
Proving everybody wrong
Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman
Beat
They're both exhausted
Listen, if
if there's a part of you as parent that
that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well
if that's wrong, then 'm sorry
(no answer) But it wasn't my intention
don't push for me
do it for you
So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong
Yeah, well, you've done a great job
Beat
Annie feels deeply hurt
Well, then  do apologize
But what 'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling
who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not
Annie stops to exit as Grace says something under her breath
Annie stops
What did you say
said
started
Grace starts to sob
Annie doesn't understand
Started what
My period
(softer) When
Tonight
(nods) felt it happen downstairs and when went into the bathroom
Annie reaches down to touch Grace's shoulder
Grace turns -- there is no anger in her face
Annie sits and takes her in her arms
Grace clings to her and sobs like a little girl
Annie sees tears run -- gratefully, lovingly
Who's going to want me now
What
Oh baby
Who's ever going to want me
Nobody will
That's not true
Why should they
Because you are
one of the most
incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman  have ever met
The efforts you make
Your courage and your dignity
(laughs thru tears) don't know where you got it honestly don't know how  would have handled all this if  were you
Grace is so grateful, they cling to each other even harder
As the tears subside, Grace manages to admit
'm sorry
about what  said
It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid,
used to pray at night that it would work
And not because of you guys or that  wanted a brother or sister
but
just so  wouldn't have to be
What
So special
Because  was the only one
You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and wasn't
was just me
And now 've completely ruined everything, anyway
They both start crying again as Annie rocks her gently
Sshhh
Ssshhhh
They hold each other as if for dear life
--   to discover mother and daughter, fast asleep, in each other's arms
' ,   - Tom sits alone, writing at his desk
His music is playing
He stops to look out the window overlooking the Creek House
Annie and Grace fell asleep with the lights still on in the living room
Tom is thinking of Grace and Annie -- wondering what happened after he left
conflicted by what he feels for Annie
And remembering why they're here in the first place
: - The phone rings, awakening Annie first, then Grace
Hello
(
) Hello, this is  Conference Service
Is this Annie MacLean
Yes
(
) have a conference call scheduled for you with Mr
Gottschalk and Mr
Farlow
(remembering) Oh
Oh, yes
One moment, please
Who is it
Uh, nothing
'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me
Sure
Annie moves to the other room, sits down at her office space, takes a breath, then picks up, yelling to Grace; Okay, Grace
(click) Operator
'm ready
- Annie and Grace are standing by the arena fence
Frank, Joe and the Twins are sitting on the fence rail
Joe is holding a saddle and a bridle, standing in some shadows in an empty arena
Pilgrim comes running into the ring
Out of habit, he starts circling the ring
He sees Tom holding a saddle
Pilgrim walks towards him
Curious, he stops, looking at him
Tom puts the saddle down, sitting crossways on it
Pilgrim walks towards him again
He stops, looking at Tom again
Tom just sits there, playing with the bridle
Pilgrim walks around him
Tom doesn't show him any interest
Pilgrim comes closer
He looks at the saddle
He runs off
He stops, looking back
Tom just sits
Pilgrim walks back over
Tom stands and shows him the bridle
Pilgrim comes closer, sniffing it
He rubs his nose against the leather
Tom pats his head
Then, in one quick, but deft motion, he puts the bridle on him
Pilgrim tosses his head, but it doesn't seem to bother him
Grace and Annie watch intently
Tom takes the reins, walking Pilgrim around the ring
He walks him to the saddle
Pilgrim paws at it with his hoof
He turns and runs off
Tom lets him go
Pilgrim runs around the ring, slows down, looks over at Tom
Tom picks up the saddle
Pilgrim, cautiously, comes back over
Tom, with the saddle, walks away from him
Pilgrim, again curious, follows him
He nudges Tom
Tom stops
Pilgrim comes around to take a good look at the saddle
Tom rubs his back
And gently, like laying down a sheet, puts the saddle on his back
Pilgrim shuffles slightly at the touch
Tom quickly cinches it
Taking up the reins, he walks Pilgrim around the ring again
He starts to jog
Pilgrim jogs with him
And in the middle of the jog, Tom grabs onto the saddle horn, and without breaking his stride, pulls himself back up onto his back
He lays across the saddle, letting Pilgrim feel his weight
He sits up, and without letting him break his stride, he urges Pilgrim with his thighs, keeping him in the jog, riding around the ring
Grace and Annie cheer
Tom tips his hat to them
- Grace is cleaning stalls, etc
She exits one of the stalls with a pail and stops -- looking down the barn to where she knows Pilgrim is
She places the pail down and gathers her courage
She walks to Pilgrim's stall
She stands motionless for some moments before she opens the doors and enters
Pilgrim steps back a bit
He looks at her
He pins his ears back
Stomps his feet
Grace is about to turn and leave, but she stops herself and remains still
Slowly, she reaches out to touch Pilgrim's head
and he lets her
We see in Grace a maturity of character, a willingness to face what she must face
the beginning of a compassion, not only for Pilgrim, but perhaps for herself as well
- full moon lights the ranch
Tom pulls up to the ranch house in his truck, parks and gets out
As he walks towards the house, he hears: Grace exits the Creek House and coming towards him, a coat over her nightgown
Tom waits until she reaches him
was waiting for you to come back
Tom instinctively knows what she wants
You hungry
,  - Grace sits at the table
Tom is cooking at the stove
It feels as if they are the only two people on earth
Grace gets up her nerve
and begins: Judith was telling me about this boy she really liked
She never even had a chance to tell me his name
She starts to quietly cry, but it doesn't stop her
We were going to go around by the railroad bridge
And we see the accident all over again
But this time, a movie -- as clear as reality -- but in deathly silence
Just the sound of Grace's voice, and her heartbeat
,  - The horses are going up the icy path
(
) We were laughing about something, don't remember what
Her horse fell
Judith's horse suddenly stumbles on the ice, going down, throwing Judith, her foot helplessly caught in the stirrup
Her horse sliding back down the hill
Grace tries to move Pilgrim to avoid the errant horse, but it's too late, the horse plows into them, the horses sliding back down the hillside onto the empty
,
- Pilgrim is first to find his legs
Judith's horse, its leg broken at the ankle, walks in a confused state
Judith's foot is helplessly caught in the stirrup
(
) Judith's foot was caught in the stirrup
she couldn't get up, she was so scared
(cries) saw this truck, coming around the turn
She sees the glint of the steel
The Truck suddenly appears from around the bend
(
) He was honking, trying to get us to move
tried to grab the reins to get Judith's horse out of the way
Grace grabs the reins of Judith's horse
The horses are spooking
(
) And the truck started skidding
The truck skidded on the icy road, going out of control, jack- knifing, heading right for them
(
) It was coming right at us
There wasn't any time to do anything
It ran right into Judith's horse
The truck bed plows into Judith's horse
(
) Judith just disappeared
And it came right at Pilgrim and me
We see this
(
) And Pilgrim reared up at the truck and  fell off
Grace falls onto the road, the truck running over her
,  - Grace sobs uncontrollably now
Judith
Oh God, Judith
'm sorry
Tom is near and holds her as she puts her head on his chest
won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad
But  can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong
The same thing would have happened to me
or Frank
or Joe
And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen
(self-reflective) used to try and
always came up short
don't think the why so's important as
what we do with what we get
remember this boy 'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation
He was sixteen
Great kid
Strong
He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock
Snapped his neck, paralyzed him
After the accident, 'd look in on him from time to time
and he wasn't there anymore
His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared
And what was left was nothing but anger
It's like the boy  knew just went away somewhere
know where he goes
know you do
Don't you disappear
(holds her tighter) You do whatever you have to, to hold on
(thinks) 'll tell you one more thing
When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck
you know what  think think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you
That's what  think
Grace listens to this
As Tom holds her in silence, it's almost as if they were father and daughter
- - Tom stands with Grace in the corral
Tom's horse, Rimrock, is saddled nearby
Tom takes Grace's cane
Let me hold that
Grace stands, looking at the horse
can't
not yet
There's no hurry
Take you time
She's trying so hard to be brave
After a moment, she reaches for the saddle horn
She puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup, takes a breath and swings her leg up -- slipping, falling to the ground
Tom doesn't say anything
She pulls herself back up
She repeats the action
determinedly
She swings her leg over again and sits squarely on the horse
Tom remains still, but proud
As the day breaks, we leave them in silence -- Tom standing, hands in pocket
Grace sitting up on the horse, proudly
,   - Endless sky
Annie is jogging off in the distance when she looks up and stops to see: Tom and Grace, both on horses, stopped on a rolling hill
They do not see her
Annie is filled with emotion
pride for her daughter, gratitude for this amazing man
As the two ride off into the distance we do a slow: : : - Frank and Diane, with the Twins, dogs at their heels, ride in front of the herd
Behind them, Joe riding alongside Grace
Smokey and some Hands ride among the herd, keeping them moving
And riding behind the herd are Annie and Tom
Highlighting, in particular, those in which the rising sexual tension between Tom and Annie is apparent
- The cattle stands in silhouette
We hear singing
Everyone is sitting around a campfire
Frank's playing the guitar, singing along with Tom
They laugh when a lyric or a note goes wrong
Everyone is enjoying it
Annie, her arms around her knees, sits off by herself
The song ends and people applaud
Frank hands the guitar to Hank; Play that sweet one you know
The one makes my wife here so friendly
(slaps his shoulder) You
Hank begins to play and sing a painfully pretty song
His sweet voice is stark contrast to his gruff, strongman appearance
Frank offers his hand to Diane, she slaps it away and laughs, he helps her up and they start to dance
As everyone watches
Joe stands and offers his hand to Grace; You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you
don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody
(sweetly) wouldn't let happen
(affectionately) You know, you're a good kid
Joe smiles and helps her up
They come together and start dancing
Annie is watching, holding her breath with gratitude
Tom notices Annie off by herself and crosses to her
He extends his hand
She hesitates, looks again to Grace with Joe, then accepts
His hand slide to her back
Her hand to his shoulder
They dance
Their bodies closer than they've ever been
Slowly, she leans her head against his body
And surrenders, for the moment
Diane sees them
She holds her husband fast, and buries her head on his neck
- -- Taking Tom and Annie a bit further in their intimacy; perhaps Tom takes extra special care to explain things to Annie, or fix her saddle cinch, or make her laugh
- The cows stands in the pasture, grazing
Annie and Diane are cleaning some pots and pans in the stream
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh
Well,  have more than a few days, ha, ha
uh
'm sort of
not an editor anymore
right now
First time 've said it out loud
They fired you
No, it's more like a leave of- (stops) Ha, ha, ha
Yeah, they fired me
You don't seem to upset
Delayed shock
Or maybe not
know could talk my way back if  wanted or
go to another magazine, someplace
Just not sure if  want to
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home
This phrase "go home" stings Annie -- though Diane said it innocently
Did you always know this was the life you wanted
fell in love
After that,  never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife
never saw it like was losing some other life, just felt like  was gaining one
know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and ain't saying it's the right one
We all have to find the life meant for us
Frank's a good man
They don't come better
But  don't deny there are times  wonder about things  won't have
Maybe one day 'll get to see Egypt
Maybe not
But  know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all
Sounds like something Tom would say
Yes, it does
Annie and Diane resume washing the dishes in silence
Annie deep in thought
Until Diane stops
After a beat, Annie notices
What
Annie, 'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is
When you first came here, didn't like you and  was worried
Tom means a lot to me and this family
Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for
Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time
don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want
He's a good man, Tom is
He's got a gift, come from heaven above,  swear
But he's still a man
And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land
Diane's words ring in Annie's head
- Dead in stillness
The cattle dark and motionless
Everyone asleep in bedrolls around the pasture
Annie awakens, looks up at the moon, watching it go in and out of the clouds
She looks over to sleeping Grace
Then looks to where Tom is -- and sees his sleeping bag is empty
Quietly, she rises and looks for him
She starts across the grass and sees him crossing on his haunches, wearing a slicker, sitting in the grass by the stream, drinking some water
She watches him
Tom senses something and turns
For a moment, they just look at each other -- half disbelieving the inevitable is so close at hand
Annie approaches as Tom rises
They meet
They kiss
Tentative at first, but more, just to make that very, precious first moment of discovery last as long as it can
The kiss grows more passionate
They begin to lose themselves in each other
Until, suddenly, aware of their surroundings, they part
No words
Their expressions to each other tell all
Annie separates herself and goes back to her bedroll
Tom stands in the grass, by the stream
the moving water, the night's only sound
: - The cattle drive returns
Tom, Annie, Grace, et al
are on their horses, heading back towards the ranch when Grace sees in the distance; Dad
Annie looks up and sees: --  has come to the ranch
He is waiting for them with his luggage beside a rental car
standing out like an Like The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit in the middle of Wyeth's "Christina's World
" - Everyone is being introduced to Robert, as Grace hugs him from the side, never letting go of him
Frank, Diane -- who introduce their kids, then Tom and Robert shake hands
This is Mr
Booker, Robert
(extends hand) Tom
Hi
It's a pleasure
'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here
bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere
Oh yeah
Laugh
Awkward silence
Well  uh
can already see a change
(hugging Grace) And 'm very grateful to you
Robert is so sincere -- in that openly, modern, "express your feelings" kind of way
Tom just nods
Did you notice -- no cane
know
Amazing
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom
Oh, we're gonna show your dad plenty
Why don't you all get settled in and we'll do the tour
Excuse me
As Tom walks away, a nervous Robert feels compelled to say: See you later
Tom just nods and keeps walking
Annie and Robert face each other for a beat
Let's bring your bags inside
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves
The MacLean walk to the Creek House
- In the distance, we see the pick-up truck parked out in the pasture
Tom is standing with Robert -- in jeans, now -- and Grace, telling Robert about the ranch
Robert has his arms around Grace, asking questions, interested in everything
Grace is loving being with her two favorite men
- Grace waits in the truck as Tom leads Robert through the cows and cowshit, climbs up and hops over a wood fence
Robert follows suit -- not as gracefully -- and gets a splinter
- Diane is busy in the kitchen when Annie enters
Is there anything you need
'm going food-shopping
Well,  am going to go after lunch
No, no, 'll go -- just give me a list
Annie is determined
She needs to be by herself for a bit
- Tom continues his tour as the dogs run about them
Tom pays the dogs no attention, except to bark an order
Robert, however, engages with them -- picking up a stick and throws it
dog returns and gives it back
Robert kneels and begins rubbing the dog's fur, talking to it, looking like an anachronism in his baggy jeans with designer cowboy belt and spanking new designer cowboy boots
Tom waits patiently for Robert, who
and carries on with the dog a bit too long
When Robert gets up, he habitually brushes the dirt off his jeans, maybe even his boots, and makes sure his outfit is hanging properly
- Grace is in the stall with Pilgrim
Once again, close enough to touch him, which he allows
Outside the stall, stand Robert and Tom
Robert squeezes his splinter
can't believe it's the same horse
We still have a way to go
How much longer do you think
Tom understands this man wants his family back
Well, like  told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim
understand
: - Everyone is seated around the table, eating, talking, laughing
Grace is right by her father's side
Frank's in the middle of telling Robert: We thought we lost him in the snow storm
Told the kids
Had a funeral for the damn thing
Finally, snow stops
Staring to warm up
go out and start cleaning the truck
Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow
nearly stained myself
He thought it was a ghost
dog ghost
Laughter all around
: - Everyone is outside enjoying the night after a long day
Diane and Annie are on the porch
Diane is showing Annie how she does her needlepoint
Annie is genuinely interested
Tom and Frank and Robert are sitting out front
Grace is at Robert's feet
Joe sits on the ground in front of his father, opposite Grace
Is the poverty worse, now, you think
haven't been back in over twenty years, but  wouldn't be surprised
The population's larger
What were you doing over in India
Uh, this was right after college was in the Peace Corps
That right
Back on Diane and Annie, who hear the laughter
and look
Diane smiles, seeing how much Grace is enjoying her dad
She sure loves her daddy, huh
Annie smiles and looks herself
Yes, she does, she thinks
Why can't
Back to the others
Everyone is very interested in Robert's stories
especially Tom
and  thought before  settled into law school -- everybody knew that was the plan -- 'd take this time for myself
Grace rises to go to the Creek House
And  tell you, Frank, it was one of the -- As Grace passes by, she stumbles a bit and Robert habitually rises to help, but Grace ignores him and rights herself, continuing
Robert quickly sits back down, continuing
one of the uh
greatest times of my life
had experiences that, think, changed my outlook forever
came back a different person, literally
Tom listens with great interest and respect
Back to Diane and Annie, who watch as Joe follows Grace
think 'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave
Just might be his first broken heart
Oh, how sweet
burst of laughter pulls their attention to the group -- Robert is now standing, acting out a story
and  have no idea what he's saying because  don't understand Hindu
Everyone is listening, with big expectant smiles
Annie watches -- having heard this story before
Her eyes gradually shift to Tom, who is enjoying the story
So, finally 'm trying to explain to him that 'm allergic to wool and would he please get his sheep out of my car -- Laughter
Robert continues, giving a quick look to Annie -- who is looking at Tom
Robert lets it go, continuing his story
- Grace is asleep
Robert sits by her bed, lit by the moon through a window
He stares at this creature he loves so much
He rises and enters Annie's room
Tired
Annie shrugs
Robert looks at the bed
He teases
Small bed
Maybe  should sleep in the barn
(teases back) You're allergic to hay
(smiles) apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and figured
You don't have to explain
You have every right to come
can see why you put your faith in him
He's a genuine
good guy
Good at what he does
That's rare
Annie nods
She tries to hide her discomfort
Robert sits on the bed before her
You were right about coming here
'm sorry for not thinking
No, it's okay
Believe me, there were plenty of times  didn't know what the hell was right
How are you feeling about work
Let's not talk about that now
And they're quiet
He moves to kiss her
It's awkward
They look to each other -- as they try to remember how to make love together
feel like 'm on a first date
Annie smiles sympathetically
, '  - Cars and pick-up trucks haphazardly parked along a dirt road
Smoking open grill barbecues
Ranchers and families move about the ranch, sit and eat at picnic tables with gingham tablecloths
Some teenagers hanging around the corral, talking
Diane and some other women, eating and talking
Frank with a group of men, drinking beer, telling stories
has been set up by the barn
People are dancing under the harvest moon
Grace is dancing with Joe
Tom is dancing with a local woman
Annie with a rancher
Everyone is having a good time
Robert is enjoying a smoke with some men
He looks over to the dance floor and smiles when he sees Grace and Joe
Joe and the Rancher trade place
Joe dances with Annie, the Rancher with Grace
But Tom sees his chance and switches with the Rancher so that he can dance with Grace
She is thrilled and he guides her effortlessly across the floor
Joe and Annie are interrupted by another couple
Joe switches partners, but Annie smiles and excuses herself -- she wants to rest
Robert continues talking with some of the men
He puts out his smoke and looks over to the dance floor
He sees Grace now dancing with Tom
His eyes search for Annie
He moves away from the men until he sees, from a distance; Annie, sitting by herself, amidst the crowd
No one would notice her unless they were looking for her
But Robert does -- and what he sees is Annie looking at Grace and Tom
then, only looking at Tom
Smiling to herself gently
Watching his every move
Suddenly, she rises and exits out of the barn to get some air
'  - Annie finds an isolated spot, behind the main house, to be by herself and catch her breath
- Tom and Grace continue dancing
She's in heaven
Robert approaches and Tom quickly allows him to take over
Grace loves the attention from both men
As they dance off, Tom crosses the dance floor and is met by Hank's wife; ' Oh Tom, would you check the shed and see if there's anymore chairs
Sure
'  - Tom is walking along when he turns the corner of Hank's house and finds; Annie sitting alone, staring up at the night
They see each other
From behind the house, no one else can see them
It is as if the fates brought them face to face and alone
Without any will to stop it, they embrace and kiss passionately
But when they look into each other's eyes, there is no joy in the kiss
Tom releases her and walks away, heading for the shed
Annie quickly pulls herself together and enters the main house through the back door
,  - Diane is once more sitting at the kitchen table, looking over some bills before bed
Her tape player is on softly
Tom enters and crosses to the sink to get a glass of water
Diane looks up, seeing Tom with his back to her -- standing at the sink, filling his glass -- staring out the window over the sink
She looks to the dish of brownies on the table
have some brownies left over
Want one
(w/o turning around) No thanks
Diane senses an uneasiness in Tom
She looks as he drinks his water
-  ' , as if from Diane's
But when we pull back we find ourselves; - Tom is standing in front of Pilgrim's stall
He opens the door
They look at each other
He strokes him and begins to whisper; There's something you have to do tomorrow, boy
Camera gently moves away
and Tom whispers to Pilgrim what must be done
- There's a stillness
sense of import
Annie, Robert, Frank, Diane, Joe and Smokey, are all at various spots along the fence
Grace stands inside the ring
Tom is standing beside Pilgrim in the middle of the ring
Pilgrim is bridled and saddled
Tom adjusts he stirrup
He walks over to Grace
All set
Grace swallows hard, nodding
She's worried
Sure
(softly) Sure
Tom puts his arms around her shoulders and walks out to Pilgrim
The horse pricks up his ears as they approach
Tom motions Grace to stop a short distance from Pilgrim so as not to crowd him
Tom walks over alone, reaching to gently take hold of him
Holding him by the bridle, he puts his head beside Pilgrim's, quietly speaking to him, soothing Pilgrim's neck with his other hand
Annie and Robert are fascinated
Anxious
Pilgrim never takes his eyes off Grace
Tom tries to ease him forward
Pilgrim resists, lifting his head and looking at Grace so you can see the white at the top of his eye
Tom turns him away, walking him in circles, trying to calm him
He leads him back to Grace
Pilgrim tosses his head and stomps his feet
Robert grows more anxious
Annie is calmer, more focused
Tom climbs up on him, riding him around the arena in an easy lope
Grace watches them go round the ring
She looks at her parents and tries to smile
They try as well
Tom dismounts and leads Pilgrim back to Grace
Pilgrim balks again, violently throwing his head, kicking
Grace's shoulders slump, she presses her hands in her pockets, fighting not to cry
Smokey
Smokey climbs over the rail into the ring as Tom says something to him
Meanwhile Frank reassures Grace: He'll be okay, Grace
Just you hang on there a minute or two
Tom'll get him, okay, you'll see
Smokey jogs over to the gate, climbing it, and disappearing into the barn
Tom crosses to Grace
There's still something going on inside of him  can't reach
So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down
Okay
What does that mean
It's more or less how it sounds
Sometimes it's not pretty to watch
Some horses fight it real hard
Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight
So if you don't want to watch, 'll call you when it's done
want to watch
Smokey re-enters the ring, carrying some rope
He talks briefly to Tom
Pilgrim, sensing something, turns and runs to the far side of the ring
Tom, his arms spread, walks over to him, keeping him by the fence
Tom takes him by the bridle
Smokey comes beside him
Tom unhitches the bridle and in its place slips a rope halter Smokey passes to him
Smokey then hands him two long ropes, one at a time
Tom fastens one under the halter and ties the other to the saddle horn
Tom asks Smokey
You got that soft rope
Smokey hands it to him
Tom quietly talks to Pilgrim, runs his hand down Pilgrim's left foreleg and lifts his hoof
Pilgrim slightly shifts
And when he's still, Tom slips the loop at the end of the soft rope over the hoof making sure it's snug
And taking the other end of the rope, he hoists the weight of Pilgrim's raised hoof and ties the rope to the saddle horn
Pilgrim stands on three legs -- an explosion waiting to happen
Tom moves away from Pilgrim, taking the halter line from Smokey
Pilgrim, trying to move, finds he's crippled
Scared, he lurches, hopping on his right foreleg
Seeing he can't walk, panicked, he tries to run
Tom and Smokey, brace themselves, lean back on their ropes and force him around them in a tight circle
He goes around and around like a crazed rocking horse with a broken leg
Tom looks over and sees Annie has left Robert outside the ring to stand by an anguished Grace -- her hands on her shoulders, gripping her
Robert watches, feeling too much a foreigner
What is he doing this
It'll be , Grace
But even Frank isn't so sure
Pilgrim, covered in sweat, still circles
As he runs, his hobbled foot jabs at the air, trying to find peace
He runs and runs as Tom and Smokey lean on the ropes -- until he can't run any more and stops
Tom and Smokey let the lines go slack
Pilgrim, stands there, his wet sides heaving, panting like an asthmatic, making loud rasping sounds
Tom and Smokey speak
Smokey hands him his rope
Turning, he gets a coiled lasso out of the sand
He swings the rope in a wide loop and makes it fall over Pilgrim's saddle horn
He pulls it tight
And he takes the other end of the rope to the far side of the fence and ties it in a quick release knot to the bottom rung
Coming back he takes the other two lines from Tom
Tom crosses to the rail
He starts putting pressure on the rope
Pilgrim feeing it, braces himself
The pressure tilts the saddle hold downward
(to Grace and Annie) He's trying to get him to go down on his knees
Pilgrim fights
Tom pulls on the rope
Pilgrim, slowly, begrudgingly, gives ground
Tom, brings him to his knees, but it is short lived
Pilgrim is muscling his way back to his feet
Tom pulls him down to his knees again
Pilgrim, fighting with every bit of strength, slowly gets to his feet again
But the pressure Tom is putting on the saddle is too strong and relentless and finally Pilgrim goes down on his knees and stays down
Yet Tom keeps the pressure on
Tom shouts to Smokey
Drop the lines and come help me
Smokey, dropping the line, runs over
They both pull on the saddle rope
That's enough
Stop it
Pilgrim snorts and foams at the mouth, fighting
But slowly, like a wounded bird, she starts giving in
He rolls over on his side and lays his head in the sand and is still
It seems like a total, humiliating surrender
Grace starts to sob, burying her face in Annie's chest
Robert feels impotent to help
Tom and Smokey stand over the fallen horse like two big game hunters at the carcass of a kill
Will you come here, please
Grace shakes her head "
" Frank motions to Annie for her to let Grace go
to let stand alone
We see that it's not easy for Annie to trust this, but she does
And she steps back to where Robert stands
Tom, his face set, walks toward Grace
Grace,  need you to come with me
Grace violently shakes her head ""
Robert gets up the courage to say aloud: Well maybe she shouldn't be here
Annie quickly turns to him and says with quick intensity: Robert
Let him handle it
Please
Robert can't watch this
He turns and takes a few steps
Just stops
standing behind and apart from Annie, to just watch
slowly becoming transfixed, like someone who can't stop staring at an accident
Tom reaches Grace and puts his hand tenderly on her shoulder
Grace,  need you to come with me
No, you're only going to hurt him some more
He's not hurt
He's okay
Look at him
(turned away) No
Grace, Listen
you've got to do this
Just trust me one more time
Grace looks into his eyes and is reminded of all this man has done for her
and she remembers her trust
Do what
Tom, prouder of her now than ever before
'll show you
Tom leads her across the ring, with his arm around her shoulder
Annie tries to maintain her composure
Robert remains still and focused
Tom and Grace come to Pilgrim, lying in the dirt, his breathing plaintive
Tom speaks gently; want you to lay down with him want you to stroke him
want to start with his hindquarters and rub him, feel him all over
Grace is shaking her head "
" He speaks more firmly
Grace, you've got to do what  say
Grace knows there's no way out
She takes a breath and slowly kneels in the dirt beside him, with Tom's help
She lays on him, rubbing him, his hindquarters, his legs, his side, softly rubbing his neck and the wet silky side of his head
Now, listen
want you to stand on him
What
Tom responds to their voice without looking at them: (they stop) Grace, do what 'm telling you
Stand on him
now
Grace obeys him through her tears
She lets Tom take her hand and guide her up onto the curve of Pilgrim's belly
Then he lets go
Grace stands there with teas steaming down her face -- standing on the animal she loved most in the world
It's so cruel
No
He had the choice
What choice
Either fight the way things are or accept it
Robert, however, is hypnotized by the event
He is having a private epiphany of sorts
Grace sits in the dirt by Pilgrim and strokes him quietly -- she begins talking to him, the way Tom does
Tom watches, as he cautiously steps further away
Pilgrim looks up at Grace out of the dark pool of his one sad eye
They look at each other
And we understand there's a connection once more moment of understanding
and forgiveness
Grace starts to untie his ropes
Smokey is about to stop her but Tom shakes ""
Pilgrim, like an infant coming out of the water, breathing life for the first time, gets to his feet
Grace and him look to each other
And all is still
Grace grabs the saddle horn
Pilgrim shuffles as if he's going to bolt
Grace quietly reassures him
She then carefully puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup
Pilgrim shifts slightly
Annie covers her mouth so as not to scream out her fear
Robert breaths heavily
They watch as Grace swings her leg, determined, and pulls herself into the saddle
Sitting on his back, Pilgrim tosses his head and looks as he's going to run off
But Grace puts her arms around his neck, and once again, quietly reassures him
She starts to ride him, slowly, her arms around his neck, talking all the while, around the ring
Annie laughs as she cries -- emotion overwhelming her
Robert feels almost numb with fascination, gratitude, confusion
The slow ride turns into a trot
then a lope
then a canter
round and round the ring
Frank and Diane smile
Diane looks to Tom and knows what he's feeling
Tom watches as any father would -- his heart pounding with pride for the miracle of his child
But he doesn't let on for a second
Grace brings Pilgrim to a stop, lifts her arms to the heavens, victorious
Everyone cheers
Smokey helps her off the horse
She stops to look at Tom, who busies himself with picking up the ropes
So she re-focuses on her parents
They run to each other and embrace
First, she and Annie
then, she and her father
But, as Robert and Grace hold each other and begins to exit, Annie manages to make eye contact with Tom
and tell him with one look, how grateful she is
and how much she loves him
And he receives it
- Work on the ranch goes on as usual while Tom and Grace keep nurturing Pilgrim back to life
- Grace and Annie go riding
- Robert takes an isolated hike up the mountain until he comes upon a ridge overlooking an inspiring vista
We can tell Robert is moved by the sight
Sweaty, tired, he find a place to sit
to be still
and to consider his life
- Frank's car is parked up for the trip to the airport that will take the Bookers to Branton, Missouri for Diane's cousin's wedding
Grace, Annie and Robert are outside saying goodbye to the Bookers; Diane, the Twins
and Joe
Joe awkwardly shakes her hand
then removes his hat and puts it on her head
Everyone laughs
They want to hug each other, but don't know if they would
Frank and Tom are packing the car
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room
(to Robert and Annie) got her a pasta maker from the catalogue
Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri
Probably use it as a planter
Diane
(whispers) Frank's touchy about his cousins
(they laugh) Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr
MacLean
Same here, Mrs
Booker
Thank you again for all your kindness
Ah
Diane turns to Annie
Robert instinctively steps away, saying goodbye to Joe and the boys
The two women look at each other with respect and concern
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself
There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing
already know the way
and it's not like  have a job  have to rush home for
(Diane nods) Between you and me,  could use the time alone
Diane understands
And you'll be all right by yourself here, (referring to Robert and Grace) after they've gone
Tom hears this bit of info as he passes by with the wedding present and puts it in the truck
Annie makes sure to avert her look
It's just one night
If  get uncomfortable, 'll go over to Hanks
(double meaning) Promise
Promise
Diane just nods, knowingly
She extends her hand
The women shake
Good luck to you, Annie
You too, Diane
They part
Diane starts giving order as she gets in the car: All right, everybody in
Frank, we all set
Camera wides as we hear the voices of departure
see the MacLeans waving
See Tom off by himself, waving
but thinking of something else
- In the midst of packing, Annie has made dinner for Grace and Robert
In the midst of eating, Robert asks: Shouldn't we have invited Tom over
did
He said he had work to do until late
Annie remains silent
-- Tom exits with a small, leather satchel
He crosses to his truck, tosses in the satchel, gets in and drives off
: - Grace enters the barn to say goodbye to Pilgrim
- She moves to his stall and opens the doors
He stands there, without any fear of her
She smiles and enters
She wraps her arm around his neck, pets him and whispers
'll see you home
- Everything is being packed up
Robert is dressed for travel
Annie is taping up the boxes containing her computer equipment
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut
Connecticut
told the office 'd work out of there next week
When are you planning to start back
Probably first thing in the morning
It's too late to start now
'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark
May  have a suggestion
Yeah, what
Take your time
(innocently) What do you mean
Annie looks up from the box to see Robert is calmly staring at her
His demeanor is different
Something's going on
You look like something's wrong
This is Robert's moment
He knows it
He takes a breath and hopes it comes out right: 'll tell you something, Annie -- stood there looking at what was happening to that horse
And, swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me
don't understa- (continues) And  have two choices
can either fight the way things are, or accept them
(Annie waits; he smiles) See,  always knew  loved you more
Didn't bother me
always felt lucky
a little amazed
that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me
And guess  thought as long as  did everything right -- if  was the best husband  could be, the best father
even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us
if  could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not
wasn't asking for more
told myself didn't need more
(smiles) But you don't know how you feel about me
You don't know
if you want a life with me anymore
(bravely) And  don't want you to come home until you do know
(the hard part) one way or the other
Annie cannot remember a time when she ever loved her husband more than in this moment -- knowing what it took for him to say this
She would not disrespect it with denials
Her throat is choked with tears, she swallows down
She nods
Robert nods, feeling both pride and heartbreak in the same moment
He picks up his bag, kisses her goodbye and exits
- Annie and Robert walk towards the car to find Grace, leaning against it -- looking depressed
What's the matter, honey
Gonna miss Pilgrim
Tom's gone
Both Robert and Annie are surprised
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden
He won't be back for three days
can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye
(hiding her own distress) Well
honey
you know
that's just not his way
Maybe you can write him a letter or something
Say thank you
Don't think about it
You take care and 'll see you home
She embraces Grace and, over her shoulder, watches Robert enter the car
Grace follows suit
The car drives off leaving Annie alone at the Double Divide
- The ranch is still
Annie stands on the porch, her arms folded, vulnerable, looking at the ranch
All her boxes are packed and stacked in the room
She looks over to the Ranch House
to Tom's window
'  - light goes on
Annie enters, cautiously
She's never been in this room
She crosses to the desk, touches it
She notices a tape player and pushes it on
She sees a small framed photo -- of Tom's son, years ago
Suddenly, she feels like an intruder
She shuts the music off and exits
- Annie faces Pilgrim
she gently lifts her hand and caresses his face
He returns her gentleness
Annie is remembering Robert's words, her heart is heavy with conflict
She jokes: Why do  get the feeling you know what  should do, but you're not telling me
She hears a truck pull up
Then, a door open and close
Her heart races
- Annie exits the barn and sees: Tom, walking away from the truck with the headlights left on
is walking right towards her
Annie begins moving towards him, When they meet: won't apologize for this
And won't hide it
Not for anybody
won't ask you to
He takes her in his arms and they kiss
- Tom leads Annie to the front door
She waits as he unlocks it
,  , '  - Tom leads her to his room
Annie cups his grasp on her with both hands
He opens the door for her, ushers her in, then closes the door
He hangs his hat
She turns to him
They embrace, surrendering to each other's passions
: - Camera pas from Tom's window, bright with dawn, past his desk upon which his classical music is playing, over to the two lovers in bed, kissing and embracing
Then: Oh, God, what are we going to do
'm supposed to -- Ssshhh
(she stops) Stand still, Annie
Takes what we've got, just for now
Can you do that
Beat
She nods
The permission Tom is giving her acts like a great burden being lifted, and for the time being, she surrenders and accepts the gift of what they feel
They kiss
- Since the ranch must continue, Tom and Annie move through a day of ranch chores -- --
--
,
- , ,
: ,   - --      , - -- ,
: --     , , - Tom and Annie, their horses packed with gear, ride across the high mountain pasture through the grazing cattle
- Annie and Tom sit overlooking a breathtaking view
Tom is showing her the rope trick
She looks down at their touching fingers and he gently pulls the rope away, still knotted, and without ever breaking their touch
Annie looks into his eyes, understanding what this means, raises his hand to her mouth and kisses it
She looks up at him with a curious expression; Show me again
Annie
One more time
- Annie lays asleep in Tom's arms, under a blanket
He picks up another blanket with his free hand and shimmies it under her head, laying her down
She snuggles with the blanket and keeps sleeping
Tom takes a moment to look at her as she sleeps, gently brushing her hair away from her eyes
He's deeply in love with this woman and wants to keep her with him
But there is a sad resignation in his look
confusion
He rises and walks to a stream nearby
He bends down to take some water when he hears something
He looks up and sees on the other side: giving birth to a foal in the tall grass
And a steps in between Tom and the mare, as if protecting her
Tom rises slowly to his feet
Then stands stock still
He and the Stallion penetrate each other
Suddenly this beautiful, powerful Stallion rears -- violently
Tom remains still, but clearly the horse is treating him as an invader
It's as if the Whisperer is now being guided by the Horse towards understanding
As Tom receives it, he remembers; (
) Summers are short here, Annie
There isn't much of a fall
Before you know it, the roads are closed
the nights get long
(
) don't care
We'd be together
(
) Two people can't just be alone together in the world
At least not us
(
) can't do this
can't leave you
Voice-Overs have carried over into a
: - Tom and Annie make love
(
) won't
But there is a difference in their lovemaking
There's a slowness, a reverence
a sense of two people so bounded, that they are outside of time
Their love is so strong it almost feels like despair -- their need to connect has gone beyond their bodies and into their spirits, for which there is no earthly satisfaction
- The sun has risen
- Annie awakens in bed and discovers she is alone
She looks around for Tom
She rises and enters the other room to discover: All her boxes and all her luggage have been removed
Her heart sinks
Tom re-enters, fully dressed, to get the last box
He sees on her face a look of confusion and hurt
figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set
(curt) How thoughtful of you
And what if decide not to go
Tom doesn't know how to respond
He looks away and bends down to reach for the box when Annie commands: Leave me alone
Beat
They stand awkwardly for a moment, until; (pleadingly) Annie, please
Tom reaches to embrace her, but Annie attacks him
Punching his chest
pulling at his shirt as Tom tries to put his arms around her
' Tom's heart is breaking as he manages to get his arms around her and hold her
as she breaks down and softly, the rage passes
Annie speaks softly
(struggling) don't know any other way, Annie
(more adamant) Why
Suddenly; You think this is easy for me
Annie is struck by the powerful sincerity of his words; It's just happened this way sometimes
can't explain it
But  look at you and see Grace and  see Robert, and no matter what you decide about him, just know this is right
Your life isn't here and you know it
Annie looks into his eyes and asks, softly defiant; Then what have we been doing
mean what was the point
(confused by her question) The point was to love each other
Why
As if there has to be a result
Tom looks at her and says with an almost innocent conviction: Because we had to
And 'll never stop loving you, Annie
Here
Where my life is
The simplicity, and truth, of it hits Annie strongly
Annie releases herself from him and turns away
despondent
Realizing the utter truth and inevitability of what he says
She starts shaking her head
Tom can't hear it
He reaches for her; Annie
She turns back into his arms and they kiss passionately
holding each other
as if for the last time
- Tom is escorting Pilgrim into the trailer attached to the Suburban
He looks across the ranch to see the figure of Annie, standing alone, perfectly still, in the pasture, looking out to the horizon
(reminiscent of Tom earlier in the film) - Tom approaches Annie from behind, stopping a few feet away
Annie
She doesn't answer
as if she has found her own private place within her, at last
place of strength
She looks as if she knows what must be done
She hears him about to walk away when she asks: Can we go for one more ride
Tom stops
Considers this
Then: Sure
'll saddle them up
He exits
Not seeing the tears in Annie's eyes
- Tom enters the barn slowly
He crosses to Rimrock's stall
then stops
As if he is waiting
As if he knows
Then
he hears the sound of Annie's Suburban starting up
He looks up and knows she's leaving
He waits
- Wide angle of Annie driving away in the Suburban with the trailer
- Annie doesn't look back -- her eyes wet with tears -- but no sobs
- Tom lowers his head
It is not his way to say goodbye
And he is moved by Annie's knowing
&    -  & of images of Annie traveling home
Across different terrains, we see Annie driving -- missing Tom
thinking of what she will decide by the time she gets home
Remembering   : -- Riding on Rimrock and tipping his hat to her
-- Sitting in the pasture, staring at Pilgrim
Ignoring her
-- Seeing her arrive at the ranch for the very first time
- Annie drives, she continues remembering
-- She and Tom in the branding
-- She and Tom dancing around the camp fire at the cattle drive
-- She and Tom kissing in secrecy behind Hank's house the night of the barn dance
- Annie continues driving and remembering; -- Annie and Tom coming towards each other that first night after everyone had left the ranch
-- Tom opening the front door to the ranch house
; : '    - much younger Annie waits, surrounded by luggage, as revealing a much younger, more vital, very handsome Robert: Yes
Hi
Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay
Are you "Tubab"
No
am a "tubab
" What do you mean
Tubab means white man
Annie is first surprised, then embarrassed but Robert seems so charming and his smile breaks into a laugh, that she just nods and laughs herself
'    - Over a meal, Robert talks excitedly of his experiences
Annie is captivated
'    - After Annie and Robert have made love, Robert sleeps with his arms wrapped around Annie
She lies awake, feeling safe and loved
: - Annie stands where she stood when she and Grace stopped here on their way to Montana
She removes from her pocket the   he made for her, and looks at it
: - car is driving up the driveway to the house
It stops
Robert and Grace get out as Annie exits from the front door
She looks beautiful -- but in a completely different way than ever before
There is a calm center to her
softness and a strength
She smiles and walks to meet them
Oh,  miss you
You look beautiful
So do you
How's everything
Good
(to Robert) Hi
Hi
They kiss as Grace watches
Was the trip okay
Mmm
made good time
(to Grace) Pilgrim's in the back
found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow
Great
Go ahead
Grace exits excitedly
Annie and Robert face each other
Robert doesn't know what to expect
but he softens when Annie smiles: have so much to tell you
You want to take a walk with me
(a little nervous) Where to
(smiles) don't know
Let's just go and
we'll see
Annie nods
He reaches for her hand, and Annie gives it willingly
They begin to walk away from Camera
together
Annie begins to speak, telling him what we already know
How he will react or what will happen, is unknown
But these two people will no longer avoid their life together
somehow, they will make the effort to face it together
As Camera Widens, we see included in the frame, Grace and Pilgrim
as she strokes him and whispers in his ear
and leads him for a walk
