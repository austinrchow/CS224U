" & " by David Newman & Robert Benton - Blonde, somewhat fragile, intelligent in expression
She is putting on make-up with intense concentration and appreciation, applying lipstick and eye make-up
As the camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we have been looking into a mirror
She is standing before the full-length mirror in her bedroom doing her make-up
She overdoes it in the style of the time: rosebud mouth and so forth
As the film progresses her make-up will be refined until, at the end, there is none
The camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly throughout the first part of this scene
As the camera continues to move away, we see, by degrees, that  is naked
Her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the audience, but implied
That is, she should be "covered" in various ways from the camera's
, but the audience must be aware of her exposure to  later in the scene
This is the only time in the film that she will ever be this exposed, in all senses of the word, to the audience
Her attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with narcissism
The bedroom itself is a second-story bedroom in a lower- class frame house in West Dallas, Texas
The neighborhood is low income
Though the room reveals its shabby surroundings, it also reveals an attempt by  to fix it up
Small and corny objets d'art are all over the tops of the bureaus, vanity tables, etc
(Little glass figurines and porcelain statuettes and the like
) finishes admiring herself
She walks from the mirror and moves slowly across the room, the camera moving with her, until she reaches the screened window on the opposite wall
The shade is up
There are no curtains
She looks out the window, looking down, and the camera looks down with her
'
Over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the garage connected to the house
There is an old car parked in the driveway, its windows open
We see a man walking up the driveway, somewhat furtively
He is a rather dapper fellow, dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a straw boater
It is
Obviously, he is about to steal the car
He looks it over, checking around him to make sure no passers-by are coming
He peers inside the front window to see if the keys are in the ignition
He studies the dashboard
continues watching, silently
Finally she calls out
2
Hey, boy
What you doin' with my mama's car
, startled, jumps and looks to see who has caught him
Obviously frightened, he looks up and his face freezes at what he sees
'
We now see what he is looking at: at the open window, revealed from the waist up, is the naked
She looks down, an impudent half-smile on her face
She doesn't move or make any attempt to cover herself
-   -  - -- whose face changes from astonishment to an answering smile of impudence
(Seeing what he has, he realizes that this girl is clearly not going to scream for the police
Already they are in a little game instigated by , sizing each other up, competing in a kind of playful arrogance
Before they speak, they have become coconspirators
) Close-up of , still smiling
Finally she speaks
Wait there
Running from the window, she flings open a closet and grabs a dress, and shoes
She slips on the shoes, and flings the dress on, running out the door as she does
The camera tracks with her, moving as fast
As she runs down the stairs she buttons up the dress
She flies out the door, slamming it behind her, runs off the porch (all this has been one continuous movement since she left the window, in great haste) and continues quickly into the driveway
Four feet away from , she stops on a dime
They stand there, looking at each other, smiling the same challenge
For a few seconds, no one speaks, then: (putting her on) Ain't you ashamed
Tryin' to steal an old lady's automobile
3
(with the same put-on) been thinkin' about buyin' me one
Bull
You ain't got money for dinner, let alone buy no car
(still the battle of wits going on) Now  got enough money for cokes, and since it don't look like you're gonna invite me inside-- You'd steal the dining room table if  did
(he moves from his spot) Come to town with me, then
How'd that be
(starting to walk onto the sidewalk) Goin' to work anyway
The camera tracks
It is a hot Texas afternoon, all white light and glare
As they walk the block to town in this scene, their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading
Goin' to work, huh
What do you do
None of your business
(pretending to give it serious thought) bet you're a
movie star
(thinks) No
lady mechanic
No maid
-- (really offended by that) What do you think  am
4
(right on the nose) waitress
(slightly startled by his accuracy, anxious to get back now that he is temporarily one-up) What line of work are you in
When you're not stealin' cars
(mysteriously) tell you, 'm lookin' for suitable employment right at the moment
What did you do before
(coolly, knowing its effect) was in State Prison
State Prison
(she shows her surprise) Yeah
(herself again) Guess some little old lady wasn't so nice
(tough) It was armed robbery
(sarcastically) My, my, the things that turn up in the driveway these days
They reach the corner and turn
They are on: --a small-town street of barber shops, cafes, groceries, etc
At the moment, it is deserted
They continue walking down the empty street
looks the place over
Tracking
5
What do y'all do for a good time around here, listen to the grass grow
Guess you had a lot more fun up at State Prison, huh
laughs, enjoying her repartee
They continue walking
At a hydrant,  stops
(showing off, but seriously) See this foot
(pointing at his right foot) chopped two toes off of it
With an axe
(shocked) What
Why
To get off the damn work detail, that's why
(stopping) Want to see
(a lady of some sensitivity) No
(turning a cute) surely don't intend to stand here and look at your dirty feet in the middle of Main Street
They continue walking in silence past a few stores, each planning what next to say
Boy, did you really do that
Yeah
You must be crazy
: 6
Gas station up the block
and  are seen leaning against the soft drink chest, their profiles silhouetted by the bright sun
They are drinking cokes
As they begin to talk, the camera moves in closer to them
takes off his hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead
watches him
What's it like
Prison
(very interested) No, armed robbery
(he thinks it a silly question) It's
don't know
it isn't like anything
(thinking she's heard proof that he's a liar) Hah
knew you never robbed bo place, you faker
(challenged) Oh, yeah
(studies her, then makes up his mind to show her) Close-up
Gun
Day
He reaches in his jacket and pulls out a gun
The camera moves to a closeup of the gun, glinting in the sunlight
The camera pulls back to show  looking at it with fascination
The weapon has an immediate effect on her
She touches it in a manner almost sexual, full of repressed excitement
(goading him on) Yeah, well you got one all right, guess
but you wouldn't have the gumption to use it
7
(picking up the challenge, proving himself) You just keep your eyes open
The camera remains just behind 's shoulder so that throughout the following scene we have  in the picture, looking at what we look at
goes into the little store
We remain outside with watching
For a minute nothing happens
We can barely see what is going on in the store
Then  comes out, walking slowly
In one hand he holds the gun, in the other a fistful of money
He gets halfway, to  and smiles broadly at her, a smile of charm and personality
She smiles back
The moment is intense, as if a spark has jumped from one to the other
Their relationship, which began the minute  spotted him in the driveway, has now really begun
has shown his stuff and  is "turned on
" Suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes running out into the street, completely dumbfounded
He stands there and says nothing, yet his mouth moves in silent protest
points the gun above him and fires
It is the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a shock
The old man, terrified, runs back into the store as fast as he can,  quickly grabs 's hand
The camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down the street
few yards and the stores disappear entirely
The landscape turns into that arid, flat and unrelieved western plain that begins where the town ends
car is parked at the back of the store
As soon as they reach it,  motions and  gets in
runs to the front, lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make it start
As he stands back,  calls to him: Hey, what's your name, anyway
(he slams the hood) Clyde Barrow
He runs over to the door, opens it, shoves her over, and starts up the engine
The entire sequence is played at an incredible rapid pace
8
(loud, to make herself heard over the gunning motor) Hi, 'm Bonnie Parker
Please to meet you
The car zooms off down the road, doing 90
The fast country breakdown music starts up on the sound track, going just as fast as the car
The car, still speeding, further down the road
We zoom down and look in the rear window
is driving, we see from behind
is all over him, biting his ear, ruffling his hair, running her hands all over him--in short, making passionate love to him while he drives
The thrill of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually
The camera pulls back and above the car
The car starts to go crazy in a comical fashion, manifesting to the audience just what is happening to the driver controlling it
The car swerves all over the road
The car comes to a sudden halt
The car starts again
It swerves this time almost right off the road before it straightens out
It jumps and jerks
Another car comes down the road the other way and 's car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive right off the road into the dirt
It is almost Mack Sennett stuff, but not quite that much
grabs the wheel and turns it sharply
It hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees
--still settling to a stop
and  appear to be necking heavily now, punctuated by 's squeals of passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea, trying to get to
The floor gear-shift is keeping their bodies apart, however
In exasperation,  takes the gear shift and shoves it forward out of their way
She plunges onto , burying him from view
9
(kissing, biting) You ready
(muffled, laughing) Hey, wait
(giggling herself) Aren't you ready
Well, get ready
has obviously touched him
With savage coquetry she tears into her clothes and his
(muffled) 'mon, honey, c'mon, boy
let's go
let's
(muffled) Hey
hey, wait a minute
quit that now, cut it out
(sharply) said, cut it out
He shoves her rudely away, slamming her into the far car door
Suddenly it looks as if they've been fighting
Both unbuttoned and unglued, they stare silently at one another, breathing heavily
gets out of the car, clearly shaken
Despite the fact that he may have encountered this situation many times before, it's one that no twenty-one- year-old boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss easily with bravado
remains seated in the car
She seems terribly vulnerable
She fumbles about for a cigarette, too confused to figure out what didn't happen
turns back and reaches through the car window from the driver's side, lighting it for her
casts  a fishy stare, then accepts the light
(trying to be casual, even insouciant) Look,  don't do that
It's not that  can't-- (his voice cracks, the match burns his fingers, and he bangs his head onto roof of car, and he goes right on) --it's just that  don't see no percentage in it
() 10
(') mean there's nothin' wrong with me,  don't like boys
doesn't know what she thinks, and  is trying to gauge her reaction--whether she feels rejected or repelled
In fact, it's both--along with a little latent fascination
(finally, spitting out smoke) Boy
boy
boy
(a little annoyed) Boy, what
Your advertising is dandy
Folks'd just never guess you don't have a thing to sell
(a little afraid) You better take me home, now
(getting back into car) Wait
Don't touch me
She gets out of car, leaving  draped across the front seat, reaching after her
(almost shouting) If all you want's stud service, then get on back to West Dallas and stay there the rest of your life
This stops her
Now  pours it on, with an almost maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets control of
But you're worth more'n that, a lot more, and you know it, and that's why you come along with me
You could find a lover boy on every corner in town and it doesn't make a damn to them whether you're waiting on tables or picking cotton, so long as you cooperate
But it does make a damn to me
11
(turning, intrigued) Why
Why
Because you're different
You're like me and you want different things
is hooked now
(continuing) You and me travelin' together, we could cut clean acrost this state, and Kansas, too, and maybe dip into Oklahoma, and Missouri or whatnot, and catch ourselves highpockets and a highheeled ol' time
We can be somethin' we could never be alone
'll show you
when we walk into the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone', you wearin' a silk dress, they'll be waitin' on you and believe me, sugar, they're gonna know your last name
He stops, having begun to woo her to something more intense than a casual, physical coupling
When'd you figure that all out
First time  saw you
How come
(intensely, with real honesty) 'Cause you may be the best damn girl in Texas
Close-up
Who are you, anyway
: 12
and  seated in booth, now
The sound track bridges the scene: the question that  has just asked is now suddenly rebutted by , as he points a finger at her
(not answering her, preferring to lead the conversation) 'll tell you about you
He loves doing this and he does it well
The more he envisions 's life, the more instinctively accurate he becomes
She grows more and more fascinated, like a child watching a mind reader
Lessee
You were born somewheres around East Texas
got a big old family, right
You went to school, of course, but you didn't take to it much 'cause you was a lot smarter than everybody else anyway
So you just quit
Now
(thinking, playing it for all it's worth) When you were sixteen
no, seventeen, there was a guy who worked in
uh
Pull back taking in , favoring
(fascinated) Cement plant-- Right
Cement plant
And you liked him 'cause he thought you was just as nice as you could be
You almost married that guy, but then
you thought, no, you didn't think you would
So you got your job in the cafe
(getting closer to home now, hitting them right in there) And every morning you wake up and you hate it
You just hate it
And you get down there and you put on your white uniform-- 13
(enthralled) Pink
And the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back, but they're stupid and dumb, boys with big tattoos all over 'em, and you don't like it
And they ask you for dates and sometimes you go
but you mostly don't, and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not
and you go home and sit in your room and think, when and how will  ever get away from this
And now you know
is half-mesmerized by his talk
waitress comes with their food
cheap, gaudy dame, she has spit curls on each temple in the style of the times
looks at her and at , who also wears spit curls
As soon as the waitress leaves: (pointing at her hair) Change that
don't like it
Without a word of protest,  immediately reaches in her bag and takes out a mirror
She holds it up and with the other hand, brushes back her spit curls into her hair
She never again wears them
When she has pushed them back she looks at  for his approval
He nods his okay
She smiles, puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food
She's ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on her plate
doesn't touch his food, just watches eat for a minute
God, you're a knockout
and  emerge from the cafe into the early evening
They move toward the car they have stolen
Just beyond sits a newer model car
is surprised to see  head toward the newer car
Hey, that ain't ours
14
Sure it is
But we came in this one
Don't mean we have to go home in it
She walks amazed around the new car and gets in beside him
He turns the key and they pull away from the cafe
The room is bare
In the middle  is waking, having slept on a couple of car seats covered with an old piece of tattered blanket
There are windows behind her
She looks about bewildered
Clyde
She starts to panic and runs to the window
(continuing) Clyde
At another window  appears
Hey, lady
(chagrined at her fear) Where you been keeping yourself
Slept out by the car
Oh
These accommodations ain't particularly deluxe
No
If they're after us,  want the first shot
Come on, you got some work to do
moves to the door and out of the house
15
On the door is a sign which reads: : -- Wide angle
Across fence
Day
On the dilapidated picket fence six old bottles have been placed
As  joins he turns and fires six quick shots
The bottles disappear
You're good
The best
And modest
Come on
Got you all set up over here
Wider angle
They move around to the side of the building where  points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree
He means that to be 's target
He hands her a gun
Set her spinnin'
fires
She misses
Again
Come down slow with it
fires again and hits the tire
She smiles and blows the smoke from the barrel in pride and self-mockery
Ain't you something
tell you 'm going to get you a Smith and Wesson, it'll be easier in your hand
Now try it again once
sights
As she is about to fire, a man appears around the corner of the building
She fires and hits the tire
Heighdo
16
whirls at the sound
He grabs gun from  because his is empty
He aims at
(frightened) No sir
no sir
You all go right ahead
watches him warily
(continuing) Used to be my place
Not any more
Bank took it
and  start to move toward the farmer
All three move around to the front of the building
At a distance we see an Okie car loaded with belongings
with a in arms sits in front
smaller  stands outside the car
Yessir, moved us off
Now it belongs to them
(He points at the foreclosure sign
) Well, that's a pitiful shame
shakes his head sympathetically
He loads the empty gun
(bitterly) You're damned right, ma'm
He looks up to see an   who has come from a distance shack and now stands near 's car
(nodding toward Negro) Me and him put in the years here
Yessir
So you all go right ahead
We just come by for a last look
He stands a moment looking at the house and then turns around toward his family in the car
and  look after him
spins and fires three fast shots into the fore-closure sign
The  stops and turns, looking at offers the gun to the farmer
He looks at it, then accepts it
He slowly takes aim at the sign and fires
It pleases him
He looks at  and  who smile
17
You all mind
and  are puzzled
Hey, Davis
Come on over here
The  moves toward them
Now  understands
She takes the second gun from  and hands it to
looks from  to the  and toward the house
The  fires again
This time at a window
He nods to slowly raises the gun and fires at another window
It shatters and they can't keep from laughing
The returns the gun as does
(continuing) Much obliged
He extends his hand
shakes it
Otis Harrison
And this here's Davis
We worked this place

car is driving down it
It is the next day
is driving,  beside her
18
You just stay in the car and watch and be ready
(he is playing it cool, knowing she is scared
He thinks he's James Cagney) Okay now
(he hands her a gun from the glove compartment) You just be ready if  need you
's hands are tense on the wheel
Her face shows how nervous she is now that the time has come
Scared
No
They drive in silence
What are you thinkin' about
Nothin'
We are still in the car
pulls over and stops by the bank
is frozen in his seat
We can see that, for all his talk, he is scared, too
What are you waitin' for
That gets him
throws the door open and jumps, practically dives out the door
The camera follows his motion right inside the bank, tracking very fast
#1
Something is very screwy here
The bank is dark, the is half asleep over his books
approaches, thrusts the gun at him
19
(with a swagger) This is a stickup
Just take it easy and nothin' will happen to you
Gimme the money
(looking up with no fear, his voice calm and conversational) Heighdy
(nonplussed at this) Gimme the money
What money
There ain't no money here, mister
(totally befuddled at the turn of events) What do you mean there ain't no money
This here is a bank, ain't it
The camera pans around the bank
We see that it is empty, dusty and shuttered
This was a bank
We failed three weeks ago
(furious) What
What
In a rage, he goes behind the partition, grabs the teller and pushes him ahead with the gun
is fuming
He forces the teller out the front door
#1
--showing  in the car
She is terrified as she sees and the  coming at her
She doesn't understand what is happening
(shoving the teller forward) Tell her
Tell her
20
(acting like a man who has had his sleep interrupted by lunatics) As  was tellin' this gentleman, our bank failed last month and ain't no money in it
sure am sorry
's reaction is one of hysterical relief and appreciation of what's funny in the situation
She laughs uproariously, she can't stop laughing
This makes madder than ever
He shoves the teller to the ground
Completely humiliated,  gets in the car, shoving over
She is still laughing
starts the car points his gun out the window
Close shot
Bank window--whereon is lettered: -$70,000
Angle to include bank window
aims and puts a bullet through each of the zeros
We see each zero shot through
Then the entire window hangs there for a second and suddenly crashes
On the soundtrack, 's laughter
: --still driving
has still not fully recovered from her mirth, but is quieting down because she sees that is really mad and can't be pushed too far
(steaming) We got $1
98 and you're laughin'
She tries to stop
The car pulls down another street of shops in another little hick town
grocery store ahead
Keep it running
21
There is an old  behind the counter, and standing in the b
g
, almost out of our vision, is a --an enormous giant of a man
steps up to the counter
Give me a loaf of bread, a dozen eggs and a quart of milk
The  gets the order and puts it in a bag
He rings open the cash register preparatory to asking  for the money
pulls his gun
This is a stickup
'll take all the money in that drawer now
He reaches over the counter into the cash drawer and grabs the bills
He smiles
Suddenly looming beside  is the , brandishing a meat cleaver
Camera looks up at this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down, missing  and sticking in the wooden counter
He grabs around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him off the ground
The struggle is in silence
is terrified, fighting wildly to get free
The gun in 's hand is pinned, because the man has 's arm pinned to his thigh
tries to raise the barrel at an upward angle to shoot, finally he is able to do so
He fires
The bullet enters the 's stomach
The  screams, but reacts like a wounded animal, more furious than ever
He still holds  in a fierce hug, staggering around the store, knocking into shelves and spilling cans
is hysterical with fear
He shoots the  again
The falls to his knees, but still he doesn't release In a panic,  drags the man to the door, trying to get out
sees  and the  holding his legs
She is terrified
drags him out on the street
The won't let go
, in real panic, aims the gun at his head and fires
Click
Out of bullets
In blind fury, he pistol-whips the 's head with two terrific swipes
Finally the  lets go
Hysterical,  jumps away and leaps into the car on the other side
still at the wheel
Get the hell out of here
They drive-off at top speed
22
is shaken
He speaks haltingly, panting; trying to get control of himself
Damn him, that big son of a bitch
He tried to kill me
ain't got eyes in back of my head
didn't want to hurt him
It wasn't a real robbery
Some food and a little bit of dough
'm not against him
Damn
The car is speeding down an open road
Suddenly it begins to buck and cough
There is something wrong with the motor
His cherubic cheeks are puffed up as he blows into the fuel lines of 's car
There is a distinctly flat sound
Reaction:  and
stands by the hood
remains seated in the car
is covered with sweat and grease--clearly he has gotten in his licks on the engine without success
Neither he nor  seems impressed by the noise
is making
Another angle
--as he screws back the fuel line and moves between  and  to the ignition, turning the engine over
It purrs beautifully
is astonished
What was wrong, anyway
(moving back to screw on gas cap) Air bubble--clogged the fuel line
now stands between  and
(continuing) just blowed her away
still can't get over it
You just blowed it away
belches
He is embarrassed before
23
'Scuse me, ma'm
Anythin' else can do for you
nods vigorously, looking across
's back to
gets the message
Well
'm not sure
(she looks around) Say, them little red things there stickin' up
Are they gas pumps
(he's not too bright) Sure
Isn't that interesting
How does that there gasoline get in my little old car
(trying to be helpful) Well, y'see, there's this tank underground, and the gas comes up this tube into the pump and into your car, 'am
My, you're a smart fellow
You sure know a lot about automobiles, don't you
(he has no idea he's being toyed with) Yeah,  do
Well, would you know what kind of a car this is
(touching it) Yeah, it's a Chevrolet 8-cylinder coupe
No, no
Sure it is
24
No, this is a stolen Chevrolet 8- cylinder coupe
jerks his hand off it as if he touched a hot stove
(getting in the conversation) You ain't scared, are you
(to Bonnie) believe he is
What a pity
We sure coulda used a smart boy who knows such a great deal about automobiles
(suddenly business- like, to
) You a good driver, boy
(getting quite confused) guess so
(pretending to cool on him) No,  don't think so
He's better off here
What's your name, boy
Moss
What's the
for
(reluctantly) Clarence Wallace
'm Miss Bonnie Parker and this is Mr
Clyde Barrow
We
rob
banks
(
reacts with wide eyes) (swiftly, testing his mettle) Ain't nothing wrong with that, is there, boy
25
(nervously) Uh, nope-- (with a put-on sigh) No, he ain't the one
Unless, Boy, you think you got enough guts for our line of work
(affronted in his dumb way) What do you mean
served a year in the reform school
Oh, a man with a record
(laughs) Now look here,  know you got the nerve to short-change old ladies who come in for gas, but what 'm askin' you is have you got what it takes to pull bank jobs with us
Mr
Moss
(anxious to prove himself) Sure,  could
Sure  could ain't scared, if that's what you think
Prove it
walks away from the car
Camera remains where it was
We see him walk inside the gas station office, open the cash drawer, close it and come out
He emerges with a fistful of money
He walks over to 's window, sticks his hand inside and drops the money on her lap
We see the bills flutter down
Not a word is spoken
moves over into the middle
opens the door and gets in behind the wheel
For a moment we see them all sitting there, each smiling their little smile
starts to hum a hillbilly tune quietly
The sound track picks it up (banjo and violin, etc
) and as the music swells, they drive off down the road
26
small room with a bed
On it, covered by a sheet which humps like a mountain over his enormous stomach, is the His head is propped up on a pillow and he sips a liquid through a bent glass straw
Camera is on the left side of the head of the bed, seeing the  in a three- quarter profile
On the opposite side of the bed stands a uniformed patrolman who is in the act of flashing mug-shot photos for the  to identify his assailant
The lawman holds a stack of them in front of them, swiftly changing the cards like a grade-school teacher with her flash cards
At each picture, the  grunts negatively and goes on sipping from his glass straw
One picture, two, three go by
The fourth picture is a mug shot of
Again the  grunts 'no,' without hesitation
As the next picture comes into view, we : --on a painted wooden sign, lit by one attached light, which reads: " "

Camera is close on
She is awake and restless
comes the measured snoring that we will think comes from
raises up and kneels over Clyde
She needs him
Clyde seems to snore on
Camera drops between them and we see that the snoring actually comes from
drops back on her pillow
We cut close on
He is awake
,  and
seated in a booth in a cafe
The Waitress brings the food and serves everybody
We see
With great concentration, as he does everything by relating to the immediate action he happens to be involved with, he takes the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling sugar over all his food
He sugars the meat, the beans, and the beets
and  watch this performance with first, amazement and second, disgust
They can't believe what they see
(incredulously) , what are you doing
Why do you do that
27
(beginning to eat it) Why not
It's just disgusting, that's why
(chewing) Not to me it ain't
But
but it makes everything sweet
Yeah,  know
With a resigned expression,  turns away and begins to eat
Suddenly a look of consternation crosses
's face
Damn
No mayonnaise
He gets up and goes down to the counter on the other end of the restaurant, out of our vision, apparently planning to put mayonnaise over the sugar
The minute he is out of earshot,  gets 's attention
Clyde, why does he have to stay in the same room as us
seems not to have heard the question
He takes up the sugar shaker and spreads a thin field of sugar on the dark table surface
He will sketch his plan in the sugar
Lemme show you about tomorrow
Why
Now
'll be waitin' right outside in the car
Here is the teller's cage
Four of them and over here the desks and what have you
Why, Clyde
Hmmm
28
In the same room with us
Hell, where else
Ain't gonna spread out all over the state
The harshness of his tone concerns him and he recovers with a smile
(continuing) Not yet, anyway
Now, the door to the bank is here now
You cover me from there
(takes his hand to her face) Just that  love you so much
You're the best damn girl in Texas
comes back with the mayonnaise; looks at the table
Hey, you spilled the sugar
Three shot
(eating) The layout for tomorrow up in Mineola
Mineola
Gosh, that's four, five hundred miles from here
So what
We take
85 to Willis Point, don't you know, and cut over on State Highway 28 at Kaufman, keep on goin' till we hit the farm- to-market road that connects to 105 and that's right up by Mineola
On a Saturday afternoon
The car driving into a small Kansas town
It is Saturday afternoon, sunny
The streets are filled with people, cars, wagons
29
is driving,  is in front with him,  is in the back
looks scared to death at the idea of robbing a bank
The car pulls up in front of the bank, double-parked
and  get out
Keep it running
and  enter bank
#2
Cut to the interior of the bank
and  come in, assume the class positions--she at the door where she can cover the bank,  at the first teller's cage
(in a very quiet voice) This is a stickup
What
This is a stickup
This time everyone in the bank hears it
The people gasp and pull back
slowly edges toward the door and prods forward
She carries a paper sack
motions her to go from cage to cage and get all of the money
begins doing so, while  keeps his gun trained on everybody
We see  get the money from the first teller, the second teller, then
car parked in a tight spot has just pulled out
Close-up
Day--who suddenly looks delighted to see a parking space
-
Immediately he methodically begins to back in
It's a tight spot and he has to cut the wheel, pull forward, cut some more, pull back and so on
The scene, for the audience, should be nervous and funny
: 30
#2
Inside the bank,  and  have filled the sack
They run out the door, the camera tracks with them
They run for where the car was, but it isn't there
Then they see
has parked it
Let's go
Let's go
suddenly realizes what a stupid thing he's done
tries to shoot out of the parking spot, but he can't
He has to go through the business of backing up, cutting the wheel and all of it
The scene is one of pure pandemonium and chaos
Come on
Get it out
policeman arrives and begins firing at car
gets the car halfway out of the spot, scraping fenders in the process, and the car is almost out when suddenly a face looms up at the window--a dignified, white-haired, celluloid-collared man, obviously a bank official who has leaped onto the running board
His screaming can barely by distinguished from all the noise
Stop
fires through the window
Close-up (special effects)
The face of the man explodes in blood
Then he drops out of sight
The car shoots off down the road, doing ninety
Police are firing at the escaping car;  and  are shooting out the back window;
is almost having a nervous breakdown at the wheel
31
police car that had been chasing  and 's car comes down the street
It is obvious that the cops have lost them
They are searching the street for a sign of 's car
They pass a movie house whose marquee reads: "  1933
"  They slow for a moment, decide that is not a probable place to look
They drive off
The opening musical sequence of "Golddiggers" is on the screen
Ginger Rogers sings "We're In The Money
"  Among the audience we cannot make out our three people
It is a small audience and thinly dispersed
Tight shot at audience
Camera pans the audience while on the track we hear the music of the song
First of our group who becomes visible is
He is staring at the screen and eating bites from a candy bar in each hand
Camera pans further and we see that  is in the row behind
and a few seats to one side
is nervous and keeps watching the entrance doors
He is in a rage
He shifts in his seat
Boy, you gotta be poor in the head
You
Count of you  killed a man
Murder
you too
Shot from behind
Shooting toward screen
(continuing) Dumb ass stupid
turns to  and nods agreement
This infuriates even more
He slaps the back of
's head
Ever do a dumb thing like that again, 'll kill you boy
Angle at
She has been watching the movie; is now disturbed by the noise
She turns back to  from her seat on the aisle
Ssshh
If you boys want to talk why don't you go outside
She smiles at her joke and turns back to the screen to the movie which she is obviously enjoying enormously
32
-
On the right of the screen, f
g
,  stands at the sink fixing her make-up in the mirror
The make-up has become more conservative
On the left, further back, is a bathtub and in it sits
His head and knees peek over the gray, soapy water
He is engaged with his usual single-minded concentration, in washing himself, carefully scrubbing his arms, not a thought in his head
finishes her make- up and regards herself quizzically, tilting her head to look at herself at different angles
She is smoking a cigarette, and really, studying herself
What do you think of me,
Uh
well, you're just fine, guess
Uh, well, course you're a real good shot
and
uh
well, sometimes you look pretty as a painting
Camera stays with  during all this, watching her look at herself as she listens to
's evaluation
She has a narcissistic concern at the moment and as she hears him enumerate her values, she thinks about each in turn and decides yes, that's true
Hey, uh, Bonnie
could you get me that washrag there
Responding automatically,  turns and walks to a towel rack, pulls the washcloth off and starts toward
when suddenly she stops with a smile on her face and a sudden motion
Teasingly, she holds the washcloth out at arm's length
(coyly) Why'nt you come get it
(not even realizing what's on her mind) Huh
(wiggling the washcloth like a bull-fighter's cape) Whyn't you come get it,
33
Suddenly
looks mortally embarrassed as he realizes what that would entail
Aw, Bonnie, come on, gimme it
tries another tack
She begins sauntering over slowly, teasingly, still holding out the treasured washcloth
(pertly) All right, 'll bring it myself
As she moves closer to the tub,
realizes that she will be able to peer down into the tub and see him and he frantically reaches up with one hand and yanks the washcloth into the tub, causing a great splash
, somewhat the victim of the splash, jumps back and away
Recovering her composure, she looks at
who is slunk down in the tub like a gross September Morn
She has tried him and he has failed; she realizes now that he was no choice for her; no real man, even if he might perform sexually
He is a lump
This irritates her; his very presence is demeaning to herself and
(irritated with herself for even thinking of such a thing) You simpleton, what would you do if we just pulled out some night while you was asleep
(trying to give the right answer, but obviously faking it) Oh,  wouldn't know what to do
But you wouldn't do that
You couldn't now
realizes, with some weariness, the inevitable truth of what he's said; thus resigned, she says patronizingly: That's right,
We'll always be around to take care of you
Pointedly, she throws her cigarette in his bath-water, "Sssssssssss
"  She turns and leaves the bathroom, slamming the door behind her
34
Camera goes with her into the connecting bedroom
is sitting on the edge of the bed cleaning the guns and oiling them
He is quiet and preoccupied and takes no note of 's present condition
The moment she enters, he looks up
(quietly) Bonnie,  want to talk to you
Sit down
sits, a little taken off balance by his serious manner
But she listens quietly
(continuing) This afternoon we killed a man and we were seen
Now nobody knows who you are yet, but they're going to be after me and anybody who's runnin' with me
Now that's murder now and it's gonna get rough
( nods continues speaking carefully and gently
) Look,  can't get out, but right now you still can
You say the word and 'll put you on the bus to go back to your Mother
'Cause you mean a lot to me, honey, and ain't going to make you run with me
So if you want, you say the word
, moved by his offer, has tears in her eyes
(as he pauses) Why
We ain't gonna have a minute's peace
doesn't like him in this mood
She tries to josh him out of it
Oh, pshaw
(trying to make her see the seriousness of it) Bonnie, we could get killed
35
(death has no reality for her) Who'd wanna kill a sweet young thing like me
(amused in spite of himself) ain't no sweet young thing
Oh, Clyde,  can't picture you with a halo, and if you went to the other place you'd rob the Devil blind, so he'd kick you right back to me
Close-up
--touched deeply, realizes that this was a lovely thing to say to him
They kiss
They are near the bed on which are some guns that  has been cleaning
The kiss moves toward real love making
They are on the bed and push the guns aside
Some fall to the floor
breaks the embrace after it has reached a high pitch
He moves away from the bed toward the window
follows him and embraces him from the rear
They are miserable
frees him and returns to the bed
She falls on it face down
gun presses into her face
sits in the window, the light silhouettes him
He turns his face toward the glass and rests his head on the window pane
turns to him from bed
She smiles a comforting smile at him
She rolls over onto her back
The gun is now under her head and moves it
She sits up and gestures to
He remains at the window
She stares at him
She looks toward the bathroom
She looks back at She is moved and pained for him
She touches her cheek with the gun and waits for him to be able to look at her
Finally he does
Her look eases him and he almost smiles
'
Shot of little fuzzy doll tied by a white shoestring to the rear-view mirror of a car
The car is moving; the doll is bouncing up and down
In the front seat are  and is a jovial, simple, big-hearted man
little chubby, given to raucous jokes, knee-slapping and broad reactions
He is, in many ways, the emotional opposite of his brother
It doesn't take much to make him happy
, his wife, is the direct opposite of
36
She is a housefrau, no more and no less, not terribly bright, not very ambitious, cuddly, simpering, madly in love with  and desirous of keeping their lives on the straight and narrow
As the scene begins we hear and then see , driving, singing "The Great Speckled Bird
"   is sitting next to him looking at a movie magazine, appearing fairly miserable
(singing) "What a beautiful thought  am thinking Concernin' that great speckled bird, Remember his name is recorded on the pages of God's Holy word
" All right, now you did foolish things as a young man, honey-love, but you went and paid your debt to society and that was right
But now you just gettin' back in with the criminal element
Criminal element
This is my brother, darlin'
Shoot, he ain't no more criminal than you are, Blanche
Well, that ain't what  heard
Now word of mouth just don't go, darlin', you gotta have the facts
Shoot
Why he and me growed up together, slept and worked side by side
(laughing) God, what a boy he was
He's a crook
(chidingly) Now you stop bad-mouthin' him, Blanche
We're just gonna have us a little family visit for a few weeks and then we'll go back to Dallas and 'll get me a job somewheres
() 37
(') just ain't gonna work in your Daddy's church--That's final
(laughing it off, singing) "What a beautiful thought  am thinking Concernin' that great speckled bird
" : 's car drives up to the cabin, honking the horn wildly
The door of the cabin opens and  comes running out
He is overjoyed to see his brother
jumps out of the car, equally delighted
They hug each other
(hugging him) Buck
Clyde
You son of a bitch
They laugh happily and begin sparring with each other, faking punches and blocking punches--an old childhood ritual
There is a great feeling of warmth between the two brothers
is more outgoing than we have ever seen him before
How's ma
How's sister
Just fine, just fine
Send their best to you
(patting Buck's stomach) Hey, you're fillin' out there
Must be that prison food
Hell no
(laughing) It's married life
You know what they say, it's the face powder that gets a man interested, but it's the baking powder that keeps him at home
() 38
(') (he explodes with laughter and so does Clyde, who loves Buck's jokes) Hey
you gotta meet my wife
Hey, honey, c'mon out here now and meet my baby brother
Camera swings to car
We see  still sitting there, her face obscured by the glint of sun on the windshield
Slowly, she gets out of the car, still carrying the movie magazine
(suspiciously, quite the grand lady) Howdy-do
(shaking her hand) Howdy-do
It's real nice to know you
beams with pleasure, thinking they must like each other
comes out of the cabin, standing on the steps
The screen door slams behind her
Close-up
Day--expressionless, looking it all over
and  notice nothing of this
bounds over to , all jollity
(grabbing her) Well
You must be Bonnie
Now hear you been takin' good care of the baby in the family
Well sis, 'm real glad to meet you
(he hugs her; just lets herself be hugged) Say
(breaking the hug) 'd like you to meet my wife, Blanche
(stiffly) Hello
39
(stiffly) Hello
There is an awkward pause
Suddenly the screen door opens and
comes out, dressed in his long underwear can hardly stand it
Everybody, this is
Moss
, my brother Buck and his wife, Blanche
(friendly) Heighdy, y'all
He pumps 's hand vigorously and then goes to
With his characteristic one-track intensity, he decides to act just as friendly as he can with , ignoring the fact that he's standing there in his underwear
, however, is not ignoring it
Well how do, Mrs
Barrow
Or can call you Blanch
sure am pleased to meet you
(shaking her hand; Blanche is slowly going crazy with mortification) Did you have a hard time findin' us here in this neck of the woods
Well, you sure picked a good day for it
Say, you got a Screenland there
Any new photos of Myrna Loy
She's my favorite picture star
is starting to edge over to  in sheer panic at this strange, young man in his 's but
takes no notice of it
finally grabs 's arm
watches it all, smirking
Hey, lemme get the Kodak
goes to his car and gets a folding Brownie camera
(lighting up a cigar) Hey,
, go put your pants on
We're gonna take some pictures
40
'all hear about the guy who thought Western Union was a cowboy's underwear
and  and
laugh heartily
goes into the cabin
pushes  and  together, posing them for a picture
Lemme get one of my bride and my brother
(getting kittenish, and overdoing it) Buck
Don't take my picture now
'm just a mess from driving all day
Oh honey, now you look real fine
watches 's behavior with hardly-veiled disgust
snaps the picture as  is just about to move out of it
(with unbecoming girlish outrage) Did you take my picture
Oh Buck
declare-- laughs and goes to , takes her by the arm and moves her next to  and
He lines them up, steps back and takes their picture
is the only one smiling
(pulling out his gun and posing like a movie tough) Hey, Buck, get one of this
does
(giving Clyde the camera) Clyde, you do one of me and my missus
He puts his arm around
takes the picture
41
(throwing her a challenge) Let me take on of Bonnie
grins at him and responds with amused arrogance
(she yanks the cigar from Clyde's mouth, smokes it and poses) Okay
snaps the picture
Everyone but  laughs
comes out dressed
(drawing Clyde aside) Hey, brother, let's you and me do a little talkin'
(handing
the camera) Here,
, take the girls' picture
They walk into the cabin
Camera goes with them
Bedroom is dark, shades pulled down
There is an aura of boys' clubhouse secret camaraderie in the following scene: (as soon as the door is shut; conspiratorially) It was you or him, wasn't it
Huh
That guy you killed
You had to, didn't ya
(they are protecting each other) Yeah, he put me in a spot, so  had to
He didn't have a Chinaman's chance
But you had to-- Yeah
had to
42
(like two kids keeping a secret from Mom) Don't say nothin' to Blanche about it
Hey, that time you broke out of jail, she talk you into goin' back
(it is obvious he had hoped Clyde hadn't known about it) Yeah, you hear about that
won't say nothin' to Bonnie about it
appreciate it
Yeah
say, what d'ya think of Bonnie
She's a real peach
There is now a long pause--a lull in the conversation, as if they asked each other all the questions and are now out of things to say
It is too much for , the natural enemy of silence, who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts out animatedly: Boy, are we gonna have us a good time
(matching his merriment) We surely are
Yessir
(a pause, then:) What are we gonna do
Well, how's this-- thought we'd all go to Missouri
They ain't lookin' for me there
We'll hole up someplace and have us a regular vacation
All right
43
No trouble, now
No trouble
ain't lookin' to go back to prison
Hey, what's this  hear about you cuttin' up your toes, boy
(ironically) That ain't but half of it
did it so  could get off work detail-- breakin' those damned rocks with a hammer day and night
Sure enough, next week  got paroled
walked out of that god-forsaken jail on crutches
Shoot-- Ain't life grand
We see the two cars, one behind the other, driving down a main road
is driving
sits next to him
No one else is in the car
And the doc, he takes him aside, says, "Son, your old mama just gettin' weak and sickly layin' there
want you to persuade her to take a little Brandy, y'know, to pick her spirits up
" "Why, doc," he says, "you know my mamma is a teetotaler
She wouldn't touch a drop
" "Well,  tell you what," the doc says, "why don't you bring her a fresh quart of milk every day from your farm, 'cept you fix it up so half of it's Brandy and don't let on
" So he does that, doctors it up with Brandy, and his mamma drinks some of it
() 44
(') And the next day he brings it again and she drinks some more--and she keeps it up every day
Finally, one week later, he brings her the milk and don't you know she just shallows it all down, and looks at her bag and says, "Son, whatever you do, don't sell that cow
" and  explode in laughter
At the top of the laugh, cut to the int
of the second car, riding right in back of them
The atmosphere is completely unlike the cozy and jolly scene preceding
We have dead silence
is driving, smoking a cigarette, grim
--seated as far away as she can get from without falling out of the car--makes a face at the cigarette smoke, rolls down the window for air
's in the back seat, just staring
: residential street in Joplin, Missouri, showing a garage apartment above a double garage
Camera sees  talking to a dapper gent with keys in his hand
pays him
The man tips his hat and walks off
gestures and Clyde drives a car into the driveway
follows, driving 's car with
stops beside leans into 's car and says: give him a month's rent in advance
We're all set
Let's get inside
calls back to
in the following car
Pull up and unload the stuff
(on the running board of moving car) Honey-love, 'm taking you into our first home
giggles
The two cars pull up before the garage and the people start to descend
45
winded  enters and puts down
As others behind him carry in their things and disperse throughout apartment
Oh look, it's so clean, Buck
And a Frigidaire
not an icebox
He give me the grocery number
He goes to the phone
(continuing) Lemme see, eh 4337
Operator
please ma'm, may  have 4337
if you please
Oh
they got linoleum on the counter
Ain't that clever
Hello, Smitty's grocery
'd like to order a mess of groceries
Oh yeah
eh 143 Hillsdale Street
Lessee, about 8 pounds of porkchops, 4 pounds of red beans
a can of Chase and Sandborn
uh
Oh, isn't this something, Daddy
Sshh
Uh
quart of milk
uh 8 bottles of Dr
Pepper and that's it,  guess
No
no
Uh
a box of Rice Krispies
Bye now
: Open on  and
He is cleaning guns
She is watching something off screen
We hear a clicking sound
(
) My, you need a haircut, Daddy
You look like a hillbilly boy
46
look of disgust crosses 's face
, who has been watching her, smiles
The clicking sound increases suddenly
(
) Gotcha
whoops
Camera cuts to see that  and
are playing checkers and  has just beaten him
Again
Boy, you ain't never gonna beat me but you keep tryin' now
He starts to set up the game again
Jest like an ol' man
Plays checkers all the time and doesn't pay any attention to his poor lonely wife
She ruffles his hair again
Cut it out now, honey
'm gonna teach this boy a lesson he'll never forget
Camera cuts to , watching with disgust
Then slowly, a wicked little smile edges across her face
She watches for a moment more, then she rises and with the most ingenuous look she can muster up, beckons to  to follow her into the bedroom
little puzzled,  follows
closes the door and immediately begins fussing with 's hair, doing a scathing imitation of
Though her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with the Barrow menage, it is also a peach doing an imitation of a lemon--and it is disarmingly sensual
Indeed the mimicry allows  to be physically freer with , and allows to respond without anxiety, without self-consciousness
We should have the distinct--if momentary--feeling that could suddenly make it with
47
(doing an unmerciful imitation) Oh, Daddy, you shore need a haircut
You look just like a little old hillbilly boy,  do declare
(she has her other hand toying with the buttons on his shirt, her hand slipping under, fluttering across his bare chest) Oh mercy me, oh my stars
laughs, and  tugs at the shirt--she kneels on the bed over , who quite easily drapes across it
(a little louder) Oh, Daddy
Yore such a slowpoke
She's letting her hair fall loose, its golden ends brushing up and down 's body
(amused, but cautionary) Hush up a little
They're in the next room
(a mock-pout, but with an edge to it) Shoot, there's always somebody in this room, the next room and ever' other kind of room
has his arm around , and she's almost draped across him--but in the direction of the length of the bed, so their bodies almost form a crooked cross
She digs an elbow into his stomach
Oof
now that ain't no nice way to talk about my brother
(imitating Blanche again with baby talk) ain't talking about your brother
Suddenly  straightens up to a kneeling position again, and cocks her head
When she speaks now it is with a simple plaintiveness
48
Honey, do you ever just want to be alone with Me
(sensing Clyde's sensitivity to the sexual implication) don't just mean like that mean do you ever have the notion of us bein' out together and alone, like at some fancy ball, or, don't know, where we walk in all dressed and they announce us and it's fancy and in public, but we're alone somehow
We're separate from everybody else, and they know it
looks up to , affectionately
He runs his hand carelessly down her body
always feel like we're separate from everybody else
(it's terribly important to her) Do you, baby
Suddenly there is a ring at the door
and freeze
and  run out into the living room, camera going with them
(to all) Quiet
'll get it
goes down the stairs and reaches the front door
Who is it
Groceries, 'am
She opens the door
young man is there with the two big sacks of groceries
49
How much
Six dollars and forty-three cents
pays him and goes to take the bags from him
Here, 'am, them bags is heavy
Let me carry 'em up for you
(curtly) No thanks, 'll take 'em
She takes the heavy bags and hefts them up and turns and walks up the stairs
They are obviously very heavy for her
Closeup the delivery boy's face, looking puzzled at this behavior
reaches the top steps, and voices are heard
' What was it
' Quiet
Open the door
'mon, c'mon
Close-up
The
look of suspicion comes across his face
: Close-up of --seated in the living room
(reading from a pad; in a recital voice) It's called "The Ballad of Suicide Sal
" (she pauses for effect; then begins:) "We each of us have a good alibi For being down here in the 'joint'; But few of them really are justified If you get right down to the point
You've heard of a woman's glory Being spent on a downright cur'
" 50
'  (
) You write that all by yourself
You want to hear this or not
As she reads, the camera pans around the room picking out everyone's reaction
is looking and listening seriously
is grinning
is blank
is in the kitchen cooking
"Still you can't always judge the story As true, being told by her
Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty, Though her features were coarse and tough--" Yeah,  knew her
She was cockeyed and had a hare-lip and no teeth
flashes him a look that could kill
He shuts up fast
She continues: "Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty, Though her features were coarse and tough; She never once faltered from duty To play on the 'up and up'
" Still listening,  gets up from his chair and walks slowly past the living room windows
The camera angled slightly above him, sees down the street
We see two police cars quietly pulling up
One of them parks sideways in the driveway to block escape from the garage, the other stays on the street
turns and looks out the window
(o
s
as we see out the window) "Sal told me this tale on the evening Before she was turned out free, And 'll do my best to relate it Just as she told it to me--" (seeing it) It's the law
51
As soon as  calls out,  drops the frying pan on the floor and begins screaming
Camera cuts back to the living room
Everyone else leaps into action
Guns begin blazing from everywhere; we rarely see who is shooting at whom
The police, down the stairs into the garage--we follow them with a hand-held camera tracking rapidly
, however, in utter panic, just runs right out the front door, and begins running down the quiet residential street, going nowhere, anywhere
, crouching, shooting with one hand, gets the garage door open
policeman fires
fires back and the cop falls dead in the street
, firing, dashes to the police car blocking their escape and releases the hand brake
,  and
leap into their car, gun the motor, still shooting madly
Two more police fall dead or wounded
One policeman is hurled through a fence by the blast of a sawed-off shotgun
jumps into the car with the others
They now begin to bump the police car with their car
The police car picks up speed as they push it and it tears into the street right at the group of firing police
The gang's car turns into the street toward the running
and  are in front;  and
in the back seat firing back at police
The car pulls alongside the wildly running ; the back door is flung open and in almost the style of a cartoon, two hands reach out and lift her off her feet and pull her into the car
They speed away
: The inside of the car, still speeding
is hysterical
is still firing out the window
The pursuing police car's driver is shot and the car crashes into a tree
The gang is not being pursued now, but  is driving at 90
is moaning and crying
, in front, turns around furiously
Dammit, you almost got us killed
52
(crying) What did  do wrong
s'pose you'd be happier if  got shot
(at her bitchiest) Yeah, it would of saved us all a lot of trouble
Buck, don't let that woman talk to me like that
(caught in the middle of a bad situation, knowing Blanche is wrong, but trying to soothe her) You shouldn't have done it, Blanche
(quietly, cont
) It was a dumb thing to do
(switching tactics) Please, Buck,  didn't marry you to see you shot up
Please, let's go
Let's get out of here and leave
Make him stop the car and let us out
(still quietly) Can't
killed a man
We're in this now
(loud and shrill) Please
Please
(exploding) Shut up
Just shut up your big mouth
At least do that, will ya, just shut up
Cut it out, Bonnie
is affronted
continues sobbing
(curtly) Stop the car
want to talk to you
53
Without a word,  stops the car
and  get out and walk fifteen feet away from the car
Both are irritated and touchy
Camera follows them
(coldly) What is it
Get rid of her
Can't do that
She's Buck's wife
(snapping her words) Get rid of both of them then
Why
What's the matter with you anyway
She's what's the matter with me, a damn stupid back country hick without a brain in her head
(contemptuously) She ain't nothin' but prunes and proverbs
(really pissed-off at Bonnie) What makes you any better
What makes you so damn special
You're just a West Dallas waitress who spent half your time pickin' up truck drivers
This hits home with
He has said the unforgivable
(raising her voice) You talk to me like that
Big Clyde Barrow, just the same as your brother, an ignorant uneducated hillbilly
(with deadly archness) Only special thing about you is your peculiar ideas about lovemakin'--which is no love makin' at all

stiffens
The two of them stand silent and tense, almost quivering with anger
They have stripped each other raw
turns and looks back at the car
Everyone is waiting, watching them
He breathes a deep sigh, like a man counting to 10 to hold his temper
Look, Bonnie-- He can't finish
Close
She drops her head into her hand for a moment, comes up a little more relaxed
She looks at and her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has inflicted on him
She softens
Clyde
honey
didn't mean all that, honey
Blame it on all that shootin',  just felt so bad
sure enough
Clyde
Okay
Okay, hon
let's get movin'
He turns and begins walking back to the car
walks alongside him
On the few steps back, she regains all her dignity and acts aloof from the others waiting for her
She reaches the car
opens her door for her and she gets in like a great lady
He walks around to his side, gets in, and they drive off
very wide shot
We see 's car driving along a wooded road
For a moment that is all we see, then we should become aware that far in the distance another car is following 's
Close
Rural mail box
On the opposite side of the road, 's car swings across the road and , who is driving, snatches a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands it into the car
They drive out of the shot
Camera holds and soon the following car enters the shot
The man driving is a Texas ranger
He drives slowly
He drives out of the shot

55
(jubilantly) Hey, y'all, listen to this here: Law enforcement officers throughout the Southwest are frankly amazed at the way in which will-of-the-wisp bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow- haired companion, Bonnie Parker, continue to elude their would-be captors
Since engaging the police in a gun battle on the streets of Joplin Missouri and slaying three of their number
Oh, Lord
We notice  is wincing
the Barrow gang has been reported as far West as White City, New Mexico, and as far north as Chicago
They have been credited with robbing the Mesquite Bank in the aforementioned White City, the
Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas, the Sanger City National Bank in Denton, Texas on three different occasions
In addition to these robberies, the fast travelling Barrows have been rumored to have had a hand in the robbing of two Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and one & store in Missouri, though Chief Percy Hammond, who first identified Clyde Barrow's brother, Buck, as a member of the gang, expressed some doubt that these last robberies were committed by the Barrow Gang alone
Go on
(finally) Clyde, we ain't goin' to see a restroom for another thirty miles
Why don't you just stop here
looks relieved
56
He pulls the car to a stop, gets out and goes off into the woods
We watch him vanish behind the trees
still scanning the newspaper
(with a laugh) Hey now, here's something
Listen here: Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers In Hunt For Barrow
Police Officer Howard Anderson's heart turned faster than his motorcycle when he forced to the side of the road a roaring black -8 sedan in which were three men and a blondheaded woman yesterday afternoon
Everybody laughs
As  continues to read, his voice remaining on the soundtrack
The camera goes outside the car and pulls back, way back, to reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car
The car stops a good distance away and one man gets out, the only occupant of the car
He is tall, dressed in the uniform of the Texas Ranger
He draws his gun and slowly approaches the car from the rear
On the soundtrack 's voice continues; as we see all this taking place
When he saw several machine guns in the car he was certain he'd caught Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and maybe Buck Barrow and the third unidentified member of the gang
It took a lot of telephoning and explaining to convince the motorcycle cop that his captives were two highway patrolmen and a blonde-haired stenographer from the Highway Patrol--
Haw
Haw
(everybody busts up with laughter) In the meantime, on screen, the lawman is slowly approaching the back of the car
Suddenly, cut to shot of  coming out of the woods, behind the lawman
His gun is tucked in his pants
In a second, he sees what is happening
57
's voice is continuing: Anderson was held up as an example for every other Texas peace officer today
"That was a mighty brave thing," explained Highway Patrol Chief
Winston
whips out his gun
The following scene is played exactly like a classic fast-draw in an heroic Western
Sheriff
spins around
Both men fire instanteously, but has the draw on him, and the aim
The gun goes flying from the 's hand
really razzle-dazzle display of grandstand marksmanship from Clyde
Immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the man, guns drawn
Boy
What a shot, Clyde
Sweet Jesus,  never seen shootin' like that
The gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt
makes him lean on the car's hood, arms extended, legs spread, while he frisks him
In general, everyone is excited over the capture
takes the sheriff's gun and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an object d'art
(examining the man's wallet, really surprised) Well, now, getta load of this want y'all to know we are in the custody of Cap'n Frank Bryce, and Frank here is a Texas Ranger

angle across hood--so 's face, not visible to or anyone else behind him, is in foreground
His gnarled, powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood, as tho they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper
His eyes stare toward camera relentlessly, unblinking, but without passion
They are shark's eyes
They have witnessed much carnage, devoured it, and are still wide open for more
58
Sure 'nough, Clyde
Say there, peacemaker
believe you got your spurs all tangled up
You're in Missouri, you know that
has been going thru the man's  credentials
Not so pleasantly: You didn't know you was in Missouri
He's lost, this here Texas Ranger
claps 's hands behind his back, handcuffs him, spins him around
(a little pissed) --he ain't lost
them banks are offerin' extra reward money fer us, and Frank figured on easy pickin's, didn't you
(he suddenly knocks Bryce's hat off) Didn't you
flinches involuntarily
suddenly grows wary at 's mood
leans into , looking up
--Now you ain't hardly doin' your job, Texas Ranger
You oughta be home lookin' after the rights of poor folks, not out chasin' after us
He suddenly hefts 's huge bulk onto the fender
(trying to be casual) Easy there, Clyde
Why take is so personal
(to Bryce) Reg'lar laws is one thing
But this here bounty hunting, we got to discourage that
looks very uncomfortable
She starts to say something, but  intervenes
59
Like how, Clyde
-- tense moment
can't think of anything right away
(trying to be helpful) Shoot him
shoots
an angry glance--it's just what the gang doesn't want
(trying again) hang him
Reaction-- carefully gauging the moment to intervene
(suddenly) --uh-uh
Take his picture
's not sure he's heard right
Neither is
Take his picture
(pointedly ignoring , brightly) Then we'll let the newspapers have it--so's everyone can see Captain Frank Bryce of the Texas Rangers with the Barrow gang-- (moving demurely to Bryce) --and all bein' just as friendly as pie
(grasping possibilities immediately) yeah, yeah
(continuing right on, coyly picking up Bryce's gun from grill) --why we 'bout the friendliest folks in the world
Texas Ranger waves his big ol' gun at us, and we just welcome him like he's one of our own
60
(grinning widely) Buck, get the Kodak
(relieved and excited) Hot dog
(to Bryce) We're mighty proud to have a Texas Ranger in the family
is obviously not pleased with this turn of events
Following dialogue is overlapped, ad-libbed, etc
sense of mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to exact
New angle
is fiddling with the camera, setting up the shot with
's following speech should be heard, b
g
, to 's speech below it
keep him set on the hood, there
more to the sun, like that
yeah
when all his ranger friends see this
bet he's gonna wish he was dead
(to Bryce) see what come o' your mischief
not doin' your job
Down in Duncanville last year poor farmers kepts the laws away from us with shot guns
you're s'posed to be protectin' them from us, and they're protectin' us from you
(giggling) --don't make sense, do it
'mon, now, Clyde, you and Bonnie first
Move into him, right close, right friendly
All righty (to Bryce, whose hands are tied, hemmed in by them both) Don't move, now, hear
61
grandly puts an arm on 's shoulder, , looking up admiringly from the other side
takes the picture
immediately hops onto the hood, next to How's this
"Captain Bryce and new found friend
" She coyly loosens his tie, tousles his hair, and plants a big kiss on him while still ogling camera
yeah, yeah
quick, Buck, get it
'm gettin' it, 'm gettin' it
Quite suddenly , whose simmering intensity we should be more sensitive to than the gang is, spits on Bonnie half-screams in disgust, but  is on top of  in a flash, half-strangling on his own fury
He pulls  off the fender by the handcuffs, spinning him around crazily like a lasso
is literally ricocheted off the car by the force, and, with  hanging on by the cuffs, plummets down the embankment to the sandy beach below, both men falling, spinning
rises shakily
He tries to walk away
grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him out into the water
smacks into a tree stump poking out of the shallows and goes down
is on top of him
Meanwhile,  has rushed down into the water, tries to pull  off
(frantic) got the picture
got the picture
(oblivious) Lemme be, lemme be
reaches the surface and  tries to throw him into deeper water
He hitches  over a moldy skiff, knocking aside one of the oars
upends  into the skiff and kicks it spinning
picks up an oar and hurls it like a boomerang, ass over end at the skiff
It kicks up a spray
(holding tightly to Clyde, yelling) got the

Reaction
waist deep, breathing heavily
All right, all right
(to Bryce, yelling) , battered and handcuffed, stares back with mindless malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical spectre of , screaming his madness across the water
: Inside the bank
In contrast to the previous inept bank robbery scene, this one goes admirably well, the gang performing slickly and without a hitch
As they enter, dripping wet,  makes a general announcement to everyone to the bank
This is the Barrow gang
(the people turn and freeze) Everybody just take it easy and nobody will get hurt
covers the door
and  go to the tellers' cages and get money
goes inside, emptying out the cash drawers
Cut to  filling the sack
Cut to a close-up of a burglar alarm button
Slowly a hand crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the button
When the finger is about one inch away, suddenly a gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away
The camera pulls back to reveal  smiling at a lady teller
Don't do nothin' silly now
Cut to  standing near the door, training his guns on the entire bank
farmer stands a few feet away, some bills clutched in his hand
That your money or the bank's
Mine
Keep it, then
63
Across the floor, the bank guard in the corner takes advantage of 's distraction to go for his gun spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guard's hat off without harming him
(to the guard, who has practically frozen in fear) Next time 'll aim a little lower
They finish robbing the bank
They start to exit
Near the door stands a guard with his hands raised
He wears sun glasses of the period
As they leave  snatches the sun glasses from the guard's head
Get a good look at us
We're the Barrow boys
The gang runs wildly into the street where the car waits, motor running
As they leap into car,  throws the sun glasses into 's lap
Happy birthday
They zoom off
Shots are heard
,  and begin firing at the bank guards who are pursuing them
The guards fire back
Close-up

funny image, but one that also awakens pity
The next sequence is carried out in cross-cutting
: The street in front of the bank
Police car pulls up and the excited crowd gestures in the direction of the departed gang
The siren starts

at the wheel) Kick it in the pants,

We got to make that state line
(driving like a wild man, but adlibing loudly) Can't get more'n this out of a Plymouth
: The gang has left a legacy of celebrity behind
We see the bank guard whose hat was shot off being interviewed by a reporter
He is seated in a chair, his shirt open at the collar and a woman teller is fanning him
(enjoying the limelight) Then he saw me goin' for my gun
Clyde Barrow himself,  mean
And suddenly  was starin' into the face of death
Tsk, tsk
photographer steps in
Just look this way, Mr
Hawkins
The bank guard hurriedly buttons up his collar and smiles as the flashbulb goes off
: Still speeding along, the siren more distant
: The bank president and a policeman are posing for that classic picture where both stand flanking a bullet hole in the wall and point proudly at it
The flashbulb goes off

Car slows up perceptibly as  says: Okay, relax
We're in Oklahoma now
Slow down
: Turn around
Don't waste no more gas
(a young eager beaver type) Ain't we gone to catch 'em
66
Hell, they're over the State line
That's out of our jurisdiction
Why don't we get 'em anyway
ain't gone to risk my life in Oklahoma
That's their problem
: Now the gang's car is seen traveling down a long, narrow country road surrounded by cornfields
: They get out, taking the various bags of money with them, and dump the lot on the hood
There is not an impressive amount of money
(disappointed) Hell
That ain't much, is it
(commiseratingly) Times is hard, Well, let's get to it
He begins dealing and splitting the money out on the hood of the car, as they gather around
This is Clyde Barrow

(lays down a bill) Bonnie Parker
(goes back to the first again and lays out another round) Clyde, Buck
Bonnie
Clyde, Clyde again

She nudges  and whispers to him

Meanwhile, 's counting still goes on
Bonnie
Clyde
(very ill at east in this position he has been forced into) Um
eh
Clyde
Hah
is clearly embarrassed
Uh, Clyde
well
what about Blanche
Everyone reacts with stunned amazement at 's nerve in wanting to get her cut
(incredulous) sees she has to rise to her own defense, and she rises to the occasion with spirit and verve
Well, why not
Say  earned my share
Same as everybody coulda got killed same as everybody, and 'm wanted by the law same as everybody
Besides  coulda got snake bit sleepin' in them woods every night
(building it up) 'm just a nervous wreck and that's the truth
And  have to listen to sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all the time
deserve mine

Day--looking at , his face full of weak smiles and embarrassment at his wife
(with a sigh) Okay
okay
hold your horses, Blanche
You'll get your share

is livid but says nothing
, the leader has decided
looks indignant, like a hog who's just been given a bath
begins counting all over again in near silence
Married a preacher's daughter and she still thinks she's takin' the collection
Everyone now laughs, but
continues counting
(to Blanche) Well, don't spend it all in one place now, hear
She'll be doin' right well to spend it at all
turns and ambles away from the car
After a moment stops counting and moves after her
He's prepared for a fight, stands behind 's arched back trying to gauge the degree of hostility there
Bonnie
No answer
(a little defensive) Look, Bonnie, 've said it and guess 'll keep sayin' it before we're thru--Blanche is Buck's wife and Buck is family
He waits expectantly
(finally, utterly without malice) --she's such a silly-Billy
looks plaintively to
My family could use some of that money
69
Them laws have been hangin' round your mamas house 'til all hours, Bonnie
It's just too risky to go there
(exploding) Well, where can we go
We rob the damn banks, what else do we do
cannot really answer
Suddenly
starts yelling: flinches at the sound
comes bounding over, as rude an assault on their sensibilities as he can be
(wincing as they are nose to nose) hear you,
This ol' heap's gushin' oil
We got to swipe us another set of wheels right away, or we won't get anywhere
Look here
He reaches down under the pan of the car and scoops a gooey handful of slick black oil which he holds before their faces
See
nods slowly
He looks back to
He sees

They are spooning, making low, loving murmurs
Oh, now

Mmmm
sweet thing
We see in the distance two cars parked in front of the house
His and hers
Suddenly we see another car drive up ( and ) and somebody gets out
Then the whole gang gets out, ditches the one car and gets in one of the parked cars
All the while the couple on the porch is busy spooning
The car begins to roll slowly into the street
The  notices
Say, isn't that your car, Eugene
(still nuzzling her) Mmmmmm
huh
(he looks, leaps from the swing) That's my car
Hey
The  and  run down the front steps and front walk to the second car
They jump in and take off, giving chase
The  is driving (it's her car)
The  is furious
'll tear 'em apart
Those punks
Steal a man's car right out from under him
Wait till  get my hands on those kids, Velma, 'll show 'em
They continue driving, furious, the man cursing and muttering
We see through their windshield the other car way in the distance
What if they have guns, Eugene
(realizing the possibility, he suddenly stops being mad and turns chicken) We'd better get the police and let them handle this
Right
71
Turn around and let's get back to town
We'll go get the sheriff
They are by now on a narrow dirt road and the  has to execute a -turn
It takes her about seven cuts to turn the car around in the narrow space

Terrified, they roll up their windows, lock their doors and huddle together
72
The Barrow gang piles out of their car and walks over, having a merry time
They surround the car and press their faces against the window, flattening their features, making menacing gestures at the shaking pair inside
We see this from the point of view of the  and  inside the car
pulls out a gun, makes as if to shoot, but he is kidding
They all laugh uproariously, especially  who is delighted with 's prank
All of this we see in pantomime from inside the trapped car
'mon, get out
Get out of there, said
They come out, hands held high, shaking with fear
They have practically turned to jelly
(ordering them into the other car) Get in here
They get in and the gang gets in
Seven people are now jammed inside

next to her
In back, , then  with  (of necessity) sitting on his lap, and then
As will be seen, the reason the Barrows have kidnapped the couple is simply that they wanted company
Living as they do, seeing only each other day after day, they long for diversion and new faces
So the atmosphere in the car will shortly change to one of friendliness and jollity, and it will get progressively more so in the series of cuts which advance the time
As the car starts up at the beginning, however, the  and  are terrified
What's your name
(hesitantly) 'm Eugene Grizzard
'm Velma Davis
73
(just as friendly as he can be) Well, howdy
We're the Barrow gang
That there is Clyde drivin' and 'm Buck
The  and  almost faint from fear; clutch at each other
The gang all laugh at this
and  begin to realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the Barrows are friendly to them
Look, don't be scared, folks
It ain't like you was the law
You're just folks like us
(agreeing over-enthusiastically) Yeah, yeah, that's the truth
expect you been readin' about us
The  and the  answer simultaneously with what they think is the right thing to say under the circumstances
Yes
No
They glare at each other
(meaningfully) Yes, Velma, we have too
(laughing at the contretemps) Well, you two must be in love,  bet
and  blush, get shy for a second
smiles
(gleefully, clapping his hands) Well, when you gonna marry the girl, boy
Everyone chuckles heartily
: 74
--still driving, same positions, but some time has elapsed
The atmosphere is now completely convivial and the captives are enjoying their new friends
As the scene starts, is finishing his joke
So then she drinks her milk down again, every drop
And she looks over at her son and says, "Son, whatever you do, don't sell that cow
" The couple laughs with great amusement, but everyone else in the car doesn't laugh--this is the tenth time they've heard the joke
: --getting on toward evening
All are thoroughly relaxes and chatting
(to Velma) How old are you, honey
Thirty-three
sudden look of surprise registers on 's face
It is now night
Everyone inside the car is eating
Apparently they stopped somewhere along the way for food
In the crowded interior, it is like a party--food is being passed back and forth, laughter and gaiety, increasing warmth between the couple and the Barrows
The car has become a little society on wheels, dashing through the black night down the highway
Inside there is a small world of happiness and fun
is unpacking the food and passing sandwiches and drinks around the car
Now  ordered some French fries, didn't
75
(passing her some) Yeah, here you go
Take it easy on those French fries, Velma
Ain't that right, Eugene
(studying his hamburger) This isn't mine
ordered mine well done
Who's got the other hamburger
Close-up
who has already taken a bite of the other one
Oh, is this supposed to be yours
He extends the bitten burger out to
Full shot
That's okay, forget it
laughs at this
(chewing) Haw
sure am havin' a good time
How 'bout you folks
Ain't you glad we picked you up
(laughing) Hey, maybe y'all ought to join up with us
That idea strikes everyone as being very amusing
(laughing) Ha
Wouldn't they be surprised back home to hear that
Yeah
What would Martha and Bill say if they heard that
(she roars with laughter) () 76
(') Lordy
They'd throw a fit
(roars with laughter) (laughing) What do you do, anyway
(as his laugh begins to fade) 'm an undertaker
Suddenly everyone freezes
shudder, as if the cold hand of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car
The atmosphere changes to cold, deadly, fearful silence in exactly one second
It is a premonition of death for the Barrows, and they react accordingly,  especially
Close-up
(tautly, in a flat voice) Get them out of here
The car brakes to a sudden stop
The rear down is opened, the  and  flung out into the darkness
The car drives off into the lonely night
From this point on, the audience should realize that death is inevitable for the Barrow gang, that it follows them always, that it waits anywhere
It is no longer a question of whether death will come, but when it will
Moving with  he tears through the brush, snagging his clothes, calling 's name
's search is so desperate here that for a moment we might think he is fleeing from something rather than looking for something
In a moment he emerges onto the road

Hold on this angle until he catches up with it and leaps onto the running board

For the very first time we see CLYDe, the leader, helpless as he hangs onto the running board

He starts running off into a cornfield
Another angle--picking up  as he kicks his way into the cornfield, knees pumping high, knocking down the stalks
He stops and picks up the stocking he had spotted, takes it and moves on
Still another angle as  has picked up a freshly beaten trail through the cornfield
He picks up one of 's scarves, now
As he runs on, he clears a knoll and , her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance, comes into view
She's far off in the cornfield, stalking off, looking neither to right nor left, carrying a brown paper sack that has split, from which she has occasionally lost clothing
screams, "

Angle on cornfield

As  gets closer herself suddenly breaks into flight, the paper bag splitting completely, the remaining clothes spilling out

That's the law talking there

He knows he's stumbled onto the wrong thing, but he bounces right along--it's his style

Why one time  knowed of a job where we could of make $2000 easy, but  saw the law outside and  said to myself, why Bonnie could get hurt here
So just drove right on and let that money lay
He waits for a response, as does

Maybe you know the way with her, then

She trails off, looking nowhere in particular

We'll be quittin' this just as soon as the hard times is over, Mother Parker,  can tell you that
Why me and Bonnie were just talkin' the other day and we talked about when we'd settle down and get us a home, and Bonnie said, " couldn't bear to live morn'n three miles from my precious mother

Don't believe  would

Well, why don't you all go play with it somewhere else

What's bothering her

(who doesn't want to be victimized by Bonnie's temperament) What's bothering her, Clyde
(exploding) said go somewhere else
She picks up the first three objects she can find on the dresser and hurls them--an ashtray, a Gideon Bible, and a flower pot--at the little group
The pot goes shattering into the wall
Everyone ducks

Who all wants to go get some food

no,  really hate you
She turns away from him, wilts onto the bed

There is something very delicate about the way he touches her; it suggests 's sensitivity to her mood rather than any degree of physical intimacy
Bonnie

What mama
she's just an old woman now

She has addressed this last directly to , but there is nothing rhetorical about it--it is a real question doesn't answer for a moment
Then: Do you care about where we're goin'
clearly finds this hard to say: Not as long as you care about me
(quite simply) Why  love you, sugar
It's the first time he's said it to her, and  is overwhelmed
She wraps her arms around 's middle, and snuggles into him, like a child
Neither we nor  can see 's face now, and her voice is muffled by his chest

Oh, God

The shapes in the room--the bed is gutted and only the box mattress remains--dresser, lamp shades, etc
, are grotesque in the flickering light
s
sounds of  and ,  giggling and whispering something we can't quite hear
Move across the room toward the gutted bed
Move giggling from the floor beneath the box mattress--for a moment it should appear as if something perversely sexual may be going on between  and

With the muzzle,  knocks the swivel mirror on the dresser overhead, bringing  and  into view

Candelabras made of empty beer bottles lie at her head and feet

She wears a garish silk bow in her hair which it, for this occasion, curled like a little girl's
sits up, beer bottle in one hand, Tommy gun in the other, derby hat cocked--and just a little unsure of the whole thing
He takes a swig-- stops him, trying terribly hard not to change her position
Lie down now, honey
've done enough
Angle on mirror-- and
Night
(with patience, to a child) You have to lie down
it's the only way we can tell what we'll look kike together
She giggles again, more than a little gassed herself clamps a big cigar between his teeth and abruptly lies down beside her
is both amused and annoyed

(it suddenly strikes her) That's not the right tie

(rising, weaving a little) You can't wear polka-dots on an occasion like this
Well what-- Stripes
Don't go away now
She weaves her way over to the dresser, takes a swig from a bottle there herself, checks her makeup, and returns with the tie
Holding against his chest to try it out she almost falls into him
steadies her
Perfect
She tries to tie it for him, and clearly has trouble with the knot

If we're gonna do this, at least  can tie it myself
Lie down before you fall down

She does, with some play-acting, exaggerated obeisance to 's command--reaching up at the last moment like a zombie and snatching an artificial flower from 's hat which still lies on the dresser
lies down now
They look into the mirror again
(grudgingly) Better
Much
This tickles  despite himself and he laughs-- begins to sing to him--performing for both CLYDe and her own image in the mirror--like some hoydenish vaudevillian
91
During the course of the song she will rise and take with her who finally joins in when they tip-toe over and begin to serenade
& (to the lugubrious strains of the Death March) "Did you ever think when a hearse went by, That somebody you or  may die
They'll wrap you up in a big white sheet and bury you down just about six feet, The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out, The worms play penuckle on your snout
Your eyes fall in, your teeth fall out, Your face turns green and the pus runs out
During this last they have been hovering over
's twitching face, like a couple of tipsy ghouls, whisper- singing into his ears
finally blinks, doesn't even bother to look at them
'm gonna die if  don't get some sleep
Quit singing that
Reaction-- and
Night
They smile, go back and lie down
Looking at their images: All right, shut your eyes now
(playing along with her) No, you first
One for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready-- & Four to Go
92
As they approach four we should feel that somehow when they shut their eyes, they really will die
They shut them on , and screen goes black
Ranged across the lawn are six police cars, loaded with peace officers
Four men come out and, guns drawn, walk cautiously over to the room on the right-- and 's
'
There is a knock on the door
They sit bolt upright in bed
Before  can say anything,  puts her hand over his mouth to shut him up
(calling out) The men are on the other side
The four lawmen, among them the  from the cafe, edge their way across the lawn, past the first garage, past the second
Before they reach the door of  and 's cabin, the window smashes and there are blasts of gunfire
One cop is hit and falls, the others run back to the cars for cover
and
are at the window, firing steadily
--running into the garage to get the car
They must escape
All they can do is escape, and all they have is that one car in the closed garage
Outside
Two of the lawmen fall to the ground, shot
As the remaining two run back for cover, we see a blinding light rolling up in a space between the six cars
It is an armored truck, with mounted guns and and spotlight, advancing toward the cabin
Inside the armored truck
Two men in the seat
Sounds of gunshots coming from everywhere, piercing light
From inside the truck, we suddenly see the windshield shattered from bullets fired by  and
The driver is hit, and he slumps over the wheel
His body hits the horn, which starts blasting and continues throughout the battle
The other man, quickly, ducks under the dashboard for protection
Inside the garage
standing by the car
He holds the Browning Automatic
The garage door is shaking from the impact of bullets, shattering
His gun already firing (automatic clip) before he gets there
in a crouch runs to the garage door, flings it up, and runs back inside the car
Now the door is open and he can get the car out
93
One hand on the wheel, one hand shooting, he rolls the car out onto the driveway
The battle is raging from all sides
The car stops
keeps shooting
The door of the cabin flies open and  and
come charging out, guns blazing away
fires the Thompson sub-machine gun, fires two pistols with automatic clips
They run in a crouch, tryingto get inside the car in front of their door
They make it
Camera pans across the motel to the other door
It opens, and  come out, holding a double bed mattress in front of them for protection
This makes their running awkward--the mattress is heavy
carries the front end,  the back with one hand, the other firing his gun
They get halfway to the car and then  is hit, shot in the head
He falls to the ground;  and the mattress fall too since she has lost balance
Both are under the mattress
dashes out of the car and drags  into the back seat
follows, hysterical
All guns on all sides are still firing
They fling themselves into the car and from a standing start, the car starts out at 60 mph down the driveway
One of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a double-barrele rifle, but the car keeps coming, about to run him down
He jumps out of the way and fires at the side
The glass cracks and we see  fling a hand to her face, which is bloody
piece of glass has lodged in her eye
We hear her scream
The horn is still blasting
manages to keep it on the road
They drive away
The police run back to their cars to give chase, calling out to each other, unable to believe that the gang could possibly have gotten away
as it is speeding down the highway
Crazy, mad hillbilly music on the soundtrack
Packed inside this car right now is more sheer human misery and horror than could be believed
It is hell in there, hell and suffering and pain
The car is a complete mess
is sobbing
Everyone is hysterical
is shrieking with pain and concern for is alternating between groaning and passing out completely
is yelling at everybody to shut up
94
Only , driving with both hands clenched on the wheel, is silent
The car is doing 90
The car from the outside, a half hour later
They have eluded the police
They are barreling down the road at top speed on a nice suburban street with proper homes
It is the middle of the night, utter silence
stops the car, points to ca car in a driveway--it is a beautiful, shiny new and expensive automobile
runs out, runs up the driveway, peers inside, gets in, quietly backs it down the driveway and pulls behind the gang's bullet-riddled getaway car
Suddenly they both zoom off down the road together
driving alone
He is crying, mumbling, wiping his eyes and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the other
wide field in the country
This is Dexter, Iowa
It is quiet
We see, in a long shot that takes in everything, that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees, a dense forest that circles them
The meadow, however, is large
The two cars drive into the middle of the field, headlights on
They stop and the Barrow gang gets out
They are in horrible shape--we can finally have a look at them
Half- dressed in their pajamas, bloody, dirty, in tatters
Those that can stagger out do so, others are carried
far shot of all this
Closer shot
Moving closer to them, we see  and
lay  down on the ground
begins to administer to his wounds as best he can, mostly just wiping him off is semi-conscious
All are in a semi-daze
falls to her knees, still clutching her eyes
She is totally hysterical
Oh, God, please help us
Dear Father in Heaven, get us out of this and Buck will never do another bad thing in his life
(she continues moaning, praying, sobbing) walks over to the group, looking at ,
goes over to her
Two shot-- and
95
He ain't got a chance
Half his head blown off
Camera pulls back to take in
My eyes
(she ) God,  think 'm blind
(in the headlights) light hurts so bad
walks over to the car and comes back with the sunglasses  had given
Moving her out of the glare, she helps  put them on
now has an arm around , and  shivers into  gracefully
is a little repelled by , but comforts her out of genuine feeling for her
(clinging) Please, please get us to a doctor
Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor
We'll die here
(helping with glasses) --here, hon'
looks silently up to
is looking dumbly down at his mangled brother
(going on) Clyde, Clyde, please get us to a doctor
Though  cannot see it,  has knelt down to the side of , taking 's hand and with his other hand has begun smoothing 's hair back, away from the wound
He's your brother
(gently, knowing will not and cannot answer ) Buck can't be moved, now, hon'
's answer to this is hysterical sobbing, burying herself into , mumbling half-coherent, muffled prayers between the sobs
96
With  and
(weakly) Clyde
Clyde
Right here, boy
believe  lost my shoes
maybe the dog hid 'em
(he lapses into unconsciousness again) has begun to cry a little, continues to smooth back 's hair with ritualistic regularity
Wide angle
Night
Camera pulls away, way back to wide shot of the entire field, showing the group in the center of the darkness, lit by the headlights
Match dissolve into early dawn, camera still on the wide shot
The field is lighter, though the trees still loom blackly around it
The two cars, one almost a shattered wreck, the other bright and shiny and new, are parked in the center
The sky is light, but the trees cast a dark shadow on the field
The gang is just sitting around weeping next to ,
sitting on the running board of a car, staring
standing and smoking
still with
All is quiet
From the edge of the woods, a man in a white shirt emerges from behind a tree
The camera swings abruptly to get him
He calls out to the gang
Surrender
It is a total surprise
,  and
all grab their guns and fire several shots; they are not firing the big guns now, but the pistols
The man lingers there for a moment--he looks strange, white, luminous, like an apparition--and then he vanishes into the woods
Silence, long enough to make you think it was perhaps an illusion
Then there is a volley of gunfire--a noise so large as to be almost an impossible sound--coming from the woods, all around, everywhere
97
ring of little white puffs of smoke emerge from the woods; from every tree a puff of smoke
The camera pans in a circle
Behind every tree is a man with a gun
There are at least 150 people out there--peace officers, farmers with hunting rifles, kids with squirrel guns, everyone who wanted to come along and catch  and
Their number is so large because this time they want no possibility of the gang making what seemed by them supernatural escapes
From this point on, the sound of guns is unnaturally muffled on the sound track
We hardly hear them at all
it is like a dream
Without a word, all of the gang including the half-dead making his final effort, scramble for the nearest car
They run, throughout this battle, crouched, like animals--their only thought, to get away, to escape
To fight it out would be ludicrous
From the moment the Barrows start in motion, there is shooting again from the edge of the woods
We see them scrambling towards the car, in an extreme long shot, surrounded by the ring of smoke
: All of them inside
is at the wheel
: Med
Long shot of the car moving
The sound track goes to complete silence
We see the car looking for an avenue of escape
It veers towards a tree, a man steps out from behind the tree and fires, the car jerks and veers toward another tree, again a man steps out and fires and so on
The car performs its eccentric dance, all in utter silence (no sound of the motor, nothing)
The film should have the feeling of slow motion, as the car swerves and loops along the edge of the woods
Not once do any of the Barrows fire back
Another man steps out and aims
Close-up
At the wheel-shot in the arm
He grabs his arm in pain, loses control of the wheel
: 98
--out of control (still silent)
It smashes into a tree stump
The picture stops, freezes for three beats
We hold the image of the moment of crash, with pieces of metal crumpling and flying into the air, suspended there by the stop-film
: Sound partly up again, but never at its realistic volume
From inside the smashed car, we peer out the window across the field and see the other car
The thought strikes the audience at the same time it strikes the gang--they must get to that car
Med
shot of the second car, sitting in the field, shining in the sun
The lawmen also realize what must be done--cut off this escape
Though ,  and the others are heading toward it, they suddenly train all their fire on the car rather than the gang
The car fills the frame of the screen
Bullets begin to hit it
It starts to quiver under the impact
For the next minute, we see the car die in front of our eyes
We see the beautiful machine fall to pieces--windows smash, tires torn apart, body riddled
The death of the car is as painful to watch as the willful death of a human being
The execution is paced deliberately to show the ritualistic tempo of the destruction
The camera pulls back, way back and slightly above everything to reveal the entire field
On the left of the screen, ,  and
are scrambling toward the edge of the woods
In the center  and  have taken cover behind a fallen log
In the foreground, police begin to emerge from the woods
The camera zooms rapidly in with them toward
is screaming
Don't kill him
Don't kill him
He's dying
is making a last feeble attempt
The zoom continues past  until it comes tight on his hand, a lawman's foot steps on his hand
falls over
He dies screams
Don't die, Daddy
Don't die
99
She goes berserk
Five men, one hardly a teen-ager, grab her and hold her as she writhes and cries
She is still wearing the sunglasses
: , ,
They have reached the edge of the woods
Camera tracks with them as they run
From all around come the sounds of the posse
The three get in through the pines and come finally to a deep stream
They jump in and start across, running awkwardly in chest-deep water
They are half way across when the police appear on the bank behind them, shooting
Close-up
Day--as she is struggling through the water
bullet hits her in the shoulder
We must see this bullet clearly, we must see it go in her flesh so that we can feel it
Tight close-up of 's face as she screams
It is the first time she has been hurt, and the scream is pure animal pain
She cries out
, who has almost reached the other side, comes back and gets her
He drags her out of the water and into a cornfield that starts growing on the opposite bank,
helping
He half-carries half-runs with her into the cornfield, as the field gets deeper and thicker
They stop for a second
(panting, to Bonnie) Saw
saw a farm
up ahead
gotta get
a car
He starts to give over the wounded  to
Baby, no
But  has not heard this last
Working on pure adrenaline now, he struggles onward
Camera tilts up slightly so we can see  as he essays his way toward a farmhouse with a car in the distance
After a few moments he disappears and we can hear only the cracking of the stalks as that sound too diminishes, Full shot
Cornfield
Day
Silence
100
Close
and
Obviously some time later
They both lie prostrate in the field, listening
licks his lips
Maybe-- Shhh
They wait for another long moment, picking up only the tiniest sounds
(finally) Oh, no
(nervously) What
What
(as though it were the most logical thing in the world) can't die without Clyde
just can't
looks at her as if she's gone crazy
After another moment the corn begins to tremble, and we hear the o
s
sound of an approaching car
With
Day--tentatively lifting his head up to clear the corn stalks
With him we see the car looming larger, bearing down on us, splitting the corn stalks
The car finally comes to a stop a few feet in front of is on her feet, and  tumbles out of the car, practically before it's stopped, sweeping  into him
For a moment both are in their knees a few feet from the running board of the car, simply holding onto each other and not moving
(tugging at both of them frantically) 'mon
'mon
'mon
: They have gotten away, but are still escaping

He is bare-chested
is beside him in front, his arm bleeding
He falls in and out of consciousness
is stretched out in back

Her shoulder has been bandaged with
's shirt
She is unconscious
comes half-awake and looks over at
Head out,
(determinedly) 'm goin' home to my daddy's farm
: is driving down the road, hell for leather
Nearing a campsite, where there are about six Okie cars and pick-up trucks all loaded down, with a number of poor families seated around a campfire, cooking
jams on the brakes
He gets out, looking totally exhausted
Reaction shot
The faces of the Okies, looking at this sudden presence in their midst
Back to
(about to drop) Can y'all spare me a little water
One man, the leader of the group, dips a cup of water and approaches
suspiciously
He comes close enough to make reach out for the water, but withholds it from him
Who are you, boy
Name's Moss
This seems to be enough for the man, who gives him the water
As
gulps it down, the man begins to circle the car, peering into it suspiciously
Suddenly he starts and his eyes open wide
(in really hushed and reverent tones) It's Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow
102
He stands there struck dumb, staring
Those of the others who have heard him begin to come over
Without a word they move quietly to the car and stare in
is out in the back seat;  is semi-conscious in the front seat
He looks up through half-closed eyes
We see a woman pour a bowl of soup at the campfire and bring it to
He accepts it
man rolls a cigarette and lights it
Then, very gingerly, as if afraid to really touch him, he reaches through the window and places it in 's lips
It hangs there, unable to drag on it or remove it
Children peer through the back window
finishes his cup of soup
He hands it and the cup of water back to a woman in the crowd
Quietly, moving together, the Okies step back
walks to the driver's seat, gets in and shuts the door
He starts up the car
The people push a bit closer for a last look
, unable to do more, nods his head in a barely perceptive gesture by way of saying "thank you" t ot the people
The cigarette is still dangling from his lips
The car moves off
pulls on his 's shirt
Who was they, Pa
That was Bonnie and Clyde, the bank robbers
woman, nearby, smiles sweetly
: The car pulls up outside the slightly ramshackle farm of ,
's father, in Arcadia, Louisiana
It sits, for a moment, in the dark
Then
honks the horn
few seconds pass, and the porch light comes on comes out in his pajamas and peers into the darkness
He is a fat man with gray hair
103
Who's there
(calling back) Daddy
Who's there
Who is it
It's
It's Clarence
Clarence
He runs down the steps, down the path to his son
They greet each other, hugging for a second, looking each other over
God, it's good to see you, boy
He holds
at arm's length to study him, and suddenly he scowls at something he sees by the light of the porch
What's that on your chest
(puzzled) Huh
(realizing what he means) It's a tattoo
'm in trouble
'll tell you about it later
My friends are hurt
Help me get 'em in
goes to car and looks inside for a moment
He walks back to
Jesus, what happened to them
You in trouble, son
Yeah
That's Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker
(reaction from Malcolm) We been shot
Help me get 'em inside
We gotta help 'em
They go to the car and drag the unconscious  out and begin carrying her up to the house
104
Why'd you get yourself marked up
tattoo
What in hell made you do a damn fool thing like that
They reach the house
'mon, Pa, open the door

Although the scene begins with a full-screen close-up of a newspaper clipping with a photo, it is just a blurry-gray, crowded scene of 's capture
Really impossible to make anybody out in the crowd
Camera stays on photo as we hear voice over of two men talking: a sheriff and his deputy
was in the bunch that took 'er
See here
Can you make me out
Here  am, see here, right behind Joe Boyd here
Sure enough, Billy, is that your head there
Camera pulls away, , a young deputy--cold, intense, humorless and square, carefully folds up the clipping and puts it in his wallet
Still can't figure how we let them other two get away
(an older, more genial type) Yeah, seems as how nobody can get 'em somehow
(sullen) Yeah
well, maybe this boy'll be the one to do it, this Hamer guy
Boy if he can't do it, Sheriff, ain't nobody but the whole
Army can do it
105
(with a new note of enthusiasm, gets up and walks to the window--turning to Billy) You hear he quit the Rangers on account of Texas got that woman governor
Said he wouldn't work under no woman
(respectfully) Yeah, that's somethin' all right
Say, how many they say he shot anyway in his day
Sixty-five they say
Son of a sea-cook
The door opens
We see, full shot and then fast close-up It should be a complete shock to the audience-- this is the man kidnapped by the gang earlier and partially destroyed by
is dressed in his Ranger outfit and hat, and again he has that quality of sinister frenzy beneath his calm manner
His attitude toward these lawmen is sheer condescension, friendly only out of convention, really superior and contemptuous of lesser workers in his field
(with politeness arising from condescension) Excuse me, am  in the right place
Is this Sheriff Smoot
and  jump up from the chairs and walk over to , hands extended
They are quite impressed by meeting in the flesh
(mispronouncing his name) Frank Hammer
sure am pleased to meet you
(shakes his hand) Hamer
106
coil of rope snaps into and through the paper, splitting it and revealing
's startled face
strides the porch angrily, snapping the rope
and  are seated along with
Through has her arm supported by a sling and  has his shoulder bandagedm it is evident by 's heady indignation and 's attentiveness that both are well on the way to recovery
(still snapping rope) What do they mean, fled
How in the nama God could  leave my brother to die when he was already dead when  left him
(livid) He was shot in too many pieces to pick off the ground
Fled
what do they know, the papers or the police
Suddenly he moves upon  with enormous intent, as if by pounding the point home to the one relative stranger among them, he will justify it all
momentarily flinches, then listens with intense deference
Why, while we were all lyin' around here, near dead, they had us holdin' up the Grand Prairie National Bank
They hung that one on us just for luck,  guess
shakes his head, still thinking this over
Abruptly, to , with deadly seriousness: Tell you what
Soon's we get well, we're gonna take that bank
He breaks into a wicked grin, but then reels, catching himself on the porch railing
He's obviously dizzy from exertion and anger
starts--then sees  is in control
(remarking on his own dizziness) Whooooooo, boy
(kneeling, to Bonnie) They don't know nothin'--do they, sugar
107
(assuring him) You did all you could, hon'
Nobody coulda done more
has been studying hard on the torn paper, b
g
Suddenly: Hey
How come 'm always called the "Un-identified sus-spect
" Group shot
Porch
has trouble with this last phrase
laughs
This picks up 's spirits once more
(to
) You can just thank your lucky stars that's all you are
So long's they don't have your last name, you're home safe
(toadying to Clyde, talking to Clarence) Mr
Barrow's lookin' out for your interests, boy
(impressed) Oh
Hey, Pa, how you like havin' a coupla big deals stayin' with you
(friendly as can be) Ain't that somethin' for me
(back in good mood, expansive) Well now, you been real nice to us, and  tell you what, let us pay you forty dollars for your hospitality, what do you say
(protesting vehemently) No, no, no
don't want your money
'm just pleased to have your company
Any friend of my boy's
(abruptly) Hey, Pa, let's have supper
'm hungry
108
(smiling) Yeah
okay, Clarence
(to Clyde) You're welcome here, now you know that
They go into the house
Camera goes with them
As soon as they are out of earshot from  and ,  turns on
displaying an entirely different demeanor from the one he presented outside
(indicating tatto which flutters through
's open shirt) You look like trash, boy, marked up like that
Cheap trash
(protesting) Bonnie says it looks good
Bonnie, what does she know
She's just cheap trash herself
Look what they do to you, and you don't even get your name in the paper-- just pictures put on your skin, by "Bonnie and Clyde"-- (more to himself) --why they're a coupla kids
But, Daddy-- 'm just glad your ma ain't alive to see that thing
peeks at it, peering down at his chest, trying to bring the bluebirds into focus, puzzled
don't see what's so bad about it
Seated in a soft chair, looking directly at us, is Her eyes are completely covered with a white bandage
She wears a hospital gown
The room is white and bright

Med
shot
in the doorway
The nurse leaves
He reaches in his pocket and pulls out a white handkerchief
He puts it over his mouth to disguise his voice, afraid she will remember it from the kidnap
Quietly, almost on tiptoes,  walks over to
He gets inches away from her face
She still doesn't know he is there
(quietly, but suddenly, his voice muffled by the handkerchief) Blanche Barrow
She starts to her feet, then adjusts to his presence
She is a bit panicked
is now a defeated human being
Her voice and manner bespeak great weariness, sorrow and still a touch of her old high-strung hysteria
But most of that is gone now, like everything else that was really vital in her life
What
What
Who is it
(in a monotone, a relentless questioner) You know your husband's dead
(her voice flat and expressionless) know
You're going to prison
know it
Where's the rest of 'em
don't know
Where's the rest of 'em
just don't know
don't know
How'd you get in with them
110
(starting slow, but warming up to the subject, she begins to talk and talk for the sake of airing her troubles) didn't mean to
didn't
Buck said we was just goin' to visit, we wouldn't be doin' no robbin' and stealin', and then we went to Joplin and all of a sudden they started shootin'
(hysteria begins to creep into her voice as she relives it all) And we run off, God,  was scared
And then it was run all the time, and  wanted to go,  begged to go, but Clyde and Bonnie and
-- (seizing on it) who
Moss
: : It is pouring rain, middle of the afternoon,  and are inside the car, sitting
They have lived so much in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in it rather than in a room
There they are themselves
is in the back seat, her legs wrapped in a plaid blanket, writing poetry
She looks like Elizabeth Barrett Browning
With one essential difference--her arm is in a sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder
is in the front seat, reading a newspaper
He is also partially bandaged
On the dashboard is a box of ginger-snaps which he eats while he reads
They look domestic
Want a ginger-snap, Bonnie
111
(busy, absorbed) No, hum-umm
(then she realizes his nice gesture and smiles warmly at him) But thanks anyway, Clyde
(she takes it all in, her situation, and looks content and cozy) It's real nice here, just the two of us like this
(more interested in his paper) Uh-huh
(something in the paper catches his interest) Look here, honey, remember this
He holds up the paper; there is one of the photos from the motel, the one showing  smoking
She looks up at it with mild interest
Yeah, at the motel
(studying the picture) You sure don't resemble that no more
Close-up
She doesn't
She has become totally fragile, the essence of herself
She is writing on a pad
and
What you writin' this time
(intensely) 'm writing a poem about us
'm writing our story
(this appeals to his ego) Oh, are you
Let's hear it
If it's good, 'll mail it in to the Law and it'll be printed in all the papers again
Just let me finish this line
112
She does so
munches a cookie
(continuing) Okay, here it is
Close-up
--as she reads intensely
At the beginning of this montage, the camera remains on her face
Behind her we see the rain on the window
(reading) "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde" You've heard the story of Jesse James-- Of how he lived and died: If you're still in need Of something to read Here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde
Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow Gang 'm sure you all have read How they rob and steal And those who squeal Are usually found dying or dead
They call them cold-hearted killers; They say they are heartless and mean; But  say this with pride, That  once knew Clyde When he was honest and upright and clean
But the laws fooled around, Kept taking him down And locking him in a cell, Till he said to me, "'ll never be free So 'll meet a few of them in hell
" The road was so dimly lighted; There were no highway signs to guide; But they made up their minds If all roads were blind, They wouldn't give up till they died
: 113
The manuscript is lying on the police blotter
picks it up and continues reading it
He reads it in a halting way: The road gets dimmer and dimmer; Sometimes you can hardly see; But it's fight man to man, And do all you can, For they know they can never be free
From heartbreak some people have suffered; From weariness some people have died; But take it all in all, Our troubles are small, Till we get like Bonnie and Clyde
Close-up of a newspaper page
The poem is printed all the way down the length of one column
On the sound track, 's voice picks up the recitation: '  (
) If a policeman is killed in Dallas, And they have no clue or guide; If they can't find a fiend, They just wipe their slate clean And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde
-
The day is sunny and we see it through the car window
She continues reading, but now she reads it directly from the newspaper: If they try to act like citizens And rent them a nice little flat About the third night They're invited to fight By a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat
Some day they'll go down together; They'll bury them side by side; To few it'll be grief-- To the law a relief-- But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde
114
finishes the poem, as camera pulls back slightly to show that it is a different day, different clothes and the bandages are gone
As she stops, she has an expectant and somewhat self-satisfied look
Close-up of
His eyes are wide, his mouth open, his face shows surprise and delight and he is on the verge of a giant laugh
(in gleeful wonder) Damn
That's me
great laugh comes bursting from him
Camera widens to take in
She is both startled and delighted by his response
(continuing) In that poem
giggles
(continuing; it is all starting to come out now--his realization that he has made it, that he is the stuff of legend, that he is an important figure) sub-gun's rat-tat-tat
(he begins to laugh loudly) Right in the paper
Close-up
Now laughing too, with a great feeling of joy
Two shot
and
Jesse James
You hear 'bout old Jesse, now you goin' to hear 'bout Clyde
He puffs up with air and explodes like a steam valve
(continuing) Pshhhhhh
He grabs  and chuckles delightedly
115
(continuing) Damn, Bonnie
You musta been one hell of a waitress
Close-up
--laughing, her eyes filled with tears
's hand wipes them away
Two shot
(shaking his head back and forth like a puppy, just so much glee in him that he can't hold it) Oooooh, that Clyde
That's my boy, that Clyde
He looks at her with love and delight, hugs her tightly
Bonnie
(she hugs him back) The Poem of Bonnie and Clyde
(laughing at the mistake, happy) The Story
The Story of Bonnie and Clyde
Oh, child, you really did tell that story
He pulls her to him, his face inches away from hers, about to kiss her
She is waiting, expecting
Suddenly, he lets out one wild laugh almost into her mouth
He kisses her
She kisses back
They are chuckling, giggling
They grow more ardent; they pull back and laugh again
They begin to make love
Bright afternoon
Camera across the street from an ice cream parlor
Sign about it: "' -
" large plate glass window fronts the store, and through it we can see the people inside seated at tables and booths
Prominent in our vision is  , seated, facing camera
He is seated across from another man, but we see him from the back
116
is obviously doing a lot of talking and then some hard listening; gesticulating and looking disturbed
After a bit of this, he rises from the table and begins walking toward the door
The other man rises and turns
We now see that it is
and  come out onto the sidewalk, squinting in the sunlight
mimes some social pleasantries by way of saying "goodbye," but 's face shows no emotion of recognition of the gesture
He turns and walks away, walking out of the frame
stands where he is, in front of the ice cream parlor
By the expression on his face, we can see that he is rather disturbed by what he has heard and that he is still grappling with the problem
: and
They lie where they were with one difference--they are now wrapped in the blanket
's pants are wadded up and tangled with his shoes at the base of the blanket
(chuckling, apparently quite pleased) Damn
damn
damn
He casts a sidelong glance to , wanting some sort of overt reaction from her
She's just smiling slightly
's underlying anxiety begins to surface
(not looking at her) Hey, listen, Bonnie, how do you feel
(watching him steadily, her slight smile growing) Fine
mean you feel like you're s'posed to feel after you've uh
Just
117
(doesn't know what the fuck to say, desperately wants her approval) Well, that's good, ain't it
Reason  ask is,  uh
Well, figger it's a good idea to ask mean how else do  tell if  did it the way
(stopping him, with great warmth) Hey
You done just perfect
looks at her for the first time, tremendously relieved
He can see she means it
Now his buoyancy, utterly, unchained breaks through: did, didn't
mean  did, really did
did it,  did, mean this was my first time and it was just like rollin' off a log when it comes right down to it, it was easy,  mean  didn't even have to try
Lovingly, laughing, altogether overwhelmed with himself, pulls  into him
He kisses her, wants to make love again, but then pulls back and keeps chattering at sixty miles a minute
He's waited twenty-three years to talk about this, and he's got the perfect audience
: After dinner
There are four empty plates, but only
and  in the kitchen
is scraping the bottom of a wilted "' -  " carton studies his son's quiet intensity in this direction for a moment, then moves very close, whispers when he speaks
(whispering) Boy, they expect you to go downtown with 'em tomorrow
(out loud, licking his ice cream) Who
118
(raising his own voice, infuriated by his son's obtuseness) Bonnie and Clyde
(he slaps the carton out of
's hands; whispering again) Bonnie and Clyde
Sure,  always go with them
thinks hard about this
better go then, you better go, better go
(forcing
to sit at table) --but when they get back in the car to come on home, don't get in with them
(genuinely puzzled) Why, Daddy
You just listen to your Pa fer once
Cain't you do that
'm yore Daddy, 'm your kin, not Clyde
(still confused) Well, what should  tell 'em
" can't get back in the car with you
" is ready to kill--his son's obtuseness and his fear of  is whipping him into a quiet frenzy
(squeezing
's arm) No, you tell them nothin', hear
(hesitates, then) made a deal and got you off with a coupla years
(a piercing treble) Made a deal with who, Daddy
119
hauls off and whacks
across the top of his head with the flat of his hand, then momentarily holds his hand over
's mouth
(we can see his own fear) the law
Just don't get back in that car
(eyeball to eyeball) And whatever you do, don't let onto them, hear
suddenly smiles, as if he knew something
(expletive) Whew
You think them laws are gonna catch Bonnie and Clyde in town
returns to the ice cream carton-- lets him, figuring he better find out what he can
What do you think, Clarence
(matter of fact) They ain't gonna catch 'em
Don't matter whether  let on or not
(playing along) Mebbe
Just you be off'n the streets of that town when they go to get in their car
(looking directly at Malcolm) Nobody catches Clyde
Clyde's got a sense, don't you know that, Daddy
Nobody catches Clyde
knows better, but for just a moment he stares at his son, fearing that maybe
, for all his limitations, has a sense about 's sense
has finished with the carton and crumples it, licking the last remnants of cream off his fingers
and 's bedroom, the middle of that night
Both are wide awake, lying on opposite sides of the double bed
Both are staring into the night, disquiet
120
(suddenly) Bonnie
Bonnie, will you marry me
There is a silent gasp from , a barely perceptible stiffening
Then she talks in a voice falsely formal, still staring up at the ceiling
How could  do that, Clyde
You know it's impossible
We'd have to go to a Justice of the Peace and the Justice of the Peace is a lawman
We couldn't even take out a license
(with a chuckle) Hey now, you sound like you been givin' it some thought on your own
(with a grim irony, her voice getting more and more emotional) Oh no,  never gave it thought haven't thought about it at least ten times a day,  haven't thought about it every minute of my life since  met you
(suddenly her voice cracks into tears) She flings herself violently across the bed and buries herself into 's chest, her knees drawn up, her head tucked down into him, her body shaking with sobs
(a bit startled by this, attempting to hold her, awkwardly, and placate her
He puts his arm around her) Bonnie
are you crying, honey
nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears
(her face still buried in 's chest, she whispers) Clyde, why do you want to marry me
121
thinks a minute and then grins
(in an attempt to be humorous) To make an honest woman out of you
is silent
(finally, in a voice charged with anticipation and dream) Clyde
what would you do, what would you do it some miracle happened and we could walk out tomorrow morning and start all over again, clean, with no record, with nobody after us
thinks about it a minute
Well
guess 'd do it all different
First off,  wouldn't live in the same state where we pull our jobs
We'd live in one state and stay clean there, and when we wanted to take a bank, we'd go to another state
and
Suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he could have, that it was not the answer  wanted to hear
He looks down at her, his voice anxious
(continuing) Bonnie
She is silent
Hey, Bonnie
But she does not answer
We see  jacking up the back wheel of his pickup truck which is parked on the side of the road in a wooded area
: 122
-
street in Arcadia
The car is parked
and walks toward the car carrying big bags of groceries and supplies and put them inside
(looking around) What happened to
He stopped off in that hardware store to get light bulbs for his daddy
opens the door of the driver's seat and sits down
Boy, my feet are sweatin'
He takes off his shoes
(kidding around) You plannin' to drive with your shoes off
Sure, why not
He reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses
As he goes to put them on, one of the lenses falls out
Damn
He puts them on
(laughing) You gonna wear 'em
Sure, drive with one eye shut
gets in the car, rummages around in one of the bags and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper
She unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard, displaying it
It is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her hand, worth about thirty cents
123
(admiring it) Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon
Just look here, you can see every little fingernail on her hands
She shows him
It is a pretty thing, honey
turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music
They are singing "Little Church in the Valley
"  He beats time on the steering wheel, getting a little impatient
puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the grocery sack
We got any peaches
sure could go for a peach right now
She burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach
She takes a big bite
The juice drips down the side of her mouth
She looks beautiful
(he stops drumming his fingers, suddenly has an idea) Whyn't we do it tomorrow
Do what
Tomorrow's Sunday, ain't it
We could drive all night and be on that golf course tomorrow morning
You sure you feel up to it
(enthused) Yeah, why not
(now feeling anxious and excited, he is impatient to move) Where is that boy
He's gone too long
124
(humming to the radio) He'll be here
(holding the peach to him) You take a bite, hon
(getting worried) No, it's takin' too long
What if something happened
Nothin' happened
(more urgently) Go take a look, see what's keepin' him
Not too delighted with the chore,  goes off
We remain with , getting anxious
The music plays on
comes back, hurriedly, now anxious herself
He ain't there
jumps into action, slams his door
'mon, let's go
gets in
They drive off
-
--hiding inside a store, peering out through a curtained window at them driving away
His expression is disturbed; his face half in shadow
and 's car coming down the road
Camera sees from 's
standing in the road, waving him down
The pickup truck, its back jacked up, is parked beside him on a shoulder of the road
What's wrong
don't know
125
reaches the spot, pulls off the road and stops the car
He gets out
Camera pulls back
talks to the old man,  stays in the car
Cut to a shut down the trench of the law, tense
Suddenly, a truck loaded with chickens comes riding down the road from the opposite direction
sees it from a long way away and realizes that he cannot afford to let anything pass between him and his quarry
He decides the time is now
He leaps up from the trench and yells at
Barrow
The   dives under his truck to hide
The shooting starts
We see the chicken truck
Two men in the front seat
They see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and, in terror, they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck
They run as fast as they can into the meadow, away from the trouble
The gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires eight-seven shots at  and , giving them absolutely no chance
The sound is rapid, deafening
At no point in the gun fight do we see  and  in motion
We see, instead, two still photographs cut into the sequence: one of Clyde, half out of the car, taking careful dead aim with his gun, just as he did in the teaching scene: one of , in terror, a pack of cigarettes in her hand clutched tight, looking as fragile and beautiful as she can be
The noise stops at once
Utter silence
It has been a massacre
and  never had a chance to return the gunfire
We see the car, a complete shambles
We never see and  dead, though for a moment we discern their bodies slumped in the car
The camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with the opposite side of the road
Then, slowly, the six lawmen stand up in the trench
On the faces of the five deputies, horror and shock at what they have just done
, however, registers no emotion
His face is a blank
He lights a cigarette
Slowly, slowly, the five men begin to edge closer to the car to see the result
Music, the wild country breakdown music, begins on the sound track
126
Before they reach the car, the camera swings away from them, past them, and zooms out and above into the meadow where the two truck drivers are standing--tiny, distant figures
The truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera, coming back to the road to see what happened
They get closer and closer to the camera until they have reached a middle distance and, as they continue to walk at us, it is-- <
