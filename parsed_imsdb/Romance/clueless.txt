The entire script to Clueless including important actions , songs from the soundtrack , and my own personal comments Just hit the little speaker next to the character's name to hear the lines from the movie (They're not working yet) hope you enjoy reading it as much as  enjoyed writing it
It's amazing the things you pick up when watching a scene 50 times
One thing: this is written by a hopelessly devoted and loyal Alicia Silverstone fan, so some of the commentary may be biased
But,  figure if you're reading this then you must have some interest her
Enjoy

com - ' "Kids in America" The Muffs (Heaps of shots of the girls having fun) So , you're probably thinking, "Is this, like a Noxema commercial, or what
" But seriously,  actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl
mean  get up,  brush my teeth, and pick out my school clothes
"Fashion Girl" David Bowie Daddy's a litigator
Those are the scariest kinds of lawyers
Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him
He's so good he gets paid five hundred dollars an hour just to fight with people, but he fights with me for free 'cause 'm his daughter
Daddy
Cher, please don't start with the juice again
Daddy, you need your vitamin
Where's my briefcase
It's been a couple of months now, so  say we go out to Malibu
Don't tell me those braindead low-lifes have been calling again
They are your parents
And don't try sneaking out of the office
Dr
Lovitz is coming by to give you a flu shot
Oh, Josh is in town
He's coming for dinner
Why
Because he's your step-brother
But you were hardly even married to his mother and that was five years ago
Why do  have to see Josh
(Watch those
) You divorce wives, not children
Here
Forget it
- ' "Just a girl" No Doubt Did  show you the loqued-out Jeep Daddy got me
It's got four wheel drive, dual side airbags and monster sound system
don't have a licence yet, but  need something to learn on
(Cher runs over a potted plant on the kerb) Oh, why that came out of nowhere
(Watch her face when she looks back at the road) Here's where Dionne lives
She's my friend because we both know what it's like to have people be jealous of us
Dude
Girlfriend
And  must give her snaps for her courageous fashion efforts
Hey Cher
Dionne and  were both named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials
So
Shopping with Dr
Seuss
Well, at least  wouldn't skin a Collie to make my backpack
It's Faux
Hello
That was a stop sign
totally paused
Yeah,
- It's not even eight thirty and Murray is paging me
He is so possesive
Tell me about it
This weekend he called me up and he's all "Where were you today
" and 'm like "'m at my Grandmother's house"
Dionne and her boyfriend, Murray are in this dramatic relationship
think they've seen that Ike and Tina Turner movie just too many times
Now  have to say to her
Dee, why do you put up with it
You could do so much better
Alright, sh, sh
Here he comes
"Shoop" Salt n' Pepa Woman, why don't you be answering any of my pages
hate when you call me Woman
Where you been all weekend
What's up
You been jeepin' around behind my back
Jeepin'
Jeepin'
(Watch Cher closely
It's Classic
) Jeepin', jeepin'
No, but speaking of vehicular sex, perhaps you can explain to me how this cheap -mart hair extension got into the back seat of your car
don't know where that came from
That looks like one of your stringy something on others you got up here
Excuse me
do not wear polyester hair,
Unlike some people  know, like Shawanna
Dee, 'm outie
Bye
Why do you gotta go there
That's it
've had it with you
Is it that time of the month again
(Croud Gasps) don't know why Dionne is going out with a high school boy
They're like dogs
You have to clean them and feed them and they're just like these nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you
(Random guy puts his arm around Cher) Ooo
Get off of me
Uh,
- Should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in America
Amber will take the con position
Cher will be pro
Cher, two minutes
So, , like right now, for example, the Haitians need to come to America
But some people are all "What about the strain on our resources
" But it's like, when  had this garden party for my father's birthday right
said
because it was a sit-down dinner
But people came that like, did not
so  was like, totally buggin'
had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish in extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was like, the more the merrier
And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians
And in conclusion, may  please remind you that it does not say
on the Statue of Liberty
(Class breaks into applause) Thank you very much
Uh, Amber
Replying
Mr
Hall, how can  answer that
The topic is Haiti and she's talking about some little party
Hello
It was his fiftieth birthday
Whatever
If she doesn't do the assignment,  can't do mine
Ladies
So, does anyone have any further thoughts on Cher's oration
Elton
Comments
Yeah,  can't find my Cranberries
've gotta do to the Quad before somebody snags it
'm afraid  can't permit that
Any further insights
had an insight, Mr
Hall
'm all ears
, like, the way  feel about the Rolling Stones is the way my kids are going to feel about Nine Inch Nails, so  really shouldn't torment my Mom anymore, huh
Yes
Well, it's a little off the subject of Haiti, but tolerance is always a good lesson, even when it comes out of nowhere
Thank you
And with that in mind, 'm going to distribute you report cards
Now, is there a Christian Stobich in this class
Hall
The buzz on Christian is that his parents have joint custody, so he'll be spending one semester in Chicago and one semester here
think it is a travesty on the part of the legal profession
(Look at Cher's face while speaking
Ahhh,  can't take it anymore
) Thank you for that perspective Cher
(Mr
Hall hands out the report cards) Now could all conversations please come to a halt
(Travis jumps up to the window) And could the suicide attempts please be postponed till the next period
Must die
(After Cher, the most classic character in the movie) Suddenly, a dark cloud settled over first period
got a  in debate
- (on phone) Dee
Wassup
Did you get your report card
Yeah, 'm toast
How'd you do
totally choked
My father is going to go ballistic on me
Mr
Hall was way harsh
(Cher and Dionne meet up in the hall) He gave me a  minus
Well, he gave me a , which drags down my entire average
Bye
'll call ya,
Yeah
- ' Isn't my house classic
The columns date all the way back to 1972
Wasn't my Mom a betty
She died when  was just a baby fluke accident during a routine liposuction
don't remember her, but like to pretend she still watches over me
Hey, Ma
98 in geometry
Pretty groovy, huh
"Fake Plastic Trees (Acoustic Version)" Radiohead Yuk
Uh, the maudlin music of the University station
Waa, waa, waa
(Cher enters the kitchen) Yuh, what is it about college and cry-baby music
Hey, who's watching the Galleria
So, the flannel shirt deal
Is that a nod to the crispy Seattle weather, or are you just trying to stay warm in front of the refrigerator
(grabs Cher's tummy) Oo, wow
You're filling out there
Wow
Your face is catching up with your mouth
went by Dad's office
He is not your Dad
Why don't you torture a new family
Hey, just because my mother marries someone else, doesn't mean he's my father
Actually, Kato, that's exactly what it means
(They enter the Lounge) hope you're not thinking of staying here
sure want to
'm sure you do
've got a place in Westwood, near School
Shouldn't you go to school on the East Coast
hear girls at
aren't at all particular
Hahaha, you're funny
(Josh changes the channel from Beavis and Butthead to the News) Hey
God, you just got here and already you're playing couch Commando
Hey
In some parts of the Universe, maybe not in Contempo Casual, but in some parts, it's considered cool to know what's going on in the world
Thank you, Josh
so need lessons from you on how to be cool
Tell me that part about Kenny  again
(From Dining Room) 'mon you chuckleheads, get in here
(They move to the Dining Room) Josh, are you still growing
You look taller than you did at Easter
don't think so
(to Cher) Doesn't he look bigger
His head does
So, Josh, have you given any thought to our little discussion about Corporate Law
Yeah, you know, but  think 'd really like to check out Environmental Law
What for
Do you want to have a miserable, frustrating life
Oh, Josh will have that no matter what he does
At least he knows what he's doing
And he's in good college
'd like to see you have a little bit of direction
have direction
Yeah, towards the mall
Which reminds me, where's your report card
It's not ready yet
What do you mean, "it's not ready yet
" Well, some teachers are trying to low-ball me, Daddy
And  know how you say, "Never accept a first offer", so  figure these grades are just a jumping off point to start negotiations
Very good
(One of the mobile phones rings, everyone answers their phone) Dee
Yeah
Hello
Yeah, Jake, what
Not the afternoon
(Cher and Josh put their phones down) You are such a brown-noser
Oh, and you are such a superficial space-cadet
What makes you think you can get teachers to change your grades
(in background) told you  wanted it in the morning
Doesn't he understand
In the morning
Only the fact that 've done it every other semester
- "Shake some action" Cracker told my
teaher an evil male had broken my heart, so she raised my  to a
'm so miserable
can't eat,  can't sleep,  can't study
They're slime, they're slime,  mean they're horrible, don't feel bad, don't feel bad,  know, and you see they're all like this
Then  promised Miss Giest 'd start a letter writing campaign to my congressman about violations of the clean air act
But Mr
Hall was totally rigid
He said my debates were unresearched, unstructured, and unconvincing,
felt impotent and out of control, which  really hate
needed to find sanctuary in a place where  could gather my thoughts and regain my strength
- Dude, what's wrong
Are you suffering from buyer's remorse or something
(Watch Cher flick her head) God, no
Nothing like that
It's just that, we've been shopping all day and  still don't know what to do about Mr
Hall
have tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude, but was brutally rebuffed
Get over it,
He's a miserable little man who wants to make everyone else miserable too
Dee, that's it
We've got to figure out a way to make Mr
Hall sublimely happy
- Here's the four-one-one on Mr
Hall
He's single, he's 47, and he earns minor duckets for a thankless job
What that man needs is a good healthy boinkfest
Unfortunately, there was a major babe drought in our school
The evil trolls from the math department were actually married,
oooh Snickers
and in the grand tradition of
teachers, Ms
Stoeger seemed to be same-sex oriented
Of course, there was always Miss Giest
Something told me not to discount Miss Giest
Well sure, she has runs in her stockings, and her slip is always showing, and she always has more lipstick on her teeth than her mouth
God, this woman is screaming for a make-over
'm her only hope
(Cher is writing a note outside Miss Giest's pidgeon hole) Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May but thy eternal summer shall not fade
Phat
Did you write that
Duh, it's like a famous quote
From where
Cliff's notes
Oh
(Travis and Miss Giest walk out of her office toward where Cher and Dionne have split the scene) know you're going to be better now
Now, you run along and 'll see you third period and you will try to remember to bring your textbook
Uh,
(Miss Giest reads the note left by the girls and her face brightens) Oh, my God
She actually looked happy
Oooh, classic
(Scene changes to Mr
Hall's classroom) Paroudasm Budapshawn, 16 tardies to work off
(Paroudasm mutters something in Farsi and his friends cheer) Janet Huon, no tardies
Kisser
Travis Berkenstock, 38 tardies
By far the most tardies in the class
Congratulations
(The whole class cheers and applaudes
Travis approaches the podium) This is so unexpected, , uh,  didn't even have a speech prepared
Uh, but  would like to say this: Tardiness is not something you can do all on your own
Many, many people contributed to my tardiness
Uh, 'd like to thank my parents for never giving me a ride to school, the
city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid, and, uh, last but not least, the wonderful crew at McDonalds for spending hours making those egg McMuffins, without which  might never be tardy
Well, if Mr
Berkenstock has no political messages to include in his speech, 'll go on
Cher Horowitz, two tardies
object
Do you recall the dates of these alleged tardies
(Cher in lawyer mode
Legendary
) One was last Monday
Mr
Hall,  was surfing the crimson wave,  had to haul ass to the ladies'
assume your referring to women's troubles, and so 'll let that one slide
Thank you, Mr
Hall
Miss Giest was right about you
What do you mean
Well, she said that you were the only one in this school with any intelligence
- ' Cher, get in here
Yes, Daddy
Would you tell me what the hell this is
Um, a second notice for three outstanding tickets
don't remember getting a first notice
The ticket is the first notice
didn't even know you could get tickets without a licence
Oh, sure you can
You can get tickets anytime
Oh, is that so
(Cher nods) Well not around here you can't
From this moment on, you will not drive, sit, do anything in that jeep without a supervised driver present
And no cruisin' around with Dionne, alright
Two permits do not equal a licence
Do  make myself clear
Yes, Daddy
Cher,  expect you to become a good driver
want to see you apply yourself
will
'm gonna practise real hard
(The scene moves to the poolside) licenced driver with nothing to do
Where would find such a loser
Hey, granola breath, you got something on your chin
'm growing a goatee
Oh, that's good
You don't want to be the last one at the coffee house without chin pubes
can't tell you how much  enjoy these little chats of ours, but in the interest of saving time, why don't you just tell me what you want
So, actually,  have a permit and  can drive and all, but Daddy says  can't take the jeep out without a licenced driver, and since your not doing anything and all, you know
What are the chances of you shutting up until you get your way
Hmmm, slim to none
'mon
- ' Hey, James Bond, in America we drive on the right side of the road
am
You try driving in platforms
Look,  got to get back to school
Ah, you want to practise parking
What's the point
Everywhere you go has valet
What class you going to
Actually, 'm going to a tree people meeting
Me might get Marky Mark to plant a celebrity tree
How fabulous
Getting Marky Mark to take time from his busy pants-dropping schedule to plant trees
Josh, why don't you just hire a gardener
You know, maybe Marky Mark wants to use his popularity for a good cause, make a contribution
In case you have never heard of that, a contribution is the giving of
Excuse me, but  have donated many expensive Italian outfits to Lucy
time
funds
And as soon as  get my licence  fully intend to brake for animals, and  have contributed many hours helping two lonely teachers find romance
Which 'll bet serves your interest more than theirs
You know, if  ever saw you do something that wasn't ninety percent selfish, 'd die of shock
Oh, that'd be reason enough for me
- Would you call me selfish
No
Not to your face
Really
What's wrong
Is Josh giving you shit because he's going through his post-adolescent idealistic phase
Look, there's Mr
Hall
(The girls run over to Mr
Hall) Mr
Hall, Mr
Hall, Mr
Hall, um, do you drink coffee
Well, not from this cafeteria
But, uh, yes under normal circumstances
Well,  am such a retard
When  was packing Daddy's lunch this morning  gave him my lemon snapple, and  took his sucky Italian roast
Do you want it
Are you sure you don't want it
Duh, it might stunt my growth
wanna be 5'10" like Cindy Crawford
But  thought maybe you and Miss Giest might like it
Maybe you can share it
Well, uh, thanks
Sure
(To Dionne) Hmm
(Outside Miss Giest's office, she opens the door) & Miss Giest
Hi girls
Did you sign up for the environmental fair
Oh, yeah, we will
You have such pretty eyes
Don't hide them
And these clips are so cute
And this tiny little waist
Oooh, wow
Girls
Oh, and don't forget to sign up for the environmental fair
Not a total betty, but a vast improvement
Well, we did our best
Mmmm, Hmmm
We gotta book it if we're going to make it to
(Scene moves outside) 'mon, Dee
Ohh,  feel like failing, dude, c'mon
know what you mean, but at least it's exercise
feel like such a heffer
had two bowls of special , three pieces of turkey bacon, a handful of popcorn, five peanut butter &'s, and like, three pieces of licorice
(Gasp) Oh, my God
Look
Is that a photo op, or what
Will you look at that body language
Legs crossed towards each other
That's an unequivocal sex invite
Oh, Cher, he's getting her digits
Look at Giest, she is so cute
Ohh, old people can be so sweet
"Change" Lightning Seeds (The following scenes show Miss Giest and Mr
Hall get it on while everyone is thanking Cher
) The entire student body was utterly grateful for the improvement in their grades
- ' Cher, what's this all about
My report card
The same semester
Uh-huh
What'd you do
Turn in some extra-credit reports
No
You take the mid-terms over
Uh-uh
You mean to tell me that you argued your way from a + to an -
Totally based on my powers of persuasion
You proud
Honey,  couldn't be happier than if they were based on real grades
Thank you
Fabulous

"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" Robert Hazard felt so satisfied,  wanted to do more good deeds
(Dionne sneezes) Dee, when your allergies act up, take out your nose-ring
Follow
through
There you go, there you go
All right, Cher
Earth to Cher
Come in Cher
Oh
Miss Stoeger
would just like to say that physical education in this school is a disgrace
mean, standing in line for forty minutes is hardly aerobically effective
doubt 've worked off the calories in a stick of care-free gum
(Class cheers) Well, you certainly exercised your mouth Cher
Now, hit the ball
(Ball flies by, inches from Cher's nose) Miss Stoeger, that machine is just a lawsuit waiting to happen
Thanks for the legal advice
(Cher returns to line) Dionne
You're up
Uh, no, Miss Stoeger
have a note from my tennis instructor, and he would prefer it if  didn't expose myself to any training that might derail his teachings
Fine
Amber
Miss Stoeger
My plastic surgeon doesn't want me doing any activity where balls fly at my nose
Well, there goes your social life
(Girls giggle
Principal walks onto the scene) Miss Stoeger
Got another one
Ladies, we have a new student with us
This is Tai Frasier
Tai, you don't have time to change, but you could hit a few balls in those clothes
She could be a farmer in those clothes
Dee, my mission is clear
Would you look at that girl
She is so adorably clueless
We have got to adopt her
Cher, she is toe-up
Our stock would plummet
Dee, don't you want to use your popularity for a good cause
No
(Motions to Tai) 'mere
Yeah, c'mere
Hang with us
Oh, thank you
How do you like California
Man,  am freakin'
could really use some sort of a herbal refreshment
Well, we do lunch in ten minutes
We don't have any tea, but we have Coke and stuff
No shit
You guys got Coke here
Well, yeah
Yeah, this is America
(Scene changes to the girls walking down main path) "Unknown song and artist" So, we decided to show Tai the ropes at Bronson Alcott High School
That is Alana's group over there
They do the
station
They think that's the most important thing on Earth
And that's the Persian mafia
You can't hang with them unless you own a
And there's Elton in the white vest, and all the most popular boys in the school
Including my boyfriend
Ain't he cute
Yeah
If you make the decision to date a high school boy, they are the only acceptable ones
Cher, which one of them is your boyfriend
As if
Cher's got attitude about high school boys
It's a personal choice every woman has got to make for herself
(Murray approaches the girls) (to Dionne) Woman, lend me five dollars
Murray,  have asked you repeatedly not to call me Woman
Excuse me, Miss Dionne
Thank you
, but street slang is an increasingly valid form of expression
Most of the feminine pronouns do have mocking, but not necessarily in a misogynistic undertone
(Murray hops away) Wow
You guys talk like grown-ups
Oh, well, this is a really good school
'm gonna go get a soda
You guys want
Sure
Alright
She's nice
Oooh, project
( can't put that cute little squeal into words) (Scene changes to inside cafeteria) "My Iron Lung" Radiohead (To food) Oh, wow
That's disgusting
(To Tai) That's nice representation
Thanks
Those are really nice stickers
Oh, you like 'em
See,  was thinking it was too cluttered
You know,  wanna wipe all of this out and concentrate on one main decorative statement
Like, uh, Marvin the Martian
Right there
Get outa town
can do Marvin the Martian
Really
Well,  mean, there's not really a lot to him
But, you wanna see
Yeah
Here
Oh, wow
That's really cool
Thanks
You drew that
Yeah, and wait,  got
one here
You didn't trace this
Uh-uh
No
Here's another one over here
And, lots of little guys
That is so cute
love to draw
You're really good at it
No
Yeah, really you are
No
Yeah
(Scene changes to outside) Are you sure that's fat free
Oh, yes
And you lose wait by doing it like this
Like really small
(Dionne giggles/hisses) It's true
met a really cool guy
Describe
Alright, he's got long hair, he's really funny, and straight off, right
He offers me some smoke
There he is
Are you talking about drugs
Yeah
Tai, how old are you
'll be sixteen in May
My birthday is in April, and as someone older, can  please give you some advice
(Tai nods) It is one thing to spark up a dubie and get laced at parties, but it is quite another to be fried all day
Do you see the distinction
Yeah
Loadies generally hang on the grassy knoll over there
"unknown song and artist" guitarish Sometimes they come to class and say bonehead things, and we all laugh, of course
But no respectable girl actually dates them
Hmm-mm
You don't want to start off on the wrong foot, do you
( shakes her head) 've got an idea
Let's do a make-over
(Dionne lights up) No, no
Oh, c'mon
Let us
Cher's main thrill in life is a make-over
, it gives her a sense of control on a world full of chaos
Pleeeaaase
(How could anyone resist that
) Sure
Why not
Shit
You guys
have never had straight friends before
- -  ' "Supermodel" Jill Sobule (Various scenes of Cher and Dionne making over Tai, then Cher and Tai working out in the lounge room) Squeeze in
Cher,  don't wanna do this any more, and my buns, they don't feel nothin' like steel
, it will get easier,  promise
Just as long as we do it every day
Not just sporadically
How do you know if we're doing it sporadically
That's another thing, Tai
We've got to work on your accent and vocabulary
See, sporadic means once in a while
Try and use it in a sentence today
Alright
, from now on we're alternating Cindy Crawford's "Aerobicise" and "Buns of Steel", and reading one non-school book a week
My first book is "Fit or Fat"
Mine is "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"
Good
Now that takes care of our minds and bodies, but we should do something good for mankind or the planet for a couple of hours
(Josh walks in) Hey, brainiac
Uh, the dreaded ex
Tai, this is Josh
Nice to meet ya
Hey
You know about this stuff
want to do something good for humanity
How about sterilization
(Tai cracks up
Cher and Josh enter the kitchen) So, what do ya think
'm amazed
That 'm devoting myself so generously to someone else
No, that you've found someone even more clueless than you are to worship you
am rescuing her from teenage hell
Do you know the wounds from adolescence can take years to heal
Yeah, and you've never had a mother so you're acting out on that poor girl as if she was your Barbie doll
Freshman psych rears it's ugly head Hey,  am not taking psych
Whatever
am going to take that lost soul in there and make her well-dressed and popular
Her life will be better because of me
How many girls can say that about you
(Josh and Cher walk back to the lounge where Tai is watching
and singing along with the "Mentos" ad
God  hate those ads
) Be seein' ya
Yeah,  hope not sporadically
- Oh, my God
Do you see how boys are responding
My heart is totally bursting
know
'm kvelling
(Travis approaches) Cher, you have Timor, right
Giest
Hey, Tai
Did you get a flyer
Uh-uh
Here
Thanks
Wow, a party
It's in the Valley
The cops usually break 'em up in less than an hour, and it takes that long to get there
And besides, it's just local loadies
Do you guys think that Travis is gonna be there
Tai,  thought we moved on from there
Don't sell yourself short now
You've got something going for you that no one in this school has
Oh, 'm not a virgin
mean mystery
As far as everyone is concerned you were the most popular girl in your school, and the fact that you hang with Dee and , well
Speaks very highly of you
If you strike while the iron is hot, you can have any guy that you want
Like who
Let's see
Who's available
There's Bronson
got it
Elton
He just broke up with Collette
Oh, yes
Who's Elton
Oh, my God
He's way popular
He's like the social director of the crew
Yeah, and his Dad can get you into any concert, and  noticed him scoping you out
He was looking at me
He said you gave him a toothache
How'd  do that
It's an expression
It means he thought you were sweet
Yeah
Yeah
Wow
Is that true
No
Oh, you are so bad
(Scene moves to fountain where Cher is taking pictures of the crew) "Alright" Supergrass Ok, you guys, all get together
Oh, that is great
Smile
Tai, Tai, get a little closer
Closer Tai
Good, great
Hey, Elton, uh, why don't you put your arm around Tai
(Unwillingly) Alright
Yeah, that's great
(Check out Cher's little smile and rock
Awesome
) Tai, c'mere, c'mere, Tai
(Scene moves to just Cher and Tai by bushes) Hold that
(Elton approaches
) Cool picture
Doesn't she look classic
Yeah, this is beautiful
She looks like one of those Bottichellis chicks
Hey, why don't you make me a copy of this,
Sure
(Another one of Cher's little squeals
Classic
) - ' , Hi Daddy
This is my friend, Tai
Get out of my chair
(Tai moves to opposite Cher
Lucy brings in dinner
) Thank you, Lucy
It looks great
What is this crap
Daddy, it's from the "Cut your Colesterol" cook book
Doctor Lovitz says you've got to get down to two hundred
(Cher's pager beeps
) No calls tonight
But it's Dionne, it might
Sorry
It might be important
We're going to have a nice family dinner
So, uh, what'd you do at school today
Well
broke in my purple clogs
(Mel's phone rings
) Yeah, hello
Alright, Jake
Yeah, yeah, no, no, what
Dee
Whatup
So, check it
Murray's geometry class is right by Elton's locker, and taped up inside was the picture you took of Tai
Oh, my God
What
Elton's got a picture of you hanging up in his locker
Oh, no shit
Hello
So, anyway, the whole crew is going to this party in the Valley
Bye
(Cher hangs up the phone
) Looks like we're going to have to make a cameo at the Val party
(in background) told you  want it in the morning
No
- ' Murray
Just look at the top of the map
Sun Valley is north
, no
All  see is Bel Air, Then you're on the wrong map
am not on the wrong map
Look at the number on the top
What is the number on the top
There are no numbers on the top
There's letters
(Murray makes a frustrated noise
) Murray, shut up
Please don't friz out
- (The gang pull up outside the party
) Listen Tai, when we get there make sure Elton sees you, but don't say hi first
Look like you're having fun and you're really popular
Talk to someone in his eyeline, preferably a guy
Make him come to you, and find an excuse to leave while he's still into the conversation
The key is, always have him wanting more
You got it
got it
Heads up
(Does a rail slide with his skateboard on the stair-rail
) Oh, did you just see that
Oh, God
Skateboards, that is like, so five years ago
Oh, you guys came
That's great
You want a beer
'll get you one
(to Tai) No
(The girls enter the party house
) "Unknown song and artist" This is ragin'
Let's do a lap before we commit to a location
(Dionne drags a dancing girl away from Murray
) Who was that
Cher, ain't that the same dress that you was wearin' yesterday
Say, Ambular
Hi
Was that you going through my laundry
As if
Like  would really wear something from Judy's
Do you prefer fashion victim or ensembly challenged
(Amber walks off
) Uh
What a clone
Cher, you looked much better in that dress than she did
(Travis bursts onto the scene spilling drink on Cher's shoes
) Uh
Ruin my satin shoes, why don't you
'm sorry
(They move to the kitchen
) Excuse me, my shoes
Uh
This is so not fixable
It's a small price to pay to the party gods
Look, 'll make amends
How about some chronic shit
Oh, it's the least you could do
Spark it
Hey, Elton's over there
Act like Travis is saying something funny
(Tai hands joint to Cher and blows smoke in her face
) Sorry
(Tai starts cracking up
) What's so funny
Nothing
(Elton approaches and reaches behind Cher for the joint) Oh, here
(Summer enters holding a card) Hey, everyone
Let's play suck and blow
(The card passes through the group until Elton drops it (on purpose) and plants one right on Cher's mouth) God, Elton
Can you suck
(Dionne screams in the background) It's Dee
'mon
(Scene changes to the bathroom, where Murray is getting his head shaved) What have you done
Oh, my God
Uh
Why did you do this to your head
Because 'm keeping it real
Because 'm keeping it real
What
'Cause 'm keeping it
'cause 'm keeping it real
(to Cher) Look
Look what he's done to his head
Can you believe this
Look at Lawrence's head
Alright
It's the bomb
You know what 'm sayin'
You look good
As will you
What'd you care what he thinks, Murray
'm the one that has to look at you
That was a big mistake
What am  going to do with you now
And right before the year book pictures
What am  going to tell my grandchildren
Alright
You know what
Ok, that's it
(mimicking) That's it
You wanna play games
(mimicking agin) You wanna play games
'm calling your mother
'm
'm ca
Oh, wait
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, wait
Don't call my Ma
Yo, man
Chill, chill
Chill
(Cher and Tai start walking away) Same thing happened at the spring dance
She spent the entire after-party in the bathroom
See, that almost destroyed by buzz
'm still baked
Yeah
(Back to the dance floor
) "Rollin' With My Homies" Coolio What do ya say, we go bump into people
Yeah, 'm cool with that
(from on the fireplace) Hey, Tai
Wait up
Whooh
(Travis jumps onto the crowd
No one keeps him up and he hits the deck
) Are you
(to dancers) Where's your sense of pit hospitality
That was so cool, the way you did that
wish  could do it
Oh, no, don't
Why not
Well, 'cause if girls did it, what would guys do to impress them
don't know, like stuff
You know
What kind of stuff
(Cher spots Travis tuning Tai and butts in to stop it) Tai,  need you
Elton's over there
(The girls start dancing
As Tai is trying to impress Elton she is hit in the head by a flying Clog) Tai
Tai, Elton, help me
(Elton carries Tai into the kitchen and places her on the counter) Thank you
Here, you should use ice
No, Travis
We've got it under control
Tai, are you
Travis, Tai would have wanted you to enjoy the party
If it's a concussion, you have to keep her concious,
Ask her questions
What's seven times seven
Stuff she knows
(Tai sits up and hits her head on the light
What a clutz
) Some bump you've got there
Yeah
Yeah
You ready to go back out there
Yeah,  am
Alright
Are you sure
Can you do this
(Singing) Rollin' with the homies
(Singing) Rollin' with the homies
(Great voice
) Yeah, let's do it
You're ready
(Elton and Tai go back to the dance floor
) had to give myself snaps for all the good deeds  was doing
It was so great
Love was everywhere
Even though  was alone,  was really happy for Tai
It's like that book  read in ninth grade that said, "'tis a far, far better thing doing stuff for other people
" (Scene changed to outside by the pool
Cher's phone rings
) Hello
Do you know what time it is
watch really doesn't go with this outfit, Daddy
Where are you
Uuhh, just having a snack with my girlfriends
Where, in Kuwait
Is that in the Valley
Cher,  expect you to walk in this door in twenty minutes
Well, um, it might take longer than that, Dad
Everywhere in
takes twenty minutes
(Cher hangs up the phone
) (Scene changes to outside front of party house
) Sorry to make you leave, Dionne is bucking for best dramatic actress at a Val party
(Tai laughs
) Hey, Summer
Hi
Pretty random fiesta
Need a ride home
That'd be great
Thanks
No,  got it
Well, 'm right below Wilshire and Lindon
Oh, that's right near me
'm, um, above Olympic
Great
Then, Tai you'll go with Summer, and Cher you'll come with me
Actually, you could take Wilshire to Cannon and that turns into Bennedict
Well, then she'd have to go back south and 'm already going north
But, you could take Tai on your way up to Sunset
Yeah
That doesn't make any sense
'd have to get off the freeway,  hate that
Tai, go with Summer, Cher, you'll come with me
Watch your feet
(Each get into respective cars and wave each other goodbye
) - ' "Away" The Cranberries (Elton is singing along to music
Trying to be sexy, but he fails miserably, the sleazy bastard
) Didn't Tai look cute tonight
(Elton just sings
) really love her hair when it's all wild, you know
But it's also very pretty when it's all up, with that curly tendrils
Like in that picture  took
You know, you're one of my best friends and  do not have friends that are girls
Well, 'm glad, because your happiness means a lot to me
It does
Sure
mean,  saw how hard your breakup with Collette was
Yeah
think we both know what it feels like to be lonely
Whatever
The thing is, is that 'd really like to see you settled already
(Elton pulls the car into a parking lot
) Where are we going
(The car stops
) knew it,  knew it
(Elton makes a pass at Cher
) Oooh, you knew what
That you were totally sprung on me
Hello
Don't you mean Tai
Tai
You have her picture in your locker
have the picture you took in my locker
Ohh, 'm having a twin peaks experience
knew it,  knew it when you kissed me
Suck and Blow is a game, Elton
(Elton has another go at Cher
) Stop it
Alright
You know,  don't get you Cher
mean, you flirt with me all year
As if
have been tryng to get you together with Tai
Tai
Why would  go with Tai
Why not
Why not
Why not
Don't you even know who my father is
You are snob and a half
Cher, listen to me
Me and Tai, mean, we don't make any sense, right
Me and you, well, makes sense
(Elton tries for Cher, yet again
) Cut it out
'mon
Stop it
(Cher gets out of the car
) (Watch Cher compose herself after getting out of the car
i
e
the head movements and sound effects
) Cher
Where are you going
You're only hurting yourself here, baby
'mon, you gonna walk home
Would you get back in the car, please
Get back in the car
Leave me alone
Fine
(Elton drives away
What a prick
) Hey, where are you going
Shit
(Cher whips out the phone and dials) Valley information
Yeah, do you have the number of a cab company
Which one
don't know which one
What do you have out here
We have Valley Cabs
Hand it over
(Cher squeals/moans) Give me the phone
(Cher complies) Bag, too
'mon
Alright, now, uh, get down on the ground
Face down
'mon
Oh, no
You don't understand, this is an Alaia
An a-what-a
It's like a totally important designer
And  will totally shoot you in the head
Get down
(Cher whimpers as she lies down on the pavement) Alright, um, count to a hundred
Thank you
One, two
The evening had turned into a royal mess
Sexually harrassed, robbed
didn't know the number of the party, so  couldn't call Dionne, and Daddy would kill me if he knew where was
There was just one person left to call, and  really, really didn't want to call him
(Cher dials up Josh's place
He's trying to get it on with his girlfriend) 'mon
(Phone rings) Hello
Josh, you busy
Who is it
It's Mel's daughter
So, ,  was at this party, and my designated driver tried to attack me, so  got out 'cause we'd stopped, and then he drove off and deserted me, and then this guy with a gun held me up, took my money, and my phone and he yelled at me and he forced me to ruin my dress
, , look, um
Where are you
Sun Valley
Man, you owe me
- ' "The Ghost in You" Counting Crows The man is ridiculous
He doesn't have one unique thought in his little, puny brain
think there's some merit in learning the form straight off
- ' Suddenly, Daddy had a case that had to be solved right away, so some clerks and Josh came to help him go through a gazillion depositions
(The doorbell rings) (from upstairs) Daddy
What
can't just open it,  have to make him wait a while
Then he can wait outside
Josh, pleeeaaase
(Who could resist that
) 'mon, Josh
'mon
(Josh opens the door
Christian walks right in) What do ya hear
She's not ready
(The two of them walk over to where Mel is working) Hey, man
(Christian extends his hand, but Mel ignores it) Nice pile of bricks you got here
You drink
No, thanks
'm cool
'm not offering, 'm asking you if you drink
You think 'd give alcohol to teenage drivers taking my daughter out
Hey, man
The protective vibe,  dig
What's with you kid
You think the death of Sammy Davis left an opening in the Rat Pack
(Cher appears walking down the stairs
Josh and every male in the audience is stunned) Christian
Doll face
Handsome
Stunning
(to Mel) You're not letting her go out like that, are ya
Cher, get in here
What's up, Daddy
What the hell is that
dress
Says who
Calvin Klein
It looks like underwear
Go upstairs and put something over it
Duh,  was just going to
(Cher runs off) Hey, you
(Christian turns around) Anything happens to my daughter,  got a
45 and shovel
doubt anybody would miss you
(Cher reappears) Bye, Daddy
'mon
(They walk out) It's so killer
Thank you
Your dad is pretty scary
Isn't he
You like Billie Holiday
love him
Right
"Miss Brown To You" Billie Holiday (They drive off) didn't like him
What's to like

If you feel like you should go
You don't need me, do ya
No, no, no
mean, unless you want
mean, unless you want
Josh
Go to the party
Go, go, go, go
'll watch her for you
(Josh walks off) You do that
- "Someday  Suppose" Mighty Mighty Bosstones (Everyone is just dancing
Tai enters) Tai
(Tai falls down the stairs on her butt
Classic
) Oh, my God
Tai, are you
God, shit
That is so embarassing
No, no one saw
Now, all night long, 'm gonna be known as that girl who fell on her butt
Tai, no one noticed
"Where'd You Go
" Mighty Mighty Bosstones Wow
Are you
That looked really bad
Yeah, thanks
(Tai spots Elton dancing with Amber
) Oh, my God, Cher, look
He's going with Amber
No, he's probably just dancing with her
Do you think she's pretty
No, she's a full on Monet
What's a monet
It's like a painting, see
From far away, it's , but up close, it's a big old mess
Let's ask a guy
Christian, what do you think of Amber
Hagsville
See
Dig this
They're charging for brewskies
Cash me a five, 'll pay you back
Sure
(Christian kisses Cher on the cheek) Thanks
(Christian walks away) He is so cute
Oh, my God
Do you see how he is falling in love with me
(The girls watch Christian shrug off an interested girl) mean, look how he ignores every other girl
Oh, God, look
There's Josh
didn't even see him come in, but it's like he finds the only adult in here, like he's deliberately trying to not have fun
(Watch the look on Cher's face as she's waving
Truly legend
) Cher,  have a question
What do you think  should do with this thing
Should , uh, like tie it around, or put it over my shoulder
Tie it around your waist
Ready to slide
Thanks
Let's go
(Christian and Cher return to the dance floor) The band was kickin', and Christian was the hottest guy there, but my enjoyment was put on pause when  saw how unhappy Tai was
(Josh walks over to Tai, engages in small talk, then asks her to dance) Oh, look, look
Josh is dancing with Tai, he never dances
can see why
No, he's doing her a prop so she won't feel left out
Oh,  dig it
(Time passes
Cher, Tai, Josh, and Christian are left
Christian is still dancing by himself) "Here (Squirmel Mix)" Luscious Jackson How are you guys holding up
We're so ready to leave
'm tired
Let's get Christian and go
Christian
You wanna go
Now
These guys here have got the skinny on the happenin' after hours
My trainer's coming really, really early this morning
Oh
Look,  could take the girls home
No, it's
No, 'm fine, stay
You sure
Yeah, sure
(to Josh) Thanks, man
You got my marker
(to Cher) You are a down girl
'll call you tomorrow
- ' That was really decent of you to dance with Tai tonight
My pleasure
You notice any positive changes in her
Yeah, it's under your tutilage she's exploring the challenging world of bare midriffs
So you didn't want to make a night of it with the ring-a-ding kid
Yeah, Daddy wouldn't go too ballistic, it's not like he's going to sleep or anything
No, not if they're going to finish those depo's
Hey, you what would be so dope
If we got some really delicious take-out
bet they haven't eaten all night
That would be pretty dope of us
Let's do it
- ' The midnight snack totally revived the lawyers and Daddy was way grateful
Mmm, Meat
Meaty oranges and you get a lot of vitamin
(Mel picks up a large sandwich) Daddy, no
Daddy, no
You know you can't have that
Cher, c'mon
Don't be silly
know it sounds mental, but sometimes  have more fun vegging out than when  go partying
Maybe because my party clothes are so binding
Look, 'm just curious
How many hours a day do you spend grooming yourself
Some people are not lucky enough to be as naturally adorable as you are
Stop it, you're making me blush
(Phone rings
Cher answers) Hello
Hi Cher, how are you
Hi, Gail
Is my son there, cleaning out your refridgerator
(Josh motions a "No" to Cher) No, no, he's not here
You should try the dorms
Alright, bye, hon
Bye-bye
(Cher hangs up the phone) What was that all about
She wants me to come home for spring break
So, what's the big deal
Nobody will be in school
Yeah, but husband number four's at home and his whole idea of acting like a family is to criticize me
So, what
You're just going to roam around campus for two weeks all by yourself
don't mind
That is stupid
Why don't you just come here, you can have your old room, and there are going to be some great parties
don't know
Why not
You got your whole social world going on,  don't want to get in the way
you won't be in the way
How much fun would it be having a brother-type tagging along
Josh, you are not my brother
You know what  mean
'mon, you need some excitement in your life
It'll replenish you for your finals
Good
can't believe 'm taking advice from someone who watches cartoons
That's Ren and Stimpy
They're way existential
Do you have any idea what you're talking about
No, why
Do  sound like  do
- ' (Theme from "2001: Space Odyssey" is playing while camera is focused on phone
The phone rings) Christian said he'd call the next day, but in boy time, that meant Thursday
So, you can imagine my astonishment to hear from him while  was packing Daddy up
Hello
" Believe 'm You" Gail Orange He said he'd come over with some video tapes and we'd watch them
night alone with Christian
sent for reinforcements
Then, Dee and  had to design a lighting concept, and costume decisions
don't rely on mirrors, so  always take polaroids
Whenever a boy comes, you should always have something baking
Oh, 'm still all red
Well, 'm trying to make you as white as  can, Cher
Look, you're all flushed
You have to calm down
Calm
You know,  am so glad  never did it with someone  had lukewarm feelings for
Christian is brutally hot, and  am going to remember tonight forever
Blot
(Later) (The door bell rings
Cher opens the door) Hi
Hi
Is something burning
Oh, my God
(Cher runs to the kitchen
The bake was fried) Oh, honey, you baked
tried
'mon, show me the rest of your pad
(Cher and Christian are outside among Mel's art collection) Your father has a well-rounded collection
Daddy says it's a good investment
He's absolutely right
Klaus Oldenberg
Oh, he's way famous
(Christian approaches a different sculpture) This is older, see
Transitional
very important piece
Um, do you want to go swimming
Hmmm, let's watch the movies
Oh,
(Scene moves to Christian and Cher lying on bed watching "Spartacus") Christian had a thing for Tony Curtis, so he brought over "Some Like It Hot" and "Sparaticus"
(Cher starts rubbing her feet up against Christian's legs
Christian doesn't enjoy it) My feet are cold
(Christian puts a pillow over Cher's feet) Thanks
Oh, watch this part, this is good
(Cher falls off the bed while trying to look sexy
Too funny
) Are you
'm fine
Do you want some, something to drink
You know,  could get you some wine
No
You notice how wine makes people wanna feel, like sexy
That's
'm actually getting tired
But, um,  could make you some coffee if you'd like
Oh, no thanks
Got the ulcer
But you had all those cappucinos before
Oh
Well, you know, that was, like
foam
(They move to the front door) You're great
We're friends, right
(Cher nods) Knock me a little kiss
(Cher kisses him on the cheek) 'll see ya
(Christian leaves) don't get it
Did my hair get flat
Did  stumble into some bad lighting
What's wrong with me
(
) - ' Nothing
Maybe he really was tired
suppose it wasn't meant to be,  mean, he does dress better than  do
What would  bring to the relationship
Get back into the right lane
What's the first thing you do
First thing  do is,  put on my blinker
(Dionne accidently turns the wipers on) Oh, wait, shit
Watch the road, watch the road
Alright
Stop
Then,  look in my mirror
, then  glance at my blind spot
Glance with your head, not the whole car
swear to God,  swear to God, Woman, you can't drive for shit
'm not trying to hear that
Hear me
Actually, going all the way is like a really big decision
can't believe  was so caprecious about it
Dee,  almost had sex with him
You almost had sex with who
Christian
(Murray cracks up) What
Yo, look
Are you bitches blind or something
Your man, Christian is a cake-boy
& what
He's a disco-dancing, Oscar Wilde-reading, Streissand ticket-holding friend of Dorothy, know what 'm saying
Uh-uh
no way
He's gay
Not even
Yes, even
He does like to shop, Cher, and the boy can dress
Oh, my God
am totally buggin'
feel like such a bonehead
What the hell
Yo, you're getting on the freeway
What
Yo, turn right
Get out of the lane
Don't go
Forget procedure, just get out of the lane
(Both Cher and Dionne scream) Truck, truck, truck, truck
Ahhh
(screaming) You're on the freeway
What do  do, Murray
Go straight, go straight, go straight
Just relax and drive, baby
Just relax and drive
(An old lady gives them the finger) (screaming) Shut up
Shut up
(Lots of screams from everybody) Whatever you do, keep your hands on the wheel, at all times
( huge truck closes in on them
Murray sees it) Aaahhhhh
( lot more screaming from the three) Turn to the right
Oh, there it is
Alright, we're off
Damn, you did wonderful
Sorry, baby
You did it, Dee
Relax, relax, relax, relax, honey, relax
Baby, relax, relax
Breathe, breathe, breath in, breathe
Let it out
Breathe, breathe, breathe, honey, breathe, breath
Relax, relax
Boy, getting off the freeway makes you realize how important love is
After that, Dionne's virginity went from technical to non-exisistant
realized how much  wanted a boyfriend of my own
- Not that Christian wasn't a blast to hang out with
He was becoming one of my favourite shopping partners
Um, where's Tai
Oh, she met some random guys at the Foot Locker and escorted them right over there
(in distance) Oh, my God
Did you see
don't know where she meets these Barnies
have a question, alright
What
The jacket
Is it James Dean or Jason Priestly
Carpe' diem
, you looked hot in it
Really
(with the barnies) If  fall, would you guys catch me
Could we please be more
generic
(Tai screams) Stop it
Please
Bring me back up, please
Bring me back up
(Tai screams a little more, then Christian rescues her) Thank you
You asshole
#1 Hey, man
We're just joking
Oh, really
Someone could get killed
(Tai runs over and hugs Cher) Cher, you don't understand
was just sitting there and  was just talking to those guys, and then, all of a sudden, we were laughing, and
Hey, are you
Yeah
Are you sure
'm fine
Yeah, uh-huh
Let's get you home for some &, huh
What's that
(Christian laughs) Boy, considering how clueless she was, Tai certainly had that "damsel in distress" act down
- Meanwhile, back at school, everyone was talking about Tai's "brush with death" at the mall
Was it, like a montage of all the scenes in your life
Not exactly a montage
Hey, Cher
Is it true some gang members, like tried to shoot Tai in the mall
No
That is what everyone is saying
Whatever
When  was nine,  fell off the jungle gym, that's when  saw this light, you know
Wait, wait
Move down for Cher
Hi
Tell me more, tell me more
Where was
You were thinking about was really important
Oh, right, right
Right before you die, your mind just sort of gets very clear
It's a very intense, spiritual thing
Well,  know when  was held at gun-point
Excuse me
(to Tai) You were saying
It's spiritual
don't know, can't,  can't pinpoint the spirituality out for you, you know, if you've never experienced anything
- ' But now  don't know how to act around him
mean, ordinarily  would strut around in my cutest little outfits and send myself flowers and candy, but  couldn't do that stuff with Josh
(Cher and Josh are in the lounge watching
) What's with you
What do you mean
You're so quiet
You haven't made me watch the real world
care about the news
Since when
Since now
(
shows scenes from Bosnia) You look confused
Well, uh,  thought they declared peace in the Middle East
(Scene changes to Mel's Den with Cher walking past the door in her pyjamas) Cher, get in here
What's up Daddy
What are you doing, dancing infront of my office
Nothing,  just wanted to see if you needed any help with anything
Yeah, you caould help me with something
Come over here
Every time that you see a telephone conversation that took place on September third, highlight it
just September third
Fun, huh
(laughing) Yeah
Daddy, did you ever have a problem that you couldn't argue your way out of
Tell me the problem, and we'll figure out how to argue it
like this boy
Yes
And he likes someone else
How could that be
don't know, but  feel wretched
Well, obviously this boy is a complete moron
You are the most beautiful girl in Beverly Hills
And to tell you the truth, 'm not sure  want you with a stupid fella like that
Well, actually he is a smart guy and, you know he's one of those do-gooder types, and now  feel like all my after-school commitments are just not good enough
How can you say that
Who takes care of everyone in this household
Who makes sure that Daddy eats right
To tell you the truth,  have not seen such good-doing sice your mother
Really
Really
Now get back to work
- Later, while we were learning about the Pismo Beach diaster,  decided  needed a complete make-over, except this time 'd make-over my soul
But what makes someone a better person
And then  realised, all my friends were really good in different ways
Like, Christian, he always wants things to be beautiful and interesting
Or Dionne and Murray, when they think no one is watching, are so considerate of each other
And poor Miss Giest, always trying to get us involved, no matter how much we resist
Oh, it's just, that doesn't even show
you know, every single possesion, every memory, everything you had your whole life
gone in a second
Can you imagine what that must feel like
(Elton raises his hand) Elton
Can  use the Pass
Yeah
We'll be collecting blankets, disposable diapers, canned goods
(Cher raises her hand) Miss Giest
Cher
wanna help
That would be wonderful
felt better already
(Back at Cher's house) Daddy
What
You didn't like that red caviar, did you
What's she talking about
(Cher starts dragging a heap of stuff to the front door) Cher, what are you doing
'm captain of the Pismo Beach disaster relief
don't think they need your skis
Daddy, some people lost all their belongings, don't you think that includes athletic equipment
This is your influence, Josh
(Scene changes to sign-on stall at school) "Shake Some Action" Cracker Hey, c'mere
Sign up, it's going to be really fun
(Scene cahnges to indoors) No, you know what
Can you please take it to bedding
Yes, thank you very much
Oh, Miss Giest, Miss Giest
Yes, dear
need more boxes, they're all filled up
Already
Great
divided them into entres and apetisers
Oh, , 'll have them picked up
Hey
Proper
This is really decent of you Travis
Sure
(Cher picks up a Bong from Travis' box
) wasn't sure about that don't need it anymore, but far be it from me to deny anyone else, you know

You know exactly what 'm talking about
