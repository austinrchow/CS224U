: "1983" young boy,  , rushes out -- excited but pouty and a little peeved
He glowers at a 1981 Mercury, parked at the curb -- then turns back toward the house
(calls back to house) Daddy
don't want you to go
emerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace sport coat with a black vest underneath, carrying some kind of case in his hand
He looks great -- a man of action, not dandified at all by the snappy attire
He squints down toward Sonny, proudly -- very much the family man
Mason's pretty wife, , appears in the doorway
(calls to Sonny) Your father has work to do, Sonny but he'll be home soon
And we'll all watch it together
You promise, Dad

Storm and Felicia come down to car, his arm around her
Sonny grabs his father's shirtsleeve
Daddy

Don't worry

He kisses Felicia, ready to leave
Daddy (wants him to stay) What about my joke
Storm lifts Sonny up into his arms
He gives the boy 100% of his attention, speaks just for him
Knock knock
Who's there
Old lady
Old lady who

Sonny may not get the joke, but he laughs delightedly -- just because it's his dad telling it
Storm kisses him and sets him down

Calabrese becomes aware of Mikey checking out the noise; he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals Mikey to proceed

But Storm isn't there
Mikey is about to check farther, when out of nowhere: Storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face
The blow is so devastating it knocks Mikey's feet out from under him so that he topples face-forward into Storm's arms, out cold
Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to the ground
Storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut
Kneeling down to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his injury -- one of Mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his fingers
Storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the big guy's hand
(re: the fairy) quarter's a quarter

Mikey
Quit playing with yourself back there

Calabrese and Vitale start this way -- bolts back up the wharf, toward his car

They see Storm 50 yards back up the pier, fleeing
Vitale takes off after him at a dead run

He gestures to the register
Take it, man
Take my life's savings
He scoops bills from the cash drawer (about twenty bucks) shoves them to the Shotgun Punk
The Punk scowls -- Where is a cop when you goddam need one

The Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him, but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly spins between the Punks and behind the gun
The    and  away part of the back  -- -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's arm
The others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun and is using it as a sword or staff
He looks like a true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation
These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in his spontaneous orchestra
Punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife
Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot- sweep the Punk
The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head slams against the floor
As soon as he hits, the shotgun is slammed through his teeth
The last Punk has produced an icepick and is staring at his compadres in disbelief
He and Storm square off
(to Punk, calmly) know what you're thinking have this big shotgun and all   you have is that little icepick
Mine's bigger than yours
It's not    fair
Storm sets the gun down
Punk #3 is still frozen
Still not fair
Storm gets down on his knees
Don't wait for the blindfold, maricon
#3 (clutching the ice pick tightly) Chinga tu madre
The Punk lungs, thrusting the ice pick with lightning speed at Storm's face
Storm makes a slight movement, parries the thrust and slides his body behind the Punk, simultaneously slamming his forearm into the rear knee joint
The Punk buckles and Storm now has one of his legs in both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee

She plainly loves him deeply -- and is held and excited by his contradictions
They come closer together, clinking their glasses, sipping

Storm begins to kiss them, she moans with pleasure
The lovemaking increases in intensity, Felicia's hand groping to open Storm's pants

He takes it in the right center mass
It looks like his right arm is torn off as his
45 is literally blown across the room
Felicia is now hysterically screaming -- but not for long -- as she is mortally wounded
We are sure Storm will collapse and this horror will be over, but Storm rushes the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as he enters, he avoids one more ferocious
The momentum of Storm's quick spin catches the assailant perfectly, and like a fast spinning top slammed against another, Storm has the puppet by the strings
He clamps down with his left and only good hand on the assailant's right hand, and uses it against the gun as a tool for more torque
Spinning him around until he is at the peak of his circle, Storm with all his might spins his whole body in the opposite direction quickly, using the whipping effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailant's wrist and flip him violently
There is a   and   scream as he lands on his head and neck, and then -- from   the side, point-blank --another ferocious   --   Storm is blown into the air and back onto the bed from   which he came

Ford tries to hand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseball and the cue is a bat
This doesn't work very well, as Storm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, using his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the pool table
We hear Ford's   and he goes down
Almost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashes toward Storm's head
This time Storm has his own tool -- and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect with his head
He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the at the same time the cue splinters in half
Storm is left with the jagged tip of the skinny end
Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table
Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's midsection

Storm turns back from the water surface, to his son and to the woman he loves
He sits (letting the boat drift wherever it wants to) and tugs Andy down beside him
Then he reaches across to his son, pulls the boy to him with a playful headlock
For a moment both Andy and Sonny are held in suspension, wondering what Storm will do or say
Finally: (to Sonny) Knock, knock
For a beat, the boy is taken aback
Then he break's into a broad smile
Who's there
Storm glances to Andy, pulling her tighter to him

Boo
Boo who
You don't have to cry about it
(a beat, then) love you both
Storm hugs his son with great affection, pulling Andy to him with his other arm
This is their beginning
drifts its happy way across the sun-shimmering sea
