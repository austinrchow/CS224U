They mattered to everyone
Except Jamie Sullivan

Clay's by the dumpster

Clay turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school, coast clear
He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as the Camaro pulls up
Eric pushes a door open
Empties fall from the back seat
Clay climbs in

Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror

: (mocking) Kelly
He looks like his face caught fire and he tried to put it out with a fork
Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing Kelly
He couldn't find his own butt with both hands at high noon in a hall of mirrors
Sniggering laughter
Go
Landon presses the gas
The   away
Kelly's so old he -- We're done with that already, bonehead
Clay smiles, good-natured
He often misses social cues
- Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the road
Another car runs it over
Mr
Kelly walks over, picks up the vest
Shakes it
Frustrated
Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster

Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed
Under the , a   scanner  quietly

: (
) So which is it
Eric finishes taking a leak
(calling over, repeating) Landon
To save your life, you have to either go deaf or go numb in your dick and balls
Eric climbs back in the car
Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric
'm thinking
No thinking
The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide -- Could  lose one ear and one nut
No questions, no negotiating -- (to Eric, annoyed) Where do you get these stupid questions --
Hypotheticals -- (to Belinda) 'm just wondering -- Don't wonder
Landon's looking out at the night
() 7
: Jamie Sullivan
Everyone looks up
Derisive laughter
pale, contemplative , 17, is jumping down off the gate, caught in the headlights
Wearing clothes she probably made herself; long hair hiding her face
She lives in her mind, not her body
Brain
Bible freak
Cherry
(), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and approaches Landon's window, her   in the She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her chest
(to Landon, tentative) Hey
Hi
Your lights
Any chance you could
turn them off -- (leaning over Landon) God give you this road
No -- Then we'll be keeping the lights on
() 8
: (to Jamie, seeming nice) If you want the lights off, 'll turn them off
And he does
Darkness
Thank you
Thank you so very much
She backs away from the car, grateful
From the car: (
) can't see a friggin' thing
Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda
(imitating Jamie) 'Thank you
Thank you so very much
' But Landon's looking at Jamie
Almost counting the seconds
Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it
Landon quickly flicks the high beams
Belinda, Eric, and Clay snicker and snort as they see -- Jamie, startled, paused at the top
But instead of looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even
moment later, she jumps down on the far side
Disappears
Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing
Landon's smiling
() 9
: Ten years
Where're you gonna be
(to Belinda, mocking) Hypothetically
Paris
Dead
Laughter
Right here
With you
He clinks Eric's raised beer
More laughter
But Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where he'd really like to be
'Twilight Zone
' 'One Step Beyond
' 'Tales from the Dark Side
' 'Twilight Zone,' dipshit
Don't call him a dipshit
You do -- And you don't
(beat, re: Jamie) What's she doing in there
Nothing 'd be doing
Laughter
Landon kisses her
With tongue
blinding white light dances through the car and settles on Landon and Belinda's faces
Shit
He scrambles out of the car
Landon looks up at the fence

' Jamie sitting atop, holding a large mirror, reflecting the headlights back into the car
They stare at each other
His annoyance turns to mild respect

Landon leaps in
Pops out the Van Halen
The address
York Ave
Landon pops in a
tape
it
"Freedom
" What number
Nobody answers
Dildoes
Landon turns the car around
The Camaro fishtails away
, red taillights bouncing on the rough road
The car turns left onto the paved road and speeds out of sight
Landon drives recklessly
Rushing
He makes a turn
'  - Two fire trucks rumbling by houses,
11
Turns right, following the fire trucks
Landon smiles at Belinda
She smiles back
Fun
Landon takes a slug of beer
Turns his eyes back to the road
'  - make another turn
Then a flash of light, movement figure on the road
An old man walking his little dog
Crossing the street
- turns the wheel hard
Jams his foot on the brake
The Camaro swerves
, - The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt
The   into a light pole
Quiet
Landon, Eric and Clay are banged up
Christ, man
You okay
Yeah
Belinda's head leans on the dash
Her shoulders shake
Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over
Scared
Belinda
() 12
: She lifts her head
Looks at him
She's laughing
He kicks his door out
The Camaro crumpled into the light pole
Headlights askew
Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed
Landon runs to the old man
Kneels
Shakes him
No response
The man's   at Landon

, growing
- battered Chevette steers through a working-class neighborhood
Landon's mother, , 35, drives
She's weary with sun-worn skin, but still attractive
She wears a skimpy black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat
What if they expel you
Kelly wouldn't do that
Why not
Cuz nothing happened at school
He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile
Don't smile at me
It's not going to get you out of this
Why not
It always has before

-  (7:59 ) By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure
'  - 8:05 Mr
Kelly gestures for Landon to sit
Landon doesn't
His forehead still shows a bruise
had hopes for you
Like 'd grow up to be president, another Reagan
(not laughing) Like you'd make it to June
Even cutting half your classes, you have a - average
'm no dummy
That's right
You just act like one
On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out of the Camaro
Those aren't mine
They came from your car
wasn't the one drinking
Kelly holds up the police test finding
Your blood alcohol level
Maybe you were legally in the clear, but make the rules here
Landon scowls, knows he's defeated
You expelling me
am
() 14
: Now  can do what  want
That's right
(sarcastic) The world is your oyster
- Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous political prisoner
Freedom
He struts through the courtyard
Not a care in the world
- Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro neighbor kid, , 12, watches from across the street, on his way to school
- Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath, the body, the paint
discouraging mess
-  - Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door
Mom
need a ride
' Dark
She wears a black eye-shield
Her waitress uniform hangs over a chair
(sleepy, annoyed) 'm not getting up to drive you somewhere
(beat) What're you doing home
- Landon lifts the garage
15
'  - murky place
Filled with old tools and junk and a grim old bike
- -    - Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his bike
No way to carry
He looks around
The bus stop
bus approaching
- , ,
Landon's working hard playing  ' "Alive and Kicking
" '  -  ' and worn terry slippers appear
(
) want to talk to you
He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out
The mangled front bumper's on the ground
Cynthia stands there in her bathrobe
Upset
Landon's almost too much
You're not hanging round here all day
'm not hanging
'm fixing my car -- You don't need a car you can't drive for a month
Go see Marvin
'Bout what
About a job
Landon ignores her
Slides back under his car
16
(
) He's going to try you as assistant manager
(beat) You could be manager someday
Landon can't believe this
Landon slides back out
'm not working there
Cynthia sets her jaw
He knows that look
-  - Landon is sweating, scouring pots
crooked cap on his head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt
He's making some headway; only two more to wash
, the owner, walks over
Beer belly, greasy hair
Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's sink
Landon glimpses his future
'   - Landon paces, jumpy
Kelly's secretary,  , quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer
Who's he in with
He'll be with you when he's available
The door to Kelly's office opens
Jamie Sullivan exits with her father, the tall stern
Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by
(joking) You expelled, too
Nobody laughs or even smiles
17
'  - Mr
Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr
Carter
want to come back
(looking up, surprised) Back
Were you ever really here
They both know Kelly has the upper hand
Kelly leans back in his chair, relishing it
(mumbling) want to graduate
Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own way
(thinking aloud) You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community -- (relieved) 'd do that -- How would you do that, Mr
Carter
Landon shrugs, clueless
(smiling) Shall  give you a few ideas
(smiling, too) Please
Besides attending all your regular classes, 'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school -- () 18
: For pay
For the inner satisfaction it will bring
(beat) Saturday mornings, 'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school -- (joking) 'm as underprivileged as they are -- The fact that you attend this school makes you privileged
His tone quiets Landon
Finally, 'd like you to join the drama club
Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings
(grumbling) 'd work backstage or something
Or something
They're doing a play for the holidays
When do  get time for me
You don't
That's the point
Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this
As he heads for the door: (softer, trying to reach him) Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself
(beat) Some of us remember how your father -- Then you remember more than  do

pushing gum wrappers under a radiator
- Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open house
dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits
Students wander in, listen, look
(answering question) -- Saturn's 15 degrees to the right of red Antares and much brighter
To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made from a wire coat hanger
This is a very simple device made from a coat hanger, plastic wrap and typewriter correction fluid
Does anyone know what it is
No one does
(barely audible) star frame
But Jamie hears
She regards him a moment, then keeps going
This is a star frame
Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at Jamie
star frame will help you locate stars and planets with your naked eye -- (scoffing, setting her up) -- Did God create the sun
() 20
: (taking him seriously) Yes, God created the universe and all its physical laws
Even Einstein said it's a miracle that our world is comprehensible -- -- If God can do all that, why can't he get you a new sweater
Landon laughs loudly
Members of the club look at him
That was a joke
Laugh
Jamie smiles
She can laugh at herself
And she finds Landon funny
- Landon washes up while his mother sets the table
The in the b
g
Your father dropped off an extra check
don't want his money
It could help with a new car -- --  like the car  have
He picks up the envelope with wet hands
Without looking inside, rips it in half
Cynthia smiles, quietly happy
-  - Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing "Karma Chameleon
" Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading, not singing
She turns around to look at Landon
He rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a Sony Walkman, glum
To
' "Sleeping Bag
" Out the window -- Jefferson High School coming into view
Bars on every window, chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass
21
-  - big room with tables and chairs but few books
Pairs of heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks
Landon sits with , a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity
geometry text between them
(reading) -- 'So what is the measure of angle x if  and  are similar triangles
' Luis is lost, intimidated
Know what 'similar' means
Luis shrugs
Luis looks down at the book as if for the answer, then at Landon, hopeless
He gets up and walks off
Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie studying him
She's at a nearby table with her student, - The    behind Landon as he hops aboard
He's late and heads for the rear bench seat
' Jamie sitting there
And no vacant seats save next to her
The bus begins to roll
Landon lurches forward
- The bus is moving through Beaufort
Landon sits next to Jamie
Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman
His body turned away
She's reading her book
You going to visit Harold
Landon scowls
What-who is she talking about
() 22
: They let him out of the hospital yesterday
He's in a rest home on Oak Street
That old man
He goes to my father's church
He could've died -- -- This your idea of small talk
don't make small talk -- -- Obviously
just wanted to tell you not to give up
Sometimes you've got to back into the teaching from somewhere else
If he heard her, he makes no sign
She goes back to her book
long beat, then: What makes you volunteer
(pause) Want to know why  tutor reading
Not really
Because, growing up, books were my world
(mean) Were
You don't know me
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair
What's more to know --
() 23
: --  wear the sweater because 'm cold
read because no one talks to me
My hair is my hair
What is it exactly that's bothering you
You don't care what people say
You mean care what you say
'm worrying about other things
Like what
The moons of Jupiter
Can't you have a normal conversation
don't want to have any conversation
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person
She reads again
The bus pulls to a stop in front of Beaufort High
Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting, leaning on her Cabriolet
Jamie watches Landon exit the bus
'  - Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her
- Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club
' big space with a stage
stands before six geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie
24
Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these places
Ms
Garber looks up from her papers
We're waiting, Mr
Carter
He slides in a row behind the others
Leans forward and pokes a boy,
Eddie's pimply and talks with his eyes squinched up
What's the play
Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker
The-the-there's this drought an' -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy comes and says he can m-make rain -- -- And the ugly farmer's daughter falls for him
saw the movie
Yeah
It's really g-g-good -- -- It blows
- Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from scripts
Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is
(as Starbuck) ' hope your dreams come true
' (as Lizzie, sad) 'They won't
' (as Starbuck) 'Believe in yourself and they will
Let me ask you, Lizzie
Look in the mirror
Are you pretty --
' () 25
: -- Landon, are you trying to be bad at this
No, it just comes naturally
Jamie smiles
Garber taps her script -- continue
(as Starbuck) 'It's got to be inside you
Then one day the mirror will be the eyes of the man who loves you
You'll look in that mirror and you'll be more than pretty
You'll be beautiful
' Ms
Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going
(as Starbuck) 'Look at me
Tell me what you see
' As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes
(as Lizzie) 'Is it really me
' (as Starbuck, hamming) 'Yes
You're-you're b-b- beautiful
' Hoots and laughter
Jamie looks away, humiliated
Quiet
(announcing) Landon will play the role of Bill Starbuck
Groans among the boys
Jamie is horrified
So is Landon
(to Garber) No way
No thanks
can't do it -- () 26
: (
) (offstage) -- You can and you will, Mr
Carter
Kelly's been standing in the wings
(warning) With all the sincerity and dignity you can muster
Everyone stares at Landon
He's trapped
- Raining
Landon exits behind all the others
Stands under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for a ride
Jamie approaches, something on her mind
(rude) You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere -- -- This play means a lot to me
(snorting) This play --
--  know you don't suck at acting
Landon laughs
Refusing to take her seriously
Behind him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night
But you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and dweebies like doing theater -- -- What are you going on about
Pause
can judge too
() 27
: He exhales, eyeing her, daring her
You don't care about classes or graduating
But you like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again
That's deep -- -- Your act only works with an audience
My act
She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac
The last car in the parking lot
Fire trucks rush by on the street below
Landon's ears twitch
He looks about
No one, no ride
He sees the Pontiac backing out of a parking spot
- Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past
ride
Please
Jamie turns to look at him
' Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading
(insincere) We can talk about your helping me with my lines
-  - Jamie's at the wheel
() 28
: know you don't want help
Then we both know
(beat) 'll point
You drive
Faster
He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks
The wet road glistens
We're following fire trucks
Yeah
Why
(duh) Because that's where the fire is
He fishes in his pocket for a tape
Pulls one out
He's searching the dash -- no cassette player
Fire is like a living thing
Wild
Unpredictable
Like me
No
Not like you
She jerks the car across the center lane
Driving on the wrong side of the road
He grips the dash
What the --
So you agree you need help
'  - Headlights looming, a car coming
Closer and closer
29
Yes
She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane
Smiling
car zips by in the other direction,
Really
Landon drops his attitude, his act
He toys with the glove compartment knob
Yeah
Kelly'll make me leave school if  screw up the play
(to herself) 28 and 42
Pause
He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested
What's with the friggin numbers
28 is do something illegal
42 is befriend an enemy
'm an enemy
Kinda
Yeah
- Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire and the firemen
Landon is just tolerating her
The reason  got the part
'm a little like Lizzie
Except don't worry about some man rescuing me
Good thing
If she's offended, she keeps it to herself
() 30
: You got some kind of list
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know
Maybe a little of both
They both smile
'll take a chance
Go for it
It's like a to-do list, but for my life
He smirks
If you can't imagine the future, you won't have one
He lights a cigarette
She reaches for it
(joking) Having a cigarette
100
She grins and takes a drag
They share the cigarette
So what else is on this list
It's private
(cajoling) You want to tell me
She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing her dreams with him
(guessing, rudely) Get very wasted
Lose your virginity -- () 31
: (correcting) Spend a year in the Peace Corps
Make a medical discovery -- (contemptuous) Ambitious
Being negative's a lot more work than being positive
Like you'd know
do know
(pause) Be two places at once
learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel
eat breakfast with chopsticks
He likes the frivolity of these
What's
Number one
She looks away, embarrassed
(changing subject) If you want help with your lines, have two conditions
(smiling) You have to promise not to fall in love with me
He's certain she's joking
No problem -- And you have to meet my father
He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this
Fathers love me
32
swinging open
Reverend Sullivan looming tall
Ichabod Crane in a collar
-  - Landon gives a cheery little wave
He's very sweaty
His bike teeters on its kickstand in the b
g
Hey
Landon Carter
Landon offers his hand
The Reverend shakes reluctantly, eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans, dirty t-shirt, aloof manner
(surprised) You're in the play
Lead man
Jamie slides out the door
She looks good in jeans and a white t-shirt
Almost normal
In the b
g
, Landon's over
He bounds down the porch steps
(explaining bike) They took my license for 30 days
But nobody's pressing charges
The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned
Landon tries the kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed bush
Not the best place
'll get something for us to drink -- Don't bother
But she's already gone
The Reverend gestures toward the open front door
- Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade
Landon pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie with her parents
He looks up, aware that the Reverend is studying him closely
() 33
: You know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off
But if ants disappeared, that would be catastrophic
The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence
(confidence flagging) Apropos of nothing
so
So so so so -- Let's get something straight
You don't know me
don't know you
But  know what you're about
(beat) Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie
His eyes lock with Landon's
His message clear and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all cheerful
miss anything
-  - Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy
Her father comes in
The Carter boy
Tell me about him
He wants help with his lines -- He was driving the car that hit Harold Keene -- By accident -- Jamie, he's careless
Reckless
(beat) Is this really the best time to be making a new friend
() 34
: 'm supposed to always be alone
don't want you to see him outside school activities
Fine
But  need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life
Pause
(gentler) 'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman
Dad, 've become a woman without her
Just not a pretty one
'  - Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt
Jamie peers into her father's room
He's sleeping
She tiptoes to the staircase and down
Sneaking out
- Landon is waiting when Jamie appears
He has scripts in his back pocket
They smile at each other, laugh
(re: her father) know
Don't say anything
He's a softy
Got him wrapped around my finger
You think so
Know so
() 35
: She grins, skeptical
This way
Jamie leads Landon toward the cemetery rear gate
People think 'm strange, don't they
(smiling) Yes
Because  try to be nice to people
Yeah
Maybe
dunno
Do you think 'm strange
Pause
Landon's caught off-guard by her frankness
Yeah
But that can be good
-   - Jamie quickly scales the fence
Landon's right after her
Why are we here
Jamie drops down
Takes a flashlight from her bag
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world
(on top of gate) The world of the dead
() 36
: (being mysterious) Could be
He drops down, not sure what she means
She's already walking away
He follows
My mother's buried near here
My father's alive but it's like he's dead
She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a storage shed
Opens the door
Enters
Returns a moment later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made cylindrical device
What is that
(proud) That is my telescope
- The ten-inch Dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky
The eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope rests on a plywood base
Landon looks through the eye- piece
( ) - a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat ring system
(impressed) Saturn
Beautiful
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings -- But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice -- () 37
: Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart
Or building blocks for a world that never formed
She looks at him
He smiles, embarrassed
'm not smart
Just a sponge
She smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope and changes its view
Sometimes  come here and just scan the heavens
(joking) Looking for intelligent life
Looking for something -- someone
Pause
He doesn't know what to say
Do you believe you'll see your mother again
hope so
(beat) think maybe she sees me now
Their eyes meet
She looks away
Changes the subject
(re: telescope) 'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet -- The dirty snowball at its core
Yeah
(beat) 'm probably not going to be around next time it comes
() 38

You're really into God, right
In ten words or less
Yeah
My relationship with God is my own
But you think about Him -- It -- Her
Don't you
Not really
Pause
When you do, how do you
Landon could joke or he could reveal something
Like in a church painting
see this giant hovering over the ground
He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do
No

There is no point
You live
You die
The end
Maybe we're not supposed to understand, but we're supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture
You have to believe to have faith
You don't believe in anything
The Bible
Why should  read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles
Interpreted by another guy like my father
Your father doesn't like me
Pause
He doesn't trust you
Sometimes  don't even trust me

He holds one out to her

She wants to jump Landon's bones
That is so pitiful
She's very confused
Deluded
Deranged

: Demented
She's coming over here
Heart be still
They laugh more and she's there
(to Landon) Hi
He doesn't respond
She shifts from foot to foot
Confused
The play's going to be really good
(mocking her) 'm really glad you think so
His friends snicker and guffaw
She looks at them, then back to Landon
guess you don't want to practice lines tonight
You guessed right
She gives him a funny look and walks away
better person than he and he knows it
That's one girl who can't take a hint
Because she doesn't know what a hint is
They laugh
Landon the loudest
It feels good, but he also feels a little
bad

She's standing in the front yard
You're not in a very good mood
You don't miss a thing
He steps down off the porch
The play's in a couple of weeks
Yes
And
() 43
: was hoping we could run lines together
Oh
Just not at school
Yeah -- Or anywhere where people might see us
Belinda's a very jealous person
That would be the reason
Pause
He thinks she might be going for this
So it's like you want to be secret friends
That's it
Exactly
You're reading my mind -- Then maybe you can read mine
She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and opens it
Before she goes in: thought  saw something in you, something good
But  was wrong
- Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost crying
In the living room, her father looks up from his reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out, glowers

Landon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage
Why do you have to be so weird
The front door opens, startling Landon
It's the Reverend
Red-faced with fury
Landon glares back, but then climbs in his car and drives off
Ashamed

Her father doesn't look up from his reading
The first time  met him  knew
'm proud of how you're handling yourself
Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and heartbreak
She leaves before her father can see her distress

Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket
You, me, and the basket
We're the three corners of a triangle
Take one step in
Landon and Luis both step forward
Am  at the same angle to you and the basket as before
Yeah
Are you
Yeah
So what did we just make
similar triangle
What else
What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths
Scalene
Okay
Make me an isosceles
Luis steps outward, directly opposite Landon
Yes
Two sides the same
Landon tosses him the ball
They play
Jamie glances over from a picnic table where she works with her student, Isabel
Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks back
Thoughtful
Watching her
But not staring

Landon can't take his eyes off her

Her eyes shining, radiating, looking directly at him
Landon is dumbstruck

Mutant ideas

Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real
It was

Her hair pulled back
She looks good in a simple, fresh way
You weren't in school yesterday
went to the doctor with my father
He okay
Healthy as can be

She doesn't help him
She opens her locker, gets what she needs
You were great the other night
Thank you
So were you

He tries to touch her hair
She ducks
haven't been nice to you

Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table
Landon
Later
Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits
Making a public statement
People can see
And that would ruin your reputation how
She goes back to her book
Ignoring him
(re: her book) What's that
She doesn't look up
Shows him the spine:     The Scarlet Letter
'm reading all the novels on Mr
Rothberg's best American authors list
How many books are there
() 53
: (annoyed) hundred
Then there's his classics list
And his European list
Landon realizes this is why she's always reading
That on your 'Life List
'    To read all those books
She doesn't deny it
He just dives in
Jamie
Maybe  want to try being positive
She looks up
Examines his face for the truth
Maybe  miss doing that dumb play with you
Students seated near them have overheard
Whisper
Maybe you inspire me
That sounds like horseshit
Which part
All of it
It's not
Prove it
She picks up her books and tray
Everyone is watching

- Landon follows Jamie out of the building
Catches up
() 54
: Jamie -- You lack honor
You lack compassion
You lack honesty
You lack humanity
She heads to the old Pontiac
Landon jogs after her
Okay
Maybe some of that is true -- You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend -- don't want to be just your friend -- You don't know what you want -- You don't either
Take a look at yourself
Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you -- And why would that scare me
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God
She gets into her car
Slams the door
the She recognizes the truth
But the real reason you're scared
You like me
She drives off
Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at Landon's spectacle
If you were really my friends, you'd be helping me, not running me down

Legs dangling over
Lighting and dropping matches into the black beyond his feet
His body caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights

Is surprised to find Cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform
Out with Belinda
That's over
Way over

Pause
Dad came to the play
(surprised) You saw him
We talked
He wanted to get a bite -- after
said no
(disbelief) After he moved out,  invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had
He didn't show, not once
He wants to show now

You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to
Landon doesn't answer

Kelly watches from near the trophy case

The book drive is being led by Beaufort High's Jamie Sullivan
Applause
This is new
Landon looks at Jamie, who's smiling
She steps to the microphone
Thank you for buying tickets
We've raised two hundred and eighty-five dollars
More applause
She steps down
Off to one side
(to Luis) About enough to buy maybe five volumes in a set of encyclopedias
Luis smiles
Jamie overhears
It's a start
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade
She smiles
He looks at her
So you're talking to me
When  have something to say
He smiles
What's number one on your list
She shakes her head
() 58
: My number one would be getting out of Beaufort
Getting out won't be your problem
It'll be figuring out what you want when you get somewhere
She walks away
What does that mean
(turning back) It means you can do anything
Landon smiles, not sure why she believes in him

You're fine like that, Mom

Without a word, just a happy smile, Landon hops down the steps toward his car
Reverend Sullivan appears in the doorway

And to all a good night

She's wearing the new sweater
Her father
Enters
What's Landon Carter up to
(innocent) Up to
thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship
Dad, why don't you get to the point where you get to the point
Why is he giving you a gift
Jamie doesn't answer
Did you give him a gift
No
saw the way he looked at you
The way he kissed you
It was a play
(unconvinced) Boys like him have -- expectations
have expectations, too

Christmas is all about the smells
Landon leans the wreath in the window

Pine's my favorite
That and cider with cloves
Landon pulls a Thermos from his coat pocket
Unscrews the cap
Finds a drinking cup
Pours in cider
Offers Harold the cup
Who are you
Landon Carter
was driving the car that -- You
Me
Harold takes the cup, looks Landon over
Landon appears genuinely contrite
'm very sorry -- What kind of a man are you, son
Pause
(honest) don't know that  am -- a man
Yet
'm working on it

: Pause
've worked on it my whole life
Harold reaches under his pillow
Pulls out a small bottle of liquor
Tops off his cider
Get yourself a glass
No
Thanks
Gotta keep my wits for the drive home
Harold nods, liking Landon

Shining in the sun
You can't expect me to pay you for your -- attachment to that car
Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old
don't
expect you to pay me for yours
The Salesman looks from Landon to the car
He pulls a wad of cash from his pocket
Wearily counts out twelve bills
Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then walks away

For books
(suspicious) Where did you get --
(angry) It's mine to give
didn't steal it
didn't say you did
But his tone implied it and Landon's already gone
Kelly is immediately sorry
He goes to his window and sees Landon pedal away on the old bike
- Landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo
When the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk
- Landon faces Jamie
Hey
heard what you did
Thank you
He nods, but quickly changes the subject
(re: the Yugo) She great or what
Why are you doing all this
To impress me
No

Reverend Sullivan
Can  ask you something

: Does it have to do with Jamie
Yes, sir
The Reverend makes a small motion and Landon enters
' Landon doesn't sit
'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve
That won't be possible
He looks back to his papers
End of conversation
'm sorry  haven't always treated Jamie the way --  should have
She deserves better
Reverend Sullivan glances up
As if surprised Landon is still there

family entertainment center
Jamie sees where they are
Before we do this
We're doing something --
Before we do this,  just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list
She waits for more
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously
What are you talking about
That little bit of larceny in your heart

Fun

Pulls the car over

He leaps out, leaving the headlights on

Where -- what -- are we --
He keeps tugging her
She follows him
Laughing
Stand right here
Where
He leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the other
He notices a large bruise on her leg
She brushes her dress down
You're acting like a crazy person
You're straddling the state line
You're in two places at once
She's thrilled at his solution to her wish
He walks to the shoulder of the road

(surprised) You're sometimes not sure
'm sure
Pretty sure
They reach the end of the dock
She turns to face the It blows her hair
She turns his face the same way
It's like the wind
can't see it but  feel it
He closes his eyes
Feeling the wind
Opens them again, rejecting the idea
We can measure wind
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable
What do you actually know with religion
Wonder
Beauty
Joy
(beat, quieter) Love
She's embarrassed
She tries to avoid implying anything
My mother told me God is love, so when you're feeling love, you're feeling God
(beat) think talking about these things -- threatens their very beauty and mystery
Her tone is matter-of-fact, but Landon's got a serious and tender look on his face
He touches her hair
() 73
: (almost a whisper) don't understand
Maybe you're not supposed to
He moves closer
might kiss you
She looks down
Shy
might do it wrong
(tenderly) Not possible
He touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth
Then leans in and kisses her
tender, soft kiss
He pulls away
They look at each other a moment
love you, Jamie
There, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling foolish
Not the old Landon
Jamie looks away
Mixed emotions
Happy and sad
(gently) Now's when you say something
(overwhelmed) can't
(beat) can't -- explain
She turns back to him, her eyes shining
She touches his face and they kiss again, deeply
But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his shoulder
Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof, staring at the water
He pulls away slightly to study her face
He touches her cheek and brings her back from wherever she's been
You make me feel
() 74
: (hopeful) Loved
(smiling) That
And less strange
Tears run down her cheeks
Landon wipes them away with his thumbs, attributing them to happiness

The lights in the living room are on
the windows, they can see her father taking down the Christmas tree
Be very quiet
He pulls her to him
Kisses her

Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over her shoulder
Hey, Reverend
Reverend Sullivan studies the two young people

And he goes
Jamie walks by her father and into the house
Not saying anything
He watches her
What has he allowed

Landon nods to Belinda, others
They glare back

It's been kicked in

Landon kicks in every locker in his row

Jamie watches, a little frightened by his anger
But then he turns to her and grins
Now they all match

Jamie approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful

Landon takes Jamie's hand as the room hushes
Come on
Where
Away from here
( ) -  - Landon leads Jamie up, round and round, to the top of the tall steel tower
76
- They exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook
Jamie's amazed at the view
How do you know this place
Before the divorce
My father used to take me here
Fire spotting was his summer job
They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets sky
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat
(beat) On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds
What would you do up here
Look
Talk
Not talk
He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket
They sit and he starts to shuffle
Not too well
Jamie takes the deck
Shuffles like a card shark
-   -  (  ) Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up
He gets out, walks to her, they kiss
What'd you tell your father
The truth
just left you out of it
She climbs up and over the wall
He follows
- Jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together
When did you build this
() 77
: was twelve
Landon shakes his head, amazed
It's not that complicated
Landon doubts this
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one
Where's the one you're building
In my back yard
(pause, embarrassed) lied before
It's hardly started
But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one -- Wait, back up
You lied
Kinda
Yeah
He grins, loving her even more
So what do you want to see
Mars
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30 -- He opens his backpack
Pulls out the contents
Thermos of hot coffee blanket
Socks
You planned this -- () 78
: Hoped for it
Pause
Are you trying to seduce me
No
Why
Are you seducible
(firm, but smiling) No
That's what  thought
He reaches back into his backpack
Pulls out a second blanket
Ergo, a second blanket
One for me, one for you
He hands her one
She takes it, smiling, reassured
Ergo
(slightly embarrassed) What about your father
'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep
-  '  - Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed
His feet find slippers on the floor
'  - Reverend Sullivan, wearing a robe, enters quietly
Checking on his daughter
Her bed is empty
- The old Pontiac slows
79
Reverend Sullivan looks down the access road to the rear cemetery gate
' The Yugo parked by the gate
The Reverend struggles with what to do
After a moment, he decides not to interfere; he'll pick his moment
He keeps driving
Jamie and Landon are looking at the heavens through the telescope
Where's Pluto
In Virgo, but it's about 1000 times too faint to see
What's the best thing  can see tonight
Me
He draws her close, they kiss
She shyly pulls away
Their hands still touching until she looks again into the telescope eyepiece
The second best thing is Jupiter
She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and steps aside so he can look
But he picks up the flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket
Can you locate XXI5639I
Sure
She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope
() 80
: Here
Why am  looking at this star
Because  had it named for you know it's not an official designation -- She couldn't be happier
She reaches for his hand
It's wonderful
love you
It's the first time he's heard it
He pulls her into his arms
They kiss
Passionately
She starts to object
(respecting her boundaries) Okay
'm stopping
And he does
They snuggle
Silence, then: What's number one
Long pause
(very shy) In April when the dogwoods and wisteria are blooming
Get married
He doesn't make fun
He strokes her hair
Kisses her forehead
- 5 Landon enters from outside
Cynthia, still in her waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking coffee
late night or an early morning
(honest) Late night
(smart-aleck) You
() 81
: Were you with Jamie
Yeah
You sleeping with her
Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer
was cleaning yesterday
found this
She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket
Landon is horrified
She reads it
Scuba dive
Touch a moon rock
Learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs
Go to college
(pause) She talking to you 'bout this stuff
Landon doesn't answer
She puts the list on the table
Smoothes it
Gently discouraging
Honey, some of this is
farfetched
You take after me
People skills and common sense
Good dependable qualities
could take after Dad, too
You do
You're handsome and charming
meant he's a doctor
That's eight years of school and training -- after college
And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being
could do it if  tried
Even Kelly thinks so
() 82
: That'd be something
She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to be practical and realistic
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach
Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment -- (angry now) Whatever my life is, 'm going to be friggin' sure 'm never disappointed -- (honest) Disappointment isn't something anyone plans for
(quieter) It catches you by surprise
Long pause
They are both sorry to have raised their voices
Have  told you how proud  am of you --
Mom, great
But what  want is for me to be proud of me
-    - Landon eats dinner with Jamie and Reverend Sullivan
Silence, then: Landon
You're not the quiet type
No
So talk to us about something
Like what, sir
() 83
: You decide
Landon searches his mind for just the right subject
How about your family
Okay
Sure
(beat) My grandfather
When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand
(pause) Made a big impression on him
Reverend Sullivan looks at his daughter
She's nodding, interested
My cousin Mike
He's from a big family
He's the fifth kid
He heard that every fifth child in the world is Chinese
So he thought he was
Jamie smiles
We didn't tell him any different for years -- (getting to the point) Your parents are divorced
Since  was five
My mom's a cocktail waitress
How do you -- the two of you -- get by
Materially or spiritually
(surprised) Either
Both
() 84
: (honest) don't know
We used to try to believe in each other
His eyes meet the Reverend's
The Reverend's got to respect him some
- Reverend Sullivan looks out the window into the back yard
Jamie showing Landon the junk pile that will become her newer, larger telescope
They are laughing, jostling each other, comfortable, happy
-   - Reverend Sullivan and Jamie put the dishes away
You and the Carter boy
Want to catch me up on recent developments
You're asking if we're involved
'm asking how much
Dad -- It's time to tell him
(pause) It would be the right thing
She turns to him, upset
Her anger spilling out
Maybe
But that's not the real reason
You think if  tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want
Me all to yourself
() 85
: (calm, stung) No
want what's best for you
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me
You're sure
You're sure you can trust him
He's playing to her old insecurities
She's not one hundred percent sure
(gentler) Isn't it better to know
Their eyes meet
She knows he's right
-  ( ) Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Three Amigos
on the marquee
Landon and Jamie exit as Belinda and a new boyfriend buy tickets
Clay and Eric and a crowd behind them
Hey, Belinda
She takes her boyfriend's arm, turns away, snubbing him
Clay, Eric
Eric says something inaudible and the whole crowd sniggers and laughs
He's become Landon
Landon reddens, now realizing for certain that he's become a Jamie Sullivan
( ) - Landon and Jamie walk
The theater in the b
g
(re: his status) From citizen high to citizen low
don't care
() 86
: Care, but just don't let it get to you
It gives them power
That what you do
Yes
try to keep my power
He's impressed with how she manages
One of your secrets
(serious) Yes, one of many
He doesn't notice her tone
-  - 's "How Will  Know
"  the
Jamie flips the
She's got something on her mind
Landon notices only that she seems a bit remote
You're worried about your college applications
'm not applying to college
(stunned) But you said -- No, you assumed
He looks at her, questioning
She's looking out her window
You're going to take a year off
Join the Peace Corps --
No
What are you going to --
() 87
: Pull over
Where
Why
Pull over
Now
Please
Tears are running down her face
He pulls the car over
- Jamie gets out of the car
Landon quickly follows
Jamie -- 'm sick
Then 'll take you home
You'll feel better tomorrow
He tries to take her arm
She shakes off his hand, steps back
Wanting to be heard and understood
Landon
'm sick -- with leukemia
Landon tries to say something
Nothing comes out
His soul numb
found out last winter
'm not responding to treatment anymore
His face crumples with pain and anguish
Why didn't you tell me
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible
(pause) didn't want anyone being -- weird around me
Including me
() 88
: Especially you
(long beat) God gives me an illness, then you
cruel joke
She gets in the car
Slams her door shut
He stands there, not knowing what to do
-  - Landon pulls up in front of Jamie's house
long quiet ride
'm not letting you die
Jamie just looks at him
Feeling sorry for him -- what he wants doesn't matter
- The Reverend and Landon drink coffee
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now
How -- how long does she have
Two, three months
Maybe less
Maybe more
So you've given up
Reverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice
Her doctors have
Jamie and
We're still praying for a miracle
(disdainful) Praying
Landon
We've lived with this for over a year now and -- () 89
: If there is a God, how could he let this happen
It's a long answer and by the time the Reverend opens his mouth to explain, Landon's out the door
- Moonless dark
Few cars
The   down the road
Landon opens a map over the steering wheel
Turns on the dome light
Looks at the return address on an old letter
() - 3
Landon's Yugo winds through city streets
() - Mansions
Big lawns
The Yugo slows as Landon leans forward to read a street sign
His face is tear-streaked
He flicks his headlights to bright, then low again
The car turns left
'  - Large new colonial
Landon slams his car door and stands in the street
Staring at his father's house
He heads up a flagstone path for the front door

Dr
Carter, putting on his robe, parts the silk drapes in the upstairs hall

' His son standing on the front lawn
Distraught, tearful
Open the door
Please
' Landon backs away from the house
Angrily kicks over a decorative planter
Is halfway to his car when Dr
Carter opens the door and comes out
Landon
Landon doesn't hear
Landon
Landon turns around
Sees his father
Breaks down, sobbing
His father goes to him
Hugs him, a big bear hug
You have to save her
Landon, who
Is your mother all right
Lights pop upstairs
It's Jamie -- my girlfriend -- she has cancer -- you have to come look at her -- right now
(calm, trying to diffuse) It's the middle of the night -- don't give a shit what time it is
Landon pulls away
Angrier
Landon, 'm a cardiologist, not an oncologist -- () 91
: You're a doctor, aren't you
He waves his father off, dismissing him
Landon
'll look into it
But Landon hasn't heard
He's in his car
Dr
Carter watches his son's car move away, regretful
- Landon quietly shuts the back door
Exhausted
Starts making coffee
Cynthia appears
Your father called
No response
Jamie's a patient at his hospital
He's having a colleague look at her chart this morning
Long pause
'm sorry
didn't know
didn't know either
- The Yugo parked in the driveway
The morning paper lying on the grass
Landon paces in front of the front porch
Incapable of ringing the bell, lacking the courage, lacking the right words
Upstairs, the curtains move
' Jamie looks out the window
' Landon pacing, talking to himself
92
She starts to raise the window, to say something, to help him, but then lets the curtain drop
She needs for him to decide, for him to be ready to face this with her
The sound of a
She looks out the window again
' The Yugo driving away

The voice from downstairs

) It's your father
Landon picks up his phone
- The door to Landon's room is ajar
Cynthia waits outside
Listening
Hearing nothing
She pushes the door open
' Landon sitting on his bed
Deflated
He can't do anything
Cynthia is pained to see his suffering
If it's incurable -- told him to leave me alone
Landon -- (re: Jamie) It was the only thing 've ever asked him
93
'  -  ( ) Landon's still in bed
Facing the wall
Cynthia
Enters with a plate of food
brought some dinner
No response
She leaves the tray and goes
-   - Jamie and her father eat dinner
Jamie is red-eyed, heartbroken
(not sure at all) He'll call
wanted to think he'd changed
(angry) No you didn't
(beat) But he did change
Just not enough
Jamie, you're not mad at me
You're mad at Landon -- (furious) am mad at you
And at Landon
And the universe
And God
(quieter) don't even know where to put all my anger
That's normal
God accepts your anger
He won't punish you
By making me ill, he is punishing me
(quieter) just don't know what for
She flees the room
94
- Goes up the stairs
Keeps going
Up another flight to the attic
- Jamie opens a closet door
Pulls out a dress, a scarf, jewelry, a worn book -- her mother's belongings
She opens the book and starts to weep
Missing her mother
Reverend Sullivan stands, looking up at the attic stairs
Frustrated, angry, worried
'  - Landon is still in bed
Cynthia enters
Pulls back the curtains
Yanks up the shades
don't care if you don't leave the house
But you have to get out of bed
- Landon sits at the kitchen table
Cynthia pours him a cup of coffee
You and  may not be communicating very well right now
But let me be clear
Don't make this about you
It's about her
Pause
Her words sink in
have no idea what to say
How to act
What if  do the wrong thing
(gently) Be yourself and  don't think there is a wrong thing
(beat) Let Jamie take the lead
She'll let you know what she needs
95
-   - Before Landon can ring the bell, the front door opens
The Reverend
Landon runs past him into the house
Where's Jamie
At school
Where you should be
Oh
-  - Deserted, classes are meeting
Landon runs, sliding to a stop at one classroom door
Looks in, keeps going, stops at another
Searching
This is '  from the top of the hallway
She stands, holding her books, watching him, unsure
finally feels her gaze, turns to look
turns away, still angry and disappointed
runs to her
Jamie
He catches up to her
face each other
Neither sure what to say
'm so sorry
'm a coward -- () 96
: should have told you sooner -- (guilt-ridden) made you do too many things, kept you up all night -- No
The drugs just stopped working
If anything, doing things  love kept me healthy longer
Pause
Are you frightened
All the time

She means not even God and he gets this
You have me

Help me live until  die

Jamie and Landon sit together in the third row, holding hands
Landon glances at her, realizes she's asleep
Pulls her sweater over her

She looks pale
He catches her eye
They both smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students
97
- Landon drives them home from Jefferson High
No music
They're going to build a tunnel under the English Channel
They're calling it The Chunnel
No response
You hungry
Nope
Anything you want
Nothing
He reaches into a cooler on the floor of the back seat
Slim Jim
Apple
Yogurt
You like yogurt
used to like yogurt
He places a red heart-shaped box in her lap
(apologetic) Not very original
Happy Valentine's Day
He grins
She looks crestfallen, feels terrible
didn't even think about it
He takes a chocolate
Pops it in his mouth
Grins
There
You gave me a chocolate

What are you thinking
(honest) That  want you to take me home
Now
We just -- don't want to come here anymore
She begins taking the telescope apart
Depressed
- Jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a pocket for a key
Unlocks the gate
Swings the gate open
Landon's astonished
You have a key
Yeah
've just never needed it
(pause) Will you talk to my father
've talked to your father
That's what  mean
Their eyes meet
Her look is serious

Cleaning a gutter
Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve
He walks over
The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below long beat, then: () 99
: (calling up) Sir
Being ignored is beginning to feel preferable to being noticed
The Reverend looks down
'll be honest
don't know if can pray, but  can do just about anything else
Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the house and walk over
Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend better
Whatever you need
Whatever Jamie needs
'm here
(beat) could start by driving her to school -- 'm not going back to school
Landon and her father both turn to her
Pale, wane
They understand what she is saying
You can tell anyone you want don't care
She goes into the house
Landon and Reverend Sullivan look at each other, then away, uncomfortable
That didn't sound like her
-  - Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out Jamie's locker
Students stare as he carefully places her things, including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag
They part and hush as he passes by
News travels fast
Clay and Eric step forward

: Hey
Landon
We heard 'bout Jamie Sullivan
She -- (fierce) Say nothing
Nothing 'bout her
(misunderstood, genuine) No
Hey
We're sorry, man

Surprised
Inspects Belinda
Eric
Clay
Others
No one speaks
Too late and not enough
He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the office
'  - Mr
Kelly and Landon
know it means not graduating, but  need to be excused from all school acti-- You're excused
Landon heads for the door
How is she
Landon can't answer
Too emotional
You will graduate

If  have to tutor you myself
Landon nods, accepting, appreciative

Jamie's in bed, wearing the sweater
Yesterday  felt sick, horrible

So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding each other

He frowns, afraid for Jamie's health

Landon picks her up, gently carries her back to bed
Settles her in
How you doing

Landon sits on her bed
Strokes her hair

Landon reaches for her hand
When he looks at her face again, she's asleep

caretaker waits while Landon carries pieces of the older telescope to his car
tall pile of parts is already at his car
Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup
Gravel flying
Eric and Clay spy Landon
Landon freezes, not sure what to expect
The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops
The Eric and Clay jump down
long tense moment, then: Hey
Hey
Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup
Eric follows suit
-   - Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how they fit together
They are like a map for how to build the bigger one
- Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard concrete form-tube from his car
Carries it around the house toward the back yard

'  - Jamie wakes from a nap
She looks thinner, grayer
She hears
She hauls herself up and to a window

Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly
Jamie moves and he starts, fully awake
She opens her eyes
You okay
She nods
Sleepy
Closes her eyes again
He rests his head on her shoulder and weeps
Her eyes open, then close again
There's nothing to say

He hesitates, then pushes the door open

Reverend Sullivan enters
Landon
You go on home

There's only one chair
Landon nods and goes
The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment
When he opens them, she's looking at him
Dad
He kisses her forehead, then sits back
So serious
Jamie, God is not punishing you
No God  know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer
Pause
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more -- was wrong
Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did
Not even God
He lets this sink in
God loaned you to me, entrusted you to my care
'm failing you
She looks away, agreeing without saying so
Jamie
make you the same promise that God does

Pictures from the play

You're with who you should be
It's like she chose you

Hi
He goes to her side
Hey
He kisses her

She reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the attic
She offers it to Landon

: (smiling) Don't worry
It's not a Bible

It's gone now

No

(beat) Maybe  believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends
He kneels on the floor
Puts his head on her pillow next to hers
Maybe  believe God sent you to me because  am ill
To help me through
He touches her face tenderly

Pause
He gets her meaning

Exhausted, despondent

But we need it now

You have two parents
We're both here for you even -- -- even if we're not here for each other anymore

For the book drive

There's nothing more

considers the photo, finds a page to tuck it into
"For Landon" above some underlined text, a Psalm from the Bible
(reading aloud) ' cry to you my Lord, my rock
Do not be deaf to me, for if you are silent,  shall go down to the pit like the rest
Hear my voice raised in petition as  cry to you for help, as  raise my hands, my Lord, toward your holy of holies
' Landon knows Jamie underlined this for him
- Landon tears down the steps
Past his mother to the front door
He's out the door before she even turns around
-  '  - Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed
His feet find slippers on the floor
He looks haggard, his hair thinner, his face defeated
'  - The Reverend, wearing his robe, checks on his sleeping daughter
The night nurse nods as he tucks in blankets
Then another
Reverend Sullivan goes to the window
Parts the drapes
Looks out
dozen flashlights in a big circle
Landon in the middle, working feverishly on the new telescope
- The back porch light comes on
Reverend Sullivan steps out onto the back porch
Landon looks up
() 114
: (flushes, almost manic) have to finish it tonight
Without a word, the Reverend turns around and goes back inside
Leaving the porch light on
Landon goes back to work
- Reverend Sullivan comes out
Dressed
He carries two mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp lantern
Peace offerings
He walks over, sets down the lantern, hands Landon a mug
Ready to work
've almost finished the rocker
Did she order mirrors
In there
As they walk to the garage
You have materials for the side bearings
'm using an old phonographic turntable
For the focuser
chrome-plated brass pipe from a drain line
The Reverend nods, impressed
He yanks the garage door up
Goes in
You know about this stuff
helped Jamie with the first one
() 115
: (surprised) thought she built it herself
She did
But hardly anyone does anything truly alone
The Reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package
Landon takes it as the Reverend lowers the garage door
(serious) need to do this alone
Reverend Sullivan searches Landon's face for a long moment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back door
- '  - Landon stands in the doorway
The Reverend is wiping his glasses, his face, maybe of tears
He sees Landon
You finish
few minutes ago
have to ask you something
Long pause
When  was seventeen,  was sent up for a year for stealing a car
(beat) Sometimes  still feel that boy inside me and  don't like him
(beat) But  like you
The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand
Landon takes it
The two men shake
Allies now
'  - Jamie opens her eyes
But can barely keep them open
Groggy from pain medication
Landon's standing there
Showered, clean clothes
() 116
: We're going out
He starts helping the nurse disconnect her
Can  -- go out
You'll be fine for a few minutes
Jamie looks at the nurse
Uncertain
The nurse nods
- Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window
The finished large telescope is set up
Pointing at the sky
She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket
(grateful, touching it) It's beautiful
Thank you
But she looks at the lights of the house and streets around them
don't know what we'll be able to see
Help me stand
He checks his watch
Wait a sec
As she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every nearby house are switched off
Neighbors step outside
Hold up binoculars
- Members of the Star Club and other students look through traditional telescopes
117
Jamie hugs Landon in gratitude
We have five minutes
Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and she peers into the telescope eyepiece
She pulls back, wipes her eyes, then looks again
She swings the telescope into the correct position
Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's hazy head and long tail
(
) The comet of the century
She steps back so he can see
He looks quickly, then moves aside so she can keep looking
She's completely engrossed
long, quiet moment, then: You love me
She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes
Will you do something for me
Landon
can't even do for myself
But if you could, you would
Yes
His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear, sadness, and love
Will you marry me
Illness, happiness, disbelief
118
- sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms
Dogwoods, wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming
Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda; teachers, including Ms
Garber; Mr
Kelly; Luis and Isabel and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation; Cynthia Carter; Dr
Carter's new wife and their two kids; neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses
Landon stands with his father by the altar
The " " begins
The double doors at the back of the church open
Everyone turns to look at the bride
Gasps of joy and sadness
'  - Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan
She's wearing her Lizzie dress from the play
It hangs loosely, but still becomes her
She's a beautiful bride
Landon swells with pride
Jamie smiles
Then, leaning on her father, she slowly makes her way down the aisle
In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her
Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath moment later, she and her father continue
long, difficult walk
walk to remember
The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father near
Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side
Jamie sits
Exhausted
() 119
: Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair
Pause
Dr
Carter kneels
Showing solidarity with his son
Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's cheek
Trying to keep his emotions in check
' Reverend Sullivan towering over them
Reverend Sullivan kneels, too
Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's hand in her left
Linking the three together
The congregation silences
Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible
Struggling
As a father, 'm supposed to give away my daughter
But  can no more give Jamie away than  can give away my heart
But  can let another share in the joy she has given me
May God's blessings be with you both
He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon
Completing the circle
Landon, repeat after me
Do you take
As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the the faces of those at the altar -- Jamie, Landon, Dr
Carter
the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter, Josh, Eric, Clay
Then  row by row as the Reverend begins reading a passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her
His voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own work
() 120
: (
) 'Love is always patient and kind
It is never jealous
Love is never boastful or conceited
It is never rude or selfish
It does not take offense and is not resentful
Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins, but delights in the truth
It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes
' And the    the double doors to find
in a different season
Winter
the front steps and
( ) As it is now, in present day
The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting
Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The Rainmaker
The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in
Reverend Sullivan
He's stooped, thin, balding
His skin parchment thin
The two men embrace
Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain
You've been well
Yes
You
Getting by
Pause
Why is he here
The Reverend waits
(fumbling) 'm -- 'm returning something
He twists the ring on his finger
Removes it
() 121
: This belongs to you
He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend
Pause
Landon searches for something meaningful to say
She taught me -- everything
She saved my life
The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness
Realizing now why Landon has come
You're marrying again
Yes
Jamie wanted that
She told me
Landon is grateful to know this
He makes a move to go
Then turns back
'm sorry she never got her miracle
She did
It was you
Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again
Warmly, fully
Two men still grieving, saying good-bye
(
) Jamie once said when you're feeling love, you're also feeling God
- Landon walks alone
His hair and clothing tousled by a steady gentle wind
(
) She made me a believer
In love
In life
In the journey that never ends
Landon stops
Faces the wind
Lets the air swirl over him
() 122
: (
) And in the mystery of all things you can't see but feel everywhere around you
He closes his eyes
She's there
